1
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,683
Next, please.

2
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:18,643
Come on, come on.

3
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,270
Next.

4
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:21,771
Name.

5
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,648
Gus Gorman.

6
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,783
Ah, yes. August Gorman.

7
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,244
Have you looked for work this week?

8
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,164
- Yes.
- What kind?

9
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:44,294
- Kitchen technician.
- Dishwasher. Any luck?

10
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,212
No, but...

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,091
Mr. Gorman, according to our records,
you've been unemployed for 36 weeks.

12
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,426
No, it's 35.

13
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,470
Not counting this week.

14
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:58,099
You secured employment in June as
a messenger and were discharged after...

15
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,061
- one day for losing...
- No, they said I lost it.

16
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,314
I did not lose it!
It was stolen by a pickpocket.

17
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:05,940
A television set?

18
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:09,819
It was a teeny-tiny, teeny-weensy
Japanese television set.

19
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:14,949
The other employment you found
was in a fast-food joint, which lasted...

20
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,493
28 minutes?

21
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,329
That's some kind of record.
Talk about fast.

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,084
Those people are crazy. They expect
you to learn that stuff in one day.

23
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,254
"Hold the lettuce. Hold the ketchup.
Can I have some sauce, please?"

24
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:31,007
- Mr. Gorman...
- "Two buns. No buns. Some cheese".

25
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:34,719
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis
is generous to a fault, but...

26
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,096
I'm not the fault!

27
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,181
Thirty-six weeks
of chronic unemployment.

28
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:41,518
Thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes
of hard-working citizens.

29
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,979
- Do you know what you are?
- Don't call me a bum, I'm not a bum!

30
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,819
You are, I was about to say,
no longer eligible.

31
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,862
- Well, look...
- Next.

32
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,156
Wait. What about this week?
I need this week!

33
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,616
Next.

34
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:58,535
You mean, that's it?

35
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,745
"Finished," like "over"?

36
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,750
Next.

37
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:08,253
"Next" as in "bye".

38
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,255
Next!

39
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,342
Name.

40
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,054
Excuse me, brother,
can I have a light?

41
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,920
- How you doing, Alex?
- Hi, Jimmy.

42
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:49,914
Excuse me.

43
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,616
Say thank you.

44
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,368
Wow!

45
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,970
Way to go, Superman!

46
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,882
Your drink is on its way.

47
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,551
Sir.

48
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,303
Excuse me...

49
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:57,018
but what if you wanna program two
bilateral coordinates at the same time?

50
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,228
You can't do that. It's impossible.

51
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,147
- But if you can't...
- Oh, no.

52
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:05,401
Computer technology is very advanced,
young lady, but it can't do that.

53
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,571
But if you think we can't
do it that way, what happens?

54
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,364
Sir.

55
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,913
Good Lord.

56
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,915
How did you do that?

57
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,710
I don't know. I just did it.

58
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,232
- Who's this?
- That's him, Ross Webster.

59
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,443
Just after he received the award for
Humanitarian of the Year.

60
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,362
He is good-looking.

61
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,447
Because I gave him F2 at a 50th.

62
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,449
One thing I don't understand...

63
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,954
the point of the story Lois wrote
is how Ross got this great honor...

64
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,791
and you bring me one picture of him
and 15 pictures of this other person.

65
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,627
- Who is she?
- Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's...

66
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:07,463
She's just Webster's.
Let's leave it at that.

67
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,299
- Who's this other woman?
- His sister, Vera Webster.

68
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,801
- Picture looks fuzzy.
- What?

69
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:15,763
The picture's fine, chief.
She looks like that in real life.

70
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:20,184
- She's VP of Webscoe Industries.
- I really don't understand you.

71
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,688
A boring banquet and you bring me
3000 boring pictures.

72
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,649
Yet Superman saves a man
from drowning on Third Avenue...

73
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:30,236
while you just stand there and
you don't bring me one picture!

74
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,238
Chief, I didn't have
my camera with me.

75
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:36,826
A photographer eats with his camera.
A photographer sleeps with his camera.

76
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,453
- I'm glad I'm a writer.
- Mr. White, please.

77
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,832
It's time for you to draw this month's
winning JINGO number.

78
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,585
Prize is an all-expenses trip
to South America.

79
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,588
- I don't know why the idiot in Circulation...
- Good morning.

80
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,798
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy.

81
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:52,758
You've got mustard on your lapel.

82
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,969
Excuse me, Mr. White,
I hate to interrupt...

83
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,430
Sorry. I'm busy.
I got a paper to get out here.

84
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,682
It'll never replace the printing press.

85
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,852
- What's the number, Mr. White?
- Fifty-three.

86
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,023
- Mr. White...
- Fifty-three!

87
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,693
- Mr. White...
- You've got to pull three more numbers.

88
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,654
I promised I'd call them back today.
What do you think?

89
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,867
- Well, I don't know, Kent...
- I think it'd make a terrific story.

90
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,703
What's a terrific story?

91
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,247
Kent's been invited
to his high-school reunion.

92
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,207
- Say.
- Yeah.

93
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,209
Could we have the next number?

94
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,879
It's practically an
American institution. Isn't it?

95
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:34,008
I don't know, Mr. Kent. Most of
the people I know are still in high school.

96
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,638
Thirty-three.

97
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,557
What I thought this story
would be about, Mr. White, is...

98
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,392
Thirty-three.

99
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:47,396
Is how much the typical small town
has changed in the last 15 years.

100
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,773
Take me, for example:

101
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,652
Can I really go back to middle America
now as a Metropolis sophisticate?

102
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,821
I'm really excited about this.
In fact, I was looking around...

103
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,491
in my closet last night...

104
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,536
and I even found
my old high-school sweater.

105
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,916
- Smallville.
- Mr. White.

106
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,585
Can I go ahead
and make my travel plan?

107
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,295
Same question about mine.

108
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,925
Tell your people the prodigal son
and his photographer are coming home.

109
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,927
Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. White.

110
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:23,099
It isn't easy for me to lose
one of my best reporters.

111
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,685
- That's okay.
- You deserve the vacation, Lois.

112
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,103
Thank you.

113
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,232
Lois, are you going some place?

114
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:36,112
Clark, you know some people
get to go all the way to Smallville...

115
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,074
and then there are others of us
who have to go to Bermuda.

116
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:41,909
Golly.

117
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,452
- Bye.
- Bye, Miss Lane.

118
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:48,958
- Have fun.
- Mr. White, the next number, please.

119
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:52,128
Well, I guess I better be going too.

120
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,756
So I'll be going.

121
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,219
Bye.

122
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,807
Couldn't we get a computer to do this?

123
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,875
- Hey, what is this?
- First paycheck.

124
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:35,504
This is the first rip-off, man! We're
supposed to get 225 a week, right?

125
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,966
This says, "$143.80".
How am I supposed to live on that?

126
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,470
State tax, federal tax,
social security tax...

127
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,306
It's so you're still getting
some money when you hit 65.

128
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,683
So I'm getting money when I? 65?

129
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,185
I want mine now!

130
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,898
I want to enjoy it while I'm young.
I wanna get up and get down. Boogie.

131
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,196
Actually, it's probably more like
$143.80 and one half cent.

132
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:04,700
There are always fractions left over,
but big corporations round it down.

133
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,703
What do I do with half a cent?
Buy a thoroughbred mouse?

134
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,705
Everybody loses those fractions?

135
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,708
They don't lose them.
You can't lose what you never got.

136
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,127
Then what happens?
The company gets them?

137
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:19,965
They can't be bothered collecting that
from your paycheck any more than you.

138
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,550
Then what happens to them?

139
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:26,305
Well, they're just floating around
out there. The computers know where.

140
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,015
How many sugars?

141
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,059
One and a half.

142
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,193
It's quitting time, Gus. You coming?

143
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:44,031
Yeah. No, actually, I got some
stuff to finish up, so...

144
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:49,078
Working overtime, huh? What are you
doing, buddy? Looking for a raise?

145
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,248
Yeah, looking for a raise.

146
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,786
You bet.

147
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,629
But my Uncle Al on my father's
side, he won't eat her stuffing.

148
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:45,467
He says it should be cooked on the outside.
She cooks it on the inside.

149
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,804
My mother told my Aunt Helen.
She's my father's half sister.

150
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,140
- I told you that, right?
- Yeah.

151
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,017
- And anyway, the family...
- Hey, hey.

152
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,311
- Look at that.
- Wow.

153
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:10,492
Okay, your choice. You can
turn back or pull over till it's over.

154
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,245
- How long will it take?
- Can't tell with these fires.

155
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,498
I mean, that fire...
That's spreading like wildfire.

156
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,167
It's just a building burning.

157
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,669
It's not just a building.
That's a chemical plant.

158
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,465
You know what I mean.
It's like... It's like chemicals.

159
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:29,303
If any of that stuff goes up in smoke,
we're in for a hairy time around here.

160
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,306
- Clark.
- Yeah?

161
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,683
I want you to keep
these people distracted.

162
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,018
What are you doing?

163
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,313
What am I doing?
Remember what the chief said?

164
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,690
A photographer always
goes after a story.

165
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,442
That could be dangerous, Jimmy.

166
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:47,696
Danger goes with the territory,
Mr. Kent.

167
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:27,486
Help me!

168
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,742
- How can I help?
- Get this man a helmet.

169
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,120
- It's you. Forget the helmet.
- How bad is it?

170
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,708
My God, it's a nightmare. Everything's
either explosive or flammable or worse.

171
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,338
Get the ladder truck in here.

172
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,383
- It won't reach.
- My God, they're trapped!

173
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,928
What's he gonna do?
Fly them down one at a time?

174
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,282
Let's go! Everybody,
down there! Move it!

175
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,117
Come on! Hurry up!

176
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,410
There you go.

177
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,166
Right down there. Take it easy.

178
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,253
All right. Everybody down there!

179
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,631
Keep moving!

180
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,000
Sir, get out. I'll show you
the quickest way.

181
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,336
Go on. Look after the others.
I can't leave.

182
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,755
- Why not?
- I gotta stay and look after those.

183
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,507
That's concentrated Beltric acid.

184
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:14,802
If that stuff heats up over 180 degrees,
we've got a crisis...

185
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,346
that'll make this fire
look like a picnic.

186
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,597
What does it do?

187
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,642
As long as it remains stable,
it's just ordinary acid.

188
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,312
But if it begins to heat up,
it'll turn volatile.

189
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,732
You'll get a great cloud of smoke
that will eat through anything.

190
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,527
Steel, concrete, anything.

191
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,164
Who the hell is that?

192
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:49,169
- Hey, you! Get off of there!
- I'm just gonna get a couple more shots.

193
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:08,772
Tell them to bring their hoses
back here! Quickly!

194
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,860
Help!

195
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,196
Help! Help me!

196
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,535
Help! Somebody help me!

197
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,079
- Help!
- It's all right.

198
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,915
- Superman! My leg.
- I got you. Take it easy.

199
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,876
All right. We'll go nice and easy.

200
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,880
Okay, I'm sorry.
All right? Here we go.

201
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,927
Medics! Over here, please.

202
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,722
That's it. Here you go.

203
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,432
Go easy. It's the left leg.

204
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,268
- My camera.
- Yeah.

205
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,813
It's a clean break right across the fibula.

206
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,901
- My camera.
- Sorry, Jimmy. You'll be okay.

207
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:59,823
Get that fire out, otherwise there'll be an
acid cloud all over the Eastern seaboard.

208
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,455
- The pump house is gone!
- What?

209
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,124
- The pump house!
- We've lost the water pressure!

210
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,628
- We've got to have water!
- How?

211
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,797
Lake Comooga's five miles from here.
We'd need a five-mile hose!

212
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,966
- Where's this lake?
- That way.

213
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:27,768
Tell them it's hopeless.

214
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,354
You told me we had
an adequate water supply.

215
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,541
Water!

216
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,725
I tell you, that man's a miracle!

217
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,086
Carol, you got gorgeous!

218
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,224
Look at you.

219
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,736
That was against Mid-City.
I'll never forget it.

220
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,906
Fourth quarter, score was tied...

221
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,784
we're back at the 25-yard line.

222
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:52,287
Coach sends in a play,
Right Flanker Option.

223
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,424
You really have grown, Clark.

224
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,468
You look very well, Miss Bannister.

225
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:11,431
I can't complain. I take the stairs
a little slow and I have these spells.

226
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,142
But really, I can't complain.

227
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,103
Lana?

228
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,313
Clark?

229
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,489
Would you excuse me? There's someone
I'd really like to say hello to.

230
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,077
Lana?

231
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,623
- Lana Lang? It's great to see you.
- Clark.

232
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:41,336
- You look wonderful.
- Me? No, you look...

233
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:44,548
- Let me give you a hand with that.
- No, no. I can manage.

234
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:51,304
This is the first time you've come back
since your mom passed away.

235
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,348
Yeah. I'm sorry.

236
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,519
I heard that you and...

237
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,814
- Donald split up.
- Did you eat yet?

238
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,065
No.

239
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,068
Beg your pardon. Excuse me. Sorry.

240
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,699
- That's not right.
- No?

241
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,368
You're right about Donald and me,
but... Hold this, okay?

242
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:14,953
Oh, sure.

243
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,874
Hi, Kent.

244
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,501
Hi. How you doing?

245
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,005
I'm sorry. I'm going nuts. Thanks.

246
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,844
- Clark.
- Yeah.

247
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,221
Lana.

248
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,392
Hey, sweet.

249
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:38,894
Here I am.

250
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:44,232
Remember when you were prom queen?
All these guys were waiting for a dance?

251
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,068
There's only one guy on your
dance card now. Huh, honey?

252
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,112
- That's good old...
- Brad Wilson.

253
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:52,157
- Hi, Brad.
- Hi, Kent.

254
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:54,242
Long time no see.

255
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,328
You know, see, see, see?

256
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,539
- Come on, Lana.
- No, I can't.

257
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,875
- Clark already asked me.
- I did?

258
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,877
- Yeah.
- Oh, excuse me.

259
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,880
Lana, I haven't danced...

260
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:54,469
Ah, Gorman.
Another week, another check.

261
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,309
Don't you have another one for me?
I put in a voucher for expenses.

262
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,811
What?

263
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,190
Yeah, yeah.

264
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,692
Here you go.

265
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,091
Thanks for helping me out.

266
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,011
You kidding? A lot of guys
would like to be where I am.

267
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,638
You'd be surprised at how many
offers I didn't get.

268
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,515
Even Brad wouldn't stick around.

269
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,183
It really isn't easy.

270
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,352
The streamers?
Yeah, you just pull, and...

271
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,022
No, not the streamers. Everything.

272
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,524
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just that...

273
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,694
I don't know why,
I just feel like I can talk to you.

274
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:53,987
What?

275
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,489
I feel like I can talk to you!

276
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,034
- You can?
- Yes.

277
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,202
- You know something, Lana?
- What?

278
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,539
I always...

279
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,042
I always wished that you would.

280
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,210
I mean, even back in high school.

281
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:12,047
- Remember when you were?
- Queen of the prom.

282
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,675
Then three years after the royal wedding,
the king abdicated.

283
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:18,053
- Isn't that terrible?
- Yeah, sure is.

284
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,057
There must be a gallon
of potato salad left over.

285
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:24,559
You know what the problem is?

286
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,562
I don't know, too much mayonnaise?

287
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:30,523
Donald loved mayonnaise.
Why would that be the problem?

288
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,568
No, the problem is,
why do I stay in Smallville?

289
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:35,528
Believe me, I've asked myself that.

290
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,241
Do you know how lucky you are
to live in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.

291
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,660
Well, Lana, you could...

292
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,579
Easy to say. But how?
What about Ricky?

293
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,165
- Ricky?
- My little boy.

294
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,709
- You? Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

295
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,422
I mean, at least here we have a house
and I've got a job that pays the bills.

296
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,093
Except for last winter when
the fuel bills kept going up and up.

297
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:01,596
Yeah. Even had to pawn
my diamond ring then.

298
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,223
That's a shame.

299
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,607
You never got married?

300
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:16,319
- Me?
- Yeah.

301
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:18,279
Well, I was...

302
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,282
No. Not...

303
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,336
You know, years later you can
look at someone and think...

304
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:36,339
"Well, I guess that's
the one that got away".

305
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,806
Give me that again, old buddy.
Run it by me just one more time.

306
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,475
- Eighty-five thousand dollars.
- Missing?

307
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:51,229
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.
Stolen from the firm.

308
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,647
By whom?

309
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:55,358
That's what I want to know.
By whom? Whom?

310
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,152
Vera, get a hold of yourself.

311
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,446
Nobody else ever will.

312
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,322
I don't know.

313
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,490
Whom?

314
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,826
In the old days it was simple.

315
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:09,372
We kept books, we knew what was
going in and what was paid out.

316
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,249
If somebody wanted to rob you...

317
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,960
they'd come in with a gun and say,
"Stick them up".

318
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,297
Now they get blasted computers
to do their dirty work.

319
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:20,759
My old friend, you are yesterday.

320
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,845
Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.

321
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,141
Mr. Webster,
it's time for your massage.

322
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,185
Does this woman
have the right to burst in?

323
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,980
Now, now, Vera. Simpson,
you know my psychic nutritionist?

324
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,318
- Hello.
- We are trying to hold a meeting here.

325
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:42,530
Why don't you hold your breath instead.
Maybe you'll turn blue.

326
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:46,034
- Improvement.
- I'm about to take a human life.

327
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:49,412
Simpson, would you excuse us
for a second, please?

328
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,044
- Mouths closed. Ears open.
- She's a big pig.

329
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:59,339
I can't have anyone with me
who isn't with me.

330
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,049
Now, girls.

331
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,009
Simpson.

332
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:04,719
Well, old chum. What now?

333
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,680
Kiss the 85 thou goodbye?

334
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,684
Keep on paying the thief his salary
until he shakes the money tree again?

335
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,979
- He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
- Why?

336
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,524
That's what they always say
in the movies.

337
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,235
He won't slip up at all. No, not at all.

338
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,071
He'll keep quietly taking
the bread from our mouths.

339
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:27,492
He'll keep a low profile and won't
do a thing to call attention to himself.

340
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:32,080
Unless, of course, he is
a complete and utter moron.

341
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,474
I'll go first. Andrew.

342
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:55,103
- I'll pick Chris.
- You feel good? You feel ready?

343
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,604
LANA
Ricky, your shoe.

344
00:30:56,772 --> 00:31:00,108
- You mean, we've gotta take Ricky?
- You guys lost the toss.

345
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,443
All right, come on, Ricky.

346
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,612
- Wait, wait...
- Come on, good luck.

347
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,575
- I just can't stand this.
- Oh, Lana. It'll be okay.

348
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:11,077
I know, I was a late bloomer myself.

349
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:15,957
It's not just that he's small, he's
the only kid in town without a father.

350
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:20,712
Oh, look. He's stewed to the gills
in the middle of the afternoon.

351
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,089
- Gee, all he had was chocolate milk.
- No, him.

352
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,757
Hey, sweet thing.

353
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,135
Little kid getting hassled, huh?

354
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,305
- Kent, you still here?
- I seem to be, Brad.

355
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:33,224
All he needs is a few pointers
from the old champ here.

356
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:36,269
I won the all-country bowling
trophy two years in a row.

357
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:37,478
I didn't know that.

358
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,606
Yeah. Natural athlete
can play any sport.

359
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,566
Brad, you're just gonna
make it worse.

360
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:44,235
- It's all right. It'll be okay.
- He'll make it worse.

361
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,577
You watch, he'll get a spare.

362
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,287
Come on, Ricky.

363
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,540
Hey, kid, you're holding it all wrong.

364
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,419
- Let old Brad show you how it's done.
- Brad.

365
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:06,341
Excuse me. Say, Brad, I think maybe
he'll be better off doing it his way.

366
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:10,136
For a guy lucky to be water boy,
you've got a big mouth.

367
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:13,598
I don't think he needs a lesson
in front of the other kids.

368
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:17,685
- He needs a man to show him.
- He's doing just fine. Excuse me.

369
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:20,855
Here you go, Ricky.

370
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:24,067
And give it your best shot.
Okay? There you go.

371
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:27,695
Sorry.

372
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,370
Ah-choo!

373
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,213
Gesundheit.

374
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:46,547
Thank you.

375
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,844
Hey, Gus, the boss wants to see you.

376
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,597
He can see me all right.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

377
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:58,226
No, not that boss. The boss.

378
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:00,895
- You mean, the boss...
- Yup.

379
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,563
- Wants to see me?
- Yup.

380
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,900
Oh, my God,
why would he wanna see me?

381
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,235
I mean...

382
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,905
Why would the boss wanna see me?

383
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,825
There's no reason.

384
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,619
Then why'd he? Oh, I know!

385
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,914
It's my suggestion
for the volleyball uniforms.

386
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:21,332
That's it.

387
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,140
Ross the boss.
Ross the boss. The boss!

388
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,143
Be calm. Be cool. Be collected.

389
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:47,859
Mr. Webster? Mr. Webster?

390
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:51,696
Mr. Webster, I did not... Mr. Webster.

391
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:54,115
Mr. August Gorman?

392
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,533
August Gorman here.

393
00:33:55,743 --> 00:34:00,288
I know you're a man of compassion,
and I don't wanna go to jail...

394
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,457
because they have robbers
and rapists...

395
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,043
I just wanna ask you one question.

396
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:07,962
You've been a naughty guy,
haven't you?

397
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,630
Come on, admit it now.

398
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,300
You've been just a little bit naughty,
haven't you?

399
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,303
- I was kind of...
- That's all right. I understand.

400
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:18,681
I can... What do
the young folks say today?

401
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,559
"Dig where you're
coming from, brother".

402
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,604
- You wanna be rich, right?
- How, what?

403
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:28,316
I was born rich. Never worn
the same pair of socks twice.

404
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:29,984
What do you do with your socks?

405
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:34,113
I don't know. They're laundered and sent
to some charitable institution, I think.

406
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,492
Actually, I don't know.
Maybe they turn them into dust rags...

407
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,160
or pen-wipers or something.

408
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:40,995
Or maybe socks.

409
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:43,956
Yes! That never occurred to me.

410
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,960
Gus, you know something?
You're a genius.

411
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:51,839
A naughty genius, but what the hell?
Nobody's perfect, right? Cheers.

412
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:55,009
Because of the half-cent thing
with the computers.

413
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,179
No, no, because computers
rule the world today.

414
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:02,016
The fellow that can fool the computers
can rule the world himself.

415
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:06,521
I've been searching for somebody
who can make these machines...

416
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,023
do what they're not supposed to.
Get my drift?

417
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,150
- Yes!
- Gus...

418
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:16,114
Webscoe, the Webscoe industrial
complex, is a family-owned cartel.

419
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,199
Some magnesium here,
some zinc there.

420
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,368
Railroads, farm machinery.
You follow me?

421
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:22,036
I follow you, sir.

422
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:24,372
- Gus, do you know what I want now?
- No.

423
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,623
I want coffee.

424
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,542
All right. Black, cream, sugar, or?

425
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,794
No, you don't seem to understand.

426
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,381
Under different company names,
I control the price of coffee beans...

427
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:37,760
in Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia,
Jamaica and the Republic of Gabon.

428
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,722
But I've got a problem and I think
maybe you can help me.

429
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,893
One country won't play ball with me.
You know how that can bug a guy, right?

430
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,396
That could bug... What country?

431
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,024
- Colombia.
- Colombia?

432
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,194
Colombia has two important exports,
and one of them's coffee.

433
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:59,031
And I've tried to reason with them.
Believe me, I've tried.

434
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,368
But this one miserable,
pissant little country...

435
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:07,915
has the gall to think it can dictate
the economy of an open market. Gus.

436
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,751
Gus, my friend...

437
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:14,380
we're going to teach them
a lesson, aren't we?

438
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:18,259
Destroy the entire
Colombian coffee crop...

439
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,928
right down to the last bean.

440
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,389
- The last bean, we are.
- Right.

441
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,934
But you got so much. You know, like...

442
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,812
A wise man once said,
I think it was Attila the Hun...

443
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,607
"It is not enough that I succeed.

444
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,776
Everyone else must fail".

445
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,528
Seems fair.

446
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,280
- Gus.
- What?

447
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:43,117
You are going to do this for me.

448
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,914
- How?
- The weather.

449
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,291
You didn't say your mother was here.

450
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,461
I'm his sister. His baby sister.

451
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:56,631
Gus, tell me, have you ever
heard of Vulcan?

452
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,299
Hi, Ms. Vulcan.

453
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:01,260
Vulcan is the weather satellite
our government put up...

454
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,803
to monitor the weather.

455
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:07,266
But if somebody were to reprogram it,
it could do much more.

456
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,101
It could make weather.

457
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,811
Storms and floods.

458
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,772
Blizzards, heat waves.

459
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,148
How do you do that?

460
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,818
Like everything else
in the 20th century, Gus.

461
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,487
You push buttons.

462
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:24,367
- There you go.
- It's the first time I won anything.

463
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,826
You won my hand, Maury.

464
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,829
But this is the first time
I won anything valuable.

465
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,665
Let's get one with the sombreros.

466
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:34,168
Mr. White, you'll be in this,
handing them their plane tickets.

467
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:36,837
- Why do I have to do this?
- Why do I have to do this?

468
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,341
You're lucky I didn't fire you.
I get a chance at exclusive photos...

469
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:42,343
of history's biggest factory fire.

470
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:45,346
He comes home with a broken leg
and 12 melted rolls of film.

471
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:46,847
It was hot.

472
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,183
Smile, Mr. White.

473
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,770
South America!
I can't believe my luck!

474
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:56,190
See, if you don't want them
to trace it back...

475
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,527
you've gotta punch in
to some little rinky-dink outfit...

476
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:02,154
that has a little
Mickey Mouse computer...

477
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,324
Some place you can sneak into, right?

478
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:06,701
Somebody could...

479
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,913
Some place where nobody knows him
so they can't connect him with us.

480
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,040
Webscoe has 112 subsidiaries.

481
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,210
They're all linked into
the central computer system.

482
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,045
How about some place...

483
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,047
small?

484
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:26,721
Smallville. This is Smallville.
We'll have a five-minute stop here.

485
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:28,723
Mind your step.

486
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,725
Watch your step, please.

487
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:32,518
Thanks, Selma.

488
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,062
Thanks a lot, Lana.
Have a good day, now.

489
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,901
Let me help you, Lana.

490
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:44,447
I'm sorry.

491
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,535
- Thanks, Clark.
- Sit down, Buster. Good boy.

492
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:52,246
Come on, Buster, sit down.
That's a good boy.

493
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,332
Okay. You all set? Great.

494
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,837
Wow.

495
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,096
I'm not saying another word.

496
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:12,600
That's it. Okay?

497
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,437
Jesus Christ!

498
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,111
Don't they have picnics in Metropolis,
Mr. Kent?

499
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,280
Well, not quite like this, Ricky.

500
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,449
- Mom and I do this all the time.
- You do?

501
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,619
- I'll help you.
- Stay close by and be careful, okay?

502
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,120
Okay, Mom.

503
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,707
Come on, Buster. Let's find you
a rabbit. Come on. Rabbit.

504
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,793
- This is so nice for him.
- Here you go.

505
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:42,421
It's even nicer when there's a man around,
which isn't that often.

506
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:45,132
- There's a lot of choices.
- The good ones are married.

507
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,635
That's why Brad thinks
he's God's gift to women.

508
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,305
He won't take no for an answer,
but he's the only one asking.

509
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:54,141
No, Lana, I meant
there's a lot of choices here.

510
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,936
This is really quite some picnic.
There's...

511
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,021
some of that.

512
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,732
Green stuff.

513
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:04,819
Hey, pâté.

514
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,615
Boy, this pâté is really unusual.

515
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,451
I didn't make any... Oh, Clark.

516
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,912
That's Buster's dog food.

517
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,331
- It's good.
- Don't eat it!

518
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:18,833
What time's the dog eat?

519
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,960
- This is nice.
- Here.

520
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,670
It's all right, Lana.

521
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:25,506
Thanks.

522
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,176
Hey, where you going? Come on!

523
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,303
Buster, stop messing about!

524
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,517
- How much longer?
- I was just thinking...

525
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:39,186
- I'm sorry. No, go ahead.
- No. You.

526
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,024
Well...

527
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,528
I was just thinking that...

528
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:50,698
somebody like you
could do really well in Metropolis.

529
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,578
I suppose I have to face it. I'm not gonna
find what I want in Smallville anymore.

530
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:01,876
Could I make it in Metropolis?
What would I do when I got there?

531
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,379
Call me.

532
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:08,549
- No, I wouldn't wanna call you.
- You don't wanna call me?

533
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:13,095
Yes, I wanna call you, but I wouldn't
wanna be a nuisance to you.

534
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:16,223
I don't think you could ever
be a nuisance to me, Lana.

535
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,227
Clark, may I tell you something?

536
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,733
My oil pan is leaking.

537
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,407
See? There's something dripping.

538
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,242
- Can I give you a hand?
- No, thanks.

539
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,246
With all the car trouble I have,
I studied up on auto repair.

540
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,332
Look at this.

541
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,834
Oh, boy.

542
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:13,697
Lana, I think I'll just go see
if Ricky's all right. You okay?

543
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,157
Yeah.

544
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:04,331
Gosh, is he all right?

545
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:14,008
Hi.

546
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,178
Superman?

547
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:19,722
That's me.

548
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,476
Mom! Mom!

549
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:30,316
There you go. He's all right,
but have a doctor check him.

550
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,192
Thank you.

551
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,862
- I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
- Nice to meet you.

552
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,196
And this is Clark.

553
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:39,325
I really have to be going.
So long, Ricky. Bye.

554
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:43,162
We were flying, Mom!

555
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,788
What were you doing, anyway?

556
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:46,373
I was looking for Buster.

557
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,376
- Buster! Buster!
- I found him!

558
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:52,046
Come on, boy. That's it.

559
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:54,882
Mr. Kent, Superman was here!

560
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,259
- What?
- Yes, he really was.

561
00:43:58,178 --> 00:43:59,720
Aren't you excited?

562
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:02,973
I'm from Metropolis.
I see Superman every day.

563
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:06,185
You do? Could you get me
his autograph?

564
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:12,650
I don't know. If I had a nickel
for every time some little kid...

565
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:37,007
Yeah? What do you want?

566
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:38,926
We're in big trouble, aren't we?

567
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:40,928
- What?
- We're in big trouble.

568
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:42,680
First, they lost the invoice.

569
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:46,517
When they found it, they realized
they came up short on a few items.

570
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:50,938
- So I rented a car because I missed the plane from Cleveland.
-00, you know.

571
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,608
And a flat tire on the highway.
What a kicker.

572
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:57,945
Had to fix it myself
with these little pinkies.

573
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:02,741
And I figured your boss was gonna be
real peeved, you know what I mean?

574
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:04,118
What do you mean?

575
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,954
He is going to hang our butts
against the wall.

576
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,082
He wanted this special order installed...

577
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,876
in his office no later
than tomorrow morning.

578
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,295
Let me in because
I gotta set it up tonight.

579
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:16,797
Get all what set up?

580
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,644
Pal, you are a real lifesaver.
I mean, a real lifesaver.

581
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:32,980
- Which way's the office?
- Straight on ahead.

582
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,899
- Follow me.
- I'm right behind you.

583
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,443
Oh, yeah.

584
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,112
Not bad. It's pretty good.

585
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,407
You know what's wrong with
this Singapore wing?

586
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:47,327
Sling! Singapore Sling.

587
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,830
What's wrong with it?

588
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:51,874
There's not enough vodka in it.

589
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,668
There's no vodka in it!

590
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,463
What did I tell you?
Put some vodka in it.

591
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:00,466
What did you? You know.

592
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,433
- Yeah.
- There's vodka in it now, buddy.

593
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:14,688
Yeah, perfect.

594
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:18,025
- You never do pass out, do you?
- Nope.

595
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:23,614
Never.

596
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,658
Job well done, buddy.

597
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:29,411
You thought I was drunk too,
didn't you? Ha, ha.

598
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,038
Fooled you.

599
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,791
Get the keys, get the keys.

600
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,812
Somebody's drunk.

601
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:00,234
Hello, baby!

602
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,569
How's the little baby?

603
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,154
Okay.

604
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:08,450
All right, let's get down to it.
Let's do it.

605
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:13,247
One, two, button your shoe.

606
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:33,684
"Both keys at the same time"?

607
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:49,700
Wait. Wait a minute.

608
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:51,702
Think you've won, don't you?

609
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,289
The Philly Flash!

610
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:48,175
Okay, ready?

611
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:51,970
One, two, three!

612
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:06,652
Yeah. Now we'll see what we'll see.

613
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:27,667
Come on, please.

614
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:31,797
There it is!

615
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:33,507
Hello! Now...

616
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:35,342
getting down to business.

617
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:40,347
I am a genius.

618
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,517
I am a...

619
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:54,152
Longitude...

620
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:57,155
and the other thing. Latitude, right?

621
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:16,883
Oh, look, Maury. A native wedding.

622
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:45,078
No one said at the Daily Planet
that this was the rainy season!

623
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,119
Meteorologists are baffled
by the tornado and rainstorms...

624
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:29,122
that struck the country
of Colombia this afternoon...

625
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:33,793
threatening to destroy the nation's
entire coffee crop for the next five years.

626
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:35,629
Gale-force winds up to...

627
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,965
an incredible 250 miles an hour
lashed the countryside...

628
00:53:39,467 --> 00:53:43,887
while 12 inches of rainfall have
already been recorded in just one day.

629
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:48,808
A spokesman for the Department of
Meteorology said this was, I quote...

630
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:52,729
"The most awesome display of
natural forces since Noah's ark".

631
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:55,774
If I laugh any harder, I'll split my sides!

632
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:59,069
To defy all laws of
weather systems known to science.

633
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,323
What a shame.

634
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,827
Poor little Colombia. Well...

635
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,508
I'm gonna get you for that,
you big silly!

636
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:24,636
Bubba, do you realize what we're on to?

637
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,388
Do I?

638
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:29,683
Every time a drunk sobers up,
he'll drink Webster coffee.

639
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:31,893
Why stop at coffee?

640
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:36,022
A cup of coffee gets the world
off to work in the morning.

641
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,316
But what keeps the world working?

642
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,193
Diet soda?

643
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,530
Vera, you mean? You mean?

644
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:46,157
Today, coffee.

645
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:48,868
Tomorrow, the oil!

646
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,538
- Oil?
- If Gus can push the right buttons...

647
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:54,457
I can have it all. Holy cats!

648
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,209
All the oil.

649
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,669
All the pumps.

650
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,296
All the tankers.

651
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,047
This is some nifty idea, Vera.

652
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,882
- Boss?
- Very nifty.

653
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:05,719
- Just the man I want to see.
- Boss, it is not my fault.

654
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,512
Isn't it neat? There...

655
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:09,556
- What's not your fault?
- Superman.

656
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:12,892
How was I to know he was
gonna start doing his thing...

657
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,186
when you started doing your thing?

658
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:18,148
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talk?

659
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:21,234
It was just on television, man.
Didn't you see it?

660
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:22,819
Don't call me "man".

661
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:25,238
I just saw Colombia
bite the dust. That's all.

662
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:29,743
You didn't see the man come flying out
of the sky from the clouds? It was him!

663
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,454
With his cape flapping in the...

664
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:38,877
His cape was flapping in the wind!

665
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,338
He was flying! He was great!

666
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,340
He was just flying around...

667
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:46,968
His cape was blowing in the wind
like this. It looked like a flag!

668
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:51,097
And he landed right in the middle
of this big plantation!

669
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:56,686
And he checked everything out
with his x-ray vision.

670
00:55:56,896 --> 00:56:01,441
And then he put these laser beams
out of his eyes onto everything.

671
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,777
Straight-out laser points.

672
00:56:04,487 --> 00:56:06,279
Dried up everything!

673
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:07,947
Just like that!

674
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:11,242
I'm talking about drying it up,
like machines in the men's rooms.

675
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,452
You know what I mean?

676
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,913
Hot air comes out when you put
your hands under.

677
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:16,790
Sometimes they don't work, right?

678
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,291
But Superman's worked!

679
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:21,503
You think he stood around
to take bows? Not this man.

680
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,297
No, sir. He flies off again. Right?

681
00:56:24,507 --> 00:56:26,966
Then he saw what
really caused the trouble.

682
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,927
He flew into the tornado...

683
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,764
went down to the bottom of it,
and turned it upside down!

684
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:36,309
He made the little end on top
and the big end on the bottom!

685
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,978
I was gonna go crazy!

686
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:42,065
I've never seen nothing like it.

687
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:44,317
The big end was on the bottom.

688
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:46,277
Little end on the top.

689
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:49,656
Mr. Ross, it was... The big...

690
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:53,785
Superman's bad.

691
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:56,287
I'll say he was.

692
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:58,665
I mean, he was bad!

693
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,418
No.

694
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:02,961
No!

695
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,004
Here, let me help.

696
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:08,508
- It was a perfect plan. It was foolproof!
- And we were the fools.

697
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:12,554
It's not my fault.
I did what I was supposed to do.

698
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:16,683
He ruined it.
That lousy do-gooder ruined it.

699
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:22,856
Now that he's pulled off this stunt,
he'll try and ruin my oil scheme too.

700
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:26,526
- I've got to get rid of him.
- How?

701
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:28,862
Shoot him? You know
about him and bullets.

702
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,322
- Kryptonite.
- What?

703
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:36,077
Or krypton-ham, or krypton-heimer?

704
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,539
I forget what you call it,
but it's stuff that can hurt Superman.

705
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:42,542
- How would you know about that?
- I know a few things.

706
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,335
I know, from the graffiti I saw.

707
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:45,879
Wait a second.

708
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:47,213
She's right.

709
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:50,675
Kryptonite. I remember reading
about it in an interview with him.

710
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:52,093
Where does it come from?

711
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:54,554
The same planet Superman
came from... Krypton.

712
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:56,222
Where is Krypton?

713
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:57,724
It's nowhere.

714
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:59,559
It blew up in space, years ago.

715
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:03,229
They sent Superman here from there
when he was just a baby.

716
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:04,564
I know some things too.

717
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:08,234
Wait a minute. You know
what happens when a planet explodes.

718
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:11,988
- Debris. Things floating in space.
- So?

719
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:16,075
So all we have to do is find out
where in heaven Krypton used to be.

720
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:19,204
Then we get good old Gus
to contact the Vulcan satellite.

721
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,539
Old Gus has been doing some thinking.

722
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,625
Good. That's why I keep you around.

723
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:28,129
Yeah. I've been thinking that I'm not
making enough money for this gig.

724
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:32,133
Gus, if there's anything I hate...

725
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:34,093
it's greed.

726
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:37,388
Greed? Mr. Ross, just a minute.

727
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:39,432
Let me tell you something.

728
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:41,392
I can't ski!

729
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:16,135
Once Gus contacts
the Vulcan satellite...

730
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,304
he orders it to search
through space...

731
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,266
around where Krypton
went bye-bye.

732
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:34,320
Then the laser probe locks
on to a floating chunk of Kryptonite.

733
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:36,573
The computer analyzes
the components...

734
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:40,076
and the boys at the lab
duplicate the stuff down here.

735
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:42,495
"Unknown"?

736
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:44,497
"Unknown"?

737
01:00:01,724 --> 01:00:03,850
What the hell,
he ain't gonna smoke it.

738
01:00:09,857 --> 01:00:12,358
Mr. White can't be responsible.

739
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:15,820
Where is he?

740
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,614
Please, Mr. Stokis.

741
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:19,741
He'll pay for this.

742
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:22,785
Get out your wallet!

743
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:27,040
- Good morning.
- Don't you "good morning" me.

744
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,712
"Old, old relationships
suddenly seem very much the same.

745
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,547
The prettiest girl in the school..."

746
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:38,676
Is still the prettiest girl
in the school.

747
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:46,517
- Hello?
- Hello. Oh, hi, Clark.

748
01:00:46,727 --> 01:00:51,272
Lana! Hi, I was just
thinking about you.

749
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:55,193
Listen, I have a problem with Ricky.

750
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:56,694
Why? What happened to Ricky?

751
01:00:56,862 --> 01:01:00,406
It's Superman's autograph you got him.
He got carried away...

752
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,576
and told the kids Superman
was coming on his birthday.

753
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:05,078
Okay, it was wrong...

754
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:08,915
but when Wednesday comes and
Superman doesn't show, it's gonna...

755
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:13,544
Well, Lana, in this case I think
I can go ahead and speak for Superman.

756
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,797
I mean, he and I
are pretty close, you know.

757
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:20,051
And you can tell Ricky that Superman
will be there on Wednesday, all right?

758
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:25,223
Well, he's gonna get the best
home-cooked meal he's had...

759
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:26,766
in a long time.

760
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:29,936
- Tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
- All right.

761
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:32,230
- But, Clark...
- Yeah?

762
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:33,940
You're the best.

763
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:41,406
And I'll take it to
the Supreme Court if I have to.

764
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:44,909
But it wasn't our fault.
It was an act of God.

765
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,911
In a church?

766
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,633
Hey!

767
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:02,802
Here's that compound you ordered.

768
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:04,887
Can't imagine what you want with it.

769
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,431
But you got it.

770
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:15,648
What the hell am I afraid for?
I'm from Earth.

771
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:23,489
Lana, I really wasn't expecting all this.

772
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:26,284
I guess they did get
a little carried away.

773
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:43,384
Superman, we all know...

774
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:46,763
that you're not looking
for honors and awards.

775
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:51,184
But when we heard that you were
coming to see your pal Ricky...

776
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:55,188
we realized that this was
our chance to say thank you.

777
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,774
First, for putting out
the Lake Comooga fire.

778
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:01,527
And not least,
for saving little Ricky.

779
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:04,697
So since you already have
the key to our hearts...

780
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:07,033
Superman...

781
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:11,287
may I present you
with the key to the city.

782
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:12,872
Thank you, sir.

783
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:18,127
Thank you.

784
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,229
As you were.

785
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:40,566
Now listen up.

786
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:42,902
I just came in directly...

787
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:45,238
from the Pentagon...

788
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:49,575
and you better believe there's
a damn good reason that I did.

789
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,912
Because God has given us...

790
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,582
one of the greatest gifts in the world...

791
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:58,709
Chemicals.

792
01:03:59,711 --> 01:04:04,340
Now, you people, you like to go sit
in church on Sunday, don't you?

793
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:07,176
You like to sit and watch
the Super Bowl.

794
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,427
Yeah.

795
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,680
Sit on what?!

796
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:16,269
You sit on molded, plastic seats!

797
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:20,606
Molded to your well-fed behinds.

798
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:26,445
Now, I don't have to tell you
that America leads the world...

799
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:27,989
in high-grade plastics.

800
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:32,785
We cannot afford
a chemical-plastics gap.

801
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,246
Now, listen to me.

802
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:37,623
Do you want...

803
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:42,211
our president of the United States
sitting down...

804
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:44,964
to write a peace treaty...

805
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:48,050
and have his ballpoint pen bust open...

806
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,470
and the ink run out all over
his nice, clean pants...

807
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,472
in front of the world leaders?

808
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,516
No. No.

809
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:57,810
Now, we all know...

810
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:02,315
that last week, half of
this great nation of ours...

811
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:04,150
almost bit the bullet...

812
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:07,278
if it wasn't for this man here.

813
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:13,826
And all I can say is,
thank the Lord for Superman.

814
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,918
Superman, you saved our bacon...

815
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:24,420
and I'd like to show our gratitude.

816
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:31,928
This is a small token
of our appreciation...

817
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:36,766
to show to you for saving us
from a chemical-plant disaster.

818
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:44,690
Thank you very much, general.

819
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:47,360
This is very nice. Thank you.

820
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:59,830
It's very nice.

821
01:06:07,214 --> 01:06:10,883
Unknown. How am I supposed
to know what "unknown" means?

822
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:14,178
It means unknown. It means
nobody knows what it means.

823
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:16,555
- Hello, boss?
- Gus?

824
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:19,892
- Gus Gorman here.
- I know that. How did it go?

825
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:24,188
You know how they're always
trying to find the secret recipe...

826
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:26,190
in that chicken in the bucket?

827
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,401
And nobody seems to know
the ingredient...

828
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:30,736
because it's unknown, right?

829
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:35,741
In the Kryptonite there was an unknown
element and Superman didn't die.

830
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,744
He didn't die.

831
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:42,081
I ask you to kill Superman...

832
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:46,419
and you're telling me you couldn't
even do that one simple thing.

833
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:51,882
Hello?

834
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,357
He hasn't had
an afternoon nap for years.

835
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:12,236
This is the biggest day of his life.
I don't know how to thank you.

836
01:07:12,404 --> 01:07:14,071
You did with that wonderful lunch.

837
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:17,450
Oh, well, I do like to cook.

838
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:20,453
- You'll take some coffee?
- Yes, please.

839
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,788
- Decaffeinated, of course.
- Right.

840
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:30,296
Hello? Yes.

841
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:33,299
What?

842
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,551
Oh, really?

843
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:36,969
Yeah, he's here.

844
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:39,138
I'll tell him.
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

845
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:42,266
Superman, that was my friend Betty.

846
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:45,978
There's an accident on the bridge.
A trailer crashed through the rail.

847
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:49,231
It's hanging off the bridge
and the driver's in the cab.

848
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:52,193
I'm sorry.
I hate to make you rush off.

849
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:54,153
Well, there's no rush.

850
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:58,574
- But the bridge...
- It's okay. I always get there on time.

851
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:00,451
Come on, let's relax a little.

852
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:17,802
It's unusual finding a good-looking girl
like you alone like this.

853
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:33,359
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't
do something about the bridge?

854
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,194
What bridge?

855
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:41,659
You're right.

856
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,623
I have to get going.

857
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,175
Get him out of there. Come on.

858
01:08:58,385 --> 01:09:00,010
Get him out! Get him out quick!

859
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,888
Come on. Get him away.
That thing's gonna go.

860
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,822
Everybody okay? Joe?

861
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:21,824
What can I do to help?

862
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:23,534
Not much of anything now.

863
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:26,287
If only you'd got here
a minute sooner.

864
01:10:41,655 --> 01:10:44,198
"At a special session
of the General Assembly...

865
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:47,618
178 countries voted
to censure Superman...

866
01:10:47,786 --> 01:10:50,246
with only Colombia abstaining".

867
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,914
I can tell you one thing.

868
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:55,960
He wasn't so mean and nasty
the other day in Smallville.

869
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,587
In fact, he was so full of niceness...

870
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:01,131
I hated laying that big chunk of...

871
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:04,843
Kryptonite. Don't you see?

872
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:08,347
That stuff we ran off in the lab
wasn't a complete failure after all.

873
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:11,392
Right after Gus gave it to him,
he started to turn into...

874
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,686
an ornery, evil, malicious, selfish...

875
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,813
- A normal person.
- Yes.

876
01:11:16,398 --> 01:11:19,942
And now that Superman
is out of the nice-guy business...

877
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,819
We can get to work on that oil.

878
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:49,722
And now, the supreme
moment, as the last runner...

879
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:53,851
the one given the great honor
of lighting the ceremonial flame...

880
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:58,147
runs the last leg of a marathon
that began seven days ago...

881
01:11:58,356 --> 01:12:03,068
as this torch has been passed
from athlete to athlete...

882
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:06,030
for 970 miles...

883
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:08,032
across the country.

884
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:52,493
How can he say that pure categories
have no objective meaning...

885
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:55,537
in transcendental logic?
What about synthetic unity?

886
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,167
Hi, honey! Am I in your way?

887
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:03,295
- Stick around, you may learn something.
- Hi, Lorelei.

888
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:07,132
All the oil tankers in the world
are totally controlled by computers.

889
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,177
They tell them where to go,
how much oil to pick up...

890
01:13:10,387 --> 01:13:12,096
and where to deliver it.

891
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:14,139
Don't they have captains
on these ships?

892
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,766
Yes, but they don't need them.

893
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:19,228
That's a throwback to some
sentimental, seafaring baloney.

894
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:23,107
You will command the tankers
to sail toward a 50-mile area...

895
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,150
in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

896
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:26,985
And do what?

897
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,363
And do nothing.

898
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:31,824
Just sit there.

899
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,869
How are all the people
gonna get their oil?

900
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,456
You catch on fast, old buddy.

901
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:45,337
Every oil pump in America is run by...

902
01:13:45,547 --> 01:13:48,298
- Computers. I know.
- Will you stop interrupting?!

903
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:49,675
I'm sorry.

904
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:53,804
You will command the pumps
to stop pumping.

905
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:57,891
Then I want you to program
one special command...

906
01:13:58,101 --> 01:14:00,185
into all these systems.

907
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:03,147
Tell them these orders
are irreversible.

908
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:07,109
So it would be impossible
for anybody to switch them back.

909
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,194
Can you do this for me, old buddy?

910
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:11,613
Old pal?

911
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:21,373
You know, you get your way
all the time.

912
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:24,334
And it's not right.

913
01:14:26,754 --> 01:14:28,881
I wanna know when I get a taste.

914
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:39,600
I think you've already had
a taste of freedom, haven't you?

915
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,352
Or would you prefer jail?

916
01:14:42,562 --> 01:14:44,396
You can't run that jail number on me.

917
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:48,317
Because I know I mean more to you
out here doing things for you...

918
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:51,236
than sitting in jail
doing nothing for nobody.

919
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:54,072
I see.

920
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,074
What do you want?

921
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:04,875
What? A waste basket?

922
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:07,211
No. These are plans.

923
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:09,588
Blueprints.

924
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:12,216
- For what?
- A computer.

925
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:15,219
- We've already got computers.
- No, not like this.

926
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:18,931
There's not a computer like this
in the whole world anyplace.

927
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,350
It doesn't exist. You see...

928
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:22,935
we have to build it.

929
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:24,561
What will it do?

930
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:26,730
Anything I tell it.

931
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,441
What will it do for me?

932
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:33,904
For you? It will do anything you
tell me to tell it to do for you.

933
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:35,489
Wow.

934
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:41,870
Tell me.

935
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:47,084
First of all, if anyone attacks
this machine or anything...

936
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,169
the computer counterattacks it.

937
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:52,381
I mean, it finds their weaknesses
and wipes them out.

938
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:53,966
Right, old buddy.

939
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:57,970
You deal with my oil
and I'll build you your machine.

940
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:03,308
Okay, I'll do it.

941
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:07,020
But I'm not so sure about
this irreversible business.

942
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:26,832
They all kind of went...
What the hell?

943
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:32,713
That's it. The last tanker.

944
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:36,341
They're all mine now. All mine.

945
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,385
Yay.

946
01:16:38,595 --> 01:16:40,846
Not quite.

947
01:16:41,014 --> 01:16:43,515
What's that in
the upper-middle quadrant?

948
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:46,018
It's a tanker.

949
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:50,063
And it's going the wrong way.

950
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:02,034
Skipper?

951
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,870
There it is again.
"Proceed immediately to...

952
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:08,165
latitude 30 north, longitude 45 west.

953
01:17:09,876 --> 01:17:11,543
There await further orders".

954
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:13,879
Hell, that's the middle of the Atlantic.

955
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:16,965
I'm not taking my ship there
just to await further orders...

956
01:17:17,175 --> 01:17:18,717
no matter what that says.

957
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:22,554
We're supposed to go to Metropolis,
and we're going to Metropolis.

958
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:24,014
All right.

959
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,736
That's where she is. Yeah.

960
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:39,988
Come on, get it up there.

961
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:42,783
Miss?

962
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,577
Miss, can you hear me?

963
01:17:45,745 --> 01:17:48,413
Listen, we are here to help you.

964
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:52,084
Don't jump. I repeat, do not jump!

965
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:55,087
Thought you'd never get here.

966
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:58,715
Don't expect me to save you.
I don't do that anymore.

967
01:17:58,925 --> 01:18:00,008
Don't worry.

968
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:02,928
I'm long past saving.

969
01:18:07,809 --> 01:18:09,267
Well...

970
01:18:09,936 --> 01:18:11,770
don't let me keep you
from anything.

971
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,022
I'm not in a rush.

972
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:21,822
What did you have in mind?

973
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,782
Lots of things.

974
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,242
Oh, yeah?

975
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:31,248
If you'll just do me
one little favor first.

976
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:32,791
What's that?

977
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:35,043
Well...

978
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:37,796
See, there's this little boat...

979
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:41,717
and it's not going where
it's supposed to go and...

980
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,005
Stop all engines!

981
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:22,674
Stop all engines!

982
01:20:16,062 --> 01:20:17,562
Hi.

983
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,539
How about a little aprčs-ski?

984
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:47,926
Champagne?

985
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:13,535
Take your turn like everybody else!

986
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,787
Stop it!

987
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,584
He's coming over here, Martha.

988
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,547
Don't you do that!

989
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:29,217
Don't! Please!

990
01:21:35,433 --> 01:21:37,392
Hit him with your handbag!

991
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:44,316
Help me! Please, help me.
Somebody's beating up my husband.

992
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:48,111
- I've gotta call the police.
- Jack, go with her, okay?

993
01:21:49,155 --> 01:21:51,656
The third one today,
and at night it's worse.

994
01:21:51,866 --> 01:21:53,658
Somebody's behind this.

995
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:55,619
You can't tell me there's no oil.

996
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:58,163
You can't say someone's
not getting rich off this.

997
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:00,206
Someone's always getting rich.

998
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,417
You know who suffers? The small guy.

999
01:22:02,627 --> 01:22:05,837
The East Coast gets
the brunt of the spill.

1000
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:51,091
No, I cannot go out with you tonight.

1001
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,093
No. I'm busy tomorrow night too.

1002
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,053
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

1003
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,305
I'll think of something. Look...

1004
01:22:57,515 --> 01:23:00,684
- I gotta go. Ricky needs me.
- Lana.

1005
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:03,979
Brad, please stop calling me.
I've told you!

1006
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,231
Well, you listen to me, huh?

1007
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:08,400
You better start appreciating old Brad.

1008
01:23:08,818 --> 01:23:10,360
What else you got in Smallville?

1009
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:18,827
What else have I got in Smallville?

1010
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:22,372
I think I got the right answer.

1011
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,416
So do I.

1012
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:37,220
Smallville Airport, what flights
do you have to Metropolis tomorrow?

1013
01:23:42,852 --> 01:23:45,395
- Where do I put this?
- Over there.

1014
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:50,150
- Where do you want this?
- Put it up there.

1015
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:56,281
Are you kidding? I'm not going in there.

1016
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,637
Hey, hey. Come on.

1017
01:24:28,147 --> 01:24:29,314
Just leave him alone.

1018
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:53,213
I can't get through.
Something's happening.

1019
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,215
Hey, look! Superman's drunk!

1020
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,510
- I wanna see what's happening here.
- Ricky. Ricky!

1021
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:02,013
- Ricky.
- Yeah, that's right.

1022
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:04,849
- Thank you.
- It's a disgrace, that's what it is.

1023
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,852
I'll tell you, nobody's ever
gonna trust that creep again.

1024
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,479
He's washed up.

1025
01:25:12,983 --> 01:25:15,693
What are you looking at? Huh?

1026
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:19,280
Excuse me. Superman? It's me, Ricky.

1027
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:21,157
Ricky from Smallville.

1028
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:23,118
Tell them you won't hurt anybody!

1029
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,494
He's changed.

1030
01:25:24,662 --> 01:25:27,330
No! Maybe he's just sick.

1031
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,374
Superman, please get better!

1032
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,042
He's not listening to you.

1033
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:35,046
Yes, he is. He can hear me.
He's got super-hearing.

1034
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:37,841
Superman, you're just in a slump!

1035
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:39,759
You'll be great again!

1036
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:41,469
You can do it, Superman!

1037
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,639
Superman, you can hear me, can't you?

1038
01:25:44,849 --> 01:25:47,392
Superman, you're just in a slump.

1039
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,187
You'll be great again.
You can do it, superman.

1040
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:54,399
Superman, you can hear me, can't you?

1041
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:15,628
He's gone nuts!

1042
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:18,548
Come on!

1043
01:27:45,511 --> 01:27:47,470
I can give as good as I get.

1044
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:51,599
Oh, yeah? All right, come on! Come on!

1045
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:53,518
Come on! Come on!

1046
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:21,629
What's the matter, Kent?
Too warm for you, huh?

1047
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:26,551
Come on, chicken! Come and get me.

1048
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:29,012
You've been on my nerves a long time!

1049
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:52,994
You always wanted to fly, Kent.

1050
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,412
Now's your chance.

1051
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,041
Skipper!

1052
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:07,058
God, would you look at that!

1053
01:34:54,481 --> 01:34:57,108
Miss Lorelei Ambrosia
isn't at home right now.

1054
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,527
But if you'd care to leave a message...

1055
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:03,114
why not deliver it to her in person?

1056
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:06,659
So you've finally shown
your true colors.

1057
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:11,122
Well, if you're looking for us,
here's where you'll find us.

1058
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:13,040
Do drop in.

1059
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:21,298
Wow, this is fun!

1060
01:35:21,717 --> 01:35:23,759
Fun? The fun's just starting.

1061
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:27,179
Wait till Superman finds us,
then you'll see some fun.

1062
01:35:27,389 --> 01:35:29,765
Wait, you gonna mess with Superman?

1063
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:34,061
Let's go. I want to be ready for him
when he falls into our trap.

1064
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:38,190
I just don't see why you can't
balloon down like the rest of us.

1065
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,483
Well...

1066
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:42,445
No way.

1067
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:45,156
I just don't believe a man can fly.

1068
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,341
Watch out, horsy!

1069
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:16,187
Don't, don't, don't.

1070
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:18,773
Just don't try to fly.

1071
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:20,483
Don't try to fly!

1072
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:36,165
Will you get out of my way!

1073
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:57,311
- Hurry! Hurry up!
- I am hurrying.

1074
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:05,194
- I can't see anything.
- Turn on the light.

1075
01:37:05,362 --> 01:37:08,113
- Where's the light switch?
- Where do you usually find it?

1076
01:37:08,323 --> 01:37:10,616
I don't know.
I guess I'll check the doorway.

1077
01:37:10,826 --> 01:37:14,703
God, it's pitch-black in here.
Oh, that's better.

1078
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:20,918
Wow, what a jukebox!

1079
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:23,045
I told you, didn't I?

1080
01:37:23,213 --> 01:37:25,506
There. The ultimate computer!

1081
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:36,433
It does everything a computer can do
and 1000 things none of them can do.

1082
01:37:36,643 --> 01:37:38,060
Let's give it a dry run.

1083
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:40,187
Wait a minute.
We've gotta wait for Gus.

1084
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:41,689
Who needs Gus?

1085
01:37:41,857 --> 01:37:45,234
- He's the only one who can operate it.
- Like fish he is!

1086
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:48,654
I know enough about computers
to put a PhD to shame.

1087
01:37:48,864 --> 01:37:51,407
Come now, brother dear,
you didn't think...

1088
01:37:51,575 --> 01:37:54,285
I was gonna let that little man
run the show, did you?

1089
01:37:54,661 --> 01:37:56,704
Why don't peons tidy up
when they're done?

1090
01:37:56,913 --> 01:37:59,707
Come on, Bubba, it's showtime.

1091
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:05,796
Engage those buttons
to activate the alpha circuit...

1092
01:38:06,006 --> 01:38:07,381
and lock the modular grid.

1093
01:38:07,591 --> 01:38:12,469
You! Activate circuits 29 through W-7...

1094
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:16,765
and start full-power coordinates
on exterior defensive systems.

1095
01:38:16,975 --> 01:38:19,852
In other words, push this red button.

1096
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:22,688
How did you know about that?

1097
01:38:40,624 --> 01:38:41,665
He's here!

1098
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:44,835
Good. Let's give him
something to worry about.

1099
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:47,379
Now, let's see...

1100
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:50,215
Tracking systems locked.

1101
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:17,701
Let the games begin.

1102
01:39:18,703 --> 01:39:20,329
Don't tense up now, honey.

1103
01:39:52,862 --> 01:39:55,739
Come on, Bubba,
you're wasting your rockets.

1104
01:40:03,164 --> 01:40:05,249
Come on, Superman!

1105
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,210
Let him have it, Ross.

1106
01:40:15,093 --> 01:40:16,927
Bubba, keep firing.

1107
01:40:17,095 --> 01:40:19,763
Keep him occupied
while I get the MX ready.

1108
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,209
What the hell is going on?

1109
01:40:57,302 --> 01:41:00,971
You keep your rockets coming.
He won't notice the missile till too late!

1110
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:11,315
So much for your catlike reflexes.

1111
01:41:21,785 --> 01:41:23,368
Oh, God!

1112
01:41:33,338 --> 01:41:36,298
No more. Look, you sit.

1113
01:41:36,508 --> 01:41:38,300
Sit, sit!

1114
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:43,138
Help!

1115
01:41:43,848 --> 01:41:47,017
Hello? Forget you, jackass!

1116
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:49,603
That's him out of the way.

1117
01:41:49,771 --> 01:41:53,857
Sis, how would you like to control
all the world's weapons systems?

1118
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:55,943
Baby!

1119
01:41:56,152 --> 01:41:57,611
It's Daddy!

1120
01:41:58,696 --> 01:42:00,864
Hey, what are you doing with my baby?

1121
01:42:01,324 --> 01:42:05,494
Gus, old buddy, genius.
Come up and join the fun.

1122
01:42:16,381 --> 01:42:19,967
He's still coming.
Arm the inner defenses.

1123
01:42:24,389 --> 01:42:25,889
All right, the game's over.

1124
01:42:26,558 --> 01:42:27,599
Hi, honey.

1125
01:42:28,143 --> 01:42:29,309
I don't know you, lady.

1126
01:42:31,354 --> 01:42:32,563
But the other night...

1127
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:37,401
I'm sorry, but that wasn't me.

1128
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:38,902
That guy's gone.

1129
01:42:40,697 --> 01:42:42,156
And you're next, Webster.

1130
01:42:43,283 --> 01:42:46,702
Never underestimate
the power of computers.

1131
01:42:46,995 --> 01:42:48,328
How do you like it?

1132
01:42:48,538 --> 01:42:51,081
I think it's typical
of people like you, Webster.

1133
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:54,751
Instead of helping others, the four
of you just wanna help yourselves.

1134
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:57,254
Four of you?

1135
01:42:57,422 --> 01:42:59,548
You mean, us? Four? Wait...

1136
01:42:59,757 --> 01:43:01,425
Hey, man!

1137
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:05,262
That's only his last name.
He likes to be called "Superman".

1138
01:43:06,055 --> 01:43:08,682
See, I'm not with them, Superman.

1139
01:43:09,267 --> 01:43:10,684
You could've fooled me, mister.

1140
01:43:19,027 --> 01:43:20,527
That's very good.

1141
01:43:22,989 --> 01:43:26,491
Let's see how long
he can carry on without any air.

1142
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:50,599
He's still coming!
He's going to get me!

1143
01:43:50,767 --> 01:43:51,892
Don't bet on it!

1144
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:05,948
You're hurting him.

1145
01:44:10,036 --> 01:44:12,120
- That's Kryptonite!
- Yes.

1146
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:14,831
- This time we got it right!
- You're a genius.

1147
01:44:15,375 --> 01:44:18,961
You've invented a machine
that can find anybody's weak spot.

1148
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:21,004
Congratulations, old buddy.

1149
01:44:21,172 --> 01:44:24,424
You'll go down in history
as the man who killed Superman!

1150
01:44:24,634 --> 01:44:25,842
I'm... No.

1151
01:44:26,552 --> 01:44:27,844
Superman!

1152
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:29,596
No!

1153
01:44:30,139 --> 01:44:32,432
- Where do you think you're going?
- Never mind.

1154
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:35,519
- Turn the power up.
- Hasn't he had enough?

1155
01:44:39,357 --> 01:44:40,649
Turn it up!

1156
01:44:40,817 --> 01:44:42,943
Power! More power!

1157
01:45:04,382 --> 01:45:07,050
Seventy-five. Current 7.75.

1158
01:45:11,139 --> 01:45:15,892
There's a current level of 7
that is not supposed to be on bar...

1159
01:45:16,102 --> 01:45:17,686
Oh, here it is!

1160
01:45:44,339 --> 01:45:45,380
What's going on?

1161
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:48,091
I don't know. The power's gone.

1162
01:45:48,551 --> 01:45:50,427
Gus must have pulled the plug out.

1163
01:45:50,928 --> 01:45:52,387
It worked.

1164
01:45:52,597 --> 01:45:54,931
It worked! I got it!

1165
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:00,437
What have you got?

1166
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,691
- Give me that screw.
- This screw?

1167
01:46:04,901 --> 01:46:07,027
- That screw.
- Never!

1168
01:46:11,449 --> 01:46:13,950
Hey, wait. I can't see.

1169
01:46:36,516 --> 01:46:37,641
What?

1170
01:46:40,478 --> 01:46:41,937
Holy!

1171
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,648
No! Make it stop!

1172
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:47,734
I can't! It's out of control!

1173
01:46:47,944 --> 01:46:51,113
But how? Where's it getting
the power from?

1174
01:46:54,659 --> 01:46:56,868
It's feeding itself.

1175
01:46:57,078 --> 01:46:58,328
It wants to live!

1176
01:47:21,227 --> 01:47:23,395
It's this thing here. We'll go to the zoo.

1177
01:47:23,604 --> 01:47:26,857
I'll do that tomorrow,
and then we'll go on to the...

1178
01:47:27,984 --> 01:47:30,527
- What's happening?
- It's okay, Ricky.

1179
01:47:30,778 --> 01:47:31,945
Put the lights on!

1180
01:47:51,883 --> 01:47:53,925
Stop it! You're killing him!

1181
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:57,095
Stop it!

1182
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:10,984
Hey. Put me down!

1183
01:48:28,252 --> 01:48:31,338
Don't leave us alone in here! Superman!

1184
01:48:35,676 --> 01:48:36,801
Oh, I get it.

1185
01:48:36,969 --> 01:48:40,555
The coaxial energy shaft is engaging
the grid source factor. Right.

1186
01:48:40,765 --> 01:48:42,599
We're through, frogface.
I'm splitting.

1187
01:48:42,767 --> 01:48:44,351
Hey, wait a minute!

1188
01:48:46,896 --> 01:48:49,564
Girls. Girls, come out of there!

1189
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:01,451
Help me! Please!

1190
01:49:08,125 --> 01:49:09,251
Sis?

1191
01:49:13,089 --> 01:49:14,381
Oh, my God.

1192
01:49:21,973 --> 01:49:23,265
What is that?

1193
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,111
Lorelei!

1194
01:49:38,656 --> 01:49:40,824
Sis, it's your Bubba!

1195
01:50:18,863 --> 01:50:20,530
Help me. Help!

1196
01:50:22,742 --> 01:50:24,034
Superman!

1197
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:28,204
Honey!

1198
01:50:28,372 --> 01:50:32,250
Honey, I'm stuck here! Help!
What about me?

1199
01:50:43,387 --> 01:50:44,429
Look out!

1200
01:52:53,768 --> 01:52:54,976
Bubba?

1201
01:53:41,315 --> 01:53:43,066
Thank you, brother.

1202
01:53:50,074 --> 01:53:51,783
Regular or premium?

1203
01:53:51,992 --> 01:53:56,079
She hasn't had a drink in so long,
give her a tankful of the good stuff.

1204
01:53:57,998 --> 01:53:59,040
How you doing?

1205
01:53:59,208 --> 01:54:02,293
Please don't talk to me.
I'm having enough trouble hanging on.

1206
01:54:02,503 --> 01:54:05,255
Okay, we'll go slow.
You're perfectly safe.

1207
01:54:05,881 --> 01:54:07,298
I'm not gonna argue with you.

1208
01:54:07,466 --> 01:54:10,593
I mean, any man who can trick
my machine can do anything.

1209
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:12,470
How did you beat my defenses?

1210
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:16,099
Those defenses are good as long
as it didn't know it's in trouble.

1211
01:54:16,308 --> 01:54:19,811
This time it didn't see the danger.
I went in with plain old acid.

1212
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:23,648
It didn't know that when acid gets hot,
it'll eat through anything.

1213
01:54:24,191 --> 01:54:25,775
- Watch the trees.
- Whoa!

1214
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:29,445
I guess it died of acid indigestion.

1215
01:54:30,698 --> 01:54:33,283
But what's gonna happen
to Ross and the ladies?

1216
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:36,995
They're gonna have to see the police.
It's not your problem anymore.

1217
01:54:38,539 --> 01:54:40,081
Are we in Metropolis yet?

1218
01:54:40,291 --> 01:54:43,376
Nope. We're just gonna make
a little stop right over there.

1219
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:53,595
We're on the ground, Gus.
Morning.

1220
01:54:53,762 --> 01:54:55,763
- You okay, Supe?
- I'm fine.

1221
01:54:55,973 --> 01:54:57,140
Excuse me a second.

1222
01:55:01,478 --> 01:55:03,271
Can you guys spare one of these?

1223
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:06,858
- Sure, Superman.
- It is Superman, isn't it?

1224
01:55:07,067 --> 01:55:09,068
Are you kidding? Is that?

1225
01:55:09,278 --> 01:55:11,988
Didn't you see us fly out of the sky?

1226
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:17,785
We're the only two men who can fly.
"Is it Superman?"

1227
01:55:17,995 --> 01:55:19,495
Just right.

1228
01:55:20,331 --> 01:55:21,372
Okay, Gus, let's go.

1229
01:55:21,582 --> 01:55:24,667
I was afraid you'd say that.
I thought I'd take the bus.

1230
01:55:25,169 --> 01:55:28,504
Well, suit yourself.
Does your boss have a computer here?

1231
01:55:28,839 --> 01:55:31,758
Yeah, he got a little bitty one
about that big.

1232
01:55:31,926 --> 01:55:35,595
You tell him he can do a lot worse
than to give Gus Gorman here a job.

1233
01:55:37,848 --> 01:55:39,432
Wow, thank you, Supe.

1234
01:55:39,767 --> 01:55:40,808
Take care.

1235
01:55:42,686 --> 01:55:44,187
I'll see you around.

1236
01:55:50,277 --> 01:55:51,361
So long.

1237
01:55:54,406 --> 01:55:56,115
Take it easy, man.

1238
01:55:57,493 --> 01:56:01,704
Well, you got good references,
so if you want that job...

1239
01:56:05,751 --> 01:56:08,544
Nah, this is not for me.
I think I'll take that bus.

1240
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:10,630
Can you tell me
where the bus station is?

1241
01:56:10,839 --> 01:56:13,424
Yeah, about nine, 10 miles over there.

1242
01:56:13,634 --> 01:56:18,096
Nine or 10 miles. Okay.

1243
01:56:18,263 --> 01:56:20,348
Hey. You really flew with him?

1244
01:56:20,516 --> 01:56:23,559
Superman? Have you ever
seen Superman before?

1245
01:56:25,562 --> 01:56:26,604
No.

1246
01:56:26,897 --> 01:56:30,400
Oh, you don't know about me and him?
Me and Superman?

1247
01:56:35,572 --> 01:56:37,907
Yeah, we go way back together.

1248
01:56:38,075 --> 01:56:40,743
We always, usually, sometimes, we...

1249
01:56:42,204 --> 01:56:43,955
Nine or 10 miles?

1250
01:56:44,498 --> 01:56:46,416
I think I'll walk.

1251
01:56:46,792 --> 01:56:48,209
Yeah, I'll walk.

1252
01:56:48,794 --> 01:56:50,003
Yeah.

1253
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:56,259
Clark.

1254
01:56:56,593 --> 01:56:59,595
What a nice surprise! Come in.

1255
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:01,347
- Gosh. Hi, Mr. Kent.
- Hi, Ricky.

1256
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:04,017
- Guess who Mom's having dinner with.
- Who?

1257
01:57:04,226 --> 01:57:05,601
Superman!

1258
01:57:06,145 --> 01:57:08,354
Yeah, that's what I came to tell you.

1259
01:57:08,564 --> 01:57:10,440
Superman said to tell you he's sorry...

1260
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:14,318
but he's run into a problem and he
won't be able to have dinner with you.

1261
01:57:14,486 --> 01:57:16,779
- I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
- Yeah.

1262
01:57:17,948 --> 01:57:19,824
Would you mind settling for me?

1263
01:57:20,034 --> 01:57:21,284
Any day.

1264
01:57:22,161 --> 01:57:23,494
- I'll get my things.
- Okay.

1265
01:57:25,414 --> 01:57:28,916
You know, Lana, I was talking
to Superman the other day.

1266
01:57:29,126 --> 01:57:32,879
You know, he and I, we talk a lot.

1267
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:36,716
And he felt badly about you having
to pawn your diamond ring.

1268
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:41,304
Well, he found...

1269
01:57:42,514 --> 01:57:45,725
He found this one just lying around.

1270
01:57:47,019 --> 01:57:49,479
He wanted you to have this.

1271
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,279
Wow, a ring from Superman!

1272
01:57:59,448 --> 01:58:01,240
- It's okay. I got it.
- Sorry.

1273
01:58:01,408 --> 01:58:02,825
Look at that.

1274
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:05,995
- Oh, Clark.
- It's okay.

1275
01:58:06,205 --> 01:58:07,497
It fits.

1276
01:58:07,998 --> 01:58:09,332
It looks really pretty.

1277
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:10,875
Thank you.

1278
01:58:11,919 --> 01:58:13,586
Well...

1279
01:58:13,754 --> 01:58:14,837
- Brad.
- Brad.

1280
01:58:15,297 --> 01:58:16,339
Son of a bitch.

1281
01:58:18,175 --> 01:58:20,093
Kent, I hate you.

1282
01:58:21,011 --> 01:58:22,929
I've always hated you.

1283
01:58:23,472 --> 01:58:25,223
- You know why?
- No.

1284
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:27,016
- Because you're nice.
- Not really.

1285
01:58:27,226 --> 01:58:28,684
And nice guys finish last.

1286
01:58:40,489 --> 01:58:42,115
Lois, I've got to hand it to you.

1287
01:58:42,324 --> 01:58:44,700
Who else could turn
a vacation into a story...

1288
01:58:44,910 --> 01:58:47,870
that'll blow the lid off
of corruption in the Caribbean?

1289
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:51,374
I knew I was on to something
when that taxi driver kidnapped me.

1290
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:53,584
Lois, you're terrific.

1291
01:58:53,794 --> 01:58:57,171
I have to be. Seems I've got
some new competition.

1292
01:58:59,091 --> 01:59:01,634
The story that you wrote
on the class reunion?

1293
01:59:01,844 --> 01:59:03,636
- I thought it was terrific.
- Thanks.

1294
01:59:03,804 --> 01:59:07,431
And fascinating. I liked the part
about the little girl back home.

1295
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:09,892
I'll take you to lunch
and you tell me about it.

1296
01:59:10,727 --> 01:59:14,021
I'd love to, but I'm having lunch
with Mr. White's new secretary.

1297
01:59:14,189 --> 01:59:15,231
- Hi, Lana.
- Hi, Clark.

1298
01:59:15,399 --> 01:59:19,735
Lana. Lois, say hello to Lana Lang,
Smallville's newest gift to Metropolis.

1299
01:59:19,903 --> 01:59:22,363
I'm glad to meet you.
I like your writing a lot.

1300
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:23,823
Thank you.

1301
01:59:24,783 --> 01:59:26,117
I like your sparkler a lot.

1302
01:59:26,326 --> 01:59:29,245
Me too. I couldn't believe it
when Clark gave it to me.

1303
01:59:30,747 --> 01:59:32,874
- Clark gave it to you?
- Yes.

1304
01:59:35,586 --> 01:59:36,961
Mr. White.

1305
01:59:37,171 --> 01:59:40,298
Mr. White, look what I've got for you.

1306
01:59:40,507 --> 01:59:43,426
People, I am in love with this machine!

1307
01:59:43,594 --> 01:59:48,222
Mr. White, excuse me, but I have
a couple of errands to run before lunch.

1308
01:59:48,432 --> 01:59:51,142
- Go ahead, Mr. White.
- Where's the handle?

1309
01:59:51,351 --> 01:59:54,604
There is no handle.
You just push the button.
