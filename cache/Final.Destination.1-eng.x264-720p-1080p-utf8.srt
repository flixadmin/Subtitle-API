1
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,726
Alex.

2
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:05,726
Tod and George's dad
just called.

3
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:07,529
He's picking you up
at 3.30 tomorrow.

4
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:10,127
The bus leaves the high school
for the airport around 5.00.

5
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,425
How's my suitcase
working out for you?

6
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:16,528
Mom, you got
to leave that on.

7
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:19,927
The tag made the last flight
without the plane crashing...

8
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:24,329
so I figure it's got to be
on or with the bag.

9
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:26,529
For luck.

10
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,028
Where would you get
a nutball idea like that?

11
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:31,428
I'm still here.

12
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:38,931
So, seventeen, on the loose...

13
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:41,332
senior trip
with your friends in Paris...

14
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,034
ten days in the springtime.

15
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:49,233
Live it up. You got
your whole life ahead of you.

16
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:10,045
Hitchcock, let me give you
a hand with this.

17
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,046
There you go.

18
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,148
Carter, you dick.

19
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,048
- Schmuck.
- Good one.

20
00:05:17,548 --> 00:05:19,748
- You left this on the bus.
- Thanks.

21
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:21,349
Come on,
let's get your stuff together.

22
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,349
Hey, Christa. Hi, Blake.

23
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:27,250
- What are you doing?
- He's the man.

24
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:29,051
All right.
You guys got everything?

25
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:31,452
Yeah, Dad, we're all set.

26
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,251
Does that mean go?

27
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:39,752
Don't know.

28
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:43,051
This is for both of you.
Have a great time.

29
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:44,653
Thanks, Dad.

30
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:47,254
- Both of us.
- Let's go.

31
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:50,154
- Alex, take care of them.
- I will.

32
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,156
Didn't think anything could look
worse than my yearbook photo.

33
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:05,157
How do you think I feel
having to look at you?

34
00:06:13,158 --> 00:06:14,959
What the fuck does he want?

35
00:06:20,658 --> 00:06:23,161
The airport does not
endorse solicitors.

36
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:34,461
Death is not the end.

37
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,462
It will be for you
if you harass my students.

38
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:41,464
Hare Rama.

39
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:51,165
I have to ask you
a few questions this evening.

40
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:52,865
Did you pack your bags yourself?

41
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:56,665
Have your belongings been in
your possession the entire time?

42
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,167
Mr. Browning?

43
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:08,267
Have you received any packages
from persons unknown to you?

44
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,968
- Same as your birthday.
- What?

45
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,971
September 25. 9.25.

46
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:29,472
Your birthday's the same
as your departure time.

47
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:44,874
Fuck off, dude. Dick.

48
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:46,275
Babe.

49
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:50,072
George, Dad said both of us.
Give me some cash.

50
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:52,576
Knock it off.

51
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:56,875
You asshole.

52
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:09,679
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

53
00:08:40,082 --> 00:08:41,383
Let's go take a shit.

54
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:44,182
- Take a shit by yourself.
- No, dude.

55
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:46,484
Listen, OK?
Take some knowledge.

56
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,384
We're about to board
a seven-hour flight.

57
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:51,886
The toilets in coach
are barely ventilated closets.

58
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:53,886
Say halfway
through the flight...

59
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:55,685
your body wants
that airplane food out.

60
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,786
You got to go
torque a wicked cable.

61
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,587
Then directly after you,
walks in Christa or Blake.

62
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:07,091
Want them to associate you with
that watery sting in their eye?

63
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:10,087
That reflexive gag
at the back of their throat?

64
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:16,389
He was born

65
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,189
In the summer

66
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:21,291
Of his 27th year

67
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,692
Comin' home

68
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:24,491
John Denver.

69
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:30,192
He left yesterday behind him

70
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,592
Died in a plane crash.

71
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:35,092
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

72
00:09:35,593 --> 00:09:37,092
At this time, we would like
to begin preboarding...

73
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:42,195
of Volee Air flight 180
to Paris through gate 46.

74
00:09:45,694 --> 00:09:47,795
I've seen it raining fire

75
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,597
In the sky

76
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:56,696
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?
How did we lose him?

77
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:05,396
Go. Go.

78
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:33,302
Go.

79
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,403
That hurt.

80
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:55,407
That's a good sign.
Younger, the better.

81
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:58,406
It'd be a fucked-up God
to take down this plane.

82
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,507
A really fucked-up God.

83
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,110
- Hey, Tod.
- Hello. How you doing?

84
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:30,614
Can you switch seats
with Christa?

85
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:34,412
God, I would,
but I got a bladder thing.

86
00:11:35,014 --> 00:11:37,614
It's a urinary tract infection.

87
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:40,214
Let's go ask Alex.

88
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:51,413
Could you trade seats so Blake
and I could sit together?

89
00:11:51,914 --> 00:11:55,217
She asked Tod,
but he had some medical thing.

90
00:11:57,118 --> 00:11:58,317
Please?

91
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:05,619
You're so sweet.
Thanks, Alex.

92
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,318
Thank you, Alex.

93
00:12:08,818 --> 00:12:10,619
You're welcome.

94
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,020
You really think we'd
titty-fuck them over Greenland?

95
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:24,421
Because of you, I got to watch
fucking "Stuart Little."

96
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:27,022
Thank you.

97
00:12:27,522 --> 00:12:29,424
Thanks, man. That's great.

98
00:12:31,223 --> 00:12:32,423
Sorry I'm late.

99
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:33,823
That's my seat right there.

100
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:35,325
Thanks.

101
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:38,227
- Hello?
- Ain't going that way.

102
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,126
May I have your attention?

103
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,327
To properly fasten
your seat belts...

104
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:43,725
slide the flat portion
into the buckle.

105
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:47,226
There are six emergency exits.

106
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:49,326
Two doors in front,
two over the wings...

107
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:51,526
two at the rear
of the aircraft.

108
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:58,427
Flight attendants,
prepare for departure.

109
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:45,436
All right.

110
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:53,239
Whatever.

111
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:13,640
It's fine.

112
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:23,443
It's OK, honey.

113
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:47,258
Could you trade seats so
Blake and I could sit together?

114
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:50,456
She asked Tod,
but he had some medical thing.

115
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:53,056
Please?

116
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,858
What's up, dude?

117
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:06,860
- Is there a problem, sir?
- What's your fucking problem?

118
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:10,060
This fucking plane's
going to explode!

119
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:12,263
- Shut up, Browning.
- You're so not funny.

120
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:15,365
- If this is a joke...
- It's not a joke!

121
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:16,962
Alex, take it easy.

122
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:19,061
- Sit down!
- It's going down!

123
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:21,564
We'll remove you
if this continues.

124
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:23,363
I'll fucking remove myself!

125
00:16:26,063 --> 00:16:28,464
- That's my seat.
- This plane is going down!

126
00:16:28,964 --> 00:16:30,666
Everybody in the aisle
off the plane.

127
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,564
Just stay where you are.
Sit tight.

128
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:36,364
This fucking plane
is going down!

129
00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:38,164
Go check him out.
See how he's doing.

130
00:16:50,368 --> 00:16:53,869
- Get the fuck off me!
- Let go, jerk.

131
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:57,171
You got this?
No one gets back on board.

132
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,970
- That's my call.
- Wait, please!

133
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,770
I've got forty students
going to Paris. Please.

134
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,371
You must understand
my position.

135
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,572
I do, and I apologize
for Alex...

136
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,472
but one of us
needs to be on that plane.

137
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:11,872
I cannot let those students
go to Paris for ten days...

138
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,671
Sit the fuck down, Carter!
Sit!

139
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:17,673
One of you
can go on the flight.

140
00:17:18,274 --> 00:17:19,974
Larry.

141
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,175
They're not taking this well.
One of us can get back on.

142
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:27,873
The rest can take
an 11.10 flight.

143
00:17:28,474 --> 00:17:29,174
I'll stay.

144
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:31,574
You know the French thing.
Get on the plane.

145
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:33,375
It's fine.

146
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:37,575
Hi, I was in the bathroom,
and the lock was stuck...

147
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:40,574
Wait, I didn't fight
with anyone!

148
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:44,078
Damn!

149
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:45,677
Thanks.

150
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,579
I called your parents.
They're on their way.

151
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,882
Stupid Alex.

152
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,280
Alex, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

153
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,280
I saw it.

154
00:18:08,381 --> 00:18:09,082
I don't know. I saw it.

155
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:12,283
I saw it on the runway,
I saw it take off...

156
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:14,982
I saw out my window,
I saw the ground.

157
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:18,085
And the cabin,
it starts to shake.

158
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:21,682
The left side blows up
and the whole plane explodes.

159
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:25,183
And it was so real,
like how everything happens.

160
00:18:25,885 --> 00:18:27,084
Been on a lot of planes
that blew up?

161
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:28,586
You fell asleep.

162
00:18:29,084 --> 00:18:33,685
We get thrown off the plane
and blow a half day in Paris?

163
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:35,686
All because Browning
has a bad fucking dream?

164
00:18:36,188 --> 00:18:39,487
Wait! The plane,
it's going to blow up!

165
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:41,588
Fuck you, Horton.

166
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,290
The only trip you're taking
is to the fucking hospital!

167
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:48,488
Get off him!
Alex, stop it!

168
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,389
There they go, here we stay.

169
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:57,990
You're paying for my trip.

170
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,589
I wish you were on that plane!

171
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:02,590
- You fucking prick!
- Shit!

172
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:13,393
- Call it in!
- Security!

173
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,402
You're looking at me
as if I caused this.

174
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,703
I didn't cause this.

175
00:20:16,503 --> 00:20:17,904
Are there any survivors?

176
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:25,206
How should I know?

177
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:31,508
- You think I'm some...
- He's not a witch.

178
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:39,208
I'm Howard Seigel...

179
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:41,109
National Transportation
and Safety Board.

180
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,210
We've contacted
all your families.

181
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,507
They are on the way.

182
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:48,308
Is there anyone here
who feels they might need...

183
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:52,209
medical attention
or spiritual counseling?

184
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,811
What's going on?
Are there any survivors?

185
00:20:57,612 --> 00:21:00,313
The cause for the explosion
is still undetermined.

186
00:21:00,912 --> 00:21:02,810
The Nassau County
authorities are on the scene...

187
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:05,911
naval search and rescue
en route.

188
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:08,013
Excuse me. I'm Agent Weine.

189
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:11,213
This is Agent Schreck.
We're with the FBI.

190
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:13,712
I understand how
you all must be feeling...

191
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:15,213
and I know it's going
to be difficult...

192
00:21:15,713 --> 00:21:18,014
but we need to ask questions
regarding today's events...

193
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:20,215
while they're still fresh
in your mind.

194
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,315
This will prove invaluable
to our rescue attempts...

195
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,416
and any potential
criminal investigation.

196
00:21:29,517 --> 00:21:30,216
You said, "Listen to me.

197
00:21:30,717 --> 00:21:32,917
"This plane will explode
on takeoff."

198
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,719
How did you know that?

199
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:37,619
I got this feeling.

200
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:40,717
This weird feeling.

201
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,218
Did you take any sedatives
before boarding?

202
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:45,219
On board, did you take
any sleeping pills...

203
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:46,719
narcotics, hallucinogens?

204
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:49,319
Do you take any drugs?

205
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,822
I saw it.

206
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:56,819
I saw it happen.

207
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:58,519
I saw the plane explode.

208
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,421
Did the weird feelings
have anything to do...

209
00:22:01,022 --> 00:22:04,223
with your saying you wished
Carter Horton was on it...

210
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,223
just before it exploded?

211
00:22:08,421 --> 00:22:10,124
Then why'd you say it?

212
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:13,024
I didn't really think
it was going to happen.

213
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,623
If that's the case, Alex...

214
00:22:15,224 --> 00:22:18,227
why did you really
get off the plane?

215
00:22:21,126 --> 00:22:23,125
My brother George...

216
00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:26,726
he told me to go
keep an eye on Alex.

217
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:31,525
And so he stayed and...

218
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:40,328
He told me
to get off the plane.

219
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:43,230
Larry Murnau said
I should get back on...

220
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,730
but I told him
that he should go.

221
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:50,828
I sent him back on the plane.

222
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:55,832
All right.

223
00:22:56,331 --> 00:22:58,330
Nobody forced you off the plane.

224
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:01,431
You said you weren't friends
with those that were...

225
00:23:02,031 --> 00:23:04,133
so, Clear, why did you
get off the plane?

226
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:08,833
Because I saw
and I heard Alex...

227
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:15,134
and I believed him.

228
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:38,839
There he is.

229
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,343
Thank you for the ride.

230
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:11,756
You are looking
at the first piece of debris...

231
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:14,854
to wash ashore
from Volee Air flight 180...

232
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:18,156
which erupted shortly after
a 9.25 p.m. Takeoff...

233
00:25:18,756 --> 00:25:20,756
from John F. Kennedy Airport
in New York.

234
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:22,956
There are no known survivors.

235
00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:25,758
Coast Guard and naval
search and rescue efforts...

236
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,557
are continuing
at this moment...

237
00:25:28,158 --> 00:25:30,756
even as jet fuel burns
on the ocean's surface.

238
00:25:31,256 --> 00:25:33,456
Authorities are pessimistic
about the possibility...

239
00:25:33,957 --> 00:25:36,558
of finding anyone alive
from the ill-fated flight.

240
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:40,560
All 287 passengers
are feared dead.

241
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:41,959
Amongst the travelers...

242
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:44,661
a class of forty students
and four teachers...

243
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:47,862
from Mount Abraham High School
in south-east New York...

244
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:50,061
en route to Paris
on a field trip.

245
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:52,263
There are reports
several students...

246
00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:55,564
were removed from the aircraft
moments before departure...

247
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:57,663
however, investigators
remain guarded...

248
00:25:58,262 --> 00:25:59,662
about the specifics
of this incident.

249
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:03,365
Authorities from National
Transportation and Safety...

250
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:04,866
and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation...

251
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:08,163
have arrived at JFK to begin
the initial investigation.

252
00:26:08,662 --> 00:26:11,865
Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long Island...

253
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:14,865
report seeing the plane explode.

254
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,466
No other aircraft were
visibly near flight 180.

255
00:26:17,966 --> 00:26:19,266
At JFK,
air traffic controllers...

256
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:22,267
are corroborating
these eyewitness accounts.

257
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:25,266
After the explosion,
debris apparently rained...

258
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:28,169
into the Atlantic Ocean
for several miles.

259
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:32,369
Investigators are cautious about
verifying these accounts...

260
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:34,767
believing they'll learn more...

261
00:26:55,274 --> 00:26:57,274
Thirty-nine days
have passed...

262
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,873
since we lost
our thirty-nine loved ones...

263
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:01,973
friends, and teachers.

264
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:04,375
As each day passes...

265
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,475
without a determining cause
for the accident...

266
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,975
we ask ourselves, "Why?"

267
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:13,677
"Ecclesiastes" tells us...

268
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:16,777
"Man no more knows
his own time...

269
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,876
"than fish taken
in the fatal net...

270
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:22,476
"or birds trapped in the snare.

271
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:26,079
"Like these,
the children of men caught...

272
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,778
"when the time falls
suddenly upon them."

273
00:27:29,378 --> 00:27:32,180
And so,
before we can heal...

274
00:27:32,779 --> 00:27:36,581
before we escape the presence
of death and time...

275
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,781
we must mourn
and celebrate theirs...

276
00:27:40,281 --> 00:27:42,280
with this memorial.

277
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:29,188
I hope you don't think because
my name ain't on this wall...

278
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:31,788
that I owe you anything.

279
00:28:32,288 --> 00:28:33,291
I don't.

280
00:28:33,691 --> 00:28:36,489
All I owe these people is
to live my life to the fullest.

281
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,791
Why don't you
stay off the J.D., then?

282
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,593
Don't you ever fucking
tell me what to do.

283
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:44,894
I control my life, not you.

284
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:50,792
I'm never going to die.

285
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:05,193
I took my driver's test
last week at the DMV.

286
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:06,593
Got a seventy.

287
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,595
It's the lowest score
you can get, but I passed.

288
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:10,895
The thing is,
when I was done with the test...

289
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:13,596
you know the guy that drives
with you during the test?

290
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:14,897
Anyways, he goes...

291
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:19,098
"Young man, you're going to die
at a very young age."

292
00:29:22,898 --> 00:29:23,599
Is that true?

293
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:27,000
Not now, not here,
not ever, Billy.

294
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,100
If I ask out Cynthia Paster,
will she say no?

295
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,901
Fuck.

296
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:48,603
Don't talk to me.
You scare the hell out of me.

297
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:51,904
I'm going up.

298
00:30:05,007 --> 00:30:06,507
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

299
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:10,405
I miss you, you know?

300
00:30:12,105 --> 00:30:13,907
Yeah, I miss you, too.

301
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:17,407
But my father,
he doesn't understand.

302
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:22,208
Look, when he gets over
this thing...

303
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:25,509
you and me,
we'll road trip to the city...

304
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:27,708
catch the Yanks.

305
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,913
We'll do that.

306
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,512
Cool.

307
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,509
I better go.

308
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,512
This thing Ms Lewton
showed me in class...

309
00:30:38,911 --> 00:30:40,911
they're going to let me read it.

310
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:43,411
It says what I'm feeling.

311
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:46,914
Take care, man.

312
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:58,914
Because of you,
I'm still alive.

313
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:03,015
Thank you.

314
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:14,019
We say that the hour of death
cannot be forecast.

315
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:18,517
But when we say this...

316
00:31:19,017 --> 00:31:20,619
we imagine
that the hour is placed...

317
00:31:21,218 --> 00:31:24,220
in an obscure
and distant future.

318
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,318
It never occurs to us
that it has any connection...

319
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,318
with the day already begun...

320
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:34,521
or that death could arrive
this same afternoon.

321
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:38,222
This afternoon
which is so certain...

322
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:44,122
and which has every hour
filled in advance.

323
00:37:28,683 --> 00:37:29,882
What happened?

324
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,182
Where's Tod?

325
00:37:38,685 --> 00:37:39,886
Get out of here.

326
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:56,588
- Didn't you see it?
- What happened?

327
00:37:57,188 --> 00:38:01,287
You caused Tod
so much guilt over George...

328
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:03,586
he took his own life.

329
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:09,689
He wouldn't do that.

330
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,490
He said we'd be friends again
after you got better.

331
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,992
Why would he make plans
if he was going to kill himself?

332
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:19,591
Mr. Waggner.

333
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:18,301
Almost autumn.

334
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:21,601
It's only the end of June.

335
00:39:24,002 --> 00:39:25,504
Yeah, but everything's
always in transition.

336
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:27,904
If you focus, even now,
just one week into summer...

337
00:39:28,505 --> 00:39:30,402
you can almost feel
autumn coming.

338
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,704
I like being able
to see the future.

339
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:36,704
Why were you at
Tod's house last night?

340
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:41,404
I've seen enough TV to know...

341
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:43,806
the FBI doesn't investigate
teen suicides.

342
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:46,306
They were there last night.
That means, one...

343
00:39:46,805 --> 00:39:48,005
they still don't have a clue
what caused the crash.

344
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:49,605
Two... they haven't
ruled out anything...

345
00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:51,606
and the fact seven people
got off the plane...

346
00:39:52,106 --> 00:39:53,107
is probably weird enough.

347
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:55,406
Not to mention, one of
those people had a vision...

348
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:57,708
of the plane exploding...

349
00:39:58,207 --> 00:40:01,009
minutes before it actually did
is highly suspicious.

350
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,108
And it doesn't help that
the visionary's friend...

351
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,010
just committed suicide.

352
00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:08,709
Why were you there last night?

353
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,511
You know what this is?

354
00:40:19,312 --> 00:40:20,812
This is a...

355
00:40:23,912 --> 00:40:25,811
This is Springy Head Guy.

356
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:31,414
It's you. Not a likeness.

357
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:34,914
It's how
you make me feel, Alex.

358
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:38,217
I'm sorry.

359
00:40:38,815 --> 00:40:40,514
No. Like you, the sculpture
doesn't even know...

360
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:42,913
what or why it is.

361
00:40:43,415 --> 00:40:45,315
It's reluctant to take form...

362
00:40:45,816 --> 00:40:47,617
and yet creating an absolute...

363
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:50,817
but incomprehensible
attraction.

364
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:54,217
In four years
of high school...

365
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:56,418
we haven't said
one word to each other.

366
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:59,617
At that moment, on the plane,
I felt what you felt.

367
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:02,418
I didn't even know where
those emotions came from...

368
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:04,921
until you started
freaking out.

369
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,520
I didn't see what you saw,
but I felt it.

370
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,323
You can still feel it,
can't you?

371
00:41:12,922 --> 00:41:16,123
Something from that day
is still with you.

372
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,923
I know because
I can still feel you.

373
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:25,821
That's why I was there
last night.

374
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:30,925
I've never dealt
with death before.

375
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:33,825
This could all be in our head.

376
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:37,624
It just feels like
it's all around us.

377
00:41:38,224 --> 00:41:39,525
It?

378
00:41:42,225 --> 00:41:44,727
What if Tod was just the first?

379
00:41:46,126 --> 00:41:47,026
Of us.

380
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:49,627
Is that something
that you're feeling?

381
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:52,327
I don't know.

382
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,027
I wish I could see him
one last time.

383
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,530
Maybe I would know.

384
00:41:59,128 --> 00:42:00,827
Then let's go see him.

385
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:32,635
Easy.

386
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:37,335
Gives me a rush.

387
00:42:39,435 --> 00:42:41,436
This place?

388
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:44,038
Doing something
I'm not supposed to.

389
00:42:47,537 --> 00:42:48,636
Come on.

390
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,438
Hurry up.

391
00:43:09,641 --> 00:43:12,043
- Is that him?
- I think.

392
00:43:12,741 --> 00:43:14,642
Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?

393
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:17,343
That's him.

394
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:21,641
Whatever it was that made him
Tod is definitely gone.

395
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,844
Holy Christ!

396
00:43:28,844 --> 00:43:30,045
Please.

397
00:43:31,644 --> 00:43:33,145
You'll wake the dead.

398
00:43:44,048 --> 00:43:45,147
Why'd his hand do that?

399
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:46,547
Chemicals.

400
00:43:47,147 --> 00:43:50,648
The vascular flush
creates cadaveric spasms.

401
00:43:51,348 --> 00:43:54,650
Look, I'm his friend...

402
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:56,650
I know who you are.

403
00:43:58,249 --> 00:43:59,748
What are all those tiny marks?

404
00:44:00,248 --> 00:44:03,449
Cuticle lacerations
from pulling at the wire.

405
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:05,750
Pulling at the wire?

406
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:08,551
If he was pulling at the wire,
he didn't kill himself.

407
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:09,951
It was an accident.

408
00:44:10,453 --> 00:44:13,052
In death,
there are no accidents...

409
00:44:13,553 --> 00:44:16,152
no coincidences, no mishaps...

410
00:44:16,652 --> 00:44:18,451
and no escapes.

411
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:23,554
What you have to realize
is we're all just a mouse...

412
00:44:24,153 --> 00:44:25,553
a cat has by the tail.

413
00:44:26,153 --> 00:44:28,455
Every single move we make...

414
00:44:28,954 --> 00:44:30,555
from the mundane
to the monumental...

415
00:44:31,156 --> 00:44:33,654
the red light
that we stop at or run...

416
00:44:34,156 --> 00:44:36,755
the people we have sex with
or won't with us...

417
00:44:37,457 --> 00:44:39,956
airplanes that we ride
or walk out of...

418
00:44:40,457 --> 00:44:43,256
it's all part of
death's sadistic design...

419
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:45,357
leading to the grave.

420
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:48,660
Design.

421
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,358
Does that mean if...

422
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,657
you figure out the design,
you can cheat death?

423
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:57,460
Alex, you've
already done that...

424
00:44:58,061 --> 00:44:59,559
by walking off the plane.

425
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:01,860
Your friend's departure...

426
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,362
shows that death has
a new design for all of you.

427
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:08,960
Now you have to figure out...

428
00:45:09,461 --> 00:45:13,063
how and when
it's coming back at you.

429
00:45:14,562 --> 00:45:15,462
Play your hunch...

430
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:18,563
if you think
you can get away with it.

431
00:45:19,064 --> 00:45:20,863
But remember...

432
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:23,965
the risk of cheating the plan...

433
00:45:24,565 --> 00:45:26,364
of disrespecting the design...

434
00:45:26,964 --> 00:45:31,767
could incite a fury to terrorize
even the Grim Reaper.

435
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:37,467
And you don't even want to
fuck with that Mack Daddy.

436
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:43,468
OK, then. Well...

437
00:45:43,969 --> 00:45:46,667
I'm sorry we broke in,
and...

438
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:50,069
No harm, no foul.

439
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:55,670
I'll see you soon.

440
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,971
The mortician said
that death has a design.

441
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,073
I'm talking about omens.

442
00:46:09,673 --> 00:46:11,672
How do we know,
that just by sitting here...

443
00:46:12,173 --> 00:46:14,472
by sipping this coffee
or breathing the air...

444
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,473
or even crossing
the intersection...

445
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,773
we haven't started in motion...

446
00:46:19,274 --> 00:46:20,873
the events that will
some day lead to our death...

447
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:23,774
forty years from now,
ten years, tomorrow?

448
00:46:25,476 --> 00:46:28,176
We don't,
unless we open ourselves up...

449
00:46:28,675 --> 00:46:31,375
to the signs
it's willing to show us.

450
00:46:35,078 --> 00:46:36,378
I don't understand.

451
00:46:36,779 --> 00:46:39,377
Did you see Tod die?

452
00:46:40,077 --> 00:46:42,378
Did it happen again,
like on the plane?

453
00:46:42,877 --> 00:46:45,678
No, it didn't,
but it might as well have.

454
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,479
This is a message
from something, Clear...

455
00:46:50,078 --> 00:46:52,680
or someone,
hinting at a design.

456
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,480
Total bullshit.

457
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:56,979
You can find death omens
anywhere you want to.

458
00:46:57,578 --> 00:47:00,180
Coffee starts with a "C"
and ends with an "E".

459
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,281
So does "choke."
We'll choke to death?

460
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:05,481
I want to hear you...

461
00:47:06,082 --> 00:47:08,081
but we'll go nuts
if you start with this shit.

462
00:47:08,781 --> 00:47:12,484
The mortician said
that death has a design, right?

463
00:47:12,883 --> 00:47:16,283
Now, what if
you, me, Tod, Carter...

464
00:47:16,983 --> 00:47:19,686
Terry, Billy, Mrs. Lewton
messed up that design?

465
00:47:20,185 --> 00:47:22,283
For whatever reason,
I saw death's plan...

466
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:24,684
and we cheated it.

467
00:47:25,184 --> 00:47:26,685
But what if it was our time?

468
00:47:27,287 --> 00:47:28,688
What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?

469
00:47:29,187 --> 00:47:31,986
What if it still is our time?

470
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:35,585
If it is,
then it's not finished...

471
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:39,687
and we will die.
Now, not later.

472
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:45,890
Unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.

473
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:58,090
After hearing you,
I do believe...

474
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:01,390
that Tod killed himself.

475
00:48:34,697 --> 00:48:36,097
Baby, come on, not now.

476
00:48:39,299 --> 00:48:40,699
Looks like we have
a reunion here.

477
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:41,999
Let it go.

478
00:48:42,399 --> 00:48:44,197
- When are you moving?
- Couple weeks.

479
00:48:44,698 --> 00:48:46,397
- That's too bad.
- Carter, you dick!

480
00:48:46,898 --> 00:48:48,499
Losing our favorite teacher.

481
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:51,601
Guys, there's something
I need to tell you.

482
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,300
Lived here your whole life,
and now she's gotta move...

483
00:48:56,002 --> 00:48:56,900
We're in danger!

484
00:48:57,402 --> 00:48:59,703
Enough! Both of you!

485
00:49:00,202 --> 00:49:01,802
They died, and we lived.

486
00:49:02,302 --> 00:49:03,602
Get over it.

487
00:49:04,102 --> 00:49:05,703
I will not let
this plane crash...

488
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,204
be the most important thing
in my life!

489
00:49:08,704 --> 00:49:09,803
God!

490
00:49:10,303 --> 00:49:12,402
I'm moving on, Carter...

491
00:49:12,904 --> 00:49:14,605
and if you want
to waste your life...

492
00:49:15,105 --> 00:49:18,304
beating the shit out of Alex
every time you see him...

493
00:49:18,803 --> 00:49:20,903
then you can just
drop fucking dead!

494
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:50,510
Is Alex there?

495
00:49:51,112 --> 00:49:53,211
Hi, Clear.
Yeah, just a minute.

496
00:49:54,511 --> 00:49:57,010
It's Clear again.
You want to talk to her?

497
00:50:01,411 --> 00:50:03,712
Clear, he's in the shower.

498
00:50:04,312 --> 00:50:05,314
Can I get him to call you back?

499
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:07,313
Sure. Bye.

500
00:50:08,315 --> 00:50:10,614
She's concerned about you.

501
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:12,514
I'm concerned about you.

502
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:14,314
Why won't you talk to her?

503
00:50:14,813 --> 00:50:16,814
Or to me?

504
00:50:19,915 --> 00:50:22,215
Dad, you and Mom have
both been a big help...

505
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:24,016
but there's something
I need to understand...

506
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:25,817
before I can talk.

507
00:50:26,217 --> 00:50:27,417
To anyone.

508
00:50:30,215 --> 00:50:31,615
The National
Transportation Safety Board...

509
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:34,717
has a new theory tonight
on the cause of the explosion...

510
00:50:35,217 --> 00:50:36,817
of Volee Air flight 180.

511
00:50:37,418 --> 00:50:39,619
Officials believe deterioration
of silicone insulation...

512
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:42,219
on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump...

513
00:50:42,817 --> 00:50:44,920
may have leaked
combustible fluids.

514
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:46,322
That's Tod's seat.

515
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:48,319
A spark beneath the coach cabin
in the fuselage...

516
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,921
may have ignited the fuel line,
proceeding to the fuel pump...

517
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:53,923
which would have set off
the catastrophic explosion.

518
00:51:25,525 --> 00:51:26,926
The path of the explosion.

519
00:51:27,526 --> 00:51:31,728
First was Tod,
then it was Terry.

520
00:51:32,328 --> 00:51:34,428
They're dying in the order
they would've died.

521
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:36,628
That's death's design.

522
00:51:37,229 --> 00:51:39,429
Ms Lewton's next.

523
00:51:42,328 --> 00:51:45,230
Whenever I can fall asleep,
I see Terry Chaney...

524
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:48,230
and in the day,
out of nowhere...

525
00:51:48,831 --> 00:51:50,230
I hear the sound of
my own voice in my head...

526
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,331
saying to Larry Murnau...

527
00:51:52,932 --> 00:51:54,332
"No. You know
the whole French thing.

528
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:55,834
"Get on the plane."

529
00:51:56,433 --> 00:51:58,834
Everything reminds me
of that day.

530
00:52:00,932 --> 00:52:03,233
Right. Yeah.

531
00:52:03,733 --> 00:52:04,634
I'm hoping a change will help.

532
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:07,034
It's just that...

533
00:52:07,534 --> 00:52:10,436
I lived here
my whole life, you know?

534
00:52:11,035 --> 00:52:12,736
And everywhere I looked
were great memories.

535
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:18,835
And now all I see
is Larry and those kids.

536
00:52:19,535 --> 00:52:22,536
Just looking out
my own front yard...

537
00:52:23,136 --> 00:52:25,037
makes me feel nothing but fear.

538
00:52:31,638 --> 00:52:33,938
Laura, I'm going to have
to call you back.

539
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:35,739
Right.

540
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,241
This is Valerie Lewton.
I need Agent Schreck.

541
00:53:13,743 --> 00:53:14,645
What are you doing here?

542
00:53:15,046 --> 00:53:17,546
I was just...

543
00:53:18,147 --> 00:53:20,646
checking the air in the tire
to make sure it's safe.

544
00:53:22,044 --> 00:53:23,244
Get in the car.

545
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:37,049
Put on your seat belt.

546
00:53:59,755 --> 00:54:01,954
I believe that...

547
00:54:03,453 --> 00:54:05,353
that Ms Lewton is next.

548
00:54:06,353 --> 00:54:07,553
Next?

549
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,055
Yeah, next, because...

550
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:14,055
there's this pattern
that's occurring.

551
00:54:14,555 --> 00:54:15,955
Right. A pattern.

552
00:54:16,556 --> 00:54:17,956
You noticed that, too?

553
00:54:34,659 --> 00:54:35,860
Mom's favorite.

554
00:54:58,863 --> 00:55:00,363
So what about this pattern?

555
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:02,564
Did you see it
in one of your visions?

556
00:55:03,163 --> 00:55:05,366
Did you catch it
in some TV static?

557
00:55:08,265 --> 00:55:10,865
I never asked for
what happened on the plane.

558
00:55:11,466 --> 00:55:14,066
You guys are going to
sit there and make fun of me.

559
00:55:14,567 --> 00:55:15,266
Whatever. It's fine.

560
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:18,667
But I saved six lives
on that plane.

561
00:55:19,266 --> 00:55:21,168
Six lives, and everybody
in my entire school...

562
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:22,468
thinks I'm a freak.

563
00:55:22,967 --> 00:55:26,569
I'm not suffering
from post-traumatic stress.

564
00:55:27,169 --> 00:55:29,972
I don't have
a narcissistic deity complex.

565
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:33,370
I'm not going Dahmer
on you guys.

566
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,669
This just is.

567
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:38,472
There is a pattern for us all.

568
00:55:39,071 --> 00:55:40,872
There is a pattern for you.

569
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,572
There is a design for everyone,
and I don't know how yet...

570
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,671
but I'm going to break
this one.

571
00:57:07,187 --> 00:57:08,685
You came to our attention...

572
00:57:09,087 --> 00:57:11,287
because you were under suspicion
in this plane explosion.

573
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:13,686
Now...

574
00:57:14,187 --> 00:57:15,587
I know you didn't
blow up the plane.

575
00:57:16,088 --> 00:57:18,490
We were ready to move on...

576
00:57:18,989 --> 00:57:20,788
but then the other survivors
started to die.

577
00:57:21,289 --> 00:57:22,688
First, your friend Tod...

578
00:57:23,187 --> 00:57:25,389
then Terry Chaney,
while you were at the scene.

579
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:27,790
And tonight, we pick you up
at Val Lewton's house.

580
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:30,590
Nobody has control
over life and death...

581
00:57:31,189 --> 00:57:34,291
unless they are taking lives
and causing death.

582
00:57:34,893 --> 00:57:37,092
Can you promise me
no one else is going to die?

583
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:39,490
No, I can't.

584
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,589
As long as I'm in here,
it's out of my control.

585
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:43,193
I'm sorry.

586
00:57:51,091 --> 00:57:53,294
Go ahead.
Get out of here.

587
00:57:54,493 --> 00:57:55,595
Thank you.

588
00:58:04,297 --> 00:58:05,996
That kid gives me the creeps.

589
00:58:06,495 --> 00:58:08,196
What do we do?
We got nothing.

590
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:10,198
That's not
what I'm talking about.

591
00:58:10,698 --> 00:58:12,798
There were
a couple of moments...

592
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:16,497
where I almost believed him.

593
00:58:18,197 --> 00:58:19,998
Don't take this
the wrong way...

594
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,799
but sometimes
you give me the creeps.

595
00:58:40,302 --> 00:58:42,502
You've got to stop this.
It's a stupid mug.

596
00:58:43,002 --> 00:58:44,201
You're out of here.

597
00:58:44,702 --> 00:58:45,902
Pretty soon you'll be gone.

598
00:58:46,402 --> 00:58:47,502
You'll be gone.

599
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:17,628
All right,
just stay still, OK?

600
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,731
Oh, God, Ms Lewton.

601
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:06,836
Dude.

602
01:02:09,436 --> 01:02:10,939
I don't know where he is.

603
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:12,739
He's not talking to me.

604
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,039
Why?

605
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:16,338
Because I didn't believe him.

606
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:18,639
If he does contact you,
I think it would be...

607
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:21,340
in the best interest of
your safety if you called us.

608
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:24,240
Now, here's my card.

609
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:26,240
Toll-free number.

610
01:02:30,642 --> 01:02:32,041
Interesting work.

611
01:02:43,544 --> 01:02:44,744
Carter, you dick!

612
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:03,546
What are you doing?

613
01:03:06,448 --> 01:03:08,148
Terry should be on this wall.

614
01:03:10,749 --> 01:03:12,248
Shit.

615
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:14,950
Why'd you want us
to meet you here?

616
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:19,250
They're watching me
to see if I go to Alex.

617
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:21,550
That's why you're taking me.

618
01:03:22,052 --> 01:03:23,251
Why would I want to see him?

619
01:03:24,752 --> 01:03:27,051
Because he knows
which one of us is next.

620
01:03:40,853 --> 01:03:43,654
Drive the speed limit, OK?

621
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:46,655
And don't pass on the right.

622
01:03:47,255 --> 01:03:49,556
Billy, wait a minute.
I'm getting a vision.

623
01:03:51,657 --> 01:03:52,757
You're the next one, man.

624
01:03:53,257 --> 01:03:54,555
Man, why'd you say that?

625
01:03:55,055 --> 01:03:57,656
Because if you say another word,
I'll fucking kill you.

626
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,761
He could be anywhere from here
to a mile down the road...

627
01:04:21,261 --> 01:04:23,762
so you guys start that way
and meet back in the middle.

628
01:04:24,462 --> 01:04:26,162
It'll take half the time.

629
01:04:57,168 --> 01:04:58,466
Do you think
they're still up there?

630
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:04,069
Somehow, flight 180,
are they still in flight?

631
01:05:04,669 --> 01:05:07,769
Somewhere... are they safe?

632
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:14,669
When I was a kid,
like six or seven...

633
01:05:15,169 --> 01:05:17,371
I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

634
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:20,272
Lying awake at night,
just worrying.

635
01:05:20,771 --> 01:05:22,771
Most kids do, I guess.

636
01:05:23,271 --> 01:05:25,970
Most kids never have it happen.

637
01:05:30,973 --> 01:05:31,772
When I was ten...

638
01:05:32,373 --> 01:05:34,373
my dad went into a 7-Eleven
for cigarettes.

639
01:05:34,873 --> 01:05:36,975
He heard someone say,
"Don't turn around."

640
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:40,873
On reflex, or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.

641
01:05:42,374 --> 01:05:43,874
A guy blew his head off.

642
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:47,276
Life became shit after that.

643
01:05:48,376 --> 01:05:50,375
My mom couldn't deal anymore.

644
01:05:51,875 --> 01:05:54,377
She married this asshole
who my mom with my real dad...

645
01:05:54,977 --> 01:05:57,078
would have crossed the street
to avoid this guy.

646
01:05:58,478 --> 01:05:59,477
He didn't really want a kid...

647
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:02,178
so my mom didn't, either,
anymore.

648
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:07,879
If that was the design
for my father and family...

649
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:10,380
then fuck death!

650
01:06:11,581 --> 01:06:15,583
God, I have thought a lot
about that somewhere.

651
01:06:16,082 --> 01:06:17,480
It exists, that place...

652
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,379
where my dad is safe.

653
01:06:19,882 --> 01:06:23,183
Where he had a full pack of
cigarettes and kept driving.

654
01:06:24,483 --> 01:06:26,381
Where me and my mom and my dad
are still together...

655
01:06:27,081 --> 01:06:29,483
and have no idea
about this life here.

656
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:35,281
Where our friends
are still in the sky.

657
01:06:35,782 --> 01:06:38,984
Where everyone
gets a second chance.

658
01:06:40,384 --> 01:06:42,686
Alex, we can't give up.

659
01:06:47,687 --> 01:06:50,087
I can't go home,
because after Mrs. Lewton...

660
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:51,586
they're looking for me.

661
01:06:52,087 --> 01:06:53,787
We're taking you
to my dad's cabin.

662
01:06:54,387 --> 01:06:55,488
It's a couple of miles
from my house.

663
01:06:55,987 --> 01:06:58,788
Browning,
you fucking warlock...

664
01:06:59,388 --> 01:07:00,388
did you hear about
Ms Lewton or what?

665
01:07:00,887 --> 01:07:02,689
Why do you think I was hiding?

666
01:07:03,288 --> 01:07:06,490
Billy told the FBI he saw you
running from her house.

667
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,190
I was running 'cause
they blame me for everything.

668
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,989
They blame me
for Tod, for her...

669
01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:11,489
for the fucking plane crash.

670
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:14,290
The fire caramelized her blood.

671
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:17,590
Your shoe prints were in it,
your fingerprints on the knives.

672
01:07:18,192 --> 01:07:18,992
I told you they were not...

673
01:07:19,492 --> 01:07:20,992
I'm not talking about
if you did it.

674
01:07:21,592 --> 01:07:23,893
Or even if
you knew she was dead.

675
01:07:24,494 --> 01:07:27,194
Did you know she was going
to be next before she was?

676
01:07:34,194 --> 01:07:35,495
Yeah, I did.

677
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:37,995
I knew.

678
01:07:38,594 --> 01:07:41,695
All right, out of us...

679
01:07:42,396 --> 01:07:43,496
who's next to see it?

680
01:07:43,997 --> 01:07:45,296
Please...

681
01:07:45,796 --> 01:07:47,596
tell me I'm going to see
the Jets win a Super Bowl.

682
01:07:48,096 --> 01:07:51,298
It's me, right?
That's why you're not saying.

683
01:07:53,698 --> 01:07:56,598
I should have felt up
Tammy in the pool that time.

684
01:07:57,297 --> 01:07:58,298
What are you whining about?
I'm next!

685
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,400
He didn't say anything.
Just drive.

686
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,299
You have a responsibility
to tell me.

687
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,398
Think it's easier to know?

688
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,400
It's not.
It's fucking harder.

689
01:08:12,002 --> 01:08:14,701
You get off
having control over me?

690
01:08:15,201 --> 01:08:16,301
Let me decide
how to deal with it.

691
01:08:16,803 --> 01:08:19,102
It doesn't matter who's next...

692
01:08:19,702 --> 01:08:22,000
'cause we're
all on the same list.

693
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:25,604
Fuck.

694
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:27,203
Really?

695
01:08:34,304 --> 01:08:35,305
Then why bother?

696
01:08:35,805 --> 01:08:36,805
What's the fucking point?

697
01:08:37,305 --> 01:08:38,905
Me and Terry'll be back
together on the other side...

698
01:08:39,305 --> 01:08:40,506
so why wait any longer?

699
01:08:42,307 --> 01:08:44,107
What are you doing?

700
01:08:46,407 --> 01:08:47,707
Carter, slow down.

701
01:08:48,206 --> 01:08:50,207
- Slow down, Carter!
- Fuck you!

702
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:53,510
Knock it off!

703
01:08:54,008 --> 01:08:55,509
May as well go out
on my own free will!

704
01:08:56,009 --> 01:08:57,508
Not with us
in the fucking car!

705
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:06,209
Jesus, Carter!

706
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:08,311
Carter, stop the car!

707
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:10,612
What's the fucking worry
if it ain't your time?

708
01:09:11,011 --> 01:09:12,511
I can get nailed
running this next red light.

709
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:13,912
You all wouldn't get shit.

710
01:09:14,311 --> 01:09:15,611
It doesn't work that way!

711
01:09:25,114 --> 01:09:27,412
I fucking hated French class!

712
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,514
- Get control of yourself.
- That's what I'm doing!

713
01:09:31,015 --> 01:09:33,315
I know what you're doing,
and it's all right to be scared.

714
01:09:33,914 --> 01:09:35,815
I'm not afraid.
I decide when it's time.

715
01:09:36,315 --> 01:09:38,916
I control my life.
I control my death.

716
01:09:39,416 --> 01:09:41,417
You don't have to prove
how big your balls are!

717
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:47,218
Stop driving
like such an asshole.

718
01:09:47,818 --> 01:09:49,019
What are you doing?

719
01:09:50,818 --> 01:09:52,017
Jesus Christ!

720
01:09:52,618 --> 01:09:54,218
Put your hands
back on the wheel!

721
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,319
- Carter, stop!
- Back on the wheel!

722
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,018
Shit.

723
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:03,821
Carter, easy.

724
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,921
I am so close to puking
right now.

725
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,819
We're afraid, too,
but we're not quitting.

726
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:14,422
Stop it and stop
this fucking car!

727
01:10:15,822 --> 01:10:18,622
Damn it, I want you
to stop this car right now!

728
01:10:38,827 --> 01:10:39,827
- Move it.
- Open the door, Billy.

729
01:10:40,427 --> 01:10:41,728
Move the fucking car!

730
01:10:42,128 --> 01:10:45,027
- Open the fucking door.
- Move the car.

731
01:10:46,426 --> 01:10:49,428
- Can't you open the door?
- Open the fucking door.

732
01:10:51,129 --> 01:10:53,028
- Open it!
- Billy, open the door!

733
01:10:57,931 --> 01:11:00,930
Carter, listen to me.
Don't do this.

734
01:11:05,429 --> 01:11:08,431
God damn it!
Get out of the fucking car!

735
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:11,432
Carter, listen to me!

736
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:12,932
This isn't the way!

737
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:15,031
It's not the way!
Get out of the car!

738
01:11:15,432 --> 01:11:16,832
It's coming!

739
01:11:22,232 --> 01:11:23,334
It ain't my time.

740
01:11:34,536 --> 01:11:35,338
Shit.

741
01:11:35,837 --> 01:11:37,338
Listen to me!
This isn't the way.

742
01:11:37,735 --> 01:11:39,037
Get out of the car!

743
01:11:42,037 --> 01:11:44,637
Come on! Get out!

744
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:53,440
I can't get out!

745
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:06,840
Man, he really is next.

746
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,842
Get out!

747
01:12:11,343 --> 01:12:12,543
Fuck!

748
01:12:32,345 --> 01:12:33,445
Oh, God!

749
01:12:35,345 --> 01:12:36,946
I saw it! I saw the belt!

750
01:12:37,446 --> 01:12:38,147
You scared now?

751
01:12:38,746 --> 01:12:39,747
It broke!

752
01:12:40,146 --> 01:12:41,347
Bullshit!

753
01:12:41,847 --> 01:12:42,647
He saved your life again.

754
01:12:43,048 --> 01:12:44,148
That's right!

755
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,750
You're next, Carter!

756
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,049
I'm staying the fuck
away from you!

757
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:50,648
- Shut up, Billy!
- We don't need this shit now.

758
01:12:51,146 --> 01:12:52,548
I don't need it ever!

759
01:12:52,948 --> 01:12:54,050
Get away from him! He's next!

760
01:12:54,548 --> 01:12:55,749
Fuck you, Billy!
I'm not dead!

761
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:57,650
You will be.

762
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,951
You're dead...

763
01:13:01,349 --> 01:13:02,551
and you ain't taking me
with you!

764
01:13:06,951 --> 01:13:09,152
- God, no!
- Oh, shit!

765
01:13:18,453 --> 01:13:20,154
Jesus fucking Christ!

766
01:13:21,956 --> 01:13:22,756
You should have been next.

767
01:13:23,356 --> 01:13:25,456
You were after Lewton.
That's the plan!

768
01:13:25,955 --> 01:13:27,853
That's the design!
You should be fucking dead!

769
01:13:28,355 --> 01:13:29,054
You're the devil!

770
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:31,756
I saw the seat belt.
I knew it would rip!

771
01:13:32,257 --> 01:13:33,756
That's how I saved him.

772
01:13:34,257 --> 01:13:35,556
Just like the explosion.
I saw it!

773
01:13:36,056 --> 01:13:37,857
- The police are coming.
- Fuck! I saved him!

774
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:39,858
Because I saved him,
it skipped Carter...

775
01:13:40,356 --> 01:13:42,657
and went to the next person
in the path of the explosion!

776
01:13:43,256 --> 01:13:44,556
I have to see it.

777
01:13:45,158 --> 01:13:46,057
Then I intervene...

778
01:13:46,657 --> 01:13:48,558
and if I intervene,
I cheat the design.

779
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:51,059
Intervene? Are you God now?

780
01:13:51,659 --> 01:13:53,460
God's not afraid to die.

781
01:13:54,059 --> 01:13:55,758
Gods don't die! We do!

782
01:13:56,261 --> 01:13:59,062
Baby, you are losing it.
The police will be here.

783
01:13:59,562 --> 01:14:00,961
We have to get you
back to my cabin.

784
01:14:01,461 --> 01:14:02,961
You can hide out
and get your head together.

785
01:14:03,462 --> 01:14:05,163
After Billy, I'm next.

786
01:14:05,663 --> 01:14:06,764
I'm next.

787
01:14:08,362 --> 01:14:09,163
Then me.

788
01:14:09,561 --> 01:14:12,262
Listen, I'm not going
to let it happen.

789
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,761
Listen to me.

790
01:14:14,264 --> 01:14:17,266
Why don't you two
get the fuck out of here?

791
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:14,195
Rusted.

792
01:17:14,694 --> 01:17:15,895
Tetanus.

793
01:17:17,692 --> 01:17:18,793
Nice one.

794
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:21,795
I overlooked it.

795
01:17:24,196 --> 01:17:26,797
You tried to capitalize,
but I caught you.

796
01:17:27,298 --> 01:17:28,496
You fuck!

797
01:17:29,996 --> 01:17:31,197
I can beat you.

798
01:17:32,798 --> 01:17:34,098
Maybe not forever...

799
01:17:34,598 --> 01:17:37,298
but I got this cabin
rigged to beat you now!

800
01:18:29,907 --> 01:18:31,206
She was there a minute ago.

801
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:33,209
What are you talking about?

802
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,608
I'm not turning him in.

803
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:38,509
It's too dangerous for him
out there alone.

804
01:18:41,309 --> 01:18:42,611
I go with you.

805
01:18:43,612 --> 01:18:44,811
You can't.

806
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:49,209
Just tell us where he is.

807
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:51,110
Wait at home.
I give you my word...

808
01:18:51,612 --> 01:18:54,211
we will bring him in safely
in protective custody.

809
01:19:25,217 --> 01:19:26,318
I never moved.

810
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:30,218
Christa asked me to change,
but I never moved.

811
01:19:30,717 --> 01:19:32,818
I would have been up
next to Tod.

812
01:19:34,419 --> 01:19:36,020
Fuck!
Why didn't I remember that?

813
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,720
I never moved. Clear's seat
was in front of mine.

814
01:19:55,723 --> 01:19:57,025
She's next.

815
01:20:41,631 --> 01:20:43,730
Get in the car!
We're going around!

816
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:54,242
- There!
- Come on, let's go!

817
01:22:00,644 --> 01:22:02,444
Alex, we're trying to help you.

818
01:22:05,344 --> 01:22:07,245
Prince! Get away from it!

819
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:21,148
Hold on!

820
01:22:52,353 --> 01:22:53,455
Run!

821
01:23:39,662 --> 01:23:40,562
We lost him.

822
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:43,160
From the direction, there's only
one place he's heading.

823
01:23:43,761 --> 01:23:45,161
No shit.

824
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:35,882
Oh, my God!

825
01:25:41,782 --> 01:25:43,183
Don't move! Stay there!

826
01:25:45,482 --> 01:25:46,683
Don't move!

827
01:25:47,084 --> 01:25:49,983
Don't touch anything.
You're grounded by the tires.

828
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:21,289
The car's going to explode!

829
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:28,391
I can only hold on for so long.
You know what to do.

830
01:26:29,092 --> 01:26:30,191
Don't!

831
01:26:30,591 --> 01:26:32,691
When I do this, it'll skip you,
and it'll all be over.

832
01:26:33,191 --> 01:26:34,691
It's the only way
we can cheat death again.

833
01:26:35,293 --> 01:26:36,392
Don't!

834
01:26:36,994 --> 01:26:38,793
I am not going to let it
beat us both.

835
01:26:39,392 --> 01:26:40,591
You know what to do!

836
01:26:42,892 --> 01:26:44,693
I'll always be with you.

837
01:26:48,894 --> 01:26:49,993
Don't!

838
01:26:55,494 --> 01:26:57,096
Get away from there!

839
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,199
Damn it!
You can't do this to me.

840
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:28,100
Come on, baby. Come on.

841
01:27:32,601 --> 01:27:34,202
Shit, he's not breathing.

842
01:27:34,702 --> 01:27:36,503
Hold on, Alex. Come on.
Stay with me.

843
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:14,709
Well, we made it.

844
01:28:15,309 --> 01:28:17,010
Paris.
I can't believe it.

845
01:28:17,609 --> 01:28:19,310
I can't believe
we got on a plane again.

846
01:28:19,609 --> 01:28:20,809
Know what I'm saying?

847
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:51,616
It's weird being here, huh?

848
01:28:52,216 --> 01:28:53,514
We finally completed a puzzle.

849
01:28:56,015 --> 01:28:57,416
It's just
there's something missing.

850
01:28:57,816 --> 01:28:58,917
You know?

851
01:29:02,316 --> 01:29:03,416
To Terry.

852
01:29:04,016 --> 01:29:04,715
And to Tod.

853
01:29:05,216 --> 01:29:06,415
To all of our friends
that can't be here.

854
01:29:06,919 --> 01:29:08,118
Cheers.

855
01:29:12,117 --> 01:29:13,218
What?

856
01:29:14,419 --> 01:29:15,720
If you would've told me
six months ago...

857
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,520
the three of us would be
sitting here having a drink...

858
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,621
I don't know.
Sometimes it feels like...

859
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:25,523
you two are the only ones
who understand.

860
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:31,320
You were right, Browning.

861
01:29:31,822 --> 01:29:33,221
It did skip us.
There was a design.

862
01:29:34,923 --> 01:29:36,822
We beat it. We won.

863
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:41,124
The only thing we won
is a chance at a full life.

864
01:29:42,425 --> 01:29:44,424
A chance
that I won't ever waste.

865
01:29:47,222 --> 01:29:50,024
There's just something
I can't figure out.

866
01:29:50,624 --> 01:29:52,925
- About what?
- The design.

867
01:29:53,526 --> 01:29:55,527
Just let it go, all right?

868
01:29:56,126 --> 01:29:58,526
Hear me out, all right?

869
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,227
- Oh, my God.
- Just listen.

870
01:30:02,826 --> 01:30:05,927
The explosion path determined
the order of our deaths.

871
01:30:06,528 --> 01:30:09,230
When I intervened
and saved Carter...

872
01:30:09,729 --> 01:30:12,929
it skipped him and went
to the next person... Billy.

873
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:14,429
Then it was Clear.

874
01:30:14,929 --> 01:30:16,429
But I intervened and saved her,
so it went to me.

875
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:20,531
But in my case,
no one intervened, right?

876
01:30:21,733 --> 01:30:22,930
I was thrown
from that power line...

877
01:30:23,431 --> 01:30:24,730
by the explosion, so...

878
01:30:25,329 --> 01:30:27,031
So why did it skip you?

879
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:29,731
How do we know this isn't
what was meant to happen?

880
01:30:30,432 --> 01:30:32,233
That out of everyone
on flight 180...

881
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,932
you, me, and Carter
were meant to live?

882
01:30:36,134 --> 01:30:38,034
Maybe that was
the design all along.

883
01:30:38,535 --> 01:30:41,933
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.

884
01:30:43,233 --> 01:30:44,534
I didn't make up the rules.

885
01:30:45,034 --> 01:30:46,936
Somebody's got to intervene
before death can skip them.

886
01:30:47,537 --> 01:30:50,135
Alex proved that three times
with the plane, me, and you.

887
01:30:50,836 --> 01:30:52,335
For all I know,
it could circle back...

888
01:30:52,835 --> 01:30:53,936
and get us all again.

889
01:30:54,535 --> 01:30:56,938
But I am the safest fucker
in the world...

890
01:30:57,536 --> 01:30:59,737
because you're still next.

891
01:31:04,839 --> 01:31:06,639
Can we just stop talking
about this?

892
01:31:07,137 --> 01:31:08,539
Let's figure out...

893
01:31:24,041 --> 01:31:26,241
I'll meet you back
at the hotel.

894
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:27,641
I'll go with you.

895
01:31:28,141 --> 01:31:31,543
No, just stay here,
OK, Clear?

896
01:31:32,143 --> 01:31:32,842
All right?

897
01:31:33,343 --> 01:31:35,542
See? It's true.
I told you you were next, man.

898
01:31:36,041 --> 01:31:38,342
Stop it, Carter.
Alex, wait.

899
01:31:38,844 --> 01:31:40,844
Clear, stay there, OK?

900
01:31:41,444 --> 01:31:42,543
Stay away.

901
01:32:14,851 --> 01:32:17,951
- I told you you were next!
- It skipped me.

902
01:32:18,551 --> 01:32:19,951
So who's next?
