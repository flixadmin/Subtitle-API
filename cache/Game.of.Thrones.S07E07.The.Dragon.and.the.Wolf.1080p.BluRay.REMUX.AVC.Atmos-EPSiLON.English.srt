Maybe it really is
all cocks in the end.

You came pretty close.

71

I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick.

Perhaps you've been reconsidering
your allegiances.

Remember my offer.
Whatever they're paying you,

88
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,672
I'll pay double.

89
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:51,383
And that would be
double what now exactly?

90
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,969
Don't you worry about me.
I'm doing all right.

91
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,263
- Looking after myself.
- Are you?

00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,639
Helping me to arrange this meeting

93
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:00,267
wasn't exactly
looking after yourself, was it?

94
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,977
You put yourself at risk.

95
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,312
I put yourself at risk.

00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,980

offered a bag of gold for,

98

it's not mine.

99

Now, thanks to me,
she's got two traitors' heads

100
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,363
coming right through her door.

101
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,698
She can lop them both off

102
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,617
as soon as she gets tired
of the clever words

103
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,160
that pour out their pieholes.

104

All thanks to
Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater.

I don't know what is.

Am I gonna die in this shit city?

113

You might.

114
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,165
And this is all your idea?

115
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,128
Seems every bad idea
has some Lannister cunt behind it.

And some Clegane cunt
to help them see it through.

I have your sister.

If you don't submit to me
here and now,

You're the smallest concern here.

Do you remember
when we discussed dwarf jokes?

has shown.

We have suffered
at each other's hands.

there would be no need
for this gathering.

we should settle our differences

and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

living in harmony.

00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,641
A general you can't negotiate with,

164
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,395
an army that doesn't leave corpses
behind on the battlefield.

165
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,439
Lord Tyrion tells me
a million people live in this city.

166
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,443
They're about to become a million more
soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

167
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,154
I imagine for most of them,
it would be an improvement.

168
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,035
This is serious.

169
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,746
I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

170
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,083
I don't think it's serious at all.
I think it's another bad joke.

171
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,711
If my brother, Jaime,
has informed me correctly,

172
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,337
you're asking me for a truce.

173
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,965
Yes. That's all.

174
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:54,968
That's all?

175
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,723
Pull back my armies and stand down
while you go on your monster hunt?

176
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,434
Or while you solidify
and expand your position?

177
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,937
Hard for me to know which it is
with my armies pulled back.

178
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,442
Until you return and march
on my capital with four times the men.

179
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:14,779
Your capital will be safe until
the Northern threat is dealt with.

180
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,365
You have my word.

181
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,451
The word of a would-be usurper.

182
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:24,581
There is no conversation
that will erase the last 50 years.

183
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,834
We have something to show you.

(CONTINUES SCREECHING)

186
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,930
We can destroy them by burning them.

(CONTINUES SCREECHING)

188
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:58,902
And we can destroy them
with dragonglass.

189
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,572
If we don't win this fight,

190
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,618
then that is the fate of every person
in the world.

There is only one war that matters.

193
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,390
The Great War.

194
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,434
And it is here.

195
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,774
DAENERYS: I didn't believe it
until I saw them.

196
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:41,444
I saw them all.

197
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,783
- How many?
- Hundred thousand at least.

198
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:04,926
Can they swim?

199
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,053
No.

200
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:08,638
Good.

201
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,017
I'm taking the Iron Fleet
back to the Iron Islands.

202
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,103
What are you talking about?

203
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:18,314
I've been around the world.
I've seen everything.

Things you couldn't imagine.
And this...

205

This is the only thing I've ever seen
that terrifies me.

206
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,832
I'm going back to my island.

207
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,875
You should go back to yours.

208
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:42,589
When winter's over,
we'll be the only ones left alive.

CERSEI: He's right to be afraid.

210

And a coward to run.

211
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,899
If those things come for us,
there'll be no kingdoms to rule.

Everything we suffered
will have been for nothing.

would have been for nothing.

In return, the King in the North

He will remain in the North
where he belongs.

against the Lannisters,

he will not choose sides.

- Not me?
- (CERSEI SCOFFS)

224
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,692
I would never ask it of you.

225
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,319
You would never agree to it,

226
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,863
and if you did, I would trust you
even less than I do now.

227
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,076
I ask it only of Ned Stark's son.

228
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:56,579
I know Ned Stark's son
will be true to his word.

229
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:15,098
I am true to my word, or I try to be.

230
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,978
That is why I cannot give you
what you ask.

231
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,066
I cannot serve two queens.

232
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:32,657
And I've already pledged myself
to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

233
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,712
Then there is nothing left to discuss.

237
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,729
It's been good to see you.

238
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,939
I imagine the next time will be
across a battlefield.

239
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,691
We both saw what just happened.

240
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,110
- We both saw that thing.
- Yes.

And I'm not looking forward
to seeing more of them.

242

But I'm loyal to the queen,

243
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,907
and you're loyal to Sansa
and her dolt brother.

Oh, fuck loyalty.

00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,327
Fuck loyalty?

and oaths.

- Talk to the queen.

I'm grateful for your loyalty,

but my dragon died
so that we could be here.

252

If it's all for nothing,

253
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,493
then he died for nothing.

254
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,203

TYRION: I'm pleased
you bent the knee to our queen.

256
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,333
I would have advised it had you asked.

257
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,461
But have you ever considered
learning how to lie

258
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:10,630
every now and then? Just a bit?

259
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,926
I'm not gonna swear an oath
I can't uphold.

260
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,137
Talk about my father if you want.

261
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:20,515
Tell me that's the attitude
that got him killed.

262
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,101
But when enough people
make false promises,

263
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:25,978
words stop meaning anything.

264
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:30,566
Then there are no more answers,
only better and better lies.

265
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,110
And lies won't help us in this fight.

266
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,363
TYRION: That is indeed a problem.

267
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:38,908
The more immediate problem
is that we're fucked.

268
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,496
Any ideas as to how we might change
that state of affairs?

269
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,165
Only one.

270
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:48,000
Everyone stays here.

271
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,711
And I go and talk to my sister.

272
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:55,925
I didn't come all this way
to have my Hand murdered.

273
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,802
I don't want Cersei
to murder me, either.

274
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,638
I could have stayed in my cell
and saved a great deal of trouble.

275
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,933
I did this. I should go.

276
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,226
She'll definitely murder you.

277
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,896
I go see my sister alone.

278
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,401
Or we all go home
and we're right back where we started.

279
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,297
You spoke with her?

280
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,674
At her, until she kicked me out.

281
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,678
She thinks I was an idiot
to trust you.

282
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,764
A lot of people
seem to think that, actually.

283
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:28,309
I'm about to step into a room with
the most murderous woman in the world

284
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:32,271
who's already tried to kill me twice,
that I know of.

285
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:34,023
Who's an idiot?

286
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:41,238
I suppose we should say goodbye,
one idiot to another.

287
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,843
I shouldn't be surprised.
I suppose she's your kind of woman.

288
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,387
A foreign whore
who doesn't know her place.

289
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,932
A foreign whore you can't abduct,
beat or intimidate.

290
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,059
That must be difficult for you.

291
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:53,644
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner

292
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:55,354
whom you've convinced
to bow down before her.

293
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:56,439
I didn't know about that.

294
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,482
And now you've got both working
towards the same goal.

295
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,568
The goal you've worked towards
your entire life.

296
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:03,612
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- The destruction of this family.

297
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:06,157
I am the one
preventing that from happening.

298
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,410
Daenerys didn't want to debate
and negotiate.

299
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,870
She didn't want to bring you words.

300
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:14,957
She wanted to bring you fire and blood
until I advised her otherwise.

301
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,668
I don't want to destroy our family.
I never have.

302
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,254
You killed our father.

303
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,215
After he sentenced me to death
for a crime I didn't commit.

304
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,341
Yes, I killed him.

305
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,135
Hate me for it if you want.

306
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,512
I hate myself for it
in spite of what he was.

307
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,681
In spite of what he did to me.

308
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,683
Oh, poor little man.

309
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,435
Your papa was mean to you.

310
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:38,230
Do you have any idea what you did
when you fired that crossbow?

311
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:40,399
You left us open.

312
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:41,776
You laid us bare for the vultures,

313
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,403
and the vultures came
and tore us apart.

314
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,031
You may not have killed Joffrey,

315
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,949
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

316
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:50,868
No one would have touched them
if Father was here.

317
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:51,952
No one would have dared...

318
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:53,496
I've never been more sorry

I will not hear it. Not from you.

I will not hear it!

All right.

You love your family,
and I have destroyed it.

So put an end to me.

If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

327

If it weren't for me,
you'd have two beautiful children.

It cost us our future.

If there's no future,
then why are we here?

Why did you allow me to come?

Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

Yes, Snow. Not what you hoped for,

but you must have hoped for something.

346

What did you hope for?

To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?

- Yes.
- Why?

351
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,162
Because I think she will
make the world a better place.

352
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:42,039
You said she'd destroy King's Landing.

353
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,876
She knows herself.

354
00:34:46,377 --> 00:34:49,421
She chose an advisor who would
check her worst impulses

355

instead of feeding them.

That's the difference between you.

I don't care about
checking my worst impulses.

I know what it is,
I know what it means.

362
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,856
And when it came at me,
I didn't think about the world.

363
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,025
Not at all.

364

As soon as it opened its mouth,
the world disappeared for me

right down its black throat.

366
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,241
All I could think about
was keeping those gnashing teeth

away from the ones who matter most.

Away from my family.

had the right idea.

Extraordinary.

They filled people with wonder and awe
and we locked them in here.

They wasted away.

she might not have been

"How well does that reason explain
what they say and what they do?"

So, tell me.
What's the worst thing she could want?

She could want me dead.

460
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:33,093
Because she thinks
I wronged my family.

461

Why did she come to Winterfell?

To kill me.

463
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:45,230
For marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

464
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,941
Why did she unearth the letter
Cersei made you write?

To provide proof of my betrayals.

To provide justification
after she murders me.

And after she murders you,
what does she become?

But if we're going to be
allies in this war,

484
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,858
it's important for the Northerners
to see us as allies.

485
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:17,739
If we sail to White Harbor together,
I think it sends a better message.

486
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,123
I've not come to conquer the North.

487
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,543
I'm coming to save the North.

488

We sail together.

489

Jon.

490
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,278
Could I speak with you?

493
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,585
What you said...

494
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:16,840
You could've lied to Cersei.

495
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:19,843
About bending the knee to Daenerys.

496
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:26,266
You risked everything
to tell an enemy the truth.

497
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,978
We went down there to make peace.

498
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:34,107
And it seems to me,
we need to be honest with each other

499
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,567
if we're gonna fight together.

500
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:39,446
You've always known what was right.

501
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,161
Even when we were
all young and stupid,

502
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,579
you always knew.

503
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,206
Every step you take,

504
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,126
it's always the right step.

505
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,336
It's not.

506
00:45:54,419 --> 00:46:00,133
It may seem that way from the outside,
but I promise you, it's not true.

507
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:05,263
I've done plenty of things
that I regret.

No.

Not compared to you.

511
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:26,076
I always wanted to do the right thing.

512
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:30,747
Be the right kind of person.

514
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:37,087
It's always seemed like there was...

515
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,635
Like there was
an impossible choice I had to make.

516
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,847
Stark or Greyjoy.

517
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:55,563
Our father was more of a father to you
than yours ever was.

- And you betrayed him.

- Betrayed his memory.
- I did.

520

But you never lost him.

521
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:13,498
He's a part of you.

522
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,335
Just like he's a part of me.

It's not my place
to forgive you for all of it.

525

But what I can forgive, I do.

526

You don't need to choose.

527

Let's start with the simplest one.

594
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,778
You murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn.

595
00:55:22,862 --> 00:55:25,490
You pushed her through the Moon Door
and watched her fall.

596
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:26,949
Do you deny it?

597
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,995
I did it to protect you.

598
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,955
You did it to take power in the Vale.

599
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,334
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

600
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:38,878
You gave Lysa
tears of Lys to poison him.

601
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:39,962
Do you deny it?

602
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,217
Whatever your aunt
might have told you,

603
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,595
she was a troubled woman.

604
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:50,264
She imagined enemies everywhere.

605
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,892
You had Aunt Lysa send
a letter to our parents

606
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:55,353
telling them it was the Lannisters
who murdered Jon Arryn

607
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:56,646
when really it was you.

608
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:59,106
The conflict between
the Starks and the Lannisters,

609
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,400
it was you who started it.
Do you deny it?

610
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:02,777
I know of no such letter.

611
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,405
You conspired with Cersei Lannister
and Joffrey Baratheon

612
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:08,741
to betray our father, Ned Stark.

613
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:11,494

he was imprisoned,

614

and later executed
on false charges of treason.

Do you deny it?

616
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:17,500
I deny it.

617
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,795
None of you were there
to see what happened.

618

None of you knows the truth.

619
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:24,590
You held a knife to his throat.

620
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:32,390
You said,
"I did warn you not to trust me."

621
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:40,398
You told our mother this knife
belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

622
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,609
But that was another one of your lies.

623
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,528
It was yours.

624
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,285
Lady Sansa,

625
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:53,661
I have known you
since you were a girl.

626
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,330
- I've protected you...
- Protected me?

627
00:56:56,706 --> 00:56:58,416
By selling me to the Boltons?

628
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:03,713
If we could speak alone,
I can explain everything.

629
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,093
Sometimes when I'm trying
to understand a person's motives,

630
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:10,344
I play a little game.

631
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,639
I assume the worst.

632
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:18,436
What's the worst reason you have
for turning me against my sister?

633
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,565
That's what you do, isn't it?

634
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,108
That's what you've always done.

635
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,945
Turn family against family,
turn sister against sister.

636
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:30,406
That's what you did
to our mother and Aunt Lysa

637
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,575
and that's what you tried to do to us.

638
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:33,659
Sansa, please...

639
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:35,536
I'm a slow learner.

640
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:37,079
It's true.

641
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:38,914
But I learn.

642
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:42,585
Give me a chance to defend myself.
I deserve that.

643
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:50,009
I am Lord Protector of the Vale

644
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,219
and I command you to escort me
safely back to the Eyrie.

645
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:53,638
I think not.

646
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,602
Sansa, I beg you.

647
00:58:01,354 --> 00:58:03,147
I loved your mother
since the time I was a boy.

648
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:04,940
And yet you betrayed her.

649
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,361
I loved you.

650
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,822
More than anyone.

651
00:58:13,074 --> 00:58:14,825
And yet you betrayed me.

652
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:19,246
When you brought me
back to Winterfell,

653
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,624
you told me
there's no justice in the world.

654
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,626
Not unless we make it.

655
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,881
Thank you for all your many lessons,
Lord Baelish.

656
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:32,593
I will never forget them.

657
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:37,139
Sansa...

658
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,016
(CHOKING)

659
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:11,549
JAIME: Our men in King's Landing
will march north in three days' time.

660
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:14,510
It'll take us a fortnight just to
gather supplies for the train.

661
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:15,845
JAIME: We don't have a fortnight.

662
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:17,638
If the North falls, we fall.
Three days.

663
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:19,432
The remaining forces
in the Westerlands

664
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:21,142
will take the River Road east.

665
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:24,562
We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town
and march together to Winterfell.

666
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:25,855
Ser Jaime.

667
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:27,857
Your Grace.

668
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:30,526
My lords,
I need a moment with my brother.

669
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,405
LORD 1: Your Grace.
LORD 2: Your Grace.

670
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:38,367
What are you doing?

671
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:41,162
Preparing the expedition north.

672
00:59:41,245 --> 00:59:42,830
Expedition north?

673
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:46,667
I always knew
you were the stupidest Lannister.

674
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:49,879
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

675
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:51,630
and you want to fight alongside them.

676
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:53,883
Are you a traitor or an idiot?

677
00:59:53,966 --> 00:59:56,177
You pledged our forces
to fight our common enemy.

678
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,013
I'll say whatever I need to say
to ensure the survival of our house.

679
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:01,682
You expect me to trust the man
who murdered our father?

680
01:00:01,766 --> 01:00:05,102
You expect me to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum?

681
01:00:05,186 --> 01:00:07,062
To fight for the Dragon Queen?

682
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:10,941
You saw it with your own eyes.
You saw a dead man trying to kill us.

683
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:12,943
And I saw it burn.

684
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:14,820
If dragons can't stop them,

685
01:00:14,904 --> 01:00:17,865
if Dothraki and Unsullied
and Northmen can't stop them,

686
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:19,950
how will our armies make a difference?

687
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:21,994
This isn't about noble houses.

688
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:23,954
This is about the living and the dead.

689
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:26,123
And I intend
to stay amongst the living.

690
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:29,084
Let the Stark boy and his new queen
defend the North.

691
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:31,253
We stay here where we've always been.

692
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:33,422
I made a promise.

693
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:39,553
Our child will rule Westeros.

694
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:43,557
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

695
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:45,851
The monsters are real.

696
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:50,981
The White Walkers, the dragons,
the Dothraki screamers.

697
01:00:51,065 --> 01:00:53,359
All the frightening stories we heard
when we were young.

698
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:56,028
They're all real. So be it.

699
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,572
Let the monsters kill each other.

700
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:00,658
And while they battle in the North,

701
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,868
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

702
01:01:02,952 --> 01:01:04,078
And then what?

703
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:05,704
And then we rule.

704
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:07,414
When the fighting in the North
is over,

705
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:10,417
someone wins.
You understand that, don't you?

706
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:14,213
If the dead win,
they march south and kill us all.

707
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:17,258
If the living win,
and we've betrayed them,

708
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,343
they march south and kill us all!

709
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:22,680
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

710
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:25,474
- Most of them will die in the North.
- I've faced them in the field.

711
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:27,434
We can't beat them.
We can't beat their dragons.

712
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:29,395
How many dragons
did you see at the pit?

713
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:30,980
- Two.
- What happened to the third?

714
01:01:31,063 --> 01:01:32,982
For all we know,
it's guarding her fleet.

715
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:37,152
She came here with her dragons,
and her Dothraki, and her Unsullied.

716
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:39,280
She came here to show us
all her power.

717
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:43,075
No, something happened.
The dragons are vulnerable.

718
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:45,536
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

719
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,246
We don't have the support
of the other houses.

720
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,999
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

721
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:53,419
You should have listened more

722
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:55,921
when Father spoke
about the importance of gold.

723
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:57,756
I know it was boring for you.

724
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:01,051
You just wanted
to hunt and ride and fight.

725
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:03,679
But I listened, I learned.

726
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:08,601
Highgarden bought us
the most powerful army in Essos.

727
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:10,185
The Golden Company.

728
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:13,939
Twenty thousand men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

729
01:02:14,023 --> 01:02:17,067
The Golden Company is not here.
They're in Essos.

730
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:20,946
How is a mercenary company in Essos
going to help us?

731
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,656
Do you really think Euron Greyjoy

732
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,117
turned tail and sailed back
to the Iron Islands?

733
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:29,288
Do you think he abandoned the chance
to marry the queen?

734
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,791
No one walks away from me.

735
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,712
He's sailing with his fleet to Essos.

736
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:38,589
He's going to ferry the Golden Company
back here

737
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,716
to help us win the war for Westeros.

738
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:45,220
You plotted with Euron Greyjoy

739
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:47,806
without telling me,
the commander of your armies?

740
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:50,559
And you conspired with Tyrion,

741
01:02:50,643 --> 01:02:53,020
the man who murdered our father,
without telling me, your queen.

742
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,230
- I didn't conspire...
- You met with him in secret

743
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:56,607
without my consent.

744
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:58,400
You planned
to promote my enemy's interests.

745
01:02:58,484 --> 01:03:00,486
That is the definition of conspiracy.

746
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:03,113
I pledged to ride north.

747
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:04,949
I intend to honor that pledge.

748
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:07,159
- Then that will be treason.
- Treason?

749
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:09,578
Disobeying your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

750
01:03:09,662 --> 01:03:10,829
What would you call it?

751
01:03:12,665 --> 01:03:14,667
Doesn't matter what I'd call it.

752
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:23,968
I told you no one walks away from me.

753
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:28,555
Are you going to order him to kill me?

754
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:33,310
I'm the only one you have left.

755
01:03:33,394 --> 01:03:35,688
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

756
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:37,439
It's just me and you now.

757
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:39,566
There's one more yet to come.

758
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:43,821
Give the order then.

759
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:05,718
I don't believe you.

I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.

768
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:05,462
I remember everything.

You're a good man.

Oh. Well, thank you, but...

I'm not sure that I am.

774

What happened to you Beyond the Wall?

Oh!

I don't know what that means.

I can see things
that happened in the past.

Jon's the one to lead the fight
against the dead.

I know he is.

785

But he can't do it alone.

786
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:04,229
So, I've come here to help him.

787
01:07:05,272 --> 01:07:07,024
He's on his way back to Winterfell.

788

789

Oh.

He needs to know the truth.

- The truth about what?
- About himself.

No one knows. No one but me.

Jon isn't really my father's son.

796
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:39,223
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

797
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:42,684
He was born in a tower in Dorne.

It's not.

801
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:53,946
Dornish bastards are named Sand.

802
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:57,574
At the Citadel,
I transcribed a High Septon's diary.

803
01:07:58,659 --> 01:08:00,535
He annulled Rhaegar's marriage
to Elia.

804
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,165
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

805
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:07,668
Are you certain?

806
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,504
It's what the High Septon wrote
in his private diary.

807
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:12,089
I don't know why he'd lie.

808
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:15,968
Is this something you can see?

809
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:21,723
RHAEGAR: Father, Smith, Warrior...
LYANNA: Father, Smith, Warrior...

810
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,310
- Mother, Maiden, Crone...
- Mother, Maiden, Crone...

811
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:27,145
- Stranger...
- Stranger...

812
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:30,232
- I am hers, and she is mine.
- I am his, and he is mine.

813
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:34,403
From this day,
until the end of my days.

814
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:38,282
BRAN: Robert's Rebellion
was built on a lie.

815
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:43,328
Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt,
or rape her.

816
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,339
He loved her.

817
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:04,057
And she loved him.

818
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:31,960
- And Jon...
- (BABY FUSSING)

819
01:09:35,547 --> 01:09:37,424
Jon's real name...

820
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:42,804
(WHISPERING)
His name is Aegon Targaryen.

821
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:45,849
You have to protect him.

822
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,977
Promise me, Ned.

823
01:09:58,028 --> 01:09:59,738
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

824
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,752
BRAN: He's never been a bastard.

825
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:20,258
He's the heir to the Iron Throne.

826
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:37,359
He needs to know.

827
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,114
We need to tell him.

828
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,167
ARYA: Are you all right?

829
01:10:55,544 --> 01:10:57,212
SANSA: It's just strange.

830
01:10:58,213 --> 01:11:01,258
In his own horrible way,
I believe he loved me.

831
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:06,680
You did the right thing.

832
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,014
You did it.

833
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:11,059
I'm just the executioner.

834
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:12,811
You passed the sentence.

835
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,940
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

836
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:19,443
Does that bother you?

837
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,698
I was never going to be
as good a lady as you.

838
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:27,742
So I had to be something else.

839
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,497
I never could have survived
what you survived.

840
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:33,915
You would have.

841
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,127
You're the strongest person I know.

842
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:43,675
I believe that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

843
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,261
Well...

844
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:48,555
Don't get used to it.

845
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,308
You're still very strange
and annoying.

846
01:11:57,856 --> 01:11:59,858
"In winter, we must protect ourselves,

847
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:03,111
"look after one another."

848
01:12:05,739 --> 01:12:07,157

"When the snows fall
and the white winds blow,

850

"the lone wolf dies,
but the pack survives."

851
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,135
I miss him.

852
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:31,723
Me, too.

853
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,677

BERIC: It's a long way down.

856
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:59,728
TORMUND: Yeah. The crows keep
telling me I'll get used to it.
