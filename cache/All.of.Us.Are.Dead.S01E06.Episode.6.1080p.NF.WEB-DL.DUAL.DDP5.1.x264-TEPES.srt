1
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,781
Hans Jonas discussed
the responsibilities

2
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,533
of life-related technologies.

3
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,455
I thus named the Jonas Virus
after this philosopher.

4
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,459
It's also my responsibility
to create an antidote.

5
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,712
I refuse to fail.

6
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,294
I'M SO SEXY

7
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,528
Hey, hey, hey! Help me!

8
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,658
Shit.

9
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,037
Let's go.

10
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,134
Ji-min!

11
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,654
- Stop her! Hey!
- What are you doing?

12
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,072
- Let go.
- What's with you?

13
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,180
I said let go of me!

14
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,431
Please come down.

15
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,394
- I want to die! Leave me alone!
- Don't be like this.

16
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,688
I don't wanna live!

17
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,691
- Ji-min. Come on.
- I want to die!

18
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,694
Please leave me alone! Please!

19
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,821
Let go of me!

20
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,826
Please let me go!

21
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,912
My mom and dad died.

22
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,917
What am I supposed to do alone?

23
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,549
Why would you die, you idiot?

24
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,843
What's the use in living?

25
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,945
Still, you should live, anyway.

26
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,014
I have nobody.

27
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,935
I don't have a mom or a dad.

28
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,064
I have nowhere to go
and no one waiting for me.

29
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,694
No one to scold me or praise me.

30
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,447
Do you know what that's like?

31
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,908
No, I don't.

32
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,954
Then don't act like you know everything.

33
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,165
Don't tell me what to do.

34
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,959
You don't know what it's like being me.

35
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,627
- No.
- Exactly.

36
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,047
So just leave me alone.

37
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,135
Every exam, I'm always last.

38
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,014
Well, not completely last.

39
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,102
Whenever I get my report card, my dad says

40
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,064
that my grades won't get me
into Seoul University,

41
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,107
so I shouldn't even bother having hope.

42
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,487
He says to make sure
I don't get hurt or sick.

43
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,907
To just stay healthy.

44
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,700
No offense.

45
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,119
I don't care about your dad.

46
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,497
I didn't believe him.

47
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,459
I'm sure he'd love it if I got into Seoul.

48
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,462
He was only saying that.

49
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,924
But...

50
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,345
He would also say to me...

51
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,143
if anything ever happens,

52
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,441
he would be the first one there for me.

53
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,902
But he's not.

54
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,988
He's not.

55
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,493
Who knows?

56
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,831
Maybe he can't come.

57
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,794
What if my...

58
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,838
my dad died?

59
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,217
At least you can have hope.

60
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,012
My hope is dead.

61
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,392
Is there hope?

62
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,275
Is it stupid of me to wait for him?

63
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,028
Or should I run away? Give up?

64
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,115
I don't know anything.

65
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,035
Both I-sak and Gyeong-su are killed.

66
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,207
I don't want any of my friends to die.

67
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,670
Why are you crying?

68
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,589
Don't die, Ji-min.

69
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,428
I don't want my friends to keep dying.

70
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,430
No one.

71
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,189
I gotta go.

72
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,485
I feel like I'm going crazy in here.

73
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,196
Okay, then.

74
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,866
So let's leave.

75
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,161
I really hate it here.

76
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,416
<i>But how do we get out?</i>

77
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,920
<i>We have nowhere to go, anyway.</i>

78
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,475
Ji-min. The mic went off in there.

79
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,740
Ugh, stay!

80
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,118
Can't you people smell? It stinks.

81
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,787
Breathe through your mouth.

82
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,871
What is it?

83
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,501
I think I have a plan to escape.

84
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,673
This is where we are.
This is where Cheong-san is.

85
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:13,177
If we turn our music only on this speaker,
the zombies will go left.

86
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,179
Then we'll take the stairs on the right,

87
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,558
get Cheong-san, and go to the roof
using the center stairs.

88
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,977
But why the roof?

89
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,770
Choppers keep flying around.

90
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,856
If we light a roof fire,
they might come save us.

91
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,735
Speakers. Will the zombies really go
towards the sound?

92
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,738
I think she's right.
They're drawn to sound.

93
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,908
That's right. They come running
whenever they hear us.

94
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,869
Can we turn on only the speakers we need?

95
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,081
Yes. The ones in the cafeteria,
yard, and library, too.

96
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,666
And draw them there.

97
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,752
Nam-ra, you were
in the broadcasting club, right?

98
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,755
Uh, yeah, my mom made me.

99
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,382
That's all good, and all.

100
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,968
Where do we get music?

101
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,637
There's no internet,
so we can't stream it.

102
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,808
Right there.

103
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,437
That thing?

104
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,609
This is ancient.
Will it even work?

105
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,180
That's good.

106
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,058
Anyone?

107
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,437
I've never done it before.

108
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,357
<i>Somebody do it. Dae-su?</i>

109
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,651
Here goes nothing.

110
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,781
Uh, mic test. One, two. One, two.

111
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,990
Cheong-san, are you there?

112
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,576
<i>- We...
- What are you doing?</i>

113
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,078
<i>H... Hey.</i>

114
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,537
Cheong-san, do you hear us?

115
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,414
It's Su-hyeok.

116
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,627
We'll come to you, so stay put.

117
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,878
<i>Got it?</i>

118
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,964
Don't come, moron. You're gonna get bit.

119
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,342
I know what you'll say,

120
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,096
but we can't hear you here.

121
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,806
What the hell are you doing, Bare-su?

122
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,975
<i>So don't go anywhere.
Wait for us.</i>

123
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,438
<i>You really can't go anywhere, okay?</i>

124
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,609
We'll come now.

125
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,861
All good.

126
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,114
Anyway, let's go.

127
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,717
The smell of shit makes me wanna hurl.

128
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,242
Dude, it's your shit.

129
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,869
- It's not just mine.
- Yes, it is.

130
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,996
<i>- Really?
- Yes.</i>

131
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,206
This can't end well.

132
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,714
<i>Cheong-san.</i>

133
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,346
<i>Please stay still.</i>

134
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,142
I know you never listen to me,
but please do it this time.

135
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,623
What's wrong?

136
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,084
- Why isn't it working?
- Beats me.

137
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,007
<i>Time for meditation.</i>

138
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,972
<i>Once again,
another fun day at school.</i>

139
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,730
<i>Everyone, close your eyes...</i>

140
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,691
<i>...and calm your hearts.</i>

141
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,193
Okay.

142
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,403
Broadcasting room.

143
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,370
Nam-ra, turn off the right
and middle speakers.

144
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,372
BUILDING CENTER, RIGHT, LEFT

145
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,878
Sound's distant.

146
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,256
Uh-huh. I hear it on the left.

147
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,803
- The speakers are working.
- Really?

148
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,473
It worked.

149
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,195
ONE HEART

150
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,293
Dae-su.

151
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,377
We're good.

152
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,508
- Hold on.
- Why? What?

153
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,393
There's one more.

154
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,686
Huh?

155
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,545
I'm going now.

156
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,965
<i>You must keep moving forward...</i>

157
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:43,883
Let's go.

158
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,175
Come on.

159
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,972
Check the left.

160
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,650
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

161
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,776
Close it. Close it.

162
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,153
Close it.

163
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,593
I could've totally died.

164
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,285
You said it was fine, you idiot.

165
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,829
- What? Where?
- There's one right outside.

166
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,248
Look right.

167
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,597
What do we do?

168
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,360
You think there's
something wrong with him?

169
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,600
Not any more than you.

170
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,602
- Rude as hell.
- Sorry.

171
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,813
Everyone else followed the sound,
but he's still there by himself.

172
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,398
Maybe he's deaf.

173
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,818
How the fuck could he hear
when the fucker's dead, huh?

174
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,613
What about the other zombies?
They all respond to sound.

175
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,115
Shit. Beats me.

176
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,117
Damn it.

177
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,244
How do we get out?

178
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,412
Hold on.

179
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,289
Let's wait a little bit.

180
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,959
I'll look.

181
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,752
Let's wait.

182
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,487
We can't be waiting.

183
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,616
Take the others and walk past him
as carefully as possible.

184
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,785
I'll do what I can from here.

185
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,373
All right.

186
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,420
Let's go.

187
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:52,636
<i>...will never perish
even when all else withers and dies.</i>

188
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,264
Hold on tight.

189
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,558
And don't let go.

190
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,815
BROADCASTING ROOM

191
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,087
Go!

192
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,326
Lee Cheong-san.

193
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,876
ROOFTOP

194
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,091
You moron.

195
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,761
Total loser, huh?

196
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,268
Thank you.

197
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,854
Of course. I saved your ass.

198
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,608
- I'm looking for Cheong-san?
- Cheong-san?

199
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,233
For what?

200
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,110
Death.

201
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,946
What do you mean?

202
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,492
I'm killing him.

203
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,294
You're badly hurt.

204
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,338
Are you okay?

205
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,799
I'm great.

206
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,469
I'm so fucking great.

207
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,762
So Cheong-san?

208
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,806
That's not funny.

209
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,771
You were always like that.

210
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,523
Isn't that right?

211
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,193
"Do this."

212
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,237
"Don't do that."

213
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,323
Always ordering me around.

214
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
It's okay, though.

215
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,704
You fought better than I did.

216
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,667
But you can't do that anymore.

217
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,013
You're nothing special.

218
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,338
You're scared?

219
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,464
That's okay.

220
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,883
Hey.

221
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,427
Aren't you scared?

222
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,639
Crazy asshole.

223
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,685
Weak asshole.

224
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,868
You little shithead.

225
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,161
Leave her alone!

226
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,972
Let's go.

227
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,228
Hurry up.

228
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,608
Here comes one. Run!

229
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,782
Shit, what's the code?

230
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,744
- Three-two-one-zero!
- Three-two-two-zero?

231
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,370
Three-two-one-zero!

232
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,664
Shit. Three, two...

233
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:58,251
What is it again?

234
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,628
Three-two-one-zero!

235
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,588
Three, two...

236
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,599
It worked! It's open!

237
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,682
Hey! Hurry!

238
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,523
Hurry! Joon-seong!

239
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,900
Help me!

240
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,568
Come on!

241
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,987
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

242
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,281
Hurry!

243
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,117
Get in here!

244
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,544
I'm tired as shit.

245
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,589
- Shit.
- You're crying?

246
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,843
You're crying?

247
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,053
Embarrassing.

248
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,682
Oh, god!

249
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,058
What happened to you, huh?

250
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,435
How do I fix it?

251
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,519
Let me see.

252
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,397
Wait. You're stabbed?

253
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,192
Why are you getting stabbed and shit?

254
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,656
Get the first aid kit.
I said get the first aid kit!

255
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,700
Where is the kit?

256
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,580
Oh, shit.

257
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:18,915
Where were you?

258
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Cheong-san.

259
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,878
Where's On-jo?

260
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,548
On-jo!

261
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,968
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

262
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,720
Hurt as hell.

263
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,307
How did you guys know I was here?

264
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,391
Aah!

265
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,436
I told you not to go.

266
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,229
Why don't you ever listen to me?

267
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,648
Hey, save the lovers' quarrel for later.

268
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,483
- Huh?
- Let's go.

269
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,278
- Where?
- We have to get to the roof

270
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,756
- before the meditation music ends.
- Let's go. Hurry.

271
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,615
Wait.

272
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,909
Where's Su-hyeok? Su-hyeok isn't here.

273
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,454
- Where are you going?
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

274
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,103
Are you crazy? Don't go by yourself.

275
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,439
- Go in! Go inside!
- They're coming.

276
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,691
Hurry!

277
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,029
The curtains. Come on.

278
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,455
There's a zombie there.

279
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,792
It's caught under a piano,
so it can't go anywhere.

280
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,804
We can't...

281
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,974
go to the roof?

282
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,946
We're trapped again, aren't we?

283
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,314
There are zombies out there, so...

284
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,442
Let's just think a little.

285
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,526
This is so annoying.

286
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
Hey.

287
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,830
Hey, Nam-ra.

288
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,332
What happened to your arm?

289
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,170
That's a bite mark, isn't it?

290
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,287
I can't eat pork. Is there anything else?

291
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,789
Take it and go!

292
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,267
- Hold on.
- Go on. Get out of here.

293
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,292
I can't eat pork!

294
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,170
- Come on, we're all waiting.
- That's enough!

295
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,435
I'm good.

296
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,312
Are the cell phones working in here?

297
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,982
No. There won't be service here.

298
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,194
So you're telling me...

299
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,781
a politician can't talk
a way out of here?

300
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,408
It's true.

301
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,468
I've never been treated this way before.

302
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,247
There's nothing politicians
can't do in our country, right?

303
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,582
Don't be sarcastic.

304
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,210
I've never done anything illegal.

305
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,754
Never did anything improper my whole life.

306
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,547
Then can't you do it just this one time?

307
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,383
I really need to leave.

308
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,842
Wait a little.

309
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,471
I'll get you a helicopter
after we're tested,

310
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,306
and send you to your daughter's school.

311
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,599
The test isn't the problem.

312
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,936
Even if we test negative,
we'll still have to quarantine here.

313
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,897
It was nine days for MERS,
two weeks for Covid-19,

314
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,774
and even three weeks for Ebola.

315
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,526
And then what?

316
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,004
Are you saying we have to stay here
even after we get tested?

317
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,531
It depends what they consider
the incubation period is.

318
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,125
Please eat as much as possible,

319
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,502
and leave your empty food containers
by the door.

320
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,169
Hold on.

321
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,006
Special Mission?

322
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,135
I was a Master Sergeant when I left.

323
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,846
Are you our senior officer?

324
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,223
He was also Special Mission Unit.

325
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,391
Nice to meet you.

326
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,686
Sorry. I'd buy you a drink
if we had met outside.

327
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,979
It's fine.

328
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,065
Tell me, how long are they considering
for quarantine?

329
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,442
We don't know, sir.

330
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,651
Sure you do.

331
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,652
It's true.

332
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,947
They don't know what this virus is,
so they don't know the incubation period.

333
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,367
From what I hear, they're thinking
a minimum of, I don't know, four weeks.

334
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,203
What? That means we have
to be here for at least a month!

335
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,955
Wait until you get tested.

336
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,038
Wait a minute.

337
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,460
- Yes, sir.
- Well...

338
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,754
I'm sorry,

339
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,340
but I have to get out of here
much sooner than that.

340
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,843
Sir.

341
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,555
Even judges and prosecutors
are standing by and waiting.

342
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,973
Connections don't work here.

343
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,851
I know. And I'm very sorry.

344
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,729
- I sincerely apologize.
- For what?

345
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,880
What good do you think that's gonna do?

346
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,702
Why are you doing this?

347
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,169
Ma'am, I'm really sorry.
I have to get to the school.

348
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,922
I already said I'd follow protocol
and help you.

349
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:02,425
Those protocols kept me
from saving too many lives.

350
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,641
I'm leaving.

351
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,852
Please help them out,
so they are not punished,

352
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,771
not too severely at least.

353
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,691
You create this mess,
but you want me to clean it up?

354
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,241
I know you're a mother as well.

355
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,784
I'm a father.

356
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,212
Hey.

357
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,380
Why did you do that?

358
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,966
What? He... He tried to get up.

359
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,677
So what now?

360
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,929
Don't even think about coming with me.

361
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,908
You want me to stay here
after what I've done?

362
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,592
We can't go that way.

363
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,908
There are no kids
in school uniforms.

364
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,153
No one got out.

365
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,739
No one saved them.

366
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,743
No.

367
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,119
That's not it.

368
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,370
Move. Step back, Su-hyeok.

369
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,122
That's not it, asshole.

370
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,583
Tell him.

371
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,668
You weren't bitten by a zombie.

372
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,094
Say something.

373
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,220
Gwi-nam.

374
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,933
He bit her. It wasn't zombies.

375
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,059
Who?

376
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,353
Gwi-nam. The bully.

377
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,271
- Yoon Gwi-nam?
- Yeah.

378
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,192
Nam-ra. Did Gwi-nam really bite you?

379
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Say it clearly.

380
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,739
It's true.

381
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,536
Gwi-nam was bitten by zombies.

382
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,334
Bullshit.

383
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,044
I saw him get bit.

384
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,800
If you get bitten by zombies,
you turn into one.

385
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,733
- So if Gwi-nam bit her...
- He's not one of them.

386
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,264
Gwi-nam wasn't a zombie.

387
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,643
He wasn't.

388
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,145
He literally talked to me.

389
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,774
You saw him. He wasn't a zombie at all.

390
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,029
Are you sure he was bitten by a zombie?

391
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,364
Yeah.

392
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,367
So I'll turn into a zombie.

393
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,702
You won't.

394
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,164
I...

395
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,252
Never mind. So be it.

396
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,921
Su-hyeok, thank you.

397
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,133
Hold on, prez.

398
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,474
I wonder why you never called me
by my name.

399
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,608
You won't.

400
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,366
She won't turn into one.

401
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,076
Don't you trust me?

402
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,538
I saw when Gwi-nam got bitten.

403
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,917
- It happened after fighting with me.
- I fought him, too. Believe me.

404
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,585
I know.

405
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:24,854
You see?

406
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,817
If she turns, I'll throw her
out the window, so she can't attack you.

407
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,196
So back off.

408
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:36,407
- Su-hyeok.
- Back off, asshole.

409
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,827
You shouldn't do this.

410
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,872
I owe it to you.

411
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,172
Don't come closer.

412
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,301
I'm warning you.

413
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,970
Screw you.

414
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,306
I warned you first.

415
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,224
Get lost.

416
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,434
Gyeong-su was enough.

417
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,437
I won't lose any more friends.

418
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,901
Get out of my way.

419
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,862
I said to stop it...

420
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,155
Get out of my way!

421
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,698
Stop it, both of you!

422
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,758
If I feel strange in any way...

423
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,139
I'll just end it quickly.

424
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,725
Sorry, but...

425
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,185
No need to be sorry.

426
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,481
I'm actually not sorry, not at all.

427
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,234
Sorry.

428
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,778
Su-hyeok.

429
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,532
Kill me if I turn.

430
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,868
Hey! Hey!

431
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,222
That's enough.

432
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,266
She should've turned by now.

433
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,517
Not yet.

434
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,564
She was bitten by Gwi-nam,
so she should be fine.

435
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,900
He was bitten by zombies.

436
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,652
Su-hyeok says he wasn't.

437
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,488
I saw it with my own eyes.

438
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,782
Su-hyeok has no reason to lie.

439
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,951
And you're telling me that I do?

440
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,661
Su-hyeok was saying...

441
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,663
I know you like him, but...

442
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,874
This is a little more important,
don't you think?

443
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,587
Why would you bring that up?

444
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,007
Because you always take his side.

445
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,969
I don't do that.

446
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,262
Yes, you do.

447
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,696
Does it hurt a lot?

448
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,997
I said we shouldn't come out!

449
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,125
I said we would all die!

450
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,145
We stopped the bleeding
and sterilized the wound.

451
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,605
So you'll be fine
once you get to a hospital.

452
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,382
How can I go to a hospital right now?

453
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,633
What a joke.

454
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,468
Stop complaining. You'll be fine.

455
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,513
It's all your fault.
It's your fault.

456
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,849
Just stop crying. Fuck!

457
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,063
Hey. Anything?

458
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,028
Of course, it's broken.
I said it wouldn't work, didn't I?

459
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,781
How annoying can you be? You won't die!

460
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,683
<i>Su-hyeok.</i>

461
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,268
<i>Su-hyeok.</i>

462
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,064
<i>I feel weird. I'm hungry.</i>

463
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:42,945
<i>Su-hyeok.</i>

464
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,866
<i>Why do you smell so good?</i>

465
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,501
Nam-ra.

466
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:01,463
Su-hyeok!

467
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,780
Get out of the way!

468
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,823
- Stop it.
- Get back now!

469
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,203
I said to stop it!

470
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,329
Stupid asshole!

471
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,629
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Cut it out.
Stop it already!

472
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,712
- Let go! Let go of me!
- They're going to come in!

473
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,466
Don't do it!

474
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,802
Get out of my way! Let go of me!

475
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,971
Stop it. Are you blind? Look at Nam-ra.

476
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,974
She would have blood
on her mouth if she bit him.

477
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,649
Does she?

478
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,360
And he's not bleeding, right?

479
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,362
It's true. There's no wound.

480
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,657
But if Gwi-nam bit her...

481
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,659
She's still fine,
which means you'll be fine.

482
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,915
Come on, put that down.

483
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,918
Stop being stubborn.

484
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,509
Let go.

485
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,429
I got it. Let go. Fuck.

486
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,558
Why won't you drop that?

487
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,436
That's my business.

488
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,826
Are you okay?

489
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,247
- Why do you care?
- What?

490
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,624
It's weird.

491
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,127
You've always hated me.

492
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,966
Sometimes, I still do.

493
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,887
What's wrong is wrong, though.

494
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:23,272
She seems fine. Let's...

495
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:25,274
She would've definitely turned by now.

496
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
No.

497
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,742
I'm not okay. I wanted to bite Su-hyeok.

498
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,035
That's not true.

499
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,078
Stop that.

500
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,914
I really did.

501
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,750
I wanted to bite him.

502
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,627
Wait, what do you mean by that?

503
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,336
I mean...

504
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,549
I wanted to bite him.

505
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,975
I shouldn't stay with you any longer.

506
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,478
If I hadn't come to my senses,
I would've bitten him.

507
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:05,272
Hey, come on, stop that.
What's wrong with you?

508
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,151
I'll go.

509
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,528
Please wait.

510
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,157
You saw Gwi-nam get bitten by zombies?

511
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,659
I told you a hundred times, yes.

512
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,410
And you saw Gwi-nam turn?

513
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,829
No, I didn't.

514
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,456
I was busy running away.

515
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,628
Su-hyeok, you definitely fought Gwi-nam?

516
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,172
Yes, I did.

517
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,468
There's no reason for either to lie.

518
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,513
Maybe Gwi-nam was bitten,
but was not affected.

519
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,849
In the movies, there are always people
who are immune, remember?

520
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,811
Still, she tried to bite him.

521
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,814
She could have bitten him for real.

522
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,692
Regardless, she isn't normal.

523
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,902
So I'm not going with her.

524
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,028
Ji-min, stop.

525
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,030
What? Are you saying that I'm wrong?

526
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,284
Maybe.

527
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,182
I really don't know what we should do.

528
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,291
We can't pretend she's fine.

529
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:06,958
Enough.

530
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,673
Please don't fight.

531
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,472
Leaving will solve everything.

532
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,605
Don't go. Where would you go?

533
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,315
Stop it.

534
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,398
Please.

535
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,738
I don't want anyone dying.

536
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,788
Hyeon-ju and I-sak...

537
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,708
They're hands were very cold
before they turned.

538
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,588
Nam-ra's hands are warm.

539
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,340
She isn't a zombie.

540
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,301
So cut it out,
and let's talk how to get to the roof.

541
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,094
- No.
- Ji-min!

542
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,262
No way!

543
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,349
She may be fine now,
but who knows what's gonna happen

544
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,433
when she turns?

545
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,228
Guys, say something. This is wrong.

546
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,564
She said herself
that she wanted to bite him.

547
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,983
She has zombie blood in her veins.

548
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,319
Zombies killed my mom and dad.

549
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,072
My mom.

550
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,629
Hey.

551
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,466
Give me your hand.

552
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,594
- What are you doing?
- Tying a knot.

553
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,640
Stop it. Stop.

554
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,519
Hold still.

555
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,576
Happy? This way,
she can't get to you if she turns.

556
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,247
I'll get bitten instead.

557
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,687
What are you going to do?

558
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,813
I have to go.

559
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,399
Be back in a minute.

560
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,676
It's probably not gonna start, you know?

561
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,744
Why are you so damn pessimistic, huh?

562
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,873
The earlier one was in an accident.
That's obviously fine.

563
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,459
How are we gonna fit two people
on that thing?

564
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,627
Try three.

565
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,756
You wanna take the baby with you?

566
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,343
If we leave the baby here,
it won't survive.

567
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,227
Here.

568
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,522
Sit in the back and kill anyone
who gets too close. Okay?

569
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,775
Oh, I can't go. There's no way.

570
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,528
You coward.
You wanna be reported for desertion?

571
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,573
Fine, go ahead.

572
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,784
Given the situation I'm currently in,
the court will agree

573
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,348
these were extenuating circumstances.

574
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,704
- Court?
- Yeah.

575
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,080
- Circumstances?
- Yeah.

576
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,541
You're smart.

577
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,752
Yes, I am. I go to Seoul University.

578
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:39,421
Okay, then, I'll break
all the windows on my way out,

579
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,839
so that they can get in.

580
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,385
Oh! All right!
All right! I'll go. I'll go.

581
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,309
Seriously?

582
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,355
A person should use his head.

583
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,483
We need to stay alive
to tell anyone about the laptop.

584
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,859
CHEONG-SAN CHICKEN

585
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,866
What's going on?

586
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,077
Hey. Hey.

587
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,954
Come here!

588
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,470
You said we were going,
so we should've just gone.

589
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,431
Are you going to save
everyone in the world?

590
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,315
- Are you the spirit of God?
- Police officer.

591
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,018
Damn it.

592
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,232
- Take the baby.
- Okay.

593
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:42,985
The baby.

594
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,527
Are you okay?

595
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,280
Are you hurt anywhere?

596
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:48,949
Mommy.

597
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:54,204
- Mommy is over there.
- Where?

598
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:55,913
Where's Mama?

599
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,252
Is...

600
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,753
Is that your mom?

601
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,006
The one in red?

602
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,682
Sir. I don't know how to hold babies.

603
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,310
This baby keeps smiling.

604
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,193
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Wait a minute.

605
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,607
Stay still for one minute.

606
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,295
What is wrong with this world?

607
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,447
It will be okay.

608
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,785
If Nam-ra's immune,
does that mean she's okay

609
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,953
even if she gets bitten?

610
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,498
- Probably.
- Oh, shit.

611
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:20,957
That's not fair.

612
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,002
She still has zombie blood in her veins.

613
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,380
She isn't completely a zombie.

614
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,965
A half-bie?

615
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,175
What's half-bie?

616
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,468
Short for half zombie?

617
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:32,427
Really?

618
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,887
It's like half and half.

619
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,764
Like half spicy, half fried... Oh!

620
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:38,266
- I want chicken.
- That's enough, Dae-su.

621
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,644
We haven't had water for two days.

622
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,563
Is it true we'll die
if we don't have water for three days?

623
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,317
I don't know.
Please don't talk to me. I'm too hungry.

624
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:51,822
Dae-su, don't you want that soda
we had on our way to school?

625
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,615
Oh!

626
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,379
- Don't you want it so bad?
- Yes.

627
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,579
I want Hot Six with Pocari.

628
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,582
I'll see your soda,
Hot Six, and Pocari,

629
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,168
and raise you an iced vanilla latte.

630
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,546
How could you think about food
with a zombie here?

631
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,006
Stop it. Nam-ra isn't a zombie.

632
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:10,966
Half-bie.

633
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,175
Close enough.

634
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,969
Let's not do this to ourselves.

635
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,346
We're all we've got now.

636
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,475
She's right.
Nam-ra is better than Na-yeon.

637
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,270
Don't even say her name.
She's subhuman.

638
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,565
Gyeong-su died, because of her,
and Miss Park...

639
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,649
That's true.

640
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:32,279
If it weren't for Na-yeon,
they'd be here with us right now.

641
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,448
Wait a sec.

642
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,826
The PTA asked the parents
to send some stuff before the competition,

643
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,995
and asked my mom to send some chicken.

644
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,078
Chicken?

645
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,207
We would've seen it
if it were here.

646
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,792
I don't see anything.

647
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,878
Hold on.

648
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,674
Shit. Maybe it's in there.

649
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,092
Hey, hey.

650
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,886
- What?
- We don't know what's in there.

651
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,054
We need to eat and survive first.

652
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,976
- Damn it. It's locked.
- It's locked, goddamn it.

653
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,272
Let's open it.

654
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,858
Find something
to pick the lock with.

655
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,152
Look for something. Hurry.

656
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,290
What do you think?

657
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:28,453
- That wall is our only way out, right?
- Yes. That's our best option.

658
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,797
Security is insane.
We're completely trapped.

659
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,400
- Let's go over it.
- Are you sure?

660
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,719
- We'll be seen for sure.
- That's the only way.

661
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:44,803
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

662
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,426
The line.

663
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,389
Drop me a line.

664
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,145
- U-sin.
- Yes?

665
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,147
Just...

666
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,358
Stay alive.

667
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,278
Are you insane? Take me with you, please.

668
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,489
Captain! Captain!

669
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,993
Captain!

670
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,662
Freeze.

671
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,499
Freeze!

672
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,711
What are you doing?

673
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,548
Stop right there.

674
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,257
What the hell?

675
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,051
I said to freeze.

676
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,470
I'm on patrol, moron.

677
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,683
Which unit are you with?

678
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,102
- Sorry.
- Pardon?

679
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:28,997
Nothing?

680
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,499
Should we knock it down?

681
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,505
Damn it.

682
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,884
PTA DONATIONS

683
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,016
Hey. Take it easy.

684
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,693
Hey. Keep it down! You gotta be quiet.

685
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,030
Hey.

686
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,198
Hey, stop doing that.

687
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,412
It won't work.

688
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,747
What a waste of energy.

689
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,384
And please, no music.

690
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,909
My mom and dad...

691
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,706
They came to the school to save me.

692
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,084
The police...

693
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,130
and firefighters never came.

694
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,468
If anybody is watching this after,

695
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,387
punish them.

696
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,848
All involved.

697
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,810
They abandoned us.

698
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,061
All of them.

699
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,191
I'll make you pay.

700
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,245
Hi, Mom.

701
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,373
Hi, Dad.

702
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,589
I'll stay alive and get revenge.

703
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,677
I'll kill all the zombies...

704
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,806
and anyone else.

705
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,209
Mom.

706
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,418
And Dad.

707
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,378
Hello.

708
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,885
I'm here with some of my classmates
and they're really good to me.

709
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,514
Let me just show you. This is them.

710
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:41,897
Uh...

711
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,567
Um...

712
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,777
Mom, Dad...

713
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,031
I miss you.

714
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,201
I miss you both.

715
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,496
And, um...

716
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,416
I'm so sorry.

717
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,302
Um, give it to me.

718
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,313
Hey, Mom.

719
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,442
I want a raise in allowance.

720
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,238
- Is it ready to go?
- Yes.

721
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:36,327

Cheong-san?

730
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,490
Mom.

731
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:17,534
It's me.

732
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,829
Dad, you're okay too, right?

733
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,415
I'm...

734
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,544
I'm good.

735
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,862
Hi, Dad.

736
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:55,948
I miss you.

737
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,744
You're not here,
but I waited for you all night,

738
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,496
and we're holding on together.

739
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:07,043
You always say being healthy
is better than getting good grades.

740
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,680
You said you'd be the first to come
if anything ever happened.

741
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,142
And you're okay, right?

742
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,903
You have to be okay, Dad.

743
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,573
You don't have to come save me, but...

744
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,872
But still, I wish you'd come.

745
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:53,006
I really thought you would be here by now.

746
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:11,858
But I'm okay.

747
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,907
Usually, I save this for my allowance.

748
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,454
But I'll say it for free here.

749
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:27,874
Dad, I...

750
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,542
I love you.

751
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,215
<i>I love you.</i>

752
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,471
I really love you.
