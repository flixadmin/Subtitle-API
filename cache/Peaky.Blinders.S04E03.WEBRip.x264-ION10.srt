1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,640
[clattering]

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,000
[fluttering]

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,160
[indistinct shouting]

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,080
[clamoring]

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,360
[Arthur] All right...
First come, first served.

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,240
Form an orderly line, all of you.

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,520
All right. All right. [sniffs]

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,280
Right. Have your contracts
of employment in your hand.

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,280
Bring 'em in. Get in there...

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,640
Get moving... On you go... Go on...
Keep going... Keep going.

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,560
-You, where are you going?
-Bradley. Foreman.

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,920
All right. You go and see
that man over there. Go!

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,160
-What's your name?
-Bradley. I'm the foreman.

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,000
-When did you last work here?
-1922.

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,360
How many have done
this type of work before?

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,160
They're mostly farm hands
from down Worcester way.

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,280
But I'll show 'em.
Hungry men learn fast.

18
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,040
All right. On you go.

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,880
[man] Dirty scabs! Black legs!

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,880
-[clamoring continues]
-[shattering]

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,560
What bastard threw that?
Get him out here.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
Bring him out!

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,200
[indistinct shouting]

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,800
[grunts]

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,280
Arthur! Oi! Enough. Enough.

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,040
Get him out. Get out!
All right, 10 more.

27
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,880
Two more. That's it.

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,560
-Ten.
-Close it up!

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,720
Right. Ten bob a man.
Two pound there for you.

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,880
What about security?

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,240
Yeah, well, about that.

32
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,200
By order of the City of Birmingham
Police Department,

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,200
you and your ugly workforce
are now under the protection

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
of the Peaky Fucking Blinders.

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,920
[footsteps approaching]

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,080
[door opens]

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
-Mr. Gray?
-[Michael] Yeah, send him in.

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,440
It's your mother.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,120
Oh, fuck...

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,320
I read about it in the paper.

41
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,120
I have a right.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm your mom as well.

43
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,040
You want me to go away?

44
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,080
Yes.

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,800
I'll just leave these.

46
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,960
They're from our orchard.

47
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,280
You used to love these.

48
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,800
-I hope there are no worms in 'em.
-[chuckles]

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,120
[sighs]

50
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,880
Look,

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,440
I just wanted to say
that you're welcome to come home.

52
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,760
To get better at home.
I know you got bored in the village...

53
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,959
But we love you

54
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,480
and your little brother
misses playing football with you.

55
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
And your dad...

56
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
Passed on.

57
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,240
He passed on peacefully in our bed.

58
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,720
[exhales] Fuck...

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,120
Now, go on.

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,840
I'm expecting Tommy,
and he is due here now.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,440
I'll go then.

62
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,160
I'll not be in the same room
as that man.

63
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,280
[door opens and closes]

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,400
[vehicle approaching]

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,200
[door opens]

66
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,560
Come on, Pol, Tommy’s expecting us.

67
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,000
-Who's with us?
-Isiah and two Lee boys.

68
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,160
Ada? How long since you've had a fuck?

69
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,640
-What?
-It's been nearly two years with me.

70
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,120
Over Christmas, I counted it up.

71
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,560
So I've made a New Year's resolution
to change the situation.

72
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,120
Oh, anyone particular in mind?

73
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,520
Not really.

74
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,640
Just me and someone unsuitable.

75
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,720
I'll sit in the front.

76
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,200
So, this is just
to make things official.

77
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,520
Your official return
to the company payroll.

78
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
So no more talk

79
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,200
of New Year's resolutions
or Tommy might change his mind.

80
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,160
What New Year's resolution?

81
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,440
Never mind.

82
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,720
I think Ada's trying to tell me
to behave myself.

83
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,040
Yeah. Behave yourself.

84
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,920
Behave myself or what?

85
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,520
Behave myself or fucking what?

86
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,560
Okay, Polly, I'll tell you the truth.

87
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,560
After your recent troubles,
Tommy asked me to keep an eye on you.

88
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,160
Troubles?

89
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,160
Whilst working for this company,

90
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,040
I have killed a man,
I have lost a man,

91
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,280
I have found a son,
I have nearly lost a son,

92
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,480
I have nearly lost my own life.

93
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,800
Now I will accept my job back
if the terms on offer are favorable.

94
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,560
But I will not behave myself.

95
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,320
[footsteps approaching]

96
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,760
[door opens]

97
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,320
Sorry I'm late.

98
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,400
Where's Arthur?

99
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Do I look like his fucking mother?

100
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Oh, Linda...

101
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,200
Why are you here?

102
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,039
You all right? Is Billy all right?

103
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,320
Yes. Everything's fine.

104
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,200
Well, look. Lovely to see you.
But I'm late for a meeting.

105
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,880
They can wait.

106
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
I've got something for you.

107
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,160
Something for a loving husband
who's been working very hard...

108
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,200
And is under a great deal of pressure.

109
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,720
Something to relieve his stress.

110
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,640
Oh.

111
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,880
It's silk. From Japan. Feel.

112
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,880
-My hands are dirty.
-Good.

113
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,080
Feel all of it.

114
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,680
Feel it properly.

115
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,680
[both breathing heavily]

116
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,320
You, uh... You want to do this here?

117
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,960
Why not? I thought you were the boss.

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,680
I am the fucking boss.

119
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,680
Then tell me what to do, boss.

120
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,240
Come here.

121
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,400
[Tommy] Right, before we start
this extraordinary general meeting

122
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,200
of the board of the
Shelby Company Limited,

123
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,520
I'd like to note the absence
of the Deputy Vice President

124
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,360
who has not yet arrived.

125
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,640
We will continue without his presence.

126
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,240
[clears throat] Item number one,
the reinstatement

127
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,600
of the Shelby Company Limited
company treasurer.

128
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,440
The board welcomes back

129
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,960
the former treasurer,

130
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,280
with generously improved
terms and conditions.

131
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,800
Due to the exceptionally

132
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,280
difficult circumstances

133
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,120
the company now finds itself in.

134
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,880
The proposed treasurer will now
check the terms and conditions

135
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,680
to see if they are in order.

136
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,360
Item number two, during the absence
of the company accountant

137
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,840
due to ill health,

138
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,200
all responsibility for
the keeping of company accounts

139
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,320
pass to the head of acquisitions.

140
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,000
Item number three.

141
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,960
The company treasurer,
having read the terms and condition,

142
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,760
lodges a signed contract of employment

143
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,440
agreeing to the terms and conditions
with the temporary head of accounts.

144
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,000
All those in favor of the
reinstatement of Mrs. Elizabeth Gray,

145
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,120
to the position of

146
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,320
Shelby Company Limited
Company Treasurer,

147
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,440
please raise your hands.

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,480
Why, goodness. Thank you.

149
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
Any other business?

150
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,840
Right, I declare this
extraordinary general meeting over.

151
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,760
Now we can talk about
the real business.

152
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,760
But for that, we need Arthur.

153
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,280
Where the fuck is Arthur?

154
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,280
[moaning]

155
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,000
[knocking on door]

156
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,680
-[Devlin] Mr. Shelby...
-Fuck off.

157
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,280
They’ve broken into the paint shop.

158
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Oh, yeah?

159
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,760
They’re chucking paint around,

160
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,760
I think they mean to set light to it.

161
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Well, you deal with it, man.
I’m fucking busy!

162
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,680
[moaning]

163
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,320
[grunts]

164
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,560
What was all that about?

165
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,880
[breathes heavily]

166
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,600
In this sinful place
there will be temptations.

167
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,320
It’s my responsibility as your wife
to help you resist those temptations.

168
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,000
By putting myself between you...

169
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,760
And the devil.

170
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,800
In the words of
my sinful Catholic mother,

171
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,760
"Keep his balls empty
and his belly full."

172
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,680
-God rest her soul.
-[chuckles]

173
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,480
[knock on door]

174
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,880
[Devlin] Mr. Shelby...

175
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,280
You have to come to the paint shop
immediately! Please!

176
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,320
Oh, I have to go.

177
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
Won't be late.

178
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,360
[door opens]

179
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,480
Sorry, ladies,
there's no smoking in here.

180
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes, love, we know.

181
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,920
All right. He's an hour late.
Fuck him.

182
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,000
[sighs] This business
directly affects Arthur,

183
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,760
but he's not here,
so we'll take a vote without him.

184
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,360
What business?

185
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,160
Official business that wasn't
on your agenda, Ada.

186
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,720
[Tommy] An informant told us
that six years ago,

187
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,120
Luca Changretta

188
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,600
came from New York to Birmingham

189
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,520
to be best man
at his cousin's wedding.

190
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,200
[Polly] We found out that they used
Reid and Dunn on Broadgate

191
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,520
for the photographs.

192
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,040
The photographer kept the negatives.
I persuaded him to give us copies.

193
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,960
And to enlarge this one...

194
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,920
That is Luca Changretta.

195
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,600
[Tommy] I've seen his face,
so I could pick him out. Half the men in the photograph
are Changrettas,

196
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,960
which means, chances are

197
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,840
they are the men
who will come to kill us.

198
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,560
We need to get both these photographs
into pubs and on street corners.

199
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,560
Then we put it about that
there's a reward for information.

200
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,080
We also propose that we give
a copy of this photograph

201
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,560
to Mr. Aberama Gold.

202
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,880
We need to forget the idea that it has
to be Arthur that pulls the trigger.

203
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,480
Tradition will just fuck us up.

204
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,120
-We should wait for Arthur...
-Arthur's not here, Ada.

205
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,520
We need Luca Changretta dead.
That's it.

206
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,440
[Polly] Dropping the law
of the bullet

207
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,080
is part of the process
of modernization

208
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,920
that I was working on before I...

209
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,400
Before I was executed.

210
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,880
-You weren't executed, Pol.
-What did you call me?

211
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,640
[Tommy] Right. Let's take a vote.
I'll deal with Arthur.

212
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,080
All those in favor
of giving the photographs to Mr. Gold,

213
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,520
raise your hand.

214
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,680
Then it will be done.

215
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,040
-Mom...
-Oh, "Mom" now, is it?

216
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,200
I smelt perfume when I came in here.

217
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,840
Yeah, it was the flowers.

218
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,240
-Right, that's it.
-Who came in here, Michael?

219
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,760
The truth is, Polly, the woman
that raised him came in here.

220
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,360
She has every right to come in here.

221
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,560
She brought him fucking apples
and she left.

222
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,640
We are in the middle of a vendetta
and Arthur is missing.

223
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,120
We need to find him.

224
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,560
Concentrate on what unites us.

225
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,840
-This is all temporary.
-Yeah, temporary, right.

226
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
[sighs heavily]

227
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,160
[man] Bastards!

228
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,920
[indistinct shouting]

229
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,960
Party is it? Is that what it is?

230
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,800
What is this, a party?
Fuck off out of it! Get out!

231
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,640
Okay, I wasn't gonna hit ya.

232
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,480
But that wasn't fucking nice.

233
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,000
[both grunting] Oh, you...

234
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,440
[man] Arthur, Mr. Shelby.
Please. Please!

235
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,839
Don’t fucking move...

236
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,960
Sorry, Mr. Shelby, please, please!

237
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,640
Then get the fuck out!

238
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,040
Fuck your fucking revolution.

239
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,080
I am a fucking mess.

240
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Shh.

241
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,000
[indistinct talking]

242
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,960
[indistinct shouting]

243
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,280
Where are you going? Come here... Fucking hit men, are you? Huh?

244
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,480
Is that what you are?

245
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,800
Arthur Shelby?

246
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,440
That's who you wanted, yeah?

247
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,280
What about...

248
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,640
-What about fucking John Shelby?
-[Man panting]

249
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,480
[grunts]

250
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,960
[breathes heavily]

251
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,800
John.

252
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
Thank you.

253
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
Send my guests in.

254
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,720
[door opens]

255
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
[in Italian]

256
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,920
They didn't come back

257
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,600
Arthur Shelby is still alive

258
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,000
Wire his village and tell them

259
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,360
[speaking English]

260
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,720
You wire Polo
and let him tell the family.

261
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,520
He has four kids. [grunts]

262
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,600
Don't you two have
any other clothes to wear?

263
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
[in Italian]

264
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,360
You walk around this little place
dressed like big city hoodlums

265
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,720
[in English]

266
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,160
Now look at me.

267
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Huh?

268
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,600
I'm here as a lover of theater.

269
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
[in Italian]

270
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,440
None of my clothes fit anymore

271
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,880
I can't eat anything, it's all shit

272
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,360
It's inedible, it's disgusting!

273
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,720
Spotted Dick? What is that?

274
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,520
I don't want to eat that, why would I?

275
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,120
[Luca sighs] I killed two of our men.

276
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,880
You complain about your fucking belly.

277
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Luca...

278
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,880
[speaks in Italian]

279
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,440
-With respect.
-With respect?

280
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,960
You raised...

281
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,800
With respect?

282
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,080
You open your mouth.

283
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,360
-Come on...
-Open your fucking mouth.

284
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,000
You fucking dress like them.

285
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,920
You eat like them.

286
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,760
You don't fucking talk to me
about, "With respect!"

287
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
[muffled grunting] [in Italian]

288
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,760
Let's get this business finished

289
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,360
then we can all go home

290
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,320
Then we can eat some decent food

291
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Sit down. What do you have?

292
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
[in Italian]

293
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,320
We found another enemy

294
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,320
This family has lots of enemies

295
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
[Matteo speaks in Italian]

296
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,760
She lives inside their territory

297
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,320
Arthur Shelby killed her son
in a boxing ring four years ago.

298
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
[in Italian]

299
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,760
She says he's crazy in the head

300
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,160
To compensate her, they look
after her and her other kids

301
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,080
She thinks if she asks one of
the brothers to come to her house

302
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,280
they would come. -She would do that for us?
-[Frederico speaks Italian]

303
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,560
So she says

304
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,080
People in this place hate forever

305
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,800
Like Sicilians

306
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Okay.

307
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,200
Okay.

308
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,760
[men talking indistinctly]

309
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,640
[Tommy] Anyone seen Arthur?

310
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,720
Anyone seen Arthur?

311
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,120
In your office, Tom.

312
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,000
If you're not gonna show up
for a family meeting,

313
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,320
you let someone know.

314
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,760
We thought you were dead,
there's 15 fucking Italians out there.

315
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,520
No, there's not.

316
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,080
There's 13.

317
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,200
I just killed two of them.

318
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,680
Ripped out their hearts
and burnt their bones to ash.

319
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,800
[sighs]

320
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Oh, I did it.

321
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,040
Me. Your brother.

322
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,240
Not fucking Aberama Gold
or his punch drunk son, but me!

323
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,080
Even if you don't trust me no more.

324
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,120
What the fuck are you talking about?
Arthur?

325
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,960
I got cleaned up at Ada's.

326
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,840
She told me
you took a vote in my absence.

327
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,600
All right. Calm down,
and tell me about the men...

328
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,600
You put my job out for contract.

329
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Arthur...

330
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,280
Yeah, well, I'm gonna make it
my fucking job anyway.

331
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,360
Because this was all my fault.

332
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,320
It was me that shot the old man.

333
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,840
-Yeah, out of mercy.
-Aye.

334
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,080
Now John's dead,

335
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,440
he's dead because of me
and I wanna make it right.

336
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Arthur, wait.

337
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,560
How did the men get in the factory?
I need to know.

338
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Through the back fucking door

339
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,560
that was supposed
to be locked and bolted.

340
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,320
Some bastard gave me up.
Somebody with keys.

341
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,680
Yeah. Why don't you sit down,
work it out for yourself?

342
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,960
Take a fucking vote.

343
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,840
Who's this little bear?

344
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,160
Yes.

345
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,080
You all right?

346
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,520
Daddy's home.

347
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,840
Yeah, I'm all right.

348
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,640
Look, Daddy's home.

349
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,040
How's Polly?

350
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
She all right?

351
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,040
Oh, go on, Linda.

352
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,040
I mean, it was her idea, wasn’t it?
Hmm?

353
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,120
The Japanese silk?

354
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,080
I'll put him to bed.

355
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,320
[door opens]

356
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,840
You kept me away
from that fucking meeting

357
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,800
-to stop me from voting.

359
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,400
Eh?

360
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,400
-You know what I am, don’t you?
-Shh, shh.

361
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,560
I'm a working man.

362
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Yeah.

363
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,920
Fucking working man.

364
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,640
Fucking...

365
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,040
Who's lost his job.

366
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,800
Is that what I am, Linda?
Is that what I am, eh?

-[door closes]
-[Linda] I don't want you dead.

368
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,360
Polly doesn't want you dead.

369
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,240
Let Mr. Gold do the killing.
For money.

370
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,640
It's the modern way, Arthur.

371
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
[Arthur] Watch.

372
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,000
Hmm? Hmm?

373
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,680
What are you doing?

374
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,680
Now fire it into the fireplace.

375
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
Please.

376
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,200
-Fire it?
-Fire it.

377
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,920
Get rid of it.

378
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,160
Then we'll go to bed.

379
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,880
Do anything you like.

380
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,120
Just fire the gun, Arthur.

381
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
Fire it.

382
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,160
Ah!

383
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,400
You go tell Polly...

384
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,400
There are rules
between a man and a woman.

385
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,840
Fucking rules.

386
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,640
But I have to do this. I have to do it.

387
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,600
John wants me to do it, Linda.

388
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,760
My brother.

389
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,200
And I'm gonna do it.

390
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,800
Was it fear or was it hatred?

391
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,240
Was what fear or hatred?

392
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Isiah.

393
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,280
You had a one-way ticket to Glasgow
in your pocket.

394
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Your wife and kids left
three days ago.

395
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,320
Now I'm gonna ask you again.

396
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,280
Was it fear of the Italians
or hatred of us

397
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,680
that made you unlock the door
and give up my brother?

398
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,040
I didn't unlock any door.

399
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,880
Here, have a drink.

400
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,840
You're gonna need it.

401
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,320
35 Drumcree Street Parkhead, Glasgow.

402
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,040
Please, please, please, please...

403
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,240
We have allegiances
with Catholic gangs in that city.

Your family are safe
only at my discretion.

405
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,560
Now explain to me

406
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,000
why you were catching
a midnight train to Glasgow.

407
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,840
You mean you don't know?

408
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,880
I run a factory full of black leg
non union labor.

409
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,200
I live in a street full of men
laid off or on strike.

410
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,240
Look at the photograph, Mr. Devlin,

411
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,240
and tell me who are the men
that contacted you.

412
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,000
No. No, you listen to me.

413
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
[clears throat]

414
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,240
I get spat at, windows smashed,
petrol on the curtains.

415
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,080
But for fear of you,
I clock in every fucking morning.

416
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,520
And today, two men are shot
and burnt on my shift.

417
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,280
And you ask me why I'm getting
on the midnight train to Glasgow?

418
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,840
Who else has keys to that door?

419
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,960
They hang on a hook inside my office.

420
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,680
Today I left the office unlocked.

421
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,360
-Why?
-Because I forgot.

422
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,320
Because I left in a hurry.

423
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,920
Because there were men
trying to set fire to the factory.

424
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,160
Mr. Shelby, may I tell you something?

425
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,800
You have a lot of enemies.

426
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Communists. Italians.

427
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Before the factory came out on strike,

428
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,200
I heard word
that two Italians attended

429
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,440
a communist party meeting
in Stechford.

430
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,640
They hardly spoke English.

431
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,360
Now, if they got a party man
into the factory,

432
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,840
it might have been him
that unlocked the door for them.

433
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,160
Mr. Shelby...

434
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,760
My train leaves at 12:00.
It's just gone 11:00.

435
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,200
I can still make it.

436
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,920
Please.

437
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840

438
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,719
I need you here.

Isiah? Get three of our men
with police badges

440
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,920
to watch Mr. Devlin's house.

441
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,600
[Devlin] Mr. Shelby, please...

442
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,639
Our friends in Glasgow
will take care of your family.

444
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,159
Before you,
I was an ordinary working man.

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,600

You're a member

I did some research on you.

It turns out I know someone
who used to know you very well.

481

Kitty Jurossi.

482
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,640
You were in love with Kitty's sister,
Greta Jurossi. Before the war.

483

Do you remember Greta Jurossi?

484
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,960
Her parents were Italian.

485
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,880
They didn't approve of
a Watery Lane Gypsy.

With your charm. Sweetness.

Greta died at the age of 19.
Of consumption.

489
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,760
And Kitty said you were
at her bedside for three months.

490
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,640
Every day. Holding her hand.

491
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,280
And after she died,
you went away to war.

492
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,560
Kitty said that the sweet boy
who left never came back.

493

And then you beat him
with his own whip.

00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,400
I need you to listen to me.

534
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,640
I need you to listen to me, Arthur.

535
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,480
The world is changing. Listen to me, Arthur.

536
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,520
Listen to the sweet voice of Jesus...

537
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,960
[exhales slowly]

538
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,400
[gunshot]

539
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,760
-Finn?
-It came from Arthur's house.

540
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,720
Arthur! Arthur!

541
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
Where is he? Arthur?

542
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,680
He fired the bullet.

543
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,680
Linda says it's the modern way, Tom.

544
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,200
[sniffles]

545
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,600
It's the modern way.

546
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,800
Yeah. Yeah.

547
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,080
Yeah. It's all right.

548
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,160
[sniffles]

549
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,760
It's all right, brother.

550
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,400
You did well.

551
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,280
God spoke to him, not me.

552
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,160
[sighs]

553
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,240
[Polly] What are you doing here?

554
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,360
On Mondays, I do the inventory.

555
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,400
Make sure nobody's dipping their hand.

556
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,000
Well, it's my job now.

557
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,600
I'm back.

558
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,520
And there's gonna be nobody dipping
their hand with me here,

559
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,520
not unless they want it cut off.

560
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,040
[door closes]

561
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
[Linda] I said to Arthur while
I'm in this fucking place

562
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,720
I want something to keep my mind busy.

563
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,800
What? You're going to take bets?

564
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,000
I've always been able to do addition
and subtraction without pen and paper.

565
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,240
But I'll need a telephone.

566
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,040
Apparently we have special clients
who take bets by telephone.

567
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,520
Linda?

568
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,920
This is a betting shop.

569
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,560
Look.

570
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,440
Arthur said yes. Tommy said yes.

571
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,120
But did God say yes?
Gambling is a sin, Linda.

572
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,040
It's not me that's doing the gambling.

573
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,080
I'm just taking the bets.

574
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,400
[door opens] [door closes]

575
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,400
The rule is that door should
always remain locked until 9:00 a.m. Right. Boy. Boy, where are you going?

576
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,840
Well, Arthur's not coming in today.
He's taking the day off. So...

577
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,240
"So" what?

578
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,360
So, today, Tommy said
that I'm in charge.

579
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,480
Sorry, you're in charge?

580
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,400
Yeah. That's what he said.

581
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,000
All right, sweetheart.

582
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:27,960
Ladies?

583
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:33,240
Let's give our boss a first day
that he'll never forget.

584
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,920
[door opens]

585
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,560
Sending Finn to the shop
was a mistake.

586
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,120
They've already found out
he's a virgin

587
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,560
and are arranging a girl
for him this afternoon.

588
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,760
I thought Linda was there.

589
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,640
She is. She loved the idea.

590
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,680
-[scoffs]
-Yeah, I know. She even swears now.

591
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,640
"Fuck." Sounds funny coming from her.

592
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,800
Polly says in the end
we all turn into our mother.

593
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,400
Ah, well... Keep an eye on her.

594
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,680
Hmm.

595
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,880
The whore watching the Madonna.

596
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,560
Does Finn know what they have planned?

597
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,600
-No.
-Do they have someone?

598
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,920
Yes. A girl I used to work with.

599
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,680
-Is she nice?
-No. She's from Aston.

600
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,040
They're paying her out of petty cash.

601
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,600
Right, well, call 'em, and tell them to pay extra

602
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,240
and get someone nice.

603
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,880
Nice women don't do
that sort of thing.

604
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,480
Yes, they do. What about you?

605
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,000
I mean in the past. Come on.

606
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,040
Where are we going?

607
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,440
Somewhere I’ve not been
in a long time.

608
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,640
[birds chirping]

609
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,120
Are we expecting somebody?

610
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,600
Tommy, I'm fucking freezing here.

611
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,800
We used to come here.

612
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,560
She'd wait for hours for me,
when I couldn't make it. And I'd wait for her
when her family kept her in.

613
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,520
Who?

614
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,880
Some girl.

615
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,040
Some girl before France.

616
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,360
I've not been back here since.

617
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,440
Wanted to come here with you. Are you kissing her or me?

618
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,720
You.

619
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,200
I want Shelby Company Limited
to increase

620
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,760
non-taxable charitable contributions
to local charities

621
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,120
by 25% as of now.

622
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:16,120
I'm gonna build two new institutes
for destitute children.

623
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,520
One in Saltley, one in Digbeth.

624
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,040
I have already identified
the buildings.

625
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,920
Two former workhouses.

626
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,960
I want you to be in charge
of the project.

627
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,920
Right, come on, let's go.

628
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,040
Why?

629
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,600
Because I promised someone
I'd change the world.

630
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,680
You do realize, Tommy,
we're all going fucking mad here.

631
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,240
Yeah, I know. Come on.

632
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,920
[footsteps approaching]

633
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,920
Finn?

634
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,960
Come here.

635
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,280
How was your day?

636
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,640
Yeah, it was okay.

637
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,680
Good man. Well done. No trouble?

638
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,600
No. No trouble.

639
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,120
And she looked after you?

640
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,080
[sighs]

641
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,720
I don't want it like that
ever again, Tom.

642
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,960
Not when they don't even
want to do it, except for the money.

643
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,600
Everything's for the money, Finn.

644
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,240
Yeah, I know. But...

645
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,680
She said, "Be a man."

646
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,800
And were you a man? Yeah.

647
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,440
But then I apologized to her,
'cause she just looked so tired.

648
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,280
Sit down, Finn.

649
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,080
[clears throat]

650
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,920
Right, listen to me, Finn,
she was right.

651
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,600
You need to be a fucking man.

652
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,280
People get tired.

653
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,200
Working in a fucking factory
gets you tired.

654
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,800
I don't go round apologizing. Do I?

655
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,080
No.

656
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,120
There's an empty space here
to be filled. You understand?

657
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,080
-Yeah.
-So, be a fucking man.

658
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,000
Okay, Tom.

659
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,920
[jazz band playing]

660
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,640
[indistinct conversations]

661
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,560
-Champagne, please.
-Of course.

662
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,280
Madam,

663
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,320
women alone are not allowed
at the bar.

664
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,360
Will someone be joining you?

665
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,600
What do you think?

666
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,800
-[music stops]
-[applause]

667
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,600
[drinks pouring] [grunts softly]

668
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,680
This is public enough, no?

669
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,560
Yes. So?

670
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,560
The boy in the hospital
is out of bounds.

671
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,880
And I will ask you to spare
Finn and Arthur.

672
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,800
In return for what?

673
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,400
Tommy Shelby.

674
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,240
And why should I trust you?

675
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,000
Because you know our history.

676
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,320
You know what happened between us.

677
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,520
You are an unlikely Cassius.

678
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,560
Hmm.

679
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,960
You know, my mother...

680
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,560
My mother knew your mother.

681
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,400
She taught her how to read.

682
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,040
Did she tell you that John
and Arthur spared her life?

683
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,640
-When Tommy wanted her dead.
-Yeah.

684
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,840
And now she's giving me
the information about you people.

685
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,040
So Tommy Shelby was right.

686
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:52,200
His ruthlessness was justified.

687
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,000
You should have killed her
when you had the chance.

688
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,960
John was a good boy.

689
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,200
Arthur tries.

690
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,600
Tommy's different.

691
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,600
You take Tommy. Spare the rest.

692
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,720
You know,

693
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,920
my mother used to say this about you.

694
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,160
She said, "That Polly Gray,

695
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,800
that child would never
let go of a grievance."

696
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,160
[chuckles]

697
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,080
And she loves to dance.

698
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,160
What do you say? Hmm?

699
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,680
You wanna dance?

700
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,040
I don't dance anymore.

701
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,760
Yeah, that's a shame.
