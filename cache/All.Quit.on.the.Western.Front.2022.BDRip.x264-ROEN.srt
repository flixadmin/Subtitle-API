1
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,157
Attack!

2
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,078
Attack!

3
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:10,740
Go! Come on! Faster!

4
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,992
Heinrich, come on! Forwards! Come now!

5
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,783
To the ladders!

6
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,289
On my command!

7
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,573
Forwards!

8
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,250
Heinrich! Get out there!

9
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:27,454
All of you, go!

10
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,540
Come on! Get out of there!

11
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,666
Go, Heinrich! Get out there now!

12
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:35,532
Attack!

13
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,081
Attack!

14
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,082
Go! Forwards!

15
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,448
Heinrich!

16
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,828
Heinrich!

17
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:20,989
- Attack! Attack!
- Attack!

18
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:09,162
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT

19
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,914
Come on!

20
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:14,656
NORTHERN GERMANY, SPRING 1917

21
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,496
THIRD YEAR OF WAR

22
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,913
Paul! Paul!

23
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,333
- Paul! Well?
- So?

24
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,374
- Well then?
- I don't know.

25
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,458
- Does he know we're all going?
- Yes, of course.

26
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:53,452
Staying at home?

27
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:56,675
My God, you're tied to your
mother's apron strings, my friend.

28
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,374
Give me it, I'll scribble something.

29
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,374
- It has to be signed by his parents.
- Well, someone. Come on, pass it here.

30
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,958
- That won't work, they'll find out.
- How will they?

31
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,083
Well?

32
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,950
Is his mother a pen pal of theirs?

33
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,540
- Give me your pen.
- Ah, I'm sorry.

34
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,458
Ludwig.

35
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,120
You mustn't. Your father will hit you.

36
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:21,192
Have you got a better idea?
I'm not being left behind here.

37
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,573
Jawohl!

38
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,916
Congratulations, Private Bäumer.
We're going to the front.

39
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,166
A dead man walking.

40
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,455
You stand here
on the threshold of existence.

41
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,392
Remember this moment.

42
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,874
It is a great moment.

43
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,998
For in years to come, you will be judged
based on what you dared to become today.

44
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,866
The iron youth of Germany.

45
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:02,873
My friends,

46
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:06,159
we are fortunate to
be alive at a great time.

47
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,700
Your deeds will be the water

48
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,788
nourishing the growth of
a strong and noble route.

49
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,995
Stand still and listen up, Leinemann!

50
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,954
The Kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

51
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,449
I am certain that I will see most
of you again soon, here at home.

52
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,746
Your sword returned to its
scabbard with honor and respect.

53
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,539
A cross crafted from iron
proudly displayed upon your chest.

54
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,790
However, take heed of this.

55
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,447
In the darkest of hours, let
me assure you it will happen,

56
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,197
that prior to an attack,
you will harbor doubts.

57
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,666
But this is not the time to
concede to any mental weakness.

58
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,866
Any unsteadiness, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the fatherland!

59
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:54,830
For modern war is like a game of chess.

60
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,412
It is never about an individual soldier.

61
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,833
Our only care is for
the entirety of the body.

62
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,208
You have the chance to earn the right to
wear the uniforms you have been given.

63
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:08,614
And by going to the front line in
Flanders, we'll pierce the enemy.

64
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:12,410
And then you will, in a few short weeks,

65
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,120
finally march on Paris!

66
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:16,657
Yeah!

67
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,039
Our future,

68
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,324
the future of Deutschland,

69
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,120
lies in the hands of
its greatest generation.

70
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,833
My friends, that is you, you see!

71
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,865
Yeah!

72
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:30,908
Therefore, off to the camps

73
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,656
for the Kaiser, God, and the fatherland!

74
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,244
Yeah!

75
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,233
Next.

76
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,250
Next.

77
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:54,789
Next.

78
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,291
- Next.
- Next.

79
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,458
Bäumer, Paul. 53 Wiesengrund.

80
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:02,705
Born November 18th, 1899. Correct?

81
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:03,708
Jawohl, sir.

82
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,368
Next.

83
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:11,958
Paul.

84
00:12:14,042 --> 00:12:16,283
Here. Your father can be proud of you.

85
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,291
Yes.

86
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
Is everything all right?

87
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,699
Yes. I'm eager to get on with it.

88
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,458
Move along.

89
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,581
Here he comes.

90
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,458
- Emil Hermano.
- Name and address.

91
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,916
- And the next.
- Excuse me.

92
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,536
It already belongs to someone.

93
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:39,081
Ah, yes. It was probably too small
for the fellow. Happens all the time.

94
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,786
Here. It's yours.

95
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,573
Thank you.

96
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,408
I remember it, you were.

97
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:05,916
Oh, Ludwig, will you be snatching
away all the ladies from us now?

98
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,990
Yeah.

99
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,067
My concern is that you don't shoot us.

100
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:14,035
<i>Girl, I love you, I do</i>

101
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,246
<i>But I can't yet marry you</i>

102
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:19,875
<i>Wait another year,
then it will come...</i>

103
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,458
She won't wait, Franz.

104
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:23,875
She won't do it.

105
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:27,282
You lady killer, you.

106
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,916
<i>Have a cup of tea,
sugar and coffee</i>

107
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:48,705
<i>And a glass of wine,
and a glass of wine</i>

108
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,280
<i>Girl, I do love you, I do</i>

109
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,076
<i>But I can't yet marry you</i>

110
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:04,619
<i>Wait another year,
then it will come true</i>

111
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:16,497
LA MALMAISON, NORTHERN FRANCE
25 KM TO THE WESTERN FRONT

112
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:32,331
- Your name?
- Kropp. Albert Kropp, sir.

113
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,600
Do you like dirty girls, Kropp?

114
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,578
Do you like dirty girls?

115
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,033
No. I don't, sir.

116
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,458
So why do you sleep with one then?

117
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,949
Report for guard duty at three o'clock.

118
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,833
Gentlemen, you'll be fighting
in a godforsaken shithole.

119
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,823
And you'll kindly do so with a clean G98.

120
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,456
You will pamper it.

121
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,990
You will love it.

122
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,267
And damn it, you will
keep it as immaculate

123
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,161
as the thighs of the Holy Virgin.

124
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,233
Do we understand each other?

125
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,915
- Jawohl, sir!
- Jawohl, sir!

126
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,871
Welcome to the 73th
Reserve Infantry Regiment.

127
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,142
We are now on the Western Front.

128
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,665
- Welcome to Paris!
- Yeah! Welcome to Paris!

129
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:26,953
Down there! Down there!

130
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,616
Down there! This way!

131
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,175
This way!

132
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:48,624
- Go on! Over there on the right!
- Damn it, what happened?

133
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,374
I have orders to hand over the
company to the front by 6:00 p.m.

134
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,869
That you may, but on foot.

135
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,999
You must give us the trucks, lieutenant.

136
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,541
With all due respect, I have orders...

137
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,583
Take the orders and
stick them up your ass.

138
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,666
I have 40 men here
who are dying in the mud.

139
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,150
Get out right now, will you?

140
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,200
Everyone, get up.

141
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,290
Come on, get on with it.

142
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,116
You heard the staff surgeon.

143
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,166
Faster, soldiers. Don't fall asleep here.

144
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,698
Keep moving.

145
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,536
- Franz Müller, correct?
- Yes.

146
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,208
The supreme army command

147
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,999
expects you to survive at
least six weeks of being here.

148
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,083
Would you like that, in
six weeks, to still be alive?

149
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,458
- Jawohl, sir.
- Then walk quicker

150
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:40,192
and stop dragging your feet
like you would do at home.

151
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,948
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

152
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,115
Hurry up.

153
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,704
We're not at a tea party here.

154
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,123
Gas!

155
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,957
- Gas!
- Gas!

156
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,661
Gas!

157
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,948
Gas!

158
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,832
Gas masks on!

159
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,458
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

160
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,866
If the French could aim better,

161
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:13,286
you could scrape us all off the road
with a spoon and bury us in a saucepan.

162
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,246
But one thing that's as
certain as amen in church.

163
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,083
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

164
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,408
Eyes straight ahead.

165
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,662
- Are you deaf?
- No, sir.

166
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,454
I was just trying to put my mask on.

167
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:54,489
Paul Bäumer, you will almost
certainly be dead by dawn.

168
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,083
You should eat something, man.

169
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,370
Attention! Gas masks off!

170
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,328
Gas masks off!

171
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Not you.

172
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,034
You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

173
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,707
Both you and that useless pig.

174
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,582
Fall in line. March.

175
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,865
Fall in line!

176
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:16,374
Stay together and keep moving!

177
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,165
Come on, hurry up!

178
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,073
Go!

179
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:40,160
Come on. Paul, come on.
Give me your knapsack.

180
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,994
Next time, you carry mine.

181
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,333
Congratulations, soldiers.

182
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,158
This is your home now.

183
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,243
Helmets off.

184
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,624
I see the men have been enjoying
themselves in my absence, Steinberger.

185
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,415
We were under barrage all night.

186
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,573
The men are a mess.

187
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,124
I think dry boots would
be a good place to begin.

188
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,874
Oh, you'd rather we all drown then?

189
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,825
Everyone pitch in!
Come on, bail out the trench.

190
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:17,375
Get in line to bail the water!

191
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,199
What are you waiting for, Bäumer?

192
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:26,081
Why are you still loitering here?
Go and help bail out the trenches.

193
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,661
Throw a dog a piece of meat.

194
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,374
Come on, all of you!

195
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,948
It will always snap it up.

196
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,865
Give a man power...

197
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,323
Man is a beast.

198
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:41,448
Drink.

199
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,371
Katczinsky, come over here.
Give us a hand.

200
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,123
Tonight, it'll be even worse.

201
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,035
Sorry.

202
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:27,875
Forget it.

203
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,454
Somehow, this isn't how I imagined it.

204
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,675
Just shut up, Ludwig.

205
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,367
My hands.
I can't feel my hands any more.

206
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:45,842
Stick them down your underwear.

207
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,453
It always works for me.

208
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,975
That will make
it shoot better, will it?

209
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:46,217
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

210
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,706
That sound. Listen.

211
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,375
There's nothing there.

212
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,286
Our first French to shoot.

213
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,290
Calm down, Paulchen.

214
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:10,967
There's someone out there.

215
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:23,042
Who's there?

216
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,240
Hey.

217
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,175
Show yourself!

218
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,499
Oh, no, no, no!

219
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:51,325
I'm hit! I'm hit! I've been hit! Get off!

220
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:54,458
- No, Paul. No.
- What's going on?

221
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,542
You're fine.

222
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:03,750
What is it?

223
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,667
The others, over there. They shot at me.

224
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,033
They saw the flash of your muzzle.

225
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,874
From now on, keep your heads down.

226
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,208
If you don't want to catch
the next bullet with your teeth,

227
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:21,374
move ten meters to the left.

228
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:24,120
Shoot, change cover.
Shoot, change cover. Understand?

229
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:26,708
Yeah.

230
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:43,282
Come on. Paul.

231
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:36,080
Take cover! Take cover! Alarm!

232
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,081
Here!

233
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:43,329
Bäumer, come here. Quickly, come on.

234
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,910
Into the bunker!

235
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,866
Inside! Inside! Inside!

236
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,508
Be careful what you eat.

237
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,995
That's what my mother said.

238
00:25:16,417 --> 00:25:18,208
- We'll always be together, won't we?
- Yeah.

239
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,192
We'll stick together. We'll always be.

240
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:25,155
I can't do this, Paul.
I can't do this. I need to go home.

241
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,783
I need to go home.

242
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:48,202
Creeping barrage.

243
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,198
What?

244
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:55,499
Every couple of minutes,

245
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,883
the artillery barrage
makes an advance forward.

246
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,911
And directly after that,

247
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:02,574
the infantry moves forward.

248
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,700
What are you saying, exactly?

249
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,248
That's how they come.

250
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:29,292
Where are you going?

251
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,323
I'll come back.

252
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,118
It's nearly over.

253
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:36,033
- No! Let me go.
- Stay where you are.

254
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,708
- Let me out of here. I want to get out.
- Calm down.

255
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,081
Calm yourself.

256
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:46,448
No!

257
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,207
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

258
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,865
Out!

259
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,790
Hey, that's Paul!

260
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:58,791
Albert!

261
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:00,658
Come here, we found Paul!

262
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:10,327
Paul!

263
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:13,698
Are you all right?

264
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:16,375
Is everything all right, Paul?

265
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,574
Come on. Paul, come on.

266
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,831
I'll help you.

267
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,458
Come on. Get up, will you? Sit down.

268
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:23,708
Are you injured?

269
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:25,533
Paul, are you injured?

270
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,666
- Can you hear me?
- We need help over here!

271
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,150
- See you later, Paul.
- We'll see you later, Paul.

272
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:43,241
Go on! Go on!

273
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,198
Here's another one.

274
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:50,123
We need help!

275
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:54,541
Steady.

276
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:56,375
Steady.

277
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:02,541
That's it.

278
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:05,532
I've got you.

279
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,039
Careful, careful.

280
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,366
Now we're in camp. Sit down.

281
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:21,392
You're all right.

282
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:24,292
Nice one. Let's have a look at you.

283
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,490
Hold still, hold still.

284
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:30,417
Yeah, you're going to be all right.

285
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,475
Right, put pressure on it.
Don't let him get up.

286
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:48,658
Katczinsky, back to work.

287
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,289
And you? Are you injured?

288
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:51,625
No.

289
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,749
Then start gathering.

290
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,415
Man, man, man!

291
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,407
No rest for the wicked.

292
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,414
It's the same every day.

293
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:04,783
Come on! Keep working!

294
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,789
We don't have all day.

295
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,787
Albrecht, Karl. Diepholz.

296
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:24,698
18 MONTHS LATER

297
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:27,867
September 14th, 1898.

298
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:35,375
Blumenthal, Samuel.

299
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:40,615
Dresden. November 6th, 1900.

300
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,407
Yesterday was his birthday.

301
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:49,408
Von Gallwitz, Gustav.

302
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,824
Osnabrück, June 20th, '99.

303
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:57,657
Götz Lüttwitz...

304
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:58,666
That's enough.

305
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:10,659
SUPREME ARMY COMMAND
7 NOVEMBER, 1918

306
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,666
- She's a looker.
- Let's see.

307
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,900
She's all right.

308
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:37,577
Herr Erzberger.

309
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,328
God be with us.

310
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,663
Once more, over 40,000 killed
in the last few weeks alone.

311
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:56,249
That should convince the general staff.

312
00:35:57,792 --> 00:35:59,908
I think the gentlemen know it's over.

313
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,581
We all know that.

314
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,248
The General Field Marshal.

315
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,039
CHAMPAGNE, FRANCE OCCUPIED TERRITORY

316
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,116
- Thank you.
- Jawohl.

317
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:12,291
Paul, if we keep up this pace,

318
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,707
we won't have conquered
France for 130 years.

319
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,492
I worked it out.

320
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,249
Don't let them catch you, Kat.

321
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:22,868
Never.

322
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:33,916
Come on.

323
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,783
Explain to me how this is
worth dying for in your mind.

324
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:43,467
When you're starving, you'll do anything.

325
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,160
Qui va là?

326
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,533
Oh, putain!

327
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:40,409
Attends je vais flinguer ce fumier!

328
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:41,907
Kat?

329
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:45,375
Kat?

330
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:47,708
Run!

331
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,675
Hey! Dirty Kraut!

332
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,874
- Rends-moi l'oie, ordure!
- Run!

333
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,164
Fumier!

334
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,749
- Just right.
- I told you.

335
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:14,041
Men, you are heroes.

336
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,749
Shut the door or the others will smell it.

337
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,083
Nice work.

338
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,291
I don't know.
How am I supposed to remember anything?

339
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:23,708
Come on, use your Prussian brain.

340
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:25,458
Here. Open-eyed and long-fingered.

341
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:26,916
Help me with the goose.

342
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,900
A piece of goose from the goose.
From France to Franz.

343
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:31,041
I want a wing.

344
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:33,124
Do I have to share?
Then I'll take the rest.

345
00:39:33,208 --> 00:39:34,041
Fill up my bowl.

346
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,413
Come here, you blind hen.
Wide-mouth frog...

347
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,790
Rest in peace in the drumfire.

348
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:42,914
Oh, God.

349
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,033
You know I'll owe you forever for this.

350
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:12,578
It's not bad, is it?

351
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:14,577
Yes.

352
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,366
- And you?
- Yes. Yes, good.

353
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,532
It's good, Paul.

354
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:22,664
Good, Kat.

355
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:23,823
Life is short.

356
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:28,035
- Where's Emil when you need him?
- Emil, bring in coffee and caviar!

357
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:31,075
Yes, and draw my foot bath as well.
I need a foot bath.

358
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,744
- Kat?
- What is it?

359
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,583
<i>The goose has been stolen,
give it back</i>

360
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,333
<i>Give it, give it, give it back</i>

361
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:42,517
<i>The goose has been stolen,
give it back</i>

362
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,749
- The farmer! The farmer!
- The farmer! Yes!

363
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:47,955
<i>Otherwise the farmer
will shoot you with his rifle</i>

364
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:51,743
<i>Otherwise the farmer
will shoot you with his rifle</i>

365
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,658
<i>Shoot you with his rifle</i>

366
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:18,499
Tjaden sits very quietly and says...

367
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:21,200
Where is he? Cross.
I keep hearing, Cross.

368
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,332
My father was leader of Nazareth.

369
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,412
Leader of Nazareth?
inquires the teacher.

370
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:28,039
What? Never heard of it.

371
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:30,499
Tjaden, go back home
and ask again, will you?

372
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:33,871
Next morning, Tjaden springs
into school and says to everybody...

373
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:37,160
Please forgive me.
My father wasn't the leader of Nazareth.

374
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,808
My father was last seen with Nadja Roth.

375
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,373
Brilliant.

376
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,541
Look.

377
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,874
Regarder!

378
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:16,828
Hey! Hello!

379
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,160
Come here!

380
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,331
Fresh baguette!

381
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,115
For you!

382
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,203
Liverwurst, love!

383
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,869
Lots of love!

384
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,325
Franz. What are you doing?

385
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:47,322
- Take me with you.
- Come on!

386
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:53,828
I'd go over.

387
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,783
But he's making a fool of himself.

388
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,541
Oh, my.
You are very beautiful, my love.

389
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,198
Franz!

390
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,625
The dark-haired beauty is for me!

391
00:43:15,167 --> 00:43:16,373
What is he doing?

392
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,000
Franz!

393
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,032
Goodbye!

394
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:28,704
Goodbye, my friends!

395
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:40,373
Damn it.

396
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:45,500
If it was all over, you
know what I'd be doing?

397
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,374
There's no peace, so it doesn't matter.

398
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,908
No, but if there was...

399
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,208
- We'd be surrounded by women again.
- Yeah, that's true.

400
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,624
I wouldn't put
trousers on for eight days.

401
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:58,916
I should really be spanking your backside
for talking about something like that.

402
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,050
What about you, Paul?

403
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:04,655
- No idea. Can't think.
- I'd stay with the Prussians.

404
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:06,808
You're an idiot, Tjaden.

405
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,999
Have you ever
done any peat digging?

406
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,118
Try it sometime.

407
00:44:10,292 --> 00:44:12,583
Can't be worse than
digging trenches in Champagne.

408
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,624
It takes longer than digging
trenches in Champagne.

409
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,758
And you can't get away with not doing it.

410
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:19,492
In peacetime military life,
you have no concerns.

411
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:22,534
Mornings, food's there
or else you're not there.

412
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:24,999
And then you have the softest bed.

413
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:26,958
Every week with fresh sheets over it.

414
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:27,875
And then...

415
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,450
And before you know it, I'm a corporal.

416
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:35,155
Imagine that.
Me becoming a military policeman.

417
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,074
A Cognac here, a pint there.

418
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,242
A military policeman is
everyone's good friend. Everyone.

419
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:41,967
There's just one catch, Tjaden.

420
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:44,410
What's that?

421
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:46,733
You'll never be a
corporal though, will you?

422
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:58,408
You always make such useless comments.

423
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:00,683
What does it matter what you think anyway?

424
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,994
- Kat! Kat!
- Here!

425
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,123
- Kat!
- Here!

426
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:20,125
Kat!

427
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:17,323
Darling one.

428
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:20,683
You asked us for a
package of food to be sent.

429
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:23,733
Four portions of sausage
are on their way with lard.

430
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,116
A couple of pieces of cake.

431
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:30,994
Sauerkraut and smoked wurst.

432
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:32,823
Some more...

433
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,786
- Hing? Hingfong?
- Hingfong.

434
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:37,492
And a cup of sugar.

435
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,083
Eggs and a glass of plum jam in there.

436
00:46:41,917 --> 00:46:45,467
Don't eat too quickly as I don't
want to have to send more right away.

437
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,916
I'd keep it away from your
comrades if I were you.

438
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,333
My dear one.

439
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,050
I must also ask a question of you.

440
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,500
Have you started to save up any money?

441
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:58,475
Could you send some
home would you think?

442
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:02,208
People are saying the war will
be over soon. Some people.

443
00:47:02,625 --> 00:47:05,125
And so it would be helpful
to have some saved up.

444
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:07,833
You're probably thinking,
what is she after?

445
00:47:07,917 --> 00:47:09,533
How cheeky of her to ask.

446
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:12,332
But I mean not to offend you.

447
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,707
You know me, I can never get enough.

448
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:18,292
But more, more. I can't help it,
I always want some more.

449
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:21,425
So make sure not to fall over
before you can come home.

450
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:25,996
Karl Lemmer is in a hospital
bed somewhere in the East.

451
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,950
Something with his stomach.

452
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:30,908
And he was out there for
barely three weeks in total.

453
00:47:32,042 --> 00:47:34,500
Can't you also be sick,
with your rheumatism?

454
00:47:35,958 --> 00:47:37,744
You've already played your role.

455
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:42,358
If only she could see how
you're sitting there, with your cigar.

456
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:48,082
This Sunday, I'll visit the gra...

457
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,287
This Sunday, I'll visit
the grave of our boy.

458
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:03,780
I'll make sure to read to him
as you remember he loved that.

459
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:09,375
By next year, we'll be able to
celebrate his tenth birthday together.

460
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:14,308
That's all I have to tell you this time.

461
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,824
Sending kisses from your wife, for you.

462
00:48:17,542 --> 00:48:18,452
Auf wiedersehen.

463
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,910
I had no idea.

464
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,664
Oh, Paul.

465
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,700
How is all this going to work out, hmm?

466
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:46,657
Returning to a home,

467
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,911
having to go back to our normal being.

468
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:54,317
Where all everyone wants to know
about are the battles we've been in.

469
00:48:56,958 --> 00:49:00,280
We'll be like travelers who belong
in another country elsewhere.

470
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:04,657
Sometimes I wonder...

471
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:06,698
Would...

472
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:10,163
Would I be happier with you here at camp?

473
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,994
Tjaden and Kropp.

474
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:15,074
And with Müller. He'd be sat with us.

475
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:18,328
And be eating fried potatoes.

476
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:20,081
Unpeeled.

477
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,118
Well...

478
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:41,032
That's enough of that.

479
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:46,207
How long until we finally get going again?

480
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:49,825
How long until
we finally get going again?

481
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:09,240
Franz?

482
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,833
Yes?

483
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,241
Tomorrow, we're up at six o'clock.

484
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:15,873
To look for some children.

485
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:17,618
What happened?

486
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:21,142
They should have arrived today.

487
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,368
A whole company.

488
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,083
How was it?

489
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:33,661
- Good.
- Yeah?

490
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:35,250
Yes.

491
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:38,541
Here.

492
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:44,875
Have a smell.

493
00:50:57,417 --> 00:50:58,748
What's her name?

494
00:50:58,917 --> 00:50:59,827
Eloise.

495
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:03,493
Eloise.

496
00:51:04,542 --> 00:51:07,705
She had skin as white as milk.

497
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,664
Breasts...

498
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,490
Hey.

499
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,633
I want to smell it too.

500
00:51:20,208 --> 00:51:21,308
Kropp, let me have it.

501
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:23,783
- Here.
- Oh, my.

502
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:24,791
Give it to me.

503
00:51:24,917 --> 00:51:27,705
A girl like that
never has dirt under her nails.

504
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:30,082
- No.
- At worst, some sand from the seashore.

505
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,956
Tjaden.

506
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:34,666
- Come on, pass it here.
- I bet she bathes twice a day.

507
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:41,162
Tjaden, give it back to me.

508
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:57,250
Sir.

509
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:06,869
Call the others.

510
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,650
There must have been a huge explosion.

511
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:49,869
Mine thrower cannons.

512
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,658
He's been blasted
right out of his uniform.

513
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:00,083
Was he one of those we've come here for?

514
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,750
No, they've only been
missing since yesterday.

515
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:05,833
He's been
hanging there for some time.

516
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:07,118
Not pleasant.

517
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:09,408
Don't get soft now, men.

518
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:11,499
How many are we looking for?

519
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:13,039
Sixty young recruits.

520
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:21,953
Breakfast is turnip bread.

521
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:23,999
Same at lunchtime, it's turnip bread.

522
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:26,883
I'm surrounded by turnip bread.
I can't face it any more.

523
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:30,058
Let me know when you find them.
I'm not going any further.

524
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:31,740
Gas.

525
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:36,077
There was gas here.

526
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,990
Shit!

527
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:56,917
Hello, madam.

528
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:01,282
I'm Kropp.

529
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:06,702
And you?

530
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:19,916
Do you want to...

531
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,915
Do you want to come with me?

532
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:28,916
Not a problem.

533
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:24,243
Kat?

534
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:27,993
Kat.

535
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:30,583
Kat!

536
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,573
Shit.

537
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:49,658
Flipping idiots.

538
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:53,204
Stupid boys.
They took their masks off too soon.

539
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,161
Germany will soon be empty.

540
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:19,786
COMPIÈGNE, FRANCE 8 NOVEMBER, 1918

541
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:22,208
General.

542
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:26,408
Well, Brixdorf, what's the latest?

543
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,124
The French are increasing the pressure.

544
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:30,916
Early this morning, our
reconnaissance intercepted orders

545
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,241
summoning entire divisions to Latierre.

546
00:58:33,417 --> 00:58:36,166
A tank fleet is still reportedly
still stuck at Fernancourt.

547
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,866
Must mean an attack is likely.

548
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:42,413
The social democrats will be
the end of mankind, Brixdorf.

549
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:45,868
General?

550
00:58:50,417 --> 00:58:53,416
I have just put a German delegation
to the armistice negotiations

551
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,911
on the train to Compiègne.

552
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:05,489
These people, Brixdorf,
are selling out our fatherland.

553
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:08,578
My orders are war.

554
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:13,330
And all the while that is the
case, I shall fight for every meter.

555
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:18,079
We have to hold on now
and wait for fresh troops.

556
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:21,250
In a few months, the incoming
class of recruits will be here.

557
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:24,041
The French are trying everything they can

558
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:26,625
to force their completely
unacceptable terms on us.

559
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:30,869
I will not capitulate.

560
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,663
We must strike without delay.
With all our might.

561
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,910
General.

562
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:06,494
From our position,

563
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,789
I have to be clear...

564
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:12,328
We all have to be clear...

565
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:14,865
For God's sake.

566
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:16,368
Shit.

567
01:00:48,875 --> 01:00:49,708
Sir!

568
01:01:00,458 --> 01:01:02,208
Soldiers, pack your bags,

569
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,954
roll up your bedding,
and wash your mess kits.

570
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:08,322
The whole regiment will
advance to the front firing position.

571
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,572
And I mean everyone who's
able to stand on two legs is going.

572
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,787
Line up, for God's sake.

573
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:18,572
You think the Frenchies will
wait for you to comb your pubes?

574
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,416
- Here we go again.
- Get moving!

575
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,037
- Where to?
- Where to? Where to?

576
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:24,532
Into battle.

577
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:01,658
Monsieur le Maréchal is awaiting you.

578
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:10,536
I'll come back for you.

579
01:04:26,083 --> 01:04:27,164
Envious, huh?

580
01:04:45,292 --> 01:04:46,532
I stand before you

581
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:50,997
in the hope that you will take our
presence here today as an opportunity

582
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:53,750
to take action to suspend all hostilities.

583
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,744
In the name of humanity,

584
01:04:57,542 --> 01:05:00,624
I'm here asking you for an
agreement to an immediate cease-fire

585
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:03,700
for the entire duration
of our negotiating time

586
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:07,163
in order to spare our nation's
unnecessary depletion.

587
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:12,413
Matthias Erzberger, head
of the German delegation.

588
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:24,783
Weygand,
what do these gentlemen want?

589
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:26,657
I don't know.

590
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:29,983
Marshal Foch asks
what brings you gentlemen to him.

591
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:35,662
We are here looking forward to hearing

592
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,242
your proposal for an enduring cease-fire

593
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:42,541
that will include all those on the
water, on land, as well as in the sky.

594
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,708
I have no proposal of this kind to make.

595
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:53,008
What does he mean by that?

596
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:56,788
I think he disliked the
phrasing of what you said.

597
01:05:58,333 --> 01:05:59,243
Yes.

598
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:00,956
Good, then...

599
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:05,623
Monsieur Le Maréchal,

600
01:06:05,792 --> 01:06:09,365
if you please, we
would like to know the conditions...

601
01:06:18,417 --> 01:06:20,867
He wants
you to ask for it, formally.

602
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,369
Monsieur le Maréchal...

603
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,707
I am asking you for an armistice.

604
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,041
We are asking for an armistice.

605
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,783
You have 72 hours to
accept our conditions.

606
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:48,083
You have 72 hours to
accept our conditions.

607
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:49,999
They are non-negotiable.

608
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:51,453
Seventy-two hours?

609
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,249
The war will continue until you sign them.

610
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:54,383
Monsieur le Maréchal,

611
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:58,121
in God's name, don't let
72 hours pass us by here.

612
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:02,675
Thousands of lives depend on it.

613
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:09,058
Sign then.

614
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:25,873
Understood.

615
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:46,574
- Soldiers, we'll march.
- Sir.

616
01:07:49,917 --> 01:07:51,032
Soldiers, march.

617
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:53,323
March, soldiers.

618
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,414
Soldiers, march.

619
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:00,275
Off you go, get out of here.

620
01:08:01,292 --> 01:08:02,248
March, soldiers.

621
01:08:03,917 --> 01:08:04,782
March.

622
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:06,789
Soldiers, march.

623
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,949
March, soldiers. Off you go.

624
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:01,244
Go, go, go!

625
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,661
Atención aux arbalètes...

626
01:09:55,917 --> 01:09:57,749
Allez! Allez les gars!

627
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,206
Allez! Allez!

628
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:33,208
Keep going, Paul. Come on. Paul!

629
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:41,623
Allez!

630
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:51,790
Au renfort!

631
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,490
Putain, putain, non, non!

632
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:57,327
Get out!

633
01:12:03,042 --> 01:12:04,248
What is that?

634
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:06,250
Get out!

635
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:10,249
- Here!
- Quick, quick, quick! Move it!

636
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:11,532
Get out!

637
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:12,448
There, there, look!

638
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:13,624
- What is it?
- Down there.

639
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:14,448
What is it?

640
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:50,282
Open fire!

641
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:52,915
Open fire!

642
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:36,165
All down!

643
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,368
Get down!

644
01:14:02,792 --> 01:14:04,829
Boys, think fast! Be smart!

645
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:28,758
Get the hand grenades out!

646
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:32,092
Throw them in the vehicle
when they're on top of us.

647
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:00,166
Get out!

648
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:02,118
Get up!

649
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:11,500
Franz!

650
01:15:11,667 --> 01:15:13,167
Follow me. Come on, follow me!

651
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:16,073
Franz!

652
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:18,289
Paul!

653
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,615
Paul.

654
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:04,702
Paul!

655
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,748
Open fire!

656
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:36,578
Retreat!

657
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:38,914
Retreat!

658
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:57,242
No, no, no!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! No!

659
01:17:57,417 --> 01:18:00,125
Please, please, no! No, no, no!

660
01:18:00,292 --> 01:18:03,250
No, wait, wait, don't shoot.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. No.

661
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:04,250
- No, no!
- Albert.

662
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:14,699
Come on, come on.

663
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:16,161
Come on!

664
01:18:21,875 --> 01:18:22,831
Keep going!

665
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:50,323
Where is Franz?

666
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,661
I've left Franz alone!

667
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:00,282
Katczinsky!

668
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,741
Take the machine gun and retreat.

669
01:19:02,917 --> 01:19:05,579
We'll regroup in Eguisac,
two kilometers northeast.

670
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,662
I miss my comrades, sir.
I miss them all!

671
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,036
I miss my mother, for God's sake.

672
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:15,666
Grenades, ammunition! Come on!

673
01:19:17,542 --> 01:19:18,657
Paul, come on!

674
01:19:26,917 --> 01:19:28,874
Get out of here! Let's go!

675
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:49,333
These aren't negotiations,
this is a dictate.

676
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:52,749
Maybe we should return to Spa
to consult with the general staff.

677
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:54,791
And what expectations
do you have for that?

678
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:57,225
Even if we end up
losing definitively after all,

679
01:19:57,333 --> 01:19:59,666
we won't be worse off than
we are with this surrender.

680
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,749
Except for a few hundred
thousand extra deaths.

681
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:03,666
Alsace-Lorraine,
occupation of the Rhineland,

682
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:05,916
cannons, locomotives,
trains, and whatever else.

683
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,124
You are aware, this
is a total capitulation.

684
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:12,452
250,000 Americans are
landing each month in Europe.

685
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:16,072
Marne, Cantigny, Cambrai.
All of those lost.

686
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:19,208
All that's left separating
us from an armistice

687
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:20,782
is false pride, as I see it.

688
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:22,291
Thanks to you and your commanders,

689
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:24,541
we're here dealing with
the mess left by them.

690
01:20:24,625 --> 01:20:27,083
I'm happy for you to
depart here, it's down to you.

691
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:28,267
We are remaining here.

692
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:35,748
It is winter.

693
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,038
Without trains and provisions,
Bolshevism will take over.

694
01:20:40,875 --> 01:20:42,958
On their way home, the
men will die of hunger

695
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:45,374
instead of dying with
honor on the battlefield.

696
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:47,490
Honor?

697
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:52,291
My son was killed in the war.
He doesn't feel any honor.

698
01:20:58,583 --> 01:20:59,698
Von Helldorf.

699
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:03,208
Please get a few copies of
the conditions of their proposal

700
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:05,374
and telegraph them to headquarters.

701
01:21:05,542 --> 01:21:06,842
You inform the government.

702
01:21:10,292 --> 01:21:12,329
We have 72 hours left here, gentlemen,

703
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,833
and during every minute
we waste by talking about it,

704
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:16,282
there dies another soldier.

705
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:20,655
Let us gain mercy where
we can, but for God's sake,

706
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,581
let's make peace.

707
01:22:07,917 --> 01:22:10,249
Retreat! Retreat!

708
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:17,332
Run! Run!

709
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:20,074
Keep firing!

710
01:23:19,167 --> 01:23:20,123
Shut up!

711
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:05,448
Shut up!

712
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:09,782
That's enough!

713
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:06,698
No, no, no.

714
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,166
Comrade.

715
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:11,207
Comrade, comrade.

716
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:14,675
So sorry.

717
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:17,039
So sorry.

718
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,207
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

719
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:00,287
DUVAL, GÈRARD TYPOGRAPHER

720
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:15,873
Your wife...

721
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:18,990
Your wife...

722
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:22,286
I promise... I promise...

723
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:24,664
I promise...

724
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,116
When were you born, Brixdorf?

725
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:18,283
1877, in June.

726
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:21,703
A summer child.

727
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:23,625
Yes.

728
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:28,081
What about your father?

729
01:30:30,375 --> 01:30:33,025
My family live in Holstein
and he has a factory there.

730
01:30:33,167 --> 01:30:35,534
Producing what?

731
01:30:37,417 --> 01:30:38,703
Riding saddles, general.

732
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:40,369
Riding saddles.

733
01:30:42,083 --> 01:30:45,451
Something that will always sell.
Your future is secure then.

734
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:48,456
I am indeed fortunate.

735
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:51,698
And?

736
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:54,567
Are you looking forward to going home?

737
01:30:55,542 --> 01:30:57,909
- When we are no longer needed here?
- Yes.

738
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:02,746
After the war, a position
of responsibility awaits me.

739
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:05,665
I will take over the business.

740
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:07,948
Congratulations.

741
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:09,493
And you?

742
01:31:11,917 --> 01:31:12,998
I'm a soldier.

743
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:17,074
My father was an officer in this regiment.

744
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,540
He fought in the three
wars under Bismarck.

745
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:22,706
He won all three of them.

746
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:25,579
In 1871, he marched on Paris

747
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,082
and when he returned, he was a hero.

748
01:31:31,917 --> 01:31:34,124
I was too late in being born, Brixdorf.

749
01:31:35,792 --> 01:31:37,749
It's been 50 years of no war.

750
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:40,703
What is a soldier without war?

751
01:31:47,875 --> 01:31:49,491
Were you and your father close?

752
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,456
As a child, maybe.

753
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:56,870
A man is alone when born.

754
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:58,581
He lives alone

755
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:01,203
and on his deathbed is alone.

756
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:32,367
THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED

757
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:33,994
Come in.

758
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:38,493
- Von Helldorf. How can I help you?
- Hindenburg.

759
01:32:38,667 --> 01:32:40,217
Open it immediately.

760
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:48,117
He urges us to sign.

761
01:32:51,375 --> 01:32:53,624
- It's over!
- We're going home!

762
01:32:53,708 --> 01:32:55,824
We're going home!

763
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:58,078
Back to our families.

764
01:33:06,542 --> 01:33:10,957
In the name of all who
are living in a world of sin.

765
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:14,663
We are surrounded by it now in the filth.

766
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,333
Knock on the monastery's door

767
01:33:18,417 --> 01:33:21,489
and you'll find only
thieves and scoundrels.

768
01:33:21,667 --> 01:33:24,375
It's finally over.
The fat pigs finally get it.

769
01:33:24,542 --> 01:33:28,615
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, do you hear that?

770
01:33:33,333 --> 01:33:34,915
Are there any sergeants left?

771
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:46,600
Chloroform the man, for God's sake.

772
01:34:00,542 --> 01:34:01,452
Bäumer.

773
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:03,458
Bäumer.

774
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:09,831
Bäumer.

775
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,536
Tjaden? Tjaden.

776
01:34:13,792 --> 01:34:14,782
What happened?

777
01:34:15,458 --> 01:34:16,541
Where have you been hit?

778
01:34:16,625 --> 01:34:17,615
Above the knee.

779
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:20,331
Or somewhere down there.

780
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:21,786
I can't feel anything.

781
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,290
How far up is the shot?

782
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:26,664
I can't raise my head.

783
01:34:28,667 --> 01:34:30,123
Ten centimetres, it seems.

784
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:36,166
You're going home soon, Tjaden.

785
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,116
- You think so?
- Yes, you are.

786
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:45,383
It's unlikely the police
force will have me though.

787
01:34:47,167 --> 01:34:48,282
God damn shit.

788
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,865
You can still do it.

789
01:34:53,042 --> 01:34:54,157
Just wait and see.

790
01:34:54,958 --> 01:34:56,869
I'm not going to let them amputate me.

791
01:34:58,292 --> 01:35:00,392
I'm not living as a cripple in this world.

792
01:35:00,792 --> 01:35:02,032
You won't have to.

793
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:05,108
There are others who are
worse off that they've patched up.

794
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,240
Oh, dear Paul.

795
01:35:10,958 --> 01:35:12,414
I have something to give you.

796
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,289
Is he dead?

797
01:35:51,083 --> 01:35:52,699
You must show braveness.

798
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:55,615
You're alive, remember?

799
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:57,533
For that, you have to be grateful.

800
01:35:58,375 --> 01:35:59,365
For us.

801
01:35:59,542 --> 01:36:01,792
- For those who didn't make it.
- That's enough.

802
01:36:01,917 --> 01:36:04,329
Look here. You mustn't say that. Not you.

803
01:36:19,792 --> 01:36:21,342
Good feeling, right?

804
01:36:22,292 --> 01:36:23,542
Have a bit of that then.

805
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:26,058
Yeah, dry your socks out there.

806
01:36:26,167 --> 01:36:28,117
The way the last summer was...

807
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,650
Right, none...

808
01:36:35,792 --> 01:36:36,873
You see?

809
01:36:37,042 --> 01:36:38,742
Not like the last one.

810
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:41,491
That was too...

811
01:36:44,875 --> 01:36:46,582
You always blame me.

812
01:36:46,750 --> 01:36:49,583
- We saw you!
- What did you see me doing?

813
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:51,664
Come on!

814
01:36:52,792 --> 01:36:54,157
Nah, we know it was you.

815
01:36:54,333 --> 01:36:56,033
Why is it always on me?

816
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,950
Do you have shit for brains?
Why won't you listen?

817
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:15,908
You have been given a
second company's provisions.

818
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:18,791
We are that second company!

819
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,949
So dish it out! Give it to us!

820
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:21,958
Kat?

821
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:23,911
- Kat!
- Paul?

822
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:24,916
Kat!

823
01:37:25,708 --> 01:37:26,618
Paul!

824
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:28,908
- Paul!
- Kat, you were alive.

825
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,536
- Paul!
- You're alive!

826
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:31,541
Paul.

827
01:37:39,875 --> 01:37:41,115
Tjaden was hit.

828
01:37:41,292 --> 01:37:42,742
He's lying inside the church.

829
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,749
He'll get a double portion from us.

830
01:37:45,833 --> 01:37:46,666
Yes.

831
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:52,786
Another one. In here.

832
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:58,572
I thought you were dead.

833
01:37:59,542 --> 01:38:00,992
At some point, we'll all die.

834
01:38:01,958 --> 01:38:03,658
But not on the home stretch.

835
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:07,675
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

836
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:14,666
Tjaden.

837
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:17,702
Tjaden.

838
01:38:21,917 --> 01:38:22,750
Yes.

839
01:38:23,542 --> 01:38:24,748
- Kat?
- Yes.

840
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:30,824
Kat.

841
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,411
I've soup here for you.

842
01:38:32,583 --> 01:38:33,999
Have you brought cutlery?

843
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:36,120
Yes, we brought cutlery as well.

844
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,911
There you go. Eat up.

845
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:09,825
Stop, stop, Tjaden, Tjaden!

846
01:39:10,333 --> 01:39:11,323
Stop!

847
01:39:15,417 --> 01:39:16,623
We need help over here!

848
01:39:17,875 --> 01:39:19,286
What made you do that?

849
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:20,291
Why would you?

850
01:39:21,208 --> 01:39:22,949
It's over for me.

851
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,411
He's bleeding out!

852
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:30,240
Tjaden.

853
01:39:35,417 --> 01:39:36,282
Tjaden.

854
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:11,785
What is it?

855
01:41:14,042 --> 01:41:15,342
I've lost something.

856
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,365
Kat, do you speak French?

857
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:24,283
S'il vous plaît. S'il vous plaît.

858
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:30,749
My mother always said it
was French I should learn.

859
01:41:35,042 --> 01:41:35,998
And the piano.

860
01:41:38,542 --> 01:41:40,078
She also warned me of war.

861
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:41,791
She didn't want me to go.

862
01:41:41,875 --> 01:41:45,175
That's not for you, she always said.
You'll be dead in no time.

863
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:48,883
I wanted to show that I could do it.

864
01:41:49,708 --> 01:41:51,119
What use is that now?

865
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:56,658
A couple of weeks, we'll be in Paris.

866
01:41:59,333 --> 01:42:02,458
These past two years of grenades
can't be shed like an item of clothing.

867
01:42:02,542 --> 01:42:05,125
- Paul.
- The stench will remain on us forever.

868
01:42:05,292 --> 01:42:07,208
- Enough.
- Ludwig is dead. Franz is dead. Albert...

869
01:42:07,292 --> 01:42:08,532
Is that to do with us?

870
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,332
They don't suffer any more.

871
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:12,789
Peace for them.

872
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:16,448
We're still alive.

873
01:42:20,875 --> 01:42:22,536
Everything here is like a fever.

874
01:42:23,292 --> 01:42:25,642
Not one person wants
it but suddenly it's there.

875
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:28,874
We didn't ask for it.
The others didn't ask for it.

876
01:42:28,958 --> 01:42:30,166
But nonetheless it happened

877
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:32,249
and nonetheless half the
world is involved, mind you.

878
01:42:32,333 --> 01:42:33,368
God looks down

879
01:42:34,792 --> 01:42:36,078
at us murderers.

880
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,490
Yeah, well.

881
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,365
But what do I know?

882
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:47,868
Nothing.

883
01:42:48,667 --> 01:42:50,317
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

884
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:54,415
Get some rest. We're the lucky ones.

885
01:42:54,917 --> 01:42:55,750
Yes.

886
01:43:13,792 --> 01:43:14,657
Kat?

887
01:43:18,833 --> 01:43:20,383
What did your son die of?

888
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:26,416
The pox.

889
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:36,703
I'm afraid of what's to come.

890
01:43:44,083 --> 01:43:44,993
Don't be.

891
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:18,118
Henri.

892
01:44:21,708 --> 01:44:22,823
Taste it.

893
01:44:26,833 --> 01:44:27,914
Were they made today?

894
01:44:30,917 --> 01:44:32,874
I'm sorry, sir. I don't think so.

895
01:44:57,292 --> 01:44:58,453
Monsieur le Maréchal.

896
01:45:05,875 --> 01:45:06,990
I'm listening.

897
01:45:07,167 --> 01:45:09,124
The Kaiser has abdicated.

898
01:45:09,208 --> 01:45:13,657
Soldiers are refusing to obey orders.
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

899
01:45:13,833 --> 01:45:16,245
The new government
will do everything it can

900
01:45:16,417 --> 01:45:18,875
to fulfill the duties imposed on it,

901
01:45:19,042 --> 01:45:22,706
but the population,
through no fault of its own,

902
01:45:23,375 --> 01:45:25,742
faces hunger and anarchy setting in.

903
01:45:25,917 --> 01:45:29,124
This is a disease of
the defeated, not of the victorious.

904
01:45:29,208 --> 01:45:30,494
I don't fear it.

905
01:45:30,667 --> 01:45:32,203
I reject any compromise.

906
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:33,958
I reject any compromise.

907
01:45:34,042 --> 01:45:36,033
Monsieur le Maréchal, please.

908
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:40,493
Be fair to your opponent or
else this peace will be hated.

909
01:45:40,667 --> 01:45:41,532
Fair?

910
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:46,457
You speak of fairness?

911
01:46:00,625 --> 01:46:01,740
Sign it.

912
01:47:06,250 --> 01:47:07,749
Let the minutes record.

913
01:47:09,375 --> 01:47:13,073
The armistice here signed shall
take effect in six hours from now

914
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:16,914
at the eleventh hour, on the
eleventh day of the eleventh month.

915
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:20,725
Very good.

916
01:47:21,292 --> 01:47:22,407
The war is over.

917
01:47:36,583 --> 01:47:38,666
What are you going to do now?

918
01:47:40,417 --> 01:47:41,999
What do you see here, Brixdorf?

919
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,036
The plains of Latierre, general.

920
01:47:46,208 --> 01:47:47,041
Eguisac.

921
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,240
I see them too.

922
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:53,166
But also German soldiers
running away like cowards.

923
01:47:55,042 --> 01:47:57,416
The French troops are farting
on our position in Latierre

924
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:00,041
and outside there's a train
crammed full of horse fuckers

925
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:01,775
who are selling the homeland off.

926
01:48:05,542 --> 01:48:07,642
See to it that all recruits are withdrawn.

927
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:10,081
Have them all report here.

928
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,287
We're going to sort out this pile of shit!

929
01:48:24,083 --> 01:48:28,407
Any communication
with the enemy remains prohibited.

930
01:48:28,583 --> 01:48:33,407
Firstly, hostilities on the entire
front will be ceased this morning,

931
01:48:33,583 --> 01:48:35,665
November 11th at eleven o'clock.

932
01:48:36,417 --> 01:48:39,079
Secondly, the troops will
not cross the line reached

933
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:41,287
on this day at this hour.

934
01:48:41,458 --> 01:48:45,497
The front line shall remain
unchanged past this hour.

935
01:48:45,667 --> 01:48:48,625
All troops are to return to their station.

936
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,600
What time is it?

937
01:48:56,417 --> 01:48:58,417
- Why aren't you asleep?
- Listen a minute.

938
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,115
It's so still.

939
01:49:05,667 --> 01:49:07,032
I must be going deaf.

940
01:49:13,417 --> 01:49:14,782
They've signed, Paul.

941
01:49:19,542 --> 01:49:20,577
The war's over.

942
01:49:22,542 --> 01:49:23,498
It's over.

943
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:30,240
Are you hungry?

944
01:49:31,208 --> 01:49:32,369
I'm hungry.

945
01:49:37,375 --> 01:49:38,786
Where are you going?

946
01:49:38,958 --> 01:49:41,058
Come on, before the bastard wakes up.

947
01:49:43,125 --> 01:49:46,197
- What are you doing for Christmas, Paul?
- I don't know.

948
01:49:46,375 --> 01:49:48,036
I'm gonna roast a goose.

949
01:49:48,625 --> 01:49:50,332
Red cabbage, potatoes...

950
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:53,037
Then I'll light all the
candles and kiss my wife.

951
01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:55,745
My God, Paul, she is beautiful.

952
01:49:55,917 --> 01:49:56,873
Yeah?

953
01:49:57,042 --> 01:49:59,249
- What does she look like?
- Well...

954
01:49:59,833 --> 01:50:02,165
Long curly hair, dark.

955
01:50:02,833 --> 01:50:05,074
And she's buxom and strong.

956
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:06,083
Yeah?

957
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:09,410
Christmas.

958
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:11,615
It's all so far away still.

959
01:50:12,167 --> 01:50:14,017
No, it's not. It's really close.

960
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:20,583
We want another child. Or children, Paul.

961
01:50:20,750 --> 01:50:24,118
Because what is Christmas
without children? It's nothing, really.

962
01:50:26,875 --> 01:50:27,865
You know when...

963
01:50:28,667 --> 01:50:30,417
Once we're back home, then we will...

964
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,991
- Yeah?
- We must do something together.

965
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:35,874
The two of us together.
Something big, yeah?

966
01:50:35,958 --> 01:50:36,791
Yeah, yeah.

967
01:50:38,792 --> 01:50:39,657
What is it?

968
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:42,995
I'm a shoemaker, Paul. I repair shoes.

969
01:50:43,542 --> 01:50:47,080
You know how to read, write.
You finished school.

970
01:50:48,083 --> 01:50:49,683
Hasn't done me any good though.

971
01:50:50,542 --> 01:50:51,623
What are we gonna do?

972
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:53,744
Sole shoes together?

973
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:55,900
Are you trying to insult me?

974
01:50:57,125 --> 01:50:59,125
I can't read my wife's letters even now.

975
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:01,858
You're going to university, Paul.

976
01:51:02,542 --> 01:51:03,992
Or I'll shoot you right here.

977
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:07,448
My trousers are loose.

978
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:11,539
My trousers are loose.

979
01:51:14,083 --> 01:51:16,083
You'll just have to eat something.

980
01:51:16,792 --> 01:51:19,592
Soon we'll be home then
we can eat whatever we want.

981
01:51:20,292 --> 01:51:21,157
Whatever we want.

982
01:51:46,417 --> 01:51:47,407
It's your go.

983
01:51:48,083 --> 01:51:50,074
If the farmer catches me again,

984
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:52,124
then he's bound to shoot
me down where I stand.

985
01:51:56,458 --> 01:51:58,290
Just be careful of the damn dog too.

986
01:51:58,458 --> 01:51:59,291
Yeah.

987
01:52:50,708 --> 01:52:52,790
Hey, hey, hey.

988
01:53:13,208 --> 01:53:14,164
Look.

989
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:18,539
It's really good.

990
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:22,750
Want some?

991
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:26,160
Shit.

992
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,991
Piece of garbage...

993
01:54:17,208 --> 01:54:18,198
Stop!

994
01:54:19,167 --> 01:54:20,282
Thief!

995
01:54:28,875 --> 01:54:30,491
Kat! Run!

996
01:54:31,375 --> 01:54:32,365
Run!

997
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:35,250
Asshole!

998
01:54:40,958 --> 01:54:41,791
God damn!

999
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:45,033
We'll kill them, these sons of bitches.

1000
01:55:02,292 --> 01:55:03,657
Oh, crap.

1001
01:55:03,833 --> 01:55:05,164
- Look at this.
- What is it?

1002
01:55:06,125 --> 01:55:08,082
- A lucky shot.
- He hit the eggs!

1003
01:55:09,958 --> 01:55:11,039
Stop the flow.

1004
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:17,786
Come on, get it in there.

1005
01:55:18,875 --> 01:55:19,910
There you go.

1006
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:24,206
We can have an omelet.

1007
01:55:24,375 --> 01:55:26,412
No, we'll eat them now.

1008
01:55:26,583 --> 01:55:27,633
They're just as good.

1009
01:55:46,333 --> 01:55:47,414
Better than ever.

1010
01:55:49,208 --> 01:55:50,118
I won't be long.

1011
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:28,410
Kat?

1012
01:57:33,333 --> 01:57:34,494
Kat?

1013
01:57:38,875 --> 01:57:39,740
Kat!

1014
01:57:41,958 --> 01:57:42,993
What happened?

1015
01:57:43,917 --> 01:57:44,750
We should leave.

1016
01:57:46,625 --> 01:57:47,660
Who fired the shot?

1017
01:57:48,167 --> 01:57:49,717
That little shit from the farm.

1018
01:57:50,667 --> 01:57:51,828
The farmer's son.

1019
01:57:53,875 --> 01:57:55,286
Kat, Kat.

1020
01:57:56,167 --> 01:57:57,202
What a mess.

1021
01:58:05,333 --> 01:58:06,198
How big is it?

1022
01:58:06,708 --> 01:58:08,995
Little finger.
I'll get the bullet out.

1023
01:58:09,167 --> 01:58:11,329
No. Give me a cigarette.

1024
01:58:12,542 --> 01:58:13,703
Let the medic do that.

1025
01:58:32,125 --> 01:58:34,375
They stuck me in a class
with seven-year-olds.

1026
01:58:36,125 --> 01:58:37,741
I'd begun shaving already.

1027
01:58:39,458 --> 01:58:40,539
Find me a word.

1028
01:58:42,667 --> 01:58:44,203
That trifle can rhyme with.

1029
01:58:48,292 --> 01:58:50,579
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

1030
01:58:57,167 --> 01:58:58,532
Fucking shit.

1031
01:58:59,958 --> 01:59:02,074
Why the hell did this have to happen now?

1032
01:59:05,917 --> 01:59:07,533
- Come on, we need to move.
- Yeah.

1033
01:59:14,708 --> 01:59:15,618
All right?

1034
01:59:16,667 --> 01:59:17,873
Kat?

1035
01:59:18,042 --> 01:59:19,166
Rifle.

1036
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:22,116
Rifle rhymes with trifle.

1037
01:59:32,083 --> 01:59:35,781
When we get home, you're
going to make a new pair of boots for me.

1038
01:59:35,958 --> 01:59:37,699
I'm walking my feet to the bone.

1039
01:59:52,292 --> 01:59:53,157
Hey!

1040
01:59:56,625 --> 01:59:57,740
Wait!

1041
01:59:59,333 --> 02:00:00,289
Pull over!

1042
02:00:00,875 --> 02:00:01,740
Let us on!

1043
02:00:02,917 --> 02:00:04,533
Hey! Let us on!

1044
02:00:15,667 --> 02:00:16,748
Come on, will you?

1045
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:53,365
This man needs care.

1046
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:56,911
Where is the medic?

1047
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,150
Could've spared
yourself the trouble.

1048
02:01:30,750 --> 02:01:31,600
He's dead.

1049
02:01:37,167 --> 02:01:39,534
But it's...
it's just a small bullet wound.

1050
02:01:40,167 --> 02:01:42,829
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

1051
02:01:43,375 --> 02:01:44,575
The organs are poisoned.

1052
02:01:51,417 --> 02:01:52,407
Unconscious.

1053
02:01:53,542 --> 02:01:54,375
No.

1054
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:55,956
He's dead.

1055
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:57,615
I know what I'm doing.

1056
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,788
Impossible. I was...
I was just talking to him.

1057
02:02:03,375 --> 02:02:04,490
He's unconscious.

1058
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:07,456
He's unconscious.

1059
02:02:14,875 --> 02:02:15,708
See?

1060
02:02:17,625 --> 02:02:20,413
He simply had bad luck.
Right before the end.

1061
02:04:09,125 --> 02:04:10,741
Go on, keep going!

1062
02:04:10,917 --> 02:04:12,203
Keep going!

1063
02:04:12,708 --> 02:04:14,324
Keep going, come on!

1064
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,081
This is it.

1065
02:04:26,250 --> 02:04:28,100
I'm going to tell him I'm going home.

1066
02:04:29,708 --> 02:04:30,698
It's over.

1067
02:04:32,542 --> 02:04:34,203
Attention!

1068
02:04:40,417 --> 02:04:41,373
Soldiers.

1069
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,162
We stand here as brothers

1070
02:04:45,125 --> 02:04:46,832
in a world of enemies

1071
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,833
and are forced to watch
as German social democrats

1072
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,867
render our beloved people defenseless

1073
02:04:54,167 --> 02:04:57,080
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

1074
02:04:59,125 --> 02:05:00,035
Comrades.

1075
02:05:01,083 --> 02:05:02,915
Soon you will be going home

1076
02:05:03,083 --> 02:05:05,415
to your parents, wives and children.

1077
02:05:06,375 --> 02:05:07,536
The war is over.

1078
02:05:08,250 --> 02:05:13,074
After years of sacrifice and suffering,
you can now look forward to your reward.

1079
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:17,914
To the reward of admiration
for all you have achieved here.

1080
02:05:19,417 --> 02:05:20,999
Ah, but comrades,

1081
02:05:22,417 --> 02:05:25,567
do you want to be welcomed as
soldiers and heroes on your return

1082
02:05:27,292 --> 02:05:28,157
or as weaklings

1083
02:05:28,333 --> 02:05:31,405
and cowards who tucked their
tails in when it really counted?

1084
02:05:31,583 --> 02:05:32,624
We're going home.

1085
02:05:32,708 --> 02:05:33,608
Soldiers.

1086
02:05:34,333 --> 02:05:38,247
We are about to attack them with
the utmost force and vehemence.

1087
02:05:38,958 --> 02:05:42,496
Latierre belongs in German hands.

1088
02:05:42,667 --> 02:05:47,537
We will seize the plains before 11:00 a.m.
and end this war with a merciless strike.

1089
02:05:47,708 --> 02:05:48,948
And make them see...

1090
02:05:50,083 --> 02:05:51,494
we were victorious.

1091
02:05:51,667 --> 02:05:56,582
Onwards, with God on our side as
he was with our fathers before us.

1092
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:59,333
I'm not going back into battle.
Not me!

1093
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:00,581
Shut up!

1094
02:06:01,875 --> 02:06:04,416
- Let me go!
- Follow your orders!

1095
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:06,291
Do as your told!

1096
02:06:06,375 --> 02:06:07,425
All of you, get back.

1097
02:06:08,083 --> 02:06:10,541
- Please, I didn't do anything!
- Aim!

1098
02:06:10,625 --> 02:06:13,287
- No! No!
- Fire!

1099
02:06:37,583 --> 02:06:38,833
Keep moving!

1100
02:06:41,667 --> 02:06:42,500
Come on!

1101
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:52,661
Company, halt!

1102
02:06:56,958 --> 02:06:59,120
Rifle off!

1103
02:06:59,292 --> 02:07:02,364
- Fix bayonets!
- Fix bayonets and load!

1104
02:07:17,417 --> 02:07:18,873
What time is it?

1105
02:07:19,042 --> 02:07:20,592
Fifteen minutes to go.

1106
02:07:57,625 --> 02:07:59,375
It belonged to Lefèvre.

1107
02:08:00,292 --> 02:08:02,192
Poor bastard, he saved it for the end.

1108
02:08:02,792 --> 02:08:05,079
- He won't need it anymore.
- Thank you, sir.

1109
02:08:09,375 --> 02:08:11,207
Here's to you and to Lefévre.

1110
02:08:17,542 --> 02:08:18,577
Well, it's good.

1111
02:08:22,208 --> 02:08:23,308
The nightmare is over.

1112
02:09:23,375 --> 02:09:26,333
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

1113
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:28,166
- In position!
- In position!

1114
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:32,081
Fire!

1115
02:09:32,958 --> 02:09:34,164
Fire!

1116
02:10:09,375 --> 02:10:11,375
Throw the grenades!

1117
02:10:21,792 --> 02:10:22,953
Charge!

1118
02:11:19,208 --> 02:11:21,119
Please, no! No, no!

1119
02:13:11,708 --> 02:13:13,324
Cease fire!

1120
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:14,956
It is 11:00 a.m.!

1121
02:13:15,625 --> 02:13:17,375
Cease fire!

1122
02:13:17,542 --> 02:13:19,533
Cease fire!

1123
02:13:20,542 --> 02:13:22,624
It is eleven o'clock.

1124
02:15:57,708 --> 02:16:00,575
A light!
Bring me a light! A light please!

1125
02:16:19,875 --> 02:16:21,975
Are you all right?

1126
02:16:22,875 --> 02:16:23,831
Yeah.

1127
02:16:24,667 --> 02:16:27,125
Well, then.
Start gathering, please.

1128
02:19:48,458 --> 02:19:52,031
Shortly after the start of
hostilities in October 1914,

1129
02:19:52,208 --> 02:19:54,950
the Western Front froze
into positional warfare.

1130
02:19:56,458 --> 02:20:02,739
By the end of the war in November 1918,
the front line had barely moved.

1131
02:20:04,417 --> 02:20:07,125
More than three million
soldiers died here,

1132
02:20:07,292 --> 02:20:10,785
often while fighting to gain only
a few hundred meters of ground.

1133
02:20:12,375 --> 02:20:18,701
Almost 17 million people lost
their lives in the First World War.

1134
02:20:20,875 --> 02:20:27,406
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT
