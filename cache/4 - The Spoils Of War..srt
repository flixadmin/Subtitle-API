1
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,172
Hold that wagon!

2
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Episode 4 - The Spoils Of War.

3
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,056
You've just won the biggest prize
in the world.

4
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,187
What could you possibly have
to be upset about?

5
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,937
Come on, you can tell me.

6
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,819
Queen of Thorns
give you one last in the balls

7
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,241
before saying goodbye?

8
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,861
I'll save my confessions
for the High Septon.

9
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,991
There is no more High Septon.

10
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,244
No, there isn't, is there?

11
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,626
There is still
the question of my prize.

12
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,089
That's a lot of money I just gave you.

13
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,586
It's not a castle.

14
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,553
How 'bout that one? It's available.

15
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,755
You don't want Highgarden.

16
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,719
- I beg to differ.
- We're at war.

17
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,642
Daenerys Targaryen could come
and take it back

18
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,844
the day after you move in.

19
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,143
Besides, think of the upkeep.

20
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,271
The more you own,
the more it weighs you down.

21
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,068
Oh, is that why
you're so glum, hey?

22
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,235
All your new riches weighing you down?

23
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,152
Move up!

24
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,236
They're not mine.
This all belongs to the Iron Bank.

25
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,076
See? We pay our debts.

26
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,998
Right. Just not to me.

27
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,625
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
formerly of

28
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,002
whatever nameless shit heap
you're from,

29
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:41,336
with a saddlebag full of gold,
complaining about not getting paid.

30
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,133
When we win this war,

31
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,216
all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms
will be yours to choose from,

32
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,029
with no one left
to take them away from you.

33
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,229
Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign
will be quiet and peaceable.

34
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,022
- Stranger things have happened.
- Like what?

35
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,021
The granaries are being emptied,
and loaded into wagons, my lord.

36
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,114
The current harvest?

37
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,441
We have teams of men collecting it,
from all the farms in the Reach.

38
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,743
Ser Bronn,
will you accompany the Tarlys

39
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,037
and help them accelerate this process?

40
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,080
I'm not much for shovelling wheat.

41
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:15,379
No, but motivating reluctant farmers
to hand over their harvest...

42
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,424
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

43
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,135
- My lord.
- My lord.

44
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,633
My lord.

45
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,438
I must say,
I don't think the Iron Bank

46
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:43,068
has ever had a debt of this magnitude
repaid in a single instalment.

47
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,319
I always considered your father
a very effective and efficient man,

48
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,746
but you appear to be
redefining those terms entirely.

49
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,953
You're too kind, my lord.

50
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,290
I am neither kind nor a lord,
Your Grace.

51
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,543
I am merely an instrument
of the institution I represent.

52
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,047
Its well-being is a matter of
arithmetic, not sentiment.

53
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,220
And the current arithmetic
is outstanding.

54
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,677
- The gold...
- Is on its way.

55
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,761
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

56
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,560
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

57
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,108
They've grown rather fond of
your interest payments.

58
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,358
We must devise a way
to raise their spirits.

59
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:27,613
Yes, perhaps we could be of assistance
in some current venture.

60
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,781
My only venture at this moment is

61
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,113
re-establishing control
over this continent

62
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,290
and every person on it.

63
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,368
I see a great deal of potential
in that venture.

64
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:41,460
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

65
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,550
It will, indeed.

66
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,798
I need to expand my armies, my navies.

67
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,346
My Hand, Qyburn, has made overtures to
the Golden Company in Essos.

68
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,432
I know them well.

69
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,009
They have helped us recover
significant sums

70
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,766
from parties
who'd fallen into deep arrears.

71
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,768
That's good to hear.

72
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,067
I, too, would like them to recover
some things that belong to me.

73
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:07,653
Rest assured, Your Grace, you can
count on the Iron Bank's support.

74
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,735
As soon as the gold arrives.

75
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,827
This is for you.

76
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,539
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

77
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,545
but your mother fought him off.

78
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,846
The other dagger,
the one that took her life,

79
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:43,276
I would have stopped that dagger
with my own heart, if I could have.

80
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,943
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

81
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,860
But I am here for her now.

82
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:57,324
To do what she would have done.
To protect her children.

83
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:05,923
Anything I can do for you, Brandon,
you need only ask.

84
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,635
Do you know who this belonged to?

85
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,473
No.

86
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,931
That very question was what started
the War of the Five Kings.

87
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,520
In a way, that dagger
made you what you are today.

88
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,728
Forced from your home, driven out
to the wilds beyond the Wall.

89
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,490
I imagine you've seen things
most men wouldn't believe.

90
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,204
To go through all of that
and make your way home again,

91
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:49,543
only to find such chaos in the world,
I can only imagine...

92
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,844
Chaos is a ladder.

93
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,775
I'm sorry to have disturbed you,
Lord Stark.

94
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,397
I'm not Lord Stark.

95
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,160
What's that?

96
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,370
Maester Wolkan built it for me
so I can move around more easily.

97
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,874
It's a very good idea.

98
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,133
You're leaving.

99
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,005
I don't want to leave you. But when...

100
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,683
When they come,
I need to be with my family.

101
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,646
You're safe.
Well, safe as anyone can be now.

102
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,103
You don't need me anymore.

103
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,561
No, I don't.

104
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,236
That's all you've got to say?

105
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,195
Thank you.

106
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,663
"Thank you"?

107
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,332
For helping me.

108
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:11,003
My brother died for you.
Hodor and Summer died for you.

109
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,459
I almost died for you.

110
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,965
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

111
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,636
Not anymore.

112
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,184
I remember what it felt like
to be Brandon Stark.

113
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,778
But I remember so much else now.

114
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,449
You died in that cave.

115
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:23,951
I did. The kitchen girl,
the redhead with the behind.

116
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,372
The only thing in the kitchen

117
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,245
that you've put
your in is the liver.

118
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,712
'Ey up. Where you going?

119
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,085
In there. I live here.

120
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,002
I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.

121
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,508
Arya Stark's dead.

122
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,183
Send for Maester Luwin,
or Ser Rodrik.

123
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,313
They'll tell you who I am.

124
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,440
There's no Rodrik here.

125
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,142
Maester's named Wolkan.

126
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,525
Go ask Jon Snow then,
the King in the North.

127
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,947
- He's my brother.
- He's 1,000 miles away.

128
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,741
Look, it's cold and we're busy,

129
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,990
so, you know, best

130
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,196
Mmm.

131
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,051
If Jon's gone,
who's in charge of Winterfell?

132
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,041
The Lady of Winterfell? Lady Stark?

133
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,747
- Which Lady Stark?
- You tell us.

134
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,628
You're the one
impersonating her sister.

135
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,470
Tell Sansa her sister's home.

136
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,425
Lady Sansa is too busy
to waste her breath on you.

137
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,599
Just like us.

138
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,350
So, for the last time.

139
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,270
I'm getting into this castle
one way or another.

140
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,947
If I'm not who I say I am,
I won't last long.

141
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:44,778
But if I am, and Sansa finds out
you turned me away...

142
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:58,087
Right, you sit there.
Right there. Don't move.

143
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,086
Right, go tell Lady Stark,
I'll watch her.

144
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,638
I ain't telling Lady Stark.
You can tell her.

145
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,632
Why me?

146
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,079
- You're gonna tell her.
- I'm not.

147
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,833
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna hit you
right in the face,

148
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,414
as hard as I can.

149
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,095
We told her to wait.

150
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,097
We were standing
right next to her, and...

151
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,304
And when we'd turned
around, she'd gone, my lady.

152
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,934
She was nothing.
Some winter town girl.

153
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,392
- Comes in asking for Ser Rodrik...
- Rodrik, yeah.

154
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,273
- And Maester Luwin.
- Luwin, yeah.

155
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,572
And don't trouble yourself over it,
my lady. We'll find her.

156
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,155
You don't have to.
I know where she is.

157
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,840
Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?

158
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,548
Yes.

159
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,822
You shouldn't have
run from the guards.

160
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,363
I didn't run. You need better guards.

161
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,214
It suits you. Lady Stark.

162
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,671
- Jon left you in charge?
- He did.

163
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,593
I hope he comes back soon.

164
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,119
I remember how happy he was to see me.

165
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,432
When he sees you,
his heart will probably stop.

166
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,864
It doesn't look like him.

167
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,027
Should've been carved by someone
who knew his face.

168
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,117
Everyone who knew his face is dead.

169
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,666
We're not.

170
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,501
They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?

171
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,803
- I wish I had.
- Hmm.

172
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,892
Me, too. I was angry
when I heard someone else had done it.

173
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,475
However long my list got,
he was always first.

174
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,642
- Your list?
- Of people I'm going to kill.

175
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,203
How did you get back to Winterfell?

176
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:20,205
It's a long story.
I imagine yours is, too.

177
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,208
Yes. Not a very pleasant one.

178
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,415
Mine neither.

179
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:34,841
- But our stories aren't over yet.
- No, they're not.

180
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,316
Arya...

181
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,270
Bran's home, too.

182
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,944
You came home.

183
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,788
I saw you at the Crossroads.

184
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,248
- You saw me?
- I see quite a lot now.

185
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,009
Bran has visions.

186
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,259
I thought you might go
to King's Landing.

187
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,475
- So did I.
- Why would you go back there?

188
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,182
Cersei's on her list of names.

189
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,449
Who else is on your list?

190
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,319
Most of them are dead already.

191
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,342
- Where did you get this?
- Littlefinger gave it to me.

192
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,879
Littlefinger? He's here?

193
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,555
He has declared for House Stark.

194
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,884
- Why would he give you a dagger?
- He thought I'd want it.

195
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,595
- Why?
- Because it was meant to kill me.

196
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,775
The cutthroat. After your fall?

197
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,352
Why would a cutthroat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

198
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,530
Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.

199
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,652
He's not a generous man.

200
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,803
He wouldn't give you anything

201
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,944
unless he thought
he was getting something back.

202
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,406
It doesn't matter.

203
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,115
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

204
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,451
I don't want it.

205
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,133
Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.

206
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,635
It's wasted on a cripple.

207
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,756
Catelyn Stark would be proud.

208
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,252
You kept your vow.

209
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,845
I did next to nothing.

210
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,467
You're too hard on yourself, my lady.

211
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,049
I'm not a...

212
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,596
Thank you, Podrick.

213
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,034
Your Grace, there's still no word
from the Unsullied.

214
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,586
Soon. He will come back to you.

215
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,961
He'd better.

216
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,259
- What happened?
- Many things.

217
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,851
"Many things"?

218
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,471
Your Grace.

219
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,398
It's all right.

220
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:23,463
I wanted you to see it
before we start hacking it to bits.

221
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,423
Well, this is it. All we'll ever need.

222
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,933
There is something else
I want to show you, Your Grace.

223
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,921
The Children of the Forest made these.

224
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
When?

225
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,714
A very long time ago.

226
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:58,315
They were right here,
standing where we're standing.

227
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,861
Before there were Targaryens or Starks
or Lannisters.

228
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,064
Maybe even before there were men.

229
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,152
No.

230
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:22,627
They were here together,
the Children and the First Men.

231
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,833
Doing what? Fighting each other?

232
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,849
They fought together,
against their common enemy.

233
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,232
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

234
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,443
Together.

235
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,364
We need to do the same
if we're going to survive.

236
00:22:55,916 --> 00:23:01,412
'Cause the enemy is real.
It's always been real.

237
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,639
And you say you can't defeat them
without my armies and my dragons?

238
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,808
No, I don't think I can.

239
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,659
I will fight for you.
I will fight for the North.

240
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,911
When you bend the knee.

241
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:49,673
My people won't accept
a southern ruler.

242
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,136
Not after everything they've suffered.

243
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,348
They will if their king does.

244
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,597
They chose you to lead them.

245
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,483
They chose you to protect them.

246
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,071
Isn't their survival more important
than your pride?

247
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,339
What is it?

248
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,054
We took Casterly Rock.

249
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,257
That's very good to hear.

250
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,930
Isn't it?

251
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,239
You'll want to discuss this
amongst yourselves. Perhaps...

252
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,032
You will stay.

253
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,986
All my allies are gone.

254
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,600
They've been taken from me while
I've been sitting here on this island.

255
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,893
You still have the largest armies.

256
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,953
Who won't be able to eat

257
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,021
because Cersei has taken all the food
from the Reach.

258
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,207
Call Grey Worm
and the Unsullied back.

259
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,818
We still have enough ships
to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.

260
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,209
Commit to the blockade
of King's Landing.

261
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,863
We have a plan.
It's still the right plan.

262
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,094
The right plan?

263
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,764
Your strategy has lost us Dorne,
the Iron Islands, and the Reach.

264
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,555
If I've underestimated our enemies...

265
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,102
Our enemies?

266
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,554
Your family, you mean.

267
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,315
Perhaps you don't want to hurt them,
after all.

268
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,159
Enough with the clever plans.

269
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,535
I have three large dragons.
I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.

270
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,910
We've discussed this.

271
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,618
My enemies are in the Red Keep.

272
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,704
What kind of a queen am I

273
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,525
if I'm not willing to risk my life
to fight them?

274
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,549
A smart one.

275
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,675
What do you think I should do?

276
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,221
- I would never presume to...
- I'm at war.

277
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,427
I'm losing.

278
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,022
What do you think I should do?

279
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,864
I never thought that
dragons would exist again.

280
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,066
No one did.

281
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:25,449
The people who follow you know that
you made something impossible happen.

282
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,246
Maybe that helps them believe that

283
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,250
you can make
other impossible things happen.

284
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,380
Build a world that's different from
one they've always known.

285
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,014
But if you use them
to melt castles and burn cities,

286
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,342
you're not different.

287
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,603
You're just more of the same.

288
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,157
Don't lunge.

289
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,009
Don't go where your enemy leads you.

290
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,263
Up.

291
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,957
- And don't...
- Don't fight someone like her

292
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,097
in the first place.

293
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,271
Nice sword.

294
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,865
Very nice dagger.

295
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,080
If they haven't contributed the
right amount of grain to the stores,

296
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,523
then I'm afraid they'll have to
make do with what they brought.

297
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:54,547
We can't...

298
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,760
It's been a while since I trained.

299
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,259
I can go and find
the master of arms for you, my lady.

300
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,215
He didn't beat the Hound.

301
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,342
You did.

302
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,219
I want to train with you.

303
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:15,768
You swore to serve both my mother's
daughters, didn't you?

304
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,614
Move aside, Podrick.

305
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,409
You can't use that, my lady.
It's too small.

306
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,744
I won't cut you, don't worry.

307
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,126
I'll try not to.

308
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,533
Who taught you how to do that?

309
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,876
No one.

310
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,491
What do you think of her?

311
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,663
Who?

312
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:39,040
I believe you know of whom I speak.

313
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,371
I think she has a good heart.

314
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:42,831
A good heart?

315
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,257
I've noticed you staring
at her good heart.

316
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,547
There's no time for that.

317
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,139
I saw the Night King, Davos.
I looked into his eyes.

318
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,103
How many men do we have in the North
to fight him? Ten thousand? Less?

319
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,930
- Fewer.
- What?

320
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,816
Speaking of good hearts.
Missandei of Naath.

321
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,062
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

322
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,197
King Snow, isn't it?

323
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,366
No, that doesn't sound right.
King Jon.

324
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,488
It doesn't matter.

325
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,161
Forgive me, but may I ask a question?

326
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,909
Of course.

327
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:19,993
Your name is Jon Snow, but your
father's name was Ned Stark.

328
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,370
Yeah, I'm a bastard.

329
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,207
My mother and father weren't married.

330
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,167
Is the custom different in Naath?

331
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,299
We don't have marriage in Naath,

332
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:33,006
so the concept of a bastard
doesn't exist.

333
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,891
That sounds liberating.

334
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,771
Why did you leave your homeland?

335
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,232
I was stolen away by slavers.

336
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,854
Oh, I'm sorry.

337
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:50,357
If I may, how did a slave girl come to
advise Daenerys Targaryen?

338
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,110
She bought me from my master
and set me free.

339
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,412
That was good of her.

340
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:58,990
Of course, you're serving her now,
aren't you?

341
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,453
I serve my queen because I want to
serve my queen.

342
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,879
Because I believe in her.

343
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:09,046
And if you wanted to sail home
to Naath tomorrow?

344
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,720
Then she would give me
a ship, and wish me good fortune.

345
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,304
You believe that?

346
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,133
I know it.

347
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,896
All of us who came with her
from Essos, we believe in her.

348
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,765
She's not our queen because

349
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,067
she's the daughter of some king
we never knew.

350
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,487
She's the queen we chose.

351
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,074
Will you forgive me if I switch sides?

352
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,791
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

353
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,880
- Pull.
- I'm trying.

354
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,619
Jon.

355
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,127
I didn't know you were here.

356
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,466
Sansa...

357
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,470
Is she all right?

358
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,640
What you did for her

359
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,935
is the only reason
I'm not killing you.

360
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,867
We heard your uncle
attacked your fleet.

361
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,948
We thought you were dead.

362
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,500
I should be.

363
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,793
Your sister?

364
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,834
Euron has her.

365
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,671
I came to ask the queen
to help me get her back.

366
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,925
The queen is gone.

367
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,009
Where did she go?

368
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,369
All the gold's safely through
the gates of King's Landing.

369
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,574
Good.

370
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,062
We need to get
the last of these wagons

371
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,419
over the Blackwater Rush
before nightfall.

372
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,962
If the head of the line is ambushed,

373
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,968
the tail will never be able
to reinforce in time.

374
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,633
- Well, we are stretched a bit thin.
- With your permission,

375
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:00,380
flogging stragglers
has a marked effect on mobility.

376
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,805
Let's give them fair warning first.

377
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,760
These men fought well at Highgarden.

378
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,034
Ser Jaime.

379
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,787
- Rickon.
- Dickon.

380
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:36,089
I hear you fought bravely
at Highgarden. Your first battle?

381
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,844
And?

382
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,343
- It was glorious.
- Come on, your father's not here.

383
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,102
All my life,
we've been pledged to House Tyrell.

384
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,647
I knew some of those men.
I hunted with them.

385
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,562
They didn't deserve to die.

386
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,694
But Lady Olenna
chose to betray her queen

387
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,737
and support the Targaryen girl.

388
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,234
So, here we are.

389
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,818
I didn't expect it to smell like that.

390
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,904
Men shit themselves when they die.

391
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,034
Didn't they teach you that
at fancy lad school?

392
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,329
Well, I learned it when I was five.

393
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,127
What?

394
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,220
Listen.

395
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,022
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

396
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,154
Get in line!

397
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,983
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

398
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,035
Get in line now!

399
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,202
Form up! Come on, lads!

400
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,408
Guard those wagons! Form a line!

401
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,038
Form a line!

402
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,127
Round those spears!

403
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,632
Shield wall!

404
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,143
Fill the gaps!

405
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,109
Get tight!

406
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,977
Get in line, boys!

407
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,601
Wait! Wait for it!

408
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,804
Spears out!

409
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,893
Spears out!

410
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,603
Hold the line!

411
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,370
Get back to King's Landing.

412
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,827
I'm not abandoning my army.

413
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,126
You're the commander,
not a infantryman.

414
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,249
Those are about to swamp us.

415
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,295
We can hold them off.

416
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,734
Dracarys!

417
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,029
Hold the line.

418
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,748
Hold!

419
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,262
Archers!

420
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,353
Archers!

421
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,303
Archers, with me!

422
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,354
Archers, to the line!

423
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,776
- Nock!
- Nock!

424
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,524
Draw!

425
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,334
- Loose!
- Loose!

426
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,293
Qyburn's Scorpion is over there.

427
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,317
Go get it then.

428
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,938
I can't shoot with one hand.

429
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,734
Come on. Come on!

430
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,410
Where are you?

431
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,106
Your people can't fight.

432
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,153
Take cover!

433
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,665
Come on, you

434
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,091
Dracarys.

435
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,370
Flee, you idiot.

436
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,078
Come on, boy. Come on!

437
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,011
You idiot. You idiot.
