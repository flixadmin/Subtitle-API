found this at the bottom

963
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:25,929
of the harbor.

964
00:51:29,183 --> 00:51:30,976
Go ahead, don't be shy.

965
00:51:37,733 --> 00:51:38,941
(GASPS)

966
00:51:38,942 --> 00:51:41,027
Oh! Jesus Christ.

967
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:42,403
Is that Translucent?

968
00:51:42,404 --> 00:51:44,614
Still think we got
nothing to worry about?

969
00:51:44,615 --> 00:51:46,949
How did they even get through his skin?

970
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,951
What kind of maniac...

971
00:51:48,952 --> 00:51:51,788
Mm-mm. Not maniac.

972
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:54,832
Smart, actually.

973
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:57,960
Very smart.

974
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:02,298
Hey, Deep, what can't I see through?

975
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:04,842
- Zinc, Homelander.
- Correct.

976
00:52:04,843 --> 00:52:06,845
And what's the box made of, Deep?

977
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:13,059
- Zinc.
- Correct again.

978
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,812
(CHUCKLES): They also knew
that we'd find Translucent...

979
00:52:15,813 --> 00:52:18,648
what's left of him... eventually.

980
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:20,858
So they were just buying time.

981
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:22,693
Why do you say that?

982
00:52:22,694 --> 00:52:24,822
I'm so glad you asked.

983
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:39,418
Whoever it was...

984
00:52:39,419 --> 00:52:41,879
they just declared war.
