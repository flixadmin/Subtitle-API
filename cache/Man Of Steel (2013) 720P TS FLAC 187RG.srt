1
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:10,616
You don't understand.

2
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:12,858
Krypton's core is collapsing.

3
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:15,063
We may only
have a matter of weeks.

4
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,833
I warned you,
harvesting the core was suicide.

5
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:21,135
It has accelerated
the process of implosion.

6
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:25,905
Our energy reserves were exhausted,
what would you have us do, El?

7
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:29,469
Look to the stars.
Like our ancestors did.

8
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:31,501
There are habitable worlds
within reach.

9
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,578
We can begin
by using the old outposts.

10
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:37,081
Are seriously suggesting that
we evacuate the entire planet?

11
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:40,650
No, everybody here
is already dead.

12
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:46,288
Give me the control of the codex,
I will ensure the survival of our race.

13
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:51,359
There is still hope,
I have held that hope in my hand.

14
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:09,940
- This council has been disbanded.
- On whose authority?

15
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,042
Mine.

16
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:18,557
The rest of you will be tried
and punished accordingly.

17
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,951
What are you doing, Zod?!
This is madness!

18
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:27,187
What I should done years ago! These
lawmakers with their endless debates

19
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:29,556
have led Krypton to ruin!

20
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:35,492
And if your forces prevail?
You be the leader of nothing.

21
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:40,173
Then join me, help me
save our race, we'll start anew.

22
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:44,428
We'll sever the degenerated
bloodlines that led us to this state.

23
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:48,071
And who will decide
which bloodline survives, Zod?

24
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:51,173
You?

25
00:03:52,174 --> 00:03:56,855
Don't do this, El. The last thing
I want is for us to be enemies.

26
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:59,880
You have abandoned the principles
that bound us together,

27
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:03,149
You've taken up the sword
against your own people.

28
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,154
I'll honor the man you once were, Zod.
Not this monster you've become.

29
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:14,825
Take him away!

30
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:25,095
**Sir, is everything all right?**
- Out of the way! I said..

31
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,320
Jor! Behind you!

32
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:54,824
Lara, you have to ready the launch,
I will be with you as soon as I can.

33
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:51,636
- Have you seen the codex?
- It's just beneath the central house.

34
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:55,673
**But I'm compelled to warn you, reaching
the chambers is class B crime punishable**

35
00:05:55,773 --> 00:06:00,276
Nobody cares any more, Keelex!
The world is about to come to an end.

36
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:09,231
Jor-el, by the authority
of General Zod, surrender the codex.

37
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:59,838
Easy, Harraka.

38
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,189
Did you find the world?

39
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,290
We have.

40
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:25,325
**orbiting main sequence yellow star**
**just as you said.**

41
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,859
Young star.
His cells would drink its radiation.

42
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:36,408
It has a seemingly
intelligent population.

43
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,837
He will be an outcast, a freak.

44
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:44,907
They'll kill him.
- How?

45
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:47,643
He'll be a god to them.

46
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:51,686
What if the ship doesn't make it?

47
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,916
He will die out there.

48
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:55,850
Alone.

49
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,019
I can't do it.

50
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:02,546
I thought I could, but...
now that it's here...

51
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:08,419
Krypton is doomed.
It's his only chance now.

52
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:11,529
It's our people's only hope.

53
00:09:11,782 --> 00:09:12,840
What is it, Keelex?

54
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:15,414
**Five attack ships**
**converging from the east.**

55
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:18,001
**Citadel’s defenses**
**are being scanned and evaluated.**

56
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:20,588
I'll upload the codex.
- No, wait.

57
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,935
Lara...

58
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:25,673
Just... let me look at him.

59
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:31,845
I'll never get to see him walk.

60
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:36,315
Never hear him say our names.

61
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:44,722
Out there amongst the stars...

62
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,992
he will live.

63
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:48,406
Goodbye, my son.

64
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:50,737
I hope some dreams
travel with you.

65
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:32,542
Concentrate fire on the main door.

66
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:50,615
**Lady Lara, the phantom drives**
**are coming on-line**

67
00:11:50,636 --> 00:11:52,440
Proceed to ignition.

68
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:57,461
We have identified an engine ignition
within the citadel.

69
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,811
A launch...

70
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:03,166
Hold this platform, Commander.

71
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:21,414
I know you stole the codex, Jor-el.
Surrender it and I'll let you live.

72
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:25,382
This is a second change
for all of Krypton,

73
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,160
not just the bloodlines
you deem worthy.

74
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:33,390
- What have you done?
- We've had a child, Zod.

75
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:35,458
A boy child.

76
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:38,694
Krypton's first natural
birth in centuries.

77
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:43,965
And he will be free.
Free to forge his own destiny.

78
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:46,467
Heresy!

79
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,536
Destroy it!

80
00:13:42,636 --> 00:13:45,506
Lara, listen to me!

81
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:48,550
The Codex is Krypton's future.

82
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:51,218
Abort the launch!

83
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:47,730
Your son, Lara...
Where have you sent him?

84
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:53,972
His name is Kal.

85
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,270
Son of El.

86
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,770
And he is beyond your reach.

87
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,185
Bring that ship down.

88
00:15:21,657 --> 00:15:23,158
**target locked**

89
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,871
Lay down your weapons,
your forces are surrounded.

90
00:15:48,712 --> 00:15:53,276
General Zod, for the crimes
of murder and high treason,

91
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:58,119
the Council has sentenced you
and your fellow insurgents

92
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:02,271
to 300 hundred cycles
of somatic reconditioning.

93
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,492
Do you have any last words?

94
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:11,401
You won't kill us yourself!
You wouldn't sully your hands,

95
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:14,933
but you'll damn us
to a black hole for eternity.

96
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,104
Jor-El, was right
you are a pack of fools,

97
00:16:20,237 --> 00:16:22,739
every last one of you!

98
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:25,008
And you...

99
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,744
You believe your son is safe?

100
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:30,445
I will find him.

101
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:34,182
I will reclaim what
you have taken from us.

102
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,150
I will find him.

103
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:41,888
I will find him, Lara.

104
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,992
I will find him!

105
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:31,791
**Lady Lara,**
**shouldn't you find refuge?**

106
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:34,751
There is no refuge, Kelor.

107
00:18:36,012 --> 00:18:38,581
Jor-El was right,

108
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:44,185
this is the end.

109
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:57,963
Make a better world than ours, Kal.

110
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,805
Watch it, dumbass! Keep your eyes open
or you are gonna get squashed!

111
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,677
Where the hell
did they find you, greenhorn?

112
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:41,170
Gentlemen, secure the deck!

113
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:44,706
We just got a distress call
from a rig due west of us.

114
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,010
Secure the deck!

115
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,722
All civilian folk, stand clear,

116
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:55,296
the sub-sea valve's failed
and the rig is about to explode.

117
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:57,964
Roger, coast guard. What about
the men left inside, over.

118
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,062
- Forget them, they are dead!
- Greenhorn, fetch me my binoculars.

119
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,831
Greenhorn!

120
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:15,626
This is the last of the oxygen!

121
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:18,022
I don't know how much longer
we can hold out!

122
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:28,776
This is coast guard 65-10.

123
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,727
We're gonna make one more pass
and then we're getting out of here.

124
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,923
Wait, wait,
I've got some guys on the heli-pad!

125
00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:59,188
Get that last guy rolling,
we have got to go!

126
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:01,501
Hey, let’s go!
What are you doing!

127
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:48,921
When Kansas became a territory...

128
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:52,475
Clark!

129
00:22:53,735 --> 00:22:55,536
Are you listening, Clark?

130
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:02,498
I asked if you could tell me
who were the first settlers of Kansas?

131
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:18,205
Are you alright, Clark?

132
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,450
Clark!

133
00:23:32,962 --> 00:23:34,962
Clark!

134
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,989
- Clark, come out of there!
- Leave me alone.

135
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:43,357
Clark, I have called your mother.

136
00:23:48,813 --> 00:23:51,750
I'm here!
Clark, honey, what's wrong?

137
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:56,857
Will you open the door?
- What's wrong with him, anyway?

138
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:58,882
He's such a weirdo!

139
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:06,590
Sweetie! How can I help you
if you won't let me in?

140
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,934
The world is too big, mom.

141
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:11,955
Then make it smaller.

142
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:15,876
Just...

143
00:24:17,785 --> 00:24:20,187
Focus on my voice.

144
00:24:21,478 --> 00:24:23,478
Pretend it's an island.

145
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:26,242
Out in the ocean.

146
00:24:27,054 --> 00:24:29,254
Can you see it?

147
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:33,549
I see it.

148
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:36,601
Then swim towards it, honey.

149
00:24:49,477 --> 00:24:52,037
What's wrong with me, mom?

150
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:56,295
Clark...

151
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:22,990
Hey, asswipe! What do you think,
did you see the game?

152
00:26:23,752 --> 00:26:26,754
Leave him alone, Pete.
- What are you, his girlfriend?

153
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,012
I want hear what he has to say.

154
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:32,344
Come on, dick splash.

155
00:28:12,639 --> 00:28:15,741
My son was there, he was in the bus.

156
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:18,435
He saw what Clark did.

157
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:22,371
I know he did.
I'm sure that what he saw...

158
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:24,755
Was an act of God, Jonathan!

159
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,458
This was providence!

160
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:34,220
Well, I think you're blowing it
a little out of proportion.

161
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:35,912
No, I'm not.

162
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:38,459
Lana saw it too and the Forny boy.

163
00:28:38,493 --> 00:28:42,296
And this isn't the first time
Clark's done something like this.

164
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:02,045
- I just wanted to help.
- I know you did, but we talked about this,

165
00:29:02,577 --> 00:29:03,777
Right?

166
00:29:04,214 --> 00:29:07,116
Right, we talked about this,
you have...

167
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:11,052
Clark, you have keep
this side of yourself a secret.

168
00:29:11,353 --> 00:29:14,756
What was I supposed to do,
just let them die?

169
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,994
Maybe.

170
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,598
There's more at stake here than just our
lives and the lives of those around us.

171
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:32,134
When the world...

172
00:29:32,602 --> 00:29:36,806
When the world finds out what you can do
it's going to change everything.

173
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:38,907
Our believes, our notions.

174
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:42,677
What it means to be human, everything.

175
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,781
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?
She was scared of you, Clark.

176
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:51,150
Why?

177
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:54,920
People are afraid
of what they don't understand.

178
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,122
Is she right?

179
00:29:57,822 --> 00:30:01,025
Did God give this to me?

180
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:02,659
Tell me.

181
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:21,275
We found you in this.

182
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,610
We were sure that the government
was gonna show up on our doorstep.

183
00:30:24,744 --> 00:30:26,802
No one ever came.

184
00:30:40,823 --> 00:30:44,359
This was in the chamber with you.

185
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:48,296
I took it
to a metallurgist at Kansas State.

186
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,741
He said whatever it was made from
didn't even...

187
00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:54,327
It didn't even exist
on the periodic table.

188
00:30:56,903 --> 00:31:00,906
It's another way of saying
that it's not from this world, Clark.

189
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:05,309
And neither are you.

190
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,165
You are the answer, son.

191
00:31:08,445 --> 00:31:12,048
You are the answer to
are we alone in the Universe.

192
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:14,116
I don't wanna be.

193
00:31:14,617 --> 00:31:16,118
And I don't blame you son.

194
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:20,389
Be huge burden for anyone to bear,
but you are not just anyone, Clark.

195
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,169
And I have to believe
that you were,

196
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,284
that you were send here for an reason.

197
00:31:27,561 --> 00:31:30,263
All these changes that
you're going through, one day,

198
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:32,431
one day you're gonna think of them
as a blessing.

199
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,001
When that day comes,
you'll have to make a choice,

200
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,804
choice of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race or not..

201
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:44,207
Can't I just
keep pretending I'm your son?

202
00:31:44,808 --> 00:31:47,009
You are my son.

203
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:54,849
But somewhere out there,
you have another father too.

204
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:56,650
Who gave you another name.

205
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,222
And he send you here
for a reason, Clark.

206
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:06,686
And even if it takes you
the rest of your life,

207
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:09,484
you owe it to yourself
to find out what that reason is.

208
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:33,013
They did find something strange in...

209
00:32:35,805 --> 00:32:39,505
I know, it's crazy, right?
The Americans are there too.

210
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:40,223
Lots of them.

211
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:43,308
They are calling it anomalous object,
whatever that means.

212
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:45,757
back off rebel, I'm serious.
Oh come on, Chrissy.

213
00:32:46,724 --> 00:32:48,689
- Knock it off!
- Sit down.

214
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:52,724
- Let me go!
- Hey, leave her alone, man.

215
00:32:55,385 --> 00:32:57,576
Or what, tough guy?

216
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,137
Or... I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

217
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:06,314
I think I'll probably just leave
when I'm good and ready.

218
00:33:15,146 --> 00:33:17,348
O, there he is.

219
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,256
It's not worth it, sweetie.

220
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:38,332
Hey, asshole, don't forget your tip.

221
00:34:30,907 --> 00:34:33,009
Thanks,

222
00:34:33,296 --> 00:34:34,696
Hi.

223
00:34:34,777 --> 00:34:36,778
Miss Lane, how are you doing?

224
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:41,849
- Jed Eubanks, Arctic cargo.
- How far to the station?

225
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:44,785
Camp is just over the rise,
I'll walk you over. - Great.

226
00:34:47,854 --> 00:34:52,357
- Help her out.
- Careful with those, they are heavy.

227
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:58,996
I got to confess, Miss Lane,
I'm not a fan of The Daily Planet.

228
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,264
But those you pieces you wrote...

229
00:35:03,466 --> 00:35:05,467
Well, they were pretty impressive.

230
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:10,438
Well, what can I say, I get writer's
block if I'm not wearing a flat jacket.

231
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:20,079
Miss Lane!
Hardy, US Northcom, dr. Emil Hamilton.

232
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,982
You are early, we were
expecting you tomorrow.

233
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:26,685
Which I why showed up today.

234
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:29,487
Look, let’s get one thing straight,
guys, okay?

235
00:35:29,488 --> 00:35:32,090
The only reason I'm here
is because we are on Canadian soil,

236
00:35:32,189 --> 00:35:35,892
and the appellate court overruled
your injunction to keep me away.

237
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:38,894
So, if we are done
measuring dicks,

238
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:41,997
can you have your people
show me what you found?

239
00:35:43,331 --> 00:35:46,980
NASA's EOS satellites
pinged the anomaly first,

240
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:48,550
the ice shelf's plates
held the echo soundings.

241
00:35:48,636 --> 00:35:50,638
But, there is definitely
something down there.

242
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,242
- A submarine, maybe Soviet era?
- Doubtful, that's 300 meters,

243
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,143
considerably larger than
anything they build back then.

244
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,677
But here is the spooky part.

245
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:02,780
The ice surrounding the object,

246
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:05,515
its nearly 20.000 years old...

247
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:10,987
Miss Lane, you are not to wander.

248
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,589
Temperatures drops to
- 40 at night around here.

249
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:16,090
We couldn't find your
body until after spring.

250
00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:23,230
There you go.

251
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:28,301
- What if I need to tinkle?
- There's a bucket in the corner.

252
00:37:02,777 --> 00:37:05,346
Where the hell are you going?

253
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,079
It's all right, it's all right..

254
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:10,590
You are hemorrhaging internally

255
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:13,320
and if I don't cauterize this bleed...

256
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:18,343
I can do things
that other people can’t.

257
00:41:18,454 --> 00:41:20,385
Now hold my hand.

258
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:23,232
This is gonna hurt.

259
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:27,487
What Colonel Hardy and his team
surmised was a Soviet era submarine,

260
00:42:27,488 --> 00:42:30,390
was actually something much more exotic.

261
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,225
An isotope analysis
of the surrounding ice bores,

262
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:35,860
suggests that an object
had been trapped in the glacier

263
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,262
for over 18,000 years.

264
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:42,599
As for my rescuer, he disappeared
during the objects departure,

265
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:48,137
A background check revealed that his work
history and identity had been falsified.

266
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:52,474
The questions raised by my rescuer's
existence are frightening to contemplate,

267
00:42:52,874 --> 00:42:55,376
but I also know what I saw.

268
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:58,402
And they've arrived
at the inescapable conclusion

269
00:42:58,428 --> 00:43:00,639
that the object
and its occupant,

270
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,082
did not originate on Earth..

271
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,452
I can’t print this Lois, you might have
hallucinated half of it.

272
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:10,544
What about the civilian contractors
who corroborated my story?

273
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,157
The Pentagon is denying that
there was a ship.

274
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:17,210
Of course they are, that's what they
are supposed to do, it’s the Pentagon.

275
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,496
Harry come on, it’s me we are talking
about, I'm a Pulitzer winning reporter.

276
00:43:20,896 --> 00:43:23,432
- Then act like it.
- Print it or I walk.

277
00:43:23,532 --> 00:43:26,635
You can’t, you are under contract.

278
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:32,673
I'm not running a story about
aliens walking among us...

279
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:40,698
Never going to happen.

280
00:43:42,747 --> 00:43:45,216
That's a Scotch
straight up for the lady.

281
00:43:45,616 --> 00:43:48,418
I'm sending you the original article,
my editor won't print it

282
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:50,387
but, if it happened to leak online...

283
00:43:51,688 --> 00:43:55,157
But, didn't you once
describe my site as a...

284
00:43:55,457 --> 00:43:59,527
- "creeping cancer of falsehoods"?
- I stand by my words, Woodburn.

285
00:43:59,627 --> 00:44:02,563
- But I want this story out there.
- Why?

286
00:44:02,863 --> 00:44:07,067
Because I want my mystery man
to know I know the truth.

287
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:25,415
**Recursive diagnostics complete.
Guiding process authenticated.**

288
00:44:25,815 --> 00:44:29,051
**All systems operational.**

289
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:45,154
To see you standing there,
having grown into an adult.

290
00:44:46,855 --> 00:44:51,493
- If only Lara could witness this.
- Who are you?

291
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:54,995
I'm your father, Kal.

292
00:44:55,495 --> 00:44:59,465
Or at least a shadow of him,
his consciousness.

293
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:05,003
My name is Jor-El.

294
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:09,607
And Kal?

295
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,143
It’s my name.

296
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,612
Kal-El, it is.

297
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,482
I have so many questions.

298
00:45:22,517 --> 00:45:28,355
Where do I come from?
Why did you send me here?

299
00:45:28,455 --> 00:45:33,026
You came from Krypton.

300
00:45:33,326 --> 00:45:37,996
A world with much harsher
environment than Earth's.

301
00:45:40,865 --> 00:45:45,302
Long ago, in an era of expansion...

302
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:48,505
... our race spread out
through the stars,

303
00:45:48,905 --> 00:45:51,707
seeking new worlds to settle upon.

304
00:45:53,227 --> 00:45:58,565
This scout ship was one of thousands
launched into the void.

305
00:45:59,365 --> 00:46:01,867
We build outposts on other planets,

306
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:05,670
using great machines to reshape
environments to our needs.

307
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:13,343
For 100,000 years,
our civilization flourished,

308
00:46:13,943 --> 00:46:18,547
- accomplishing wonders.
- What happened?

309
00:46:20,182 --> 00:46:24,052
Artificial population control
was established.

310
00:46:24,152 --> 00:46:28,255
The outposts on space exploration
were abandoned,

311
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:32,892
we exhausted our natural
resources, as a result...

312
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:36,962
our planet's core became unstable.

313
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:42,266
Eventually our military
leader, General Zod,

314
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,702
attempted a coup,

315
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:48,565
but by then it was too late.

316
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:52,708
Your mother and I
foresaw the coming calamity,

317
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:55,844
and we took certain steps
to ensure your survival.

318
00:46:57,478 --> 00:46:59,847
This is a genesis chamber.

319
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:03,049
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this,

320
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:07,019
every child was designed to fulfill
a predetermined role in our society,

321
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:10,489
as a worker, a warrior, a leader.

322
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:15,526
Your mother and I believed that
Krypton lost something precious,

323
00:47:15,593 --> 00:47:18,128
the element of choice, of chance.

324
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,920
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something other

325
00:47:20,946 --> 00:47:23,092
than what society
had intended for him or her?

326
00:47:24,366 --> 00:47:27,769
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

327
00:47:27,869 --> 00:47:29,915
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

328
00:47:29,988 --> 00:47:32,612
Krypton's first natural birth
in centuries.

329
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,010
That's why we risked
so much to save you.

330
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,812
Why didn't you come with me?

331
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:45,316
We couldn't, Kal.

332
00:47:45,718 --> 00:47:47,820
No matter how much we wanted to,

333
00:47:48,018 --> 00:47:50,554
no matter how much we loved you...

334
00:47:51,054 --> 00:47:52,455
Your mother Lara and I

335
00:47:52,547 --> 00:47:55,716
were a product of the failures
of our world as much Zod was,

336
00:47:55,803 --> 00:47:57,753
tied to its fate.

337
00:47:57,893 --> 00:48:00,031
- So, I'm alone.
- No.

338
00:48:01,496 --> 00:48:05,199
You are much as a child of Earth now
as you are of Krypton.

339
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:08,835
You can embody
the best of both worlds.

340
00:48:09,168 --> 00:48:12,471
A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

341
00:48:17,275 --> 00:48:20,344
The people of Earth are different
from us, it’s true.

342
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,302
But ultimately I believe
that is a good thing.

343
00:48:23,335 --> 00:48:26,438
They won't necessarily make
the same mistakes we did.

344
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,742
Not if you guide them, Kal.

345
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:32,409
Not if you give them hope.

346
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:37,467
That is what this symbol means.

347
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:40,716
The symbol of the House of EL
means "hope".

348
00:48:40,726 --> 00:48:43,128
Embodied within it
is the fundamental belief

349
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,690
the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

350
00:48:48,422 --> 00:48:51,725
That's what you can bring them.

351
00:49:10,807 --> 00:49:12,675
Why am I so different from them?

352
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,712
Earth's sun is younger and
brighter than Krypton’s was.

353
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:20,392
Your cells
have drunk in its radiation,

354
00:49:20,808 --> 00:49:24,211
strengthening your muscles,
your skin, your senses.

355
00:49:25,552 --> 00:49:30,523
Earth's gravity is weaker,
yet its atmosphere is more nourishing,

356
00:49:30,589 --> 00:49:33,792
You've grown stronger here
than I ever could've imagined.

357
00:49:34,025 --> 00:49:36,227
The only way to know how strong,

358
00:49:36,394 --> 00:49:42,032
is to keep testing your limits.

359
00:50:31,818 --> 00:50:35,722
You will give the people of Earth
an ideal to strive towards.

360
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:42,218
They will race behind you,
they will stumble, they will fall.

361
00:50:42,913 --> 00:50:44,915
But in time...

362
00:50:46,049 --> 00:50:49,052
they will join you
when the sun comes.

363
00:50:50,186 --> 00:50:54,890
In time, you will help them
accomplish wonders.

364
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:21,703
How do you find someone who has
spent a lifetime covering his tracks?

365
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,872
You start with the urban legends
that have sprung up in his wake.

366
00:52:24,939 --> 00:52:28,141
All of the friends of a friend
who claim to have seen him.

367
00:52:29,209 --> 00:52:31,610
For some he was a guardian angel.

368
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:36,114
For others a cypher,
a ghost who never quite fit in.

369
00:52:38,004 --> 00:52:42,420
As you work your way back in time,
the stories begin to form a pattern.

370
00:52:42,987 --> 00:52:46,516
- Pete Ross, do you know him?
- Yes, he works in the I-Hop.

371
00:52:46,543 --> 00:52:48,150
You go down the road...

372
00:52:49,364 --> 00:52:51,364
Pete Ross?

373
00:52:52,661 --> 00:52:55,864
I'd like to talk to you about an accident
that occurred when you were younger,

374
00:52:55,897 --> 00:52:58,899
a school bus
that went into the river?

375
00:53:03,762 --> 00:53:05,762
Rusty!

376
00:53:06,405 --> 00:53:11,243
Mrs. Kent, I'm Lois Lane
from The Daily Planet.

377
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:13,291
Quiet!

378
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:17,114
I'm from The Daily Planet and I'd like
to talk to you about your son.

379
00:53:44,528 --> 00:53:49,198
Where are you from, what are you
doing here, let me tell your story.

380
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:55,311
- What if I don't want my story told?
- It’s going to come out eventually.

381
00:53:55,344 --> 00:53:58,047
Somebody’s going to get a photograph
or figure out where you live.

382
00:53:58,347 --> 00:53:59,948
Then I’ll just disappear again.

383
00:53:59,982 --> 00:54:03,184
The only way you can disappear for good
is to stop helping people altogether,

384
00:54:03,186 --> 00:54:05,988
and I sense
that's not option for you.

385
00:54:09,723 --> 00:54:11,791
My father believed...

386
00:54:11,891 --> 00:54:14,793
... that if the world found out
who I really was...

387
00:54:15,994 --> 00:54:18,736
they'd reject me, out of fear.

388
00:54:21,232 --> 00:54:23,333
I'm tired of safe!

389
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,202
I just want do something
useful with my life.

390
00:54:25,268 --> 00:54:28,170
So farming, feeding people,
that's not useful?

391
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,664
I didn't say that.

392
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:32,291
Our family has been farming
for 5 generations, Clark.

393
00:54:32,324 --> 00:54:33,949
Your family. Not mine.

394
00:54:34,047 --> 00:54:36,915
I don't know even why I'm listening
to you, you are not my dad,

395
00:54:36,945 --> 00:54:38,746
you are just some guy who
found me in the field.

396
00:54:38,757 --> 00:54:40,058
Clark!

397
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:44,917
That's all right, Martha.

398
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:48,720
He is right, Clark has a point.

399
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,489
We are not your parents.

400
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,783
But we've been doing
the best we can,

401
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:55,851
and we've been
making it up as we go along,

402
00:54:55,926 --> 00:55:00,997
so maybe... maybe our best
isn't good enough anymore.

403
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,334
Look...

404
00:55:06,435 --> 00:55:08,576
- Dad, please...
- Hold on.

405
00:55:28,252 --> 00:55:30,954
Go for the overpass.

406
00:55:31,955 --> 00:55:33,656
Go for the overpass!

407
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:36,425
Take cover! Take cover!

408
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:39,027
Over there, just follow them!

409
00:55:43,431 --> 00:55:44,732
She's stuck!

410
00:55:46,567 --> 00:55:48,268
You guys follow me.

411
00:55:48,468 --> 00:55:50,770
The dog's in the car!

412
00:55:53,539 --> 00:55:55,540
I get him!

413
00:55:56,141 --> 00:55:58,543
Get your mom to the overpass.

414
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,451
- Jonathan!
- Ma, stay here.

415
00:57:21,976 --> 00:57:24,878
I let my father die,
because I trusted him.

416
00:57:25,979 --> 00:57:29,782
Because he was convinced
that I had to wait.

417
00:57:30,683 --> 00:57:33,185
That the world was not ready.

418
00:57:34,586 --> 00:57:37,288
What do you think?

419
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,093
You better watch out Lois.

420
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:45,016
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.

421
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:48,496
He knows you are Woodburn’s
anonymous source and he cannot wait...

422
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,560
... to rip you in two.

423
00:57:55,269 --> 00:57:57,898
I told you not to run with this,
and what do you do?

424
00:57:57,938 --> 00:58:00,240
You let Woodburn just shotgun it
all over the internet!

425
00:58:00,707 --> 00:58:03,976
Now, the publishers want me
to sue you!

426
00:58:04,076 --> 00:58:06,718
Well, if it makes a difference,
I'm dropping it.

427
00:58:06,814 --> 00:58:09,310
- Whoa, just like that?
- Yeah.

428
00:58:10,381 --> 00:58:12,984
- What happened to your leads?
- They didn't pan out.

429
00:58:13,024 --> 00:58:14,499
The story was smoke.

430
00:58:14,585 --> 00:58:18,087
Or perhaps it just didn't get
the attraction you hope it would.

431
00:58:19,021 --> 00:58:22,190
2 weeks leave, no pay -
that's your pennance.

432
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:25,593
You try something like
this again - you're done here.

433
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:28,762
No, let’s make it 3 weeks, since you
are so willing to agree with me.

434
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:31,106
No, no, don't.

435
00:58:31,965 --> 00:58:34,434
I believe you saw something Lois,

436
00:58:34,467 --> 00:58:37,469
but not for a moment do I believe
that your leads just went cold,

437
00:58:37,536 --> 00:58:41,806
so whatever your reasons
are for dropping it...

438
00:58:42,273 --> 00:58:44,175
I think you're doing
the right thing.

439
00:58:44,342 --> 00:58:45,643
Why?

440
00:58:47,077 --> 00:58:50,514
Can you imagine how people
on this planet would react...

441
00:58:51,414 --> 00:58:52,715
If...

442
00:58:52,815 --> 00:58:56,919
they knew that there was
someone like this out there?

443
00:59:14,399 --> 00:59:16,301
Go get him!

444
00:59:21,939 --> 00:59:23,940
Well, look at you!

445
00:59:40,754 --> 00:59:42,855
A reporter came by here.

446
00:59:42,922 --> 00:59:45,424
She is a friend, don't worry.

447
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,794
Mom.

448
00:59:50,161 --> 00:59:51,362
What?

449
00:59:52,296 --> 00:59:54,498
- I found them.
- Whom?

450
00:59:55,799 --> 00:59:57,600
My parents.

451
00:59:58,568 --> 01:00:00,569
My people.

452
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:03,773
I know where I come from now.

453
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,241
Wow...

454
01:00:07,542 --> 01:00:09,343
That's wonderful.

455
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:13,246
I'm so happy for you.

456
01:00:22,454 --> 01:00:25,489
- What?
- Its nothing.

457
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,094
When you were a baby,
I use to lay by your cradle.

458
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,262
Listen to your breath.

459
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:36,298
It was hard for you.

460
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:39,033
You struggled.

461
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:41,197
And I worried all the time.

462
01:00:41,293 --> 01:00:43,998
You worried that the truth
would come out.

463
01:00:44,338 --> 01:00:47,407
No, the truth about you...

464
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:49,357
... is beautiful.

465
01:00:49,408 --> 01:00:52,411
We saw that, the moment
we laid eyes on you.

466
01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:00,784
We knew that one day,
the whole world would see that.

467
01:01:01,618 --> 01:01:03,420
I just…

468
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,883
I worried they’d take you
away from me.

469
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:10,592
I'm not going anywhere, mom.

470
01:01:12,327 --> 01:01:14,328
I promise.

471
01:01:20,166 --> 01:01:23,969
- General Swanwick, sir.
- What am I looking at, doc?

472
01:01:24,503 --> 01:01:26,504
Comet? Asteroid?

473
01:01:27,972 --> 01:01:31,642
Comets don't make
course corrections, General.

474
01:01:34,777 --> 01:01:37,264
I wanted you see this before
some amateur with a telescope

475
01:01:37,287 --> 01:01:39,369
creates a worldwide panic.

476
01:01:40,349 --> 01:01:44,419
The ship appears to have inserted
itself into a lunar synchronous orbit.

477
01:01:44,786 --> 01:01:46,612
Though I have no idea why.

478
01:01:47,195 --> 01:01:50,464
Have you tried...
communicating with it?

479
01:01:50,558 --> 01:01:53,327
Well, they haven't
responded as of yet.

480
01:01:55,394 --> 01:01:57,596
I'm just speculating,

481
01:01:58,097 --> 01:01:59,917
but I think whoever is
at the helm of that thing

482
01:01:59,943 --> 01:02:02,500
is looking to make
a dramatic entrance.

483
01:02:08,738 --> 01:02:11,746
Does anybody know where
we keep the toner cartridges?

484
01:02:11,774 --> 01:02:14,042
- What's going on?
- It’s all over the news.

485
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:16,244
You got to see this.

486
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:44,504
Clark!

487
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:46,682
Yeah, coming.

488
01:03:31,447 --> 01:03:33,447
**You are not alone.**

489
01:03:35,297 --> 01:03:37,599
Yo*are* no* AL**0

490
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:42,084
**you are not alone**

491
01:04:15,506 --> 01:04:18,308
- It’s coming in on the RSS feeds.
- **you are not alone**

492
01:04:19,642 --> 01:04:21,511
It’s on my phone, too.

493
01:04:23,613 --> 01:04:26,415
My name is General Zod.

494
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:31,986
I come from a world far from yours.

495
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:37,289
I have journeyed across an ocean
of stars to reach you.

496
01:04:38,357 --> 01:04:42,787
For some time your world
has sheltered one of my citizens.

497
01:04:43,128 --> 01:04:45,430
I request that you return
this individual...

498
01:04:46,397 --> 01:04:48,098
... to my custody.

499
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,670
For reasons unknown,

500
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:54,635
he has chosen to keep his
existence a secret from you.

501
01:04:56,138 --> 01:04:59,441
He will have made efforts
to blend in.

502
01:04:59,675 --> 01:05:02,077
He will look like you.

503
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:04,612
But he is not one of you.

504
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:09,883
To those of you who may know
of his current location:

505
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:15,572
The fate of your planet
rests in your hands.

506
01:05:16,888 --> 01:05:19,632
To Kal-El, I say this:

507
01:05:21,759 --> 01:05:25,104
Surrender within 24 hours,

508
01:05:28,464 --> 01:05:32,135
or watch this world
suffer the consequences.

509
01:05:49,014 --> 01:05:51,380
If he truly means us no harm,

510
01:05:51,479 --> 01:05:53,315
then he'll turn himself in
to his people,

511
01:05:53,391 --> 01:05:55,894
and face the consequences
and if he won’t do that,

512
01:05:55,954 --> 01:05:57,455
then maybe we should.

513
01:05:57,521 --> 01:06:00,523
The Daily Planet's Lois Lane
knows who this guys is.

514
01:06:00,524 --> 01:06:02,426
And I think she’s the one
we should be questioning.

515
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,760
Hold-on, you are saying
Lois Lane knows...

516
01:06:05,825 --> 01:06:08,563
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.

517
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:12,167
For once I actually I agree with
Woodburn. Now, have you seen him?

518
01:06:12,179 --> 01:06:14,548
No, and even I did, I wouldn't say.

519
01:06:14,575 --> 01:06:18,278
The entire world
is being threaten here!

520
01:06:19,137 --> 01:06:22,040
This not the time for you to fall back
on your journalistic integrity!

521
01:06:23,101 --> 01:06:28,004
This is serious, Lois! The FBI is here
hurling around words like treason.

522
01:06:28,007 --> 01:06:29,408
I got to go.

523
01:06:45,767 --> 01:06:48,670
FBI, hands up!
Drop the bag, now!

524
01:06:55,985 --> 01:06:59,482
Regarding the visitors' goals,
we know very little at this point.

525
01:06:59,565 --> 01:07:01,765
Accorfing to
government officials I've spoken to,

526
01:07:01,786 --> 01:07:04,186
the visitors do not represent a threat,

527
01:07:04,216 --> 01:07:06,616
despite the ominous tone
of their message.

528
01:07:06,672 --> 01:07:09,172
And, of course,
the question on everyone's mind:

529
01:07:09,252 --> 01:07:11,252
Who is this Kal-El person?

530
01:07:11,271 --> 01:07:14,785
Does he actually exist?
How could he ever...

531
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,521
Come on, Kent.

532
01:07:28,426 --> 01:07:30,127
Come on, fight back!

533
01:07:30,428 --> 01:07:32,429
Get up, Kent.

534
01:07:34,465 --> 01:07:35,466
Is that it?

535
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,902
Is that all you got?

536
01:07:39,891 --> 01:07:41,891
Come on, Kent!

537
01:07:42,638 --> 01:07:44,239
Come on!

538
01:08:12,758 --> 01:08:14,560
Did they hurt you?

539
01:08:15,694 --> 01:08:16,995
They can't.

540
01:08:17,128 --> 01:08:19,730
It's not what I meant,
I meant are you all right?

541
01:08:20,943 --> 01:08:23,798
I wanted to hit that kid.
I wanted to hit him so bad!

542
01:08:23,836 --> 01:08:25,337
I know you did, I mean...

543
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:29,738
Part of me even wanted you to,
but then what?

544
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,174
Would it make you feel any better?

545
01:08:33,883 --> 01:08:38,645
You just have to decide what kind of man
you want to grow up to be, because...

546
01:08:38,712 --> 01:08:41,815
whoever that man is -
good character or bad - he is...

547
01:08:43,549 --> 01:08:46,352
He is going to change the world.

548
01:08:50,999 --> 01:08:53,094
What’s on your mind?

549
01:08:58,058 --> 01:09:00,159
I don't where to start.

550
01:09:00,196 --> 01:09:02,397
Whereever you want.

551
01:09:03,966 --> 01:09:07,001
That ship that appeared last night.

552
01:09:07,235 --> 01:09:10,971
I'm the one they are looking for.

553
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:15,659
Do you know...

554
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:18,043
- why they want you?
- No.

555
01:09:18,044 --> 01:09:20,202
But this General Zod,

556
01:09:20,253 --> 01:09:24,399
even if I surrender, there's
no guarantee he'll keep his word.

557
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:29,327
If there's a chance I can save
Earth by turning myself in...

558
01:09:29,953 --> 01:09:31,955
... shouldn't I take it?

559
01:09:32,722 --> 01:09:34,635
What does your gut tell you?

560
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:37,692
Zod can’t be trusted.

561
01:09:39,461 --> 01:09:44,965
The problem is... I'm not sure
the people of Earth can be either.

562
01:09:52,638 --> 01:09:56,341
Sometimes you have to take
a leap of faith first,

563
01:09:57,275 --> 01:10:01,045
the trust part comes later.

564
01:10:23,562 --> 01:10:26,164
All right, you got our attention.

565
01:10:26,398 --> 01:10:29,801
- What it is you want?
- I would like to speak to Lois Lane.

566
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:31,636
What makes you think she's here?

567
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:35,816
Don't play games with me, General,
I'll surrender.

568
01:10:35,939 --> 01:10:39,442
But only if you guarantee
Lois's freedom.

569
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:51,126
Why are you surrendering to Zod?

570
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:55,160
I’m surrendering to mankind,
there is a difference.

571
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:58,453
You let them handcuff you.

572
01:10:58,924 --> 01:11:02,627
Wouldn't be much of a surrender
if I resisted.

573
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:08,165
And if it makes them feel more secure,
then all the better for it.

574
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:16,138
What does the S stand for?

575
01:11:16,904 --> 01:11:19,607
It’s not an a S,

576
01:11:19,826 --> 01:11:22,391
on my world it means “hope”.

577
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:27,495
Well, here it’s an S.

578
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:32,226
How about...

579
01:11:36,054 --> 01:11:38,221
Sir, hi.

580
01:11:38,389 --> 01:11:41,791
- My name is doctor...
- Emil Hamilton, I know.

581
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:44,460
I can see your ID tag
in your breast pocket,

582
01:11:44,494 --> 01:11:47,296
along with a half eaten roll
of pastrami sandwich.

583
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,980
And I also see the squad
soldiers in the next room

584
01:11:50,035 --> 01:11:52,353
preparing that
tranquilizing agent of yours.

585
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,909
You won’t need it.

586
01:11:53,968 --> 01:11:57,571
Sir, you cannot expect us
to not take precautions,

587
01:11:57,604 --> 01:12:00,173
you could be carrying
some kind of alien pathogen.

588
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:03,542
I’ve been here for 33 years, doctor,
haven't infected anyone yet.

589
01:12:03,575 --> 01:12:05,377
That you know of.

590
01:12:05,477 --> 01:12:07,679
We have legitimate
security concerns.

591
01:12:07,712 --> 01:12:10,514
Now you revealed your identity
to Miss Lane over there.

592
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:13,483
Why won't you do the same with us?

593
01:12:13,517 --> 01:12:16,286
Let’s put our cards
on the table, General.

594
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:19,722
You are scared of me
because you can't control me.

595
01:12:19,755 --> 01:12:22,757
You don't and you never will.

596
01:12:23,258 --> 01:12:25,259
But that doesn't mean
I'm your enemy.

597
01:12:25,326 --> 01:12:28,529
And who is? Zod?

598
01:12:29,163 --> 01:12:33,232
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Be that as it may,

599
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:36,735
I been given orders
to hand you over to him.

600
01:12:37,036 --> 01:12:39,037
Do what you have to do, General.

601
01:12:43,754 --> 01:12:44,955
Thank you.

602
01:12:45,622 --> 01:12:46,923
For what?

603
01:12:47,891 --> 01:12:50,092
For believing in me.

604
01:12:52,394 --> 01:12:54,896
Didn't make much
difference in the end.

605
01:12:55,363 --> 01:12:57,165
It did to me.

606
01:13:17,481 --> 01:13:19,582
They are coming.

607
01:13:19,606 --> 01:13:21,606
You should leave now.

608
01:13:23,586 --> 01:13:25,687
Go, Lois.

609
01:14:36,711 --> 01:14:41,214
Kal-El, I'm sub-commander Faora-Ul.

610
01:14:41,314 --> 01:14:45,317
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.

611
01:14:50,155 --> 01:14:53,157
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.

612
01:14:53,257 --> 01:14:57,828
General Zod, would like
this woman to accompany me.

613
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:00,897
You asked for the alien.

614
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,832
You didn't say anything
about one of our own.

615
01:15:03,834 --> 01:15:07,737
Shall I tell the general
you are unwilling to comply?

616
01:15:07,969 --> 01:15:10,571
I don't care what you tell him.

617
01:15:12,526 --> 01:15:14,826
It's all right.

618
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:16,743
I'll go.

619
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:03,110
The atmosphere composition in our ship
is not compatible with humans.

620
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:07,714
You will need to wear
a breather beyond this point.

621
01:16:31,906 --> 01:16:33,207
Kal-El.

622
01:16:34,608 --> 01:16:38,811
You have no idea how long
we've been searching for you.

623
01:16:39,078 --> 01:16:42,314
- I take it you are Zod.
- General Zod, our Commander!

624
01:16:42,396 --> 01:16:46,475
It's all right, Faora. You can
forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.

625
01:16:46,618 --> 01:16:48,719
He is a stranger to our ways.

626
01:16:48,853 --> 01:16:51,155
This should be cause for celebration.

627
01:16:52,122 --> 01:16:53,923
Not conflict.

628
01:16:57,827 --> 01:17:00,427
I... feel strange.

629
01:17:07,034 --> 01:17:10,136
- What's happening to him?
- He is rejecting our ships atmospherics.

630
01:17:11,137 --> 01:17:15,407
Spend a lifetime adapting to Earth's
ecology but never adapted to ours.

631
01:17:16,052 --> 01:17:16,953
Help him!

632
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:20,014
I can't. Whatever's happening to him
has to run its course.

633
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:39,418
Hello, Kal.

634
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,621
Or do you prefer Clark?

635
01:17:44,089 --> 01:17:46,991
That's the name they gave you,
isn't it?

636
01:17:48,259 --> 01:17:52,462
I was Krypton's military leader,
your father - our foremost scientist.

637
01:17:52,562 --> 01:17:56,565
The only thing we agreed on
was that Krypton was dying.

638
01:17:56,632 --> 01:17:59,735
In return for my efforts
to protect our civilization,

639
01:18:00,535 --> 01:18:02,637
and save our planet...

640
01:18:02,703 --> 01:18:06,306
... I and my fellow officers
were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

641
01:18:09,442 --> 01:18:12,945
And then,
the destruction of our world...

642
01:18:13,045 --> 01:18:14,747
freed us.

643
01:18:19,984 --> 01:18:21,985
We were adrift.

644
01:18:22,253 --> 01:18:26,755
Destined to float among the ruins
of our planet until we starved.

645
01:18:28,324 --> 01:18:30,428
How did you find your way to Earth?

646
01:18:30,626 --> 01:18:34,729
We managed to retro-fit the phantom
projector into a hyper drive.

647
01:18:35,363 --> 01:18:39,766
Your father made similar modification
to the craft that brought your here.

648
01:18:40,634 --> 01:18:43,636
And so
the instrument of our damnation...

649
01:18:45,504 --> 01:18:47,006
... became our salvage.

650
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:56,569
We sought out the old colonial
outposts, looking for signs of life.

651
01:18:59,983 --> 01:19:02,551
But all we found was death.

652
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:07,863
Cut off from Krypton, these outposts
withered and died long ago.

653
01:19:08,928 --> 01:19:11,229
We salvaged what we could:

654
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:13,264
armor, weapons.

655
01:19:13,364 --> 01:19:15,366
Even a world-engine.

656
01:19:16,867 --> 01:19:19,168
For 33 years we prepared,

657
01:19:20,303 --> 01:19:23,306
until finally
we detected a distress beacon,

658
01:19:23,373 --> 01:19:27,876
which you triggered when
you accessed the ancient scout ship.

659
01:19:28,577 --> 01:19:31,479
You lead us here, Kal.

660
01:19:32,913 --> 01:19:37,217
And now it's within your power
to save what remains of your race.

661
01:19:42,921 --> 01:19:46,224
On Krypton, the genetic template
for every being yet to be born,

662
01:19:46,324 --> 01:19:48,726
is encoded
in the registry of citizens.

663
01:19:50,094 --> 01:19:52,686
Your father stole
the registry's codex

664
01:19:52,712 --> 01:19:55,423
and stored it in the capsule
that brought you here.

665
01:19:55,865 --> 01:19:57,667
For what purpose?

666
01:19:57,867 --> 01:20:01,269
So that Krypton can live again...

667
01:20:01,336 --> 01:20:03,338
... on Earth.

668
01:20:22,853 --> 01:20:24,955
Where is the codex, Kal?

669
01:20:26,556 --> 01:20:28,798
If Krypton lives again,

670
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:31,560
what happens to Earth?

671
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:34,785
A foundation
has to be built on something.

672
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:39,100
Even your father recognized that.

673
01:20:45,471 --> 01:20:46,472
No, Zod.

674
01:20:49,041 --> 01:20:53,177
- I can’t be a part of this.
- Then what can you be a part of?

675
01:20:55,779 --> 01:20:56,780
Stop!

676
01:21:07,089 --> 01:21:11,525
Your father acquitted himself
with honor Kal.

677
01:21:13,093 --> 01:21:17,330
- You killed him?
- I did.

678
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:21,967
And not a day goes by
where it doesn't haunt me.

679
01:21:22,317 --> 01:21:28,355
But if I had to do it again, I would.
I have a duty to my people.

680
01:21:28,406 --> 01:21:33,510
And I will not allow anyone
to prevent me from carrying it out.

681
01:21:51,057 --> 01:21:53,325
2 bogeys launching
from the alien ship.

682
01:21:53,326 --> 01:21:55,701
- Put it on.
- Yes, sir.

683
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:57,554
There it is.

684
01:21:57,629 --> 01:22:00,899
Retask Skycam 4, give me
a closer look. - Yes, sir.

685
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:03,525
Command, word of the day is "Trident".

686
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:07,692
- We have 2 alien craft on aggressive
approach.  - I-com 4 coming on line.

687
01:22:08,037 --> 01:22:12,341
- Air speed? - 380 knots, they are
not responding to our hails.

688
01:22:13,075 --> 01:22:15,311
You are wasting your efforts.

689
01:22:16,118 --> 01:22:18,823
The strength you do have from
your exposure to the Earth's sun

690
01:22:18,849 --> 01:22:21,124
is being neutralized on our ship.

691
01:22:21,162 --> 01:22:24,187
Here, in this environment,

692
01:22:25,151 --> 01:22:27,152
you're as weak as a human.

693
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:28,593
- Where did you come from?
- The command key, Miss Lane.

694
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,029
Thanks to you, I'm uploading
into the ships mainframe.

695
01:23:32,796 --> 01:23:35,799
- Who are you?
- I'm Kal's father.

696
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,136
- Can you help us?
- I designed this ship.

697
01:23:42,404 --> 01:23:46,207
I can modify its atmospheric
composition to human compatibility.

698
01:23:46,811 --> 01:23:50,114
We can stop them, we can send
them back to the phantom zone.

699
01:23:50,677 --> 01:23:52,993
- How?
- I can teach you.

700
01:23:53,149 --> 01:23:57,654
And in turn, you can teach Kal.
Will you help me?

701
01:24:10,918 --> 01:24:13,418
The ship's curve is loaded.
They turn off quickly.

702
01:24:13,512 --> 01:24:15,512
Retrieve the command key.

703
01:24:22,795 --> 01:24:25,423
- Did you do that?
- Yes. Pick up the side arm.

704
01:24:35,261 --> 01:24:37,261
What's happening?

705
01:24:57,821 --> 01:24:59,821
To your right, fire!

706
01:25:00,924 --> 01:25:02,924
Behind you!

707
01:25:14,978 --> 01:25:17,478
Secure yourself inside the under pod.

708
01:25:17,997 --> 01:25:19,997
Safe travels, Miss Lane.

709
01:25:20,103 --> 01:25:23,118
It's highly unlikely
we'll be seeing each other again.

710
01:25:23,804 --> 01:25:26,934
Remember, the Phantom Drive
is essential for stopping them.

711
01:25:28,067 --> 01:25:30,067
Movie your head to the left.

712
01:25:56,436 --> 01:25:59,530
Is it true
what Zod said about the codex?

713
01:25:59,536 --> 01:26:01,536
Strike that panel.

714
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:07,965
We wanted you to learn
what it meant to be human first.

715
01:26:08,707 --> 01:26:11,373
So that one day,
when the time was right,

716
01:26:11,564 --> 01:26:14,825
you could be the bridge
between two peoples.

717
01:26:17,269 --> 01:26:19,269
Look.

718
01:26:21,197 --> 01:26:22,897
Lois.

719
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:25,209
You can save her, Kal.

720
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:29,457
You can save all of them.

721
01:27:47,753 --> 01:27:50,456
You will be safe here.

722
01:27:51,656 --> 01:27:55,459
- Are you all right?
- Oh yeah.

723
01:27:57,594 --> 01:28:01,294
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna tell them
anything about you,

724
01:28:01,377 --> 01:28:03,743
but they did something to me,
they looked inside my mind...

725
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:06,492
It's okay, Lois.
They did the same thing to me.

726
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:22,039
Clark!

727
01:28:30,452 --> 01:28:34,355
The craft he arrived in,
where is it?

728
01:28:35,857 --> 01:28:38,359
Go to hell.

729
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:50,335
There.

730
01:29:21,037 --> 01:29:22,338
Where has he hidden it?

731
01:29:22,371 --> 01:29:23,672
I don't know.

732
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:25,840
Where is the Codex?!

733
01:29:39,939 --> 01:29:42,200
You think
you can frighten my mother?!

734
01:30:23,953 --> 01:30:25,555
What have you done to me?

735
01:30:25,557 --> 01:30:29,560
My parents taught me
to home my senses, Zod.

736
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:33,594
To focus...

737
01:30:33,628 --> 01:30:35,656
... on just what I wanted to see.

738
01:30:35,713 --> 01:30:38,887
And without your helmet,
you are getting everything.

739
01:30:39,566 --> 01:30:43,069
And its hurts, doesn't it?

740
01:31:32,241 --> 01:31:34,443
Get inside, it’s not safe.

741
01:31:38,722 --> 01:31:41,792
All clear, this is Guardian,
I'm airborne mission commander.

742
01:31:42,025 --> 01:31:44,522
I have previously encountered

743
01:31:44,525 --> 01:31:47,206
the beings we are about
to engage at close proximity,

744
01:31:47,262 --> 01:31:51,166
they are extremely dangerous,
we are authorized to use deadly force.

745
01:31:53,768 --> 01:31:56,029
Roger, Guardian,
advancing to target.

746
01:32:26,758 --> 01:32:30,061
Airborne One,
request immediately re-attack.

747
01:32:30,143 --> 01:32:35,010
Roger, Guardian, we're commencing
our run at 2-1-2 degrees.

748
01:32:41,909 --> 01:32:44,111
Airborne One, eject, eject!

749
01:32:56,785 --> 01:32:59,253
I have a bogey incoming!

750
01:33:18,381 --> 01:33:20,883
You are weak, son of El.

751
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:22,900
Unsure of yourself.

752
01:33:27,522 --> 01:33:32,126
The fact that you posses
a sense of morality and we do not...

753
01:33:32,226 --> 01:33:35,628
... gives us
an evolutionary advantage.

754
01:33:38,704 --> 01:33:40,919
And if history has proven anything...

755
01:33:50,941 --> 01:33:54,644
it is that the evolution always wins.

756
01:35:02,364 --> 01:35:04,232
I need you engage the targets.

757
01:35:04,269 --> 01:35:07,172
Guardian, this is Battle 01,
what about that guy in blue?

758
01:35:07,266 --> 01:35:09,868
I said, engage all targets!

759
01:35:32,155 --> 01:35:33,956
Are you okay?

760
01:35:39,427 --> 01:35:40,428
We are going in hard.

761
01:35:41,629 --> 01:35:44,031
Brace for impact!

762
01:35:44,364 --> 01:35:46,366
We are going in hard.

763
01:35:51,303 --> 01:35:55,507
Guardian is down,
I repeat guardian is down.

764
01:36:16,872 --> 01:36:20,774
Battle 1-2 calling Guardian,
Guardian, do you read?

765
01:36:20,795 --> 01:36:26,099
I want you to put down everything you got
at my position, this will be danger close.

766
01:36:26,131 --> 01:36:28,533
Copy, danger close.
Good luck, sir.

767
01:37:09,099 --> 01:37:13,536
A good death is its own reward.

768
01:37:25,545 --> 01:37:27,747
You will not win,

769
01:37:28,214 --> 01:37:32,051
for everyone you save,
we will kill a million more.

770
01:39:20,831 --> 01:39:22,831
This man is not our enemy.

771
01:39:25,356 --> 01:39:27,356
Thank you, Colonel.

772
01:39:45,034 --> 01:39:47,034
Mom?

773
01:39:47,059 --> 01:39:49,059
I'm alright!

774
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:02,740
Nice suit, son.

775
01:40:03,762 --> 01:40:05,762
I'm sorry.

776
01:40:06,001 --> 01:40:08,001
It's only stuff, Clark.

777
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:11,970
It can always be replaced.

778
01:40:14,296 --> 01:40:16,296
But you can't be.

779
01:40:16,881 --> 01:40:18,381
Mom...

780
01:40:18,398 --> 01:40:22,050
Zod said this Codex he's looking for
can actually bring my people back.

781
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,266
Isn't that a good thing?

782
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:31,221
I don't think they're interested
in sharing this world.

783
01:40:31,222 --> 01:40:33,131
Clark!

784
01:40:35,956 --> 01:40:38,403
I know how to stop them.

785
01:40:39,926 --> 01:40:45,230
- What happened down there?
- He exposed a temporary weakness.

786
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:50,968
It is of little consequence,
because I have located the codex.

787
01:40:52,102 --> 01:40:55,005
It was never in the capsule.

788
01:40:55,105 --> 01:40:58,908
Jor-el took the codex,
the DNA of an billion people..

789
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:02,577
And he bonded it with
his sons individual cells,

790
01:41:02,678 --> 01:41:07,915
all Krypton's heirs,
living in one refugee's body.

791
01:41:12,352 --> 01:41:18,090
Does Kal-el need to be alive, for us
to extract the codex from his cells?

792
01:41:18,991 --> 01:41:22,126
No.

793
01:41:26,096 --> 01:41:28,397
Released the world-engine.

794
01:42:00,524 --> 01:42:01,591
What did just happen?

795
01:42:01,625 --> 01:42:03,926
The ships just split in 2,
track 1 is heading east,

796
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:06,295
track 2 is deploying towards
the Southern Hemisphere.

797
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:10,665
- How fast is that bogey moving?
- Approaching Mach 24 and accelerating.

798
01:42:10,698 --> 01:42:14,868
Looks like it’s going to impact
somewhere in the South Indian Ocean.

799
01:42:32,449 --> 01:42:36,753
- The rest of the ship is descending.
- Put it on the board now.

800
01:42:37,587 --> 01:42:41,090
Oh my God!

801
01:43:19,587 --> 01:43:23,090
Bring the phantom drive on-line!

802
01:43:44,473 --> 01:43:47,164
We are now slave to the world engine.

803
01:43:47,743 --> 01:43:49,844
Initiate.

804
01:44:22,470 --> 01:44:25,072
What have they hit us with?

805
01:44:25,106 --> 01:44:30,577
Looks like some kind of gravity weapon,
its working in tandem with their ship.

806
01:44:30,877 --> 01:44:33,529
Somehow they are
increasing the Earth's mass,

807
01:44:33,591 --> 01:44:36,509
clouding the atmosphere
with particulates.

808
01:44:37,682 --> 01:44:39,751
Oh my God!

809
01:44:40,918 --> 01:44:42,620
They are Terra-forming.

810
01:44:42,653 --> 01:44:44,254
What's that?

811
01:44:44,354 --> 01:44:47,991
Planetary engineering modifying
Earth's atmosphere and topography.

812
01:44:48,091 --> 01:44:50,893
And turning Earth into Krypton.

813
01:44:50,993 --> 01:44:53,728
- But what happen to us?
- Based on these readings,

814
01:44:54,329 --> 01:44:56,431
there won’t be an us.

815
01:44:56,564 --> 01:44:58,992
General Swanwick, sir.
I'm on with the control tower,

816
01:44:59,091 --> 01:45:01,937
Colonel Hardy is on his way in
and he got Superman in tow.

817
01:45:02,402 --> 01:45:04,070
Superman?

818
01:45:04,137 --> 01:45:07,539
The alien, sir. That's what
they're calling him, Superman.

819
01:45:13,277 --> 01:45:16,814
- We have a plan, General.
- Is that what I think it is?

820
01:45:17,347 --> 01:45:18,949
It's the ship he arrived in.

821
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:23,486
This ship is run by something
called a phantom-drive.

822
01:45:23,586 --> 01:45:27,250
Its bends space. Zod's ship
uses the same technology.

823
01:45:27,276 --> 01:45:30,049
if we can make the two drives
collide with one another...

824
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:32,459
- Singularity could be created,
- Like a black hole.

825
01:45:32,473 --> 01:45:35,073
Yes. So if you open up this doorway,

826
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:37,172
then theoretically
they should be pulled back in.

827
01:45:37,263 --> 01:45:39,665
So, you want us bomb them with that?

828
01:45:39,698 --> 01:45:43,322
General, if that craft
maxes at 17,000 pounds,

829
01:45:43,348 --> 01:45:46,840
we can drop it from a C-17.
It’s viable plan.

830
01:45:46,875 --> 01:45:49,577
And if I don't stop that machine
over the Indian Ocean,

831
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:52,709
the gravity field
will continue to expand.

832
01:45:58,380 --> 01:46:02,016
If that thing is making Earth
more like Krypton,

833
01:46:02,018 --> 01:46:04,520
would you be weaker around it?

834
01:46:04,718 --> 01:46:10,256
Maybe, but I'm not gonna let that
stop me from trying.

835
01:46:10,356 --> 01:46:13,859
You may want
to step back a little bit.

836
01:46:14,626 --> 01:46:18,096
Maybe a little bit more.

837
01:46:48,372 --> 01:46:51,561
Faora! Take command.
- Yes, sir.

838
01:46:51,631 --> 01:46:54,965
I need to secure
the Genesis chamber,

839
01:46:55,062 --> 01:46:57,865
and pay my respects
to an old friend.

840
01:47:05,167 --> 01:47:09,303
Guardian en route to Metropolis.

841
01:48:04,314 --> 01:48:08,884
**command key accepted**
**genesis chamber coming on-line, sir.**

842
01:48:08,984 --> 01:48:12,487
Stop this, Zod,
while there still time.

843
01:48:13,488 --> 01:48:17,157
Haven't giving up lecturing me
have you, even in death.

844
01:48:17,257 --> 01:48:19,126
I will not let you use
the codex like this.

845
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:21,261
You don't have
the power to stop me.

846
01:48:21,327 --> 01:48:24,763
The command key I have entered
is revoking your authority,

847
01:48:24,797 --> 01:48:27,299
this ship is now under my control.

848
01:48:59,091 --> 01:49:02,141
North Com, Lightning 1. Request
permission to unleash the hounds.

849
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:04,462
North Com, Lightning 1,
you are clear to engage.

850
01:49:04,529 --> 01:49:07,764
Send battle damage
assessment when able, out.

851
01:49:30,649 --> 01:49:35,487
All right everybody, we are leaving,
leaving the building now!

852
01:50:15,151 --> 01:50:20,022
Get back!
Everybody keep moving, keep moving!

853
01:50:46,143 --> 01:50:48,111
Our people can co-exist.

854
01:50:48,578 --> 01:50:52,281
So we can suffer through years of
pain trying to adapt like your son has?

855
01:50:52,314 --> 01:50:54,816
You are talking about genocide.

856
01:50:54,817 --> 01:50:57,820
Yes, and I'm arguing
its merits with a ghost.

857
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:02,756
We are both ghosts, Zod,
can't you see that?

858
01:51:02,857 --> 01:51:04,859
The Krypton you're clinging on to
is gone.

859
01:51:04,874 --> 01:51:08,174
Ship, have you managed to quarantine
this invasive intelligence?

860
01:51:08,261 --> 01:51:10,461
- I have.
- Then prepare to terminate it,

861
01:51:10,551 --> 01:51:14,435
- I'm tired of this debate.
- Silencing me won't change anything.

862
01:51:16,267 --> 01:51:18,288
My son...

863
01:51:18,664 --> 01:51:21,393
... is twice the man you are.

864
01:51:22,284 --> 01:51:24,252
He will finish what we started.

865
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:28,261
I can promise you that.

866
01:51:31,731 --> 01:51:37,903
Tell me, you have Jor-El's
memories, his conscience.

867
01:51:37,936 --> 01:51:41,872
Can you experience his pain?

868
01:51:41,972 --> 01:51:46,276
I will harvest the codex
from your son's corps.

869
01:51:46,376 --> 01:51:52,014
And I will rebuild Krypton,
on top of his bones.

870
01:52:48,592 --> 01:52:51,728
Jenny, where are you!

871
01:52:51,811 --> 01:52:55,394
- I'm here!
- Hold on, hold on.

872
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:58,734
I can't get free, I'm stuck.

873
01:52:58,767 --> 01:53:00,869
We get you out there, all-right.
Just sit tight.

874
01:53:01,672 --> 01:53:04,573
- No, no! Please don't leave me!
- I'm not gonna leave you.

875
01:53:05,239 --> 01:53:08,241
Robert, get your ass
over here and help me!

876
01:53:13,545 --> 01:53:15,147
Try this.

877
01:53:23,387 --> 01:53:25,088
Come on push!

878
01:53:26,589 --> 01:53:29,091
This is Guardian,
are we clear to make the drop?

879
01:53:29,125 --> 01:53:31,093
Negative, Guardian.

880
01:54:49,055 --> 01:54:51,056
He did it.

881
01:54:52,991 --> 01:54:56,492
Northcom, this is Guardian, we're passing
the phase line, we're good to go.

882
01:54:56,494 --> 01:55:00,098
Godspeed, Guardian. On the package.
You are cleared out.

883
01:55:00,431 --> 01:55:03,333
We are lining in for
the final run.

884
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:06,302
It’s up to you and Hamilton now.

885
01:55:45,046 --> 01:55:48,043
- How am I gonna get it in?
- Load master, is the package on?

886
01:55:48,091 --> 01:55:50,093
- Are we ready to drop?
- Negative.

887
01:55:50,904 --> 01:55:53,106
There is something wrong,
it’s not  supposed to do this.

888
01:55:53,139 --> 01:55:56,275
- What is it supposed to do?
- It's supposed to go in all the way.

889
01:55:56,676 --> 01:55:59,678
- Let me take a look.
- Co-pilot's aircraft.

890
01:56:00,133 --> 01:56:02,133
Co-pilot's aircraft.

891
01:56:08,417 --> 01:56:11,018
We are lined up for the drop,
what's the hold up?

892
01:56:11,159 --> 01:56:13,159
We have a slight set-back.

893
01:56:28,257 --> 01:56:30,493
Target that aircraft!

894
01:56:33,294 --> 01:56:35,095
**target locked**

895
01:56:44,752 --> 01:56:47,953
- Zod!
- If you destroy this ship..

896
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,641
... you destroy Krypton.

897
01:56:53,777 --> 01:56:56,179
Krypton had its chance!

898
01:59:51,152 --> 01:59:53,487
Are they gone?

899
01:59:53,989 --> 01:59:56,108
I think so.

900
01:59:57,157 --> 01:59:58,694
He saved us.

901
02:00:24,111 --> 02:00:28,060
You know they say it's all
downhill after the first kiss.

902
02:00:30,516 --> 02:00:35,254
I'm pretty sure nobody cares
if I'm kissing a human.

903
02:01:02,909 --> 02:01:06,478
Look at this...

904
02:01:06,579 --> 02:01:10,715
We could have built a new Krypton
in this squalor.

905
02:01:10,815 --> 02:01:15,252
But you chose the humans over us.

906
02:01:15,352 --> 02:01:21,390
I exist only to protect Krypton...

907
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:26,695
That is the sole purpose
for which I was born,

908
02:01:26,795 --> 02:01:31,232
and every action I take,
no matter how violent,

909
02:01:31,332 --> 02:01:36,703
or how cruel,
is for the greater good...

910
02:01:36,803 --> 02:01:39,007
...of my people.

911
02:01:43,141 --> 02:01:47,344
And now I have no people.

912
02:01:50,614 --> 02:01:53,850
My soul...

913
02:01:53,950 --> 02:01:59,154
that is what you have taken from me!

914
02:02:06,626 --> 02:02:10,763
I'm going to make them suffer Kal,
these humans you adopted.

915
02:02:10,863 --> 02:02:13,889
I will take them all from you,
one by one.

916
02:02:13,921 --> 02:02:15,631
You are a monster, Zod.

917
02:02:18,436 --> 02:02:21,172
I'm gonna stop you.

918
02:04:01,218 --> 02:04:07,256
There is only one way this ends, Kal!
Either you die, or I do!

919
02:04:37,513 --> 02:04:41,116
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.

920
02:04:41,216 --> 02:04:45,286
Trained my entire life
to master my senses.

921
02:04:45,386 --> 02:04:48,989
Where did you train? On a farm!

922
02:08:59,589 --> 02:09:01,057
Are you F-ing stupid.

923
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:03,192
That's one of your
surveillance drones.

924
02:09:03,259 --> 02:09:07,696
That's a 12 million $
piece of hardware. - It was.

925
02:09:07,796 --> 02:09:11,766
I know you are trying to find out,
where I hang my cape, you won't.

926
02:09:11,866 --> 02:09:14,368
Then I'll ask the obvious question -

927
02:09:14,468 --> 02:09:17,737
how do we know you won't one day
act against America's interests?

928
02:09:17,837 --> 02:09:22,573
I grew up in Kansas, General.
I'm about American as its gets.

929
02:09:22,574 --> 02:09:27,879
Look, I'm here to help,
but it has to be on my own terms.

930
02:09:28,179 --> 02:09:32,716
- You have to convince Washington of that.
- Even if I was willing to try...

931
02:09:33,073 --> 02:09:38,410
- What makes you think they'd listen?
- I don't know, General.

932
02:09:38,510 --> 02:09:43,314
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

933
02:09:49,886 --> 02:09:53,857
- What are you smiling about, Captain?
- Nothing, sir.

934
02:09:56,491 --> 02:09:58,530
I just think he's kinda hot.

935
02:10:00,461 --> 02:10:05,532
- Get in the car, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

936
02:10:12,504 --> 02:10:17,708
He always believed you were meant for
greater things, and when the day came,

937
02:10:17,808 --> 02:10:21,645
your shoulders will be
able to bare the weight.

938
02:10:21,745 --> 02:10:24,747
I just wish he could have been here
to see it finally happen.

939
02:10:25,181 --> 02:10:27,983
He saw it Clark, believe me.

940
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:17,689
What are you going to do, when
you are not saving the world?

941
02:11:17,723 --> 02:11:19,124
Have you given any thought to that?

942
02:11:19,191 --> 02:11:22,827
I have, actually.

943
02:11:22,927 --> 02:11:28,498
I'm going to find a job, where I can
keep my ear to the ground.

944
02:11:32,201 --> 02:11:35,737
Where people won't look twice,
when I want go somewhere dangerous,

945
02:11:37,539 --> 02:11:41,575
or start asking questions.

946
02:11:52,417 --> 02:11:55,987
Come on Lois, when are you
going to throw me a bone?

947
02:11:56,854 --> 02:11:59,690
Courtside seats to the game
tonight, what do you say?

948
02:11:59,823 --> 02:12:02,362
I'd say, you should go back
to trolling the intern pool,

949
02:12:02,388 --> 02:12:05,051
you'll probably have more luck.

950
02:12:05,121 --> 02:12:07,121
Sorry.

951
02:12:08,488 --> 02:12:11,362
- Courtside?
- Don't, don't.

952
02:12:11,702 --> 02:12:14,387
Lombardi, Lane. Want you
to meet our new stringer,

953
02:12:14,459 --> 02:12:18,622
want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent, good luck, kid.

954
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:24,176
- Hey. Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

955
02:12:25,377 --> 02:12:29,680
Lois Lane, welcome to The Planet.

956
02:12:32,916 --> 02:12:34,995
Glad to be here, Lois.
