...last night, that wasn't me.

616
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,968
It sure looked like you.

617
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,513
Yeah. I was affected
by one of the metahumans.

618
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,557
He messed with my head.

619
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,725
But I'm okay now, I promise.

620
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,563
I defended you.

621
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,482
Everyone told me that you would
bring me nothing but danger.

622
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:22,652
My father, Barry, Eddie.

623
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:26,114
I didn't listen to them.
I never listened to them.

624
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,783
But now it's time I did.

625
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:33,329
Don't contact me anymore, okay?

626
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,417
Iris...

627
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,335
...I'm sorry.

628
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,547
Me too.

629
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,795
Look at that. Better than an ATM.

630
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:26,424
Anyone tell you not to hang out
under the freeway at night?

631
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,052
You're liable to get robbed.

632
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:33,389
You got the shakes, man.
What are you, tweaking or just cold?

633
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,558

634
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,399
I'm not cold.
