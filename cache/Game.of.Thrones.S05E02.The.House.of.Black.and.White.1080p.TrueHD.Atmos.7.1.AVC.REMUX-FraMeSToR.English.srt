Wary of strangers, as she should be.

171
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,972
I saw her riding on the East Road
with Littlefinger.

172
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,098
We'll follow them.

173
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:13,728
My lady,
If both Stark girls refused your service,

174
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,313
maybe you're released from your vow.

175
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,690
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

176
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:18,775
But if they don't want your protection...

177
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,027
Do you think she's safe with Littlefinger?

178
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,323
No, my lady.

179
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,116
Get your horse.

180
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:33,915

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

182
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,461
A summons from the queen.

183
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,773
CERSEI: There are only
two like it in the world.

184
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,193
The one I'm wearing,
the one I gave to Myrcella.

185
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,987
- It's a threat.
- Of course it's a threat.

186
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:11,244
Our daughter's alone in Dorne
surrounded by people who hate our family.

187
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,496
"It's a threat."

188
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,082
No note?

189
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,210
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister

190
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,422
and every other tragedy
that's befallen their cursed country.

191
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,007
I will burn their cities to the ground
if they touch her.

192
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,884
- Softer.
- What?

193
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:27,969
Not so loud.

194
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,888
Our daughter's in danger
and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly?

195
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,224
The world can't know she's our daughter.

196
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,936
Then don't call her your daughter.

197
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,521
You've never been a father to her.

198
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,065
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the street.

199
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,192
And what has your caution brought?

200
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,738
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding.

201
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,199
Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne.

202
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:55,746
Our baby boy set to marry
that smirking whore from Highgarden.

203
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:05,923
I'm going to make things better.

204
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,467
You've never made anything better.

205
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,053
I'm going to Dorne
and I'm bringing our daughter home.

(SCOFFS)

You can't just ask Prince Doran
to give her back.

208
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,393
She's promised to his son.

209
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,396
I'm not going to ask him anything.

210
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,482
You go down there with an army,
it's an act of war.

211
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,275
No army.

212
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,526
Do you know where they're keeping her?

213
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,408
- Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
- I'll find her.

214
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,914
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

215
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,125
(CHUCKLES)

216
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,793
You're going to Dorne?

217
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,340
A one-handed man, alone.

218
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,593
I never said I was going alone.

219
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,354
No sunflowers. I don't like yellow.

220
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,606
Roses are very nice. Definitely roses.

221
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,360
And music. I adore music.
But no flutes. I hate flutes.

222
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,487
We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes.

223
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,864
Then there's the food.
Food is the most important thing.

224
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,534
Don't you agree?
We're going to need pigeon pies.

225
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,786
That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?

226
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,997
Don't they?

227
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,333
Don't who?

228
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,378
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

229
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,507
They certainly do, my dear.

230
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,135
It's a fine place, isn't it?

231
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,637
A fine place.

232
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,267
I never thought I'd end up
settling down in a place like this.

233
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:40,977
You won't.

234
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,020
Pardon?

235
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,064
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

236
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,442
When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

237
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:49,902
She hates me.

238
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,321
She calls me mean names,
and sometimes, even still,

239
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:55,283
she pulls my hair when Mother's not looking.

240
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,828
You know what I think?

241
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,038
I think you're a good person.

242
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,124
And your sister is a mean person.

243
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,667
She is.

244
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,588
I've been all over the world,

245
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,715
and if there's one thing I've learned,

246
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,967
it's that meanness comes around.

247
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,803
People like your sister,

248
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,348
they always get
what's coming to them eventually.

249
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,392
One way or another.

250
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,188
Who's that?

251
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,152
Jaime fucking Lannister.

252
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,781
- Ser Jaime.
- Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

253
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,493
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

254
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,995
Thank you.

255
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,123
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

256
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,876
A pleasure.

257
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,380
Run along, love.

258
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,805
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

259
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,016
When were you planning on getting married?

260
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,393
- Just get on with it.
- On with what?

261
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,978
What you're here for.

262
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,939
There's no way this little visit could
possibly mean anything good for me.

263
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,067
It's very good for you.

264
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,248
- Lollys will be marrying Ser Willis Bracken.
- Mmm.

265
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,627
We made a deal, your sister and I.

266
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,253
I would have advised against that.

267
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,755
How is this good for me?

268
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,966
'Cause you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

269
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,468
And when we return,

270
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,097
I'm going to give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

271
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,268
Return from where?

272
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,562
As far south as south goes.

273
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,953
TRYSTANE: My future queen.

274
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,790
(SPEAKING SOFTLY)

275
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,714
You are beautiful.

276
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,766
The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

277
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,687
Remove yourself from my path or I'll take
that long ax and I'll shove it up your...

278
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,313
DORAN: Captain.

279
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,984
Let her pass.

280
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,781
Your brother was murdered,

281
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:45,327
and you sit here in the Water Gardens,
staring at the sky and doing nothing.

282
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,582
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat.
By law, that is not murder.

283
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,084
- Your brother.
- You don't have to remind me.

284
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,004
He was my brother
long before he was anything to you.

285
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,006
What will you do about his death?

286
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,592
I will bury him. I will mourn for him.

287
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,718
And then?

288
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,261
You would have me go to war?

289
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,721
The whole country would have you go to war.

290
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,640
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

291
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,895
The Sand Snakes are with me.

292
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,646
They have the love of their people.

293
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:18,444
They will avenge their father while
you sit here in your chair doing nothing.

294
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,699
Oberyn is dead,

295
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,578
and this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens,

296
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:31,457
eating our food, breathing our air.

297
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,627
How many of your brothers and sisters
do they have to kill?

298
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,755
Let me have her.

299
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,302
Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.

300
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,139
I loved my brother.

301
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,391
And you made him very happy.

302
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,603
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

303
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,066
But we do not mutilate little girls
for vengeance.

304
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,443
Not here.

305
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,153
Not while I rule.

306
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,657
And how long will that be?

DAARIO: The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

308
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,262
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off.

309
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,264
Of course you haven't found
any Sons of the Harpy.

310
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,766
You haven't, have you?

00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,315
they drink, whore,

314
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,192
fight in the streets,

315
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,694
they blend in.

316
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,154
They overhear things in taverns,

317
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,908
follow people to nice, quiet alleys,

318
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,035
break a few fingers,

319
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,829
overhear a few more things.

320
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,124
Before you know it...

321
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,603
No one here.

322
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,272
We go.

323
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,108
In a hurry? You're afraid?

324
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,152
Unsullied fear nothing.

325
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,696
Right.

326
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,114
That's your problem.

327
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:31,160
You understood fear once long ago,
but you've forgotten what it means.

328
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,537
Someone who's forgotten fear

329
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,582
has forgotten how to hide.

00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,131
(GROANS)

332
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,885
Fear is useful that way.

333
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,728
(SCREAMS)

334
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,329
Sons of the Harpy,
they want to put a collar back on my neck.

335
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,083
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace, you must kill him.

336
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,459
It would send a message.

337
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,170
I think you should exercise restraint,
Your Grace.

338
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,296
Why?

339
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,090
For one thing,
he may have valuable information.

340
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,051
The Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.

341
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,427
How do you know that?

342
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,429
Because I questioned him.

343
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,057
HIZDAHR: And the information you did get,
he is young and poor.

344
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,141
He is born free.

345
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,477
Why should he want to bring back slavery?
What did it do for him?

346
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,937
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride

347
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,855
was knowing that
there was someone lower than he was.

348
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:42,940
They pay him.

349
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,109
Great families afraid to do a thing.

350
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,902
They pay poor men to do it for them.

351
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,821
- And how do you know this?
- Everyone know this.

352
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,948
I don't know it,
and I'm the head of a great family.

353
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,367
BARRISTAN: We do not know
what this man did or didn't do.

354
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,996
Give him a trial at least. A fair trial.

355
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,289
Show all the citizens of Meereen

356
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,750
that you're better than
those who would depose you.

357
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:02,918
Teach them a better way.

358
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,421
I do not know the place
from where Old Ser comes.

359
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,924
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

360
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,010
But here in Meereen,

361
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,013
before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us.

362
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,390
So we learn much about them,

363
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,600
or we do not live long.

364
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,811
They teach me what they are.

365
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:25,107
Mercy, fair trial, these mean nothing to them.

366
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,443
All they understand is blood.

367
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,742
DAENERYS: Thank you all for your counsel.

368
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,711
Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you.

369
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,464
- About what?
- About your father.

370
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,507
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

371
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,134
You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies?

372
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,469
Consider me reminded.

373
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,429
Your Grace,

374
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,015
I served in his Kingsguard.

375
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,600
I was at his side from the first.

376
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,102
Your enemies did not lie.

377
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,230
Go on.

378
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,818
When the people rose in revolt against him,

379
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:13,405
your father set their towns and castles aflame.

380
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,784
He murdered sons in front of their fathers.

381
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,203
He burned men alive with wildfire

382
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,996
and laughed as they screamed.

383
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,626
And his efforts to stamp out dissent

384
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:30,047
led to rebellion
that killed every Targaryen except two.

385
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,674
I'm not my father.

386
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,511
No, Your Grace. Thank the gods.

387
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:40,516
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

388
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,394
And each time,
it made him feel powerful and right.

389
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,022
Until the very end.

390
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:55,864
I will not have the Son of the Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

391
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,495
Your Grace.

392

- (NEIGHING)
- (BLEATING)

393
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,047
There's a bug.

394
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,590
Yes, best be careful.

395
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,468
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

396
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:21,348
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

397
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,770
Besides,

398
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,482
what else is there for me to do
inside this fucking box?

399
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,608
You don't like it?

400
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,735
- I want to take a walk.
- You can't.

401
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:37,447
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

402
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,491
She ought to offer her cunt.

403
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,743
Best part of her for the best part of me.

404
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,498
Well, I suppose a box
is as good a place for me as anywhere.

405
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,209
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to Volantis

406
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,295
talking about the futility of everything?

407
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,546
You're right. No point.

408
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,465
The road to Volantis?

409
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,510
You said we were going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

410
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,012
The road to Meereen.

411
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,557
And what do you hope to find
at the end of the road to Meereen?

412
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,851
I told you. A ruler.

413
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,186
We've already got a ruler.

414
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,731
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

415
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:15,110
Every pile of shit on the side of every road
has someone's banner hanging from it.

416
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,448
You were quite good, you know, at ruling.

417
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,491
During your brief tenure as Hand.

418
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,077
I didn't rule. I was a servant.

419
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,538
Still, a man of talent.

420
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,081
Managed to kill a lot of people.

421
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:32,127
Yes, but you showed great promise
in other areas as well.

422
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,383
She wanted me to leave King's Landing.

423
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,594
She begged me.

424
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,845
I wouldn't go.

425
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,472
Why?

426
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,057
'Cause I liked it.

427
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,726
Power.

428
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,895
Even as a servant.

429
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,022
People follow leaders.

430
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,526
And they will never follow us.
They find us repulsive.

431
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:57,903
I find us repulsive.

432
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,905
And we find them repulsive,

433
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,283
which is why we surround ourselves
with large, comfortable boxes

434
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:04,493
to keep them away.

435
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,496
And yet,

436
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,748
no matter what we do,

437
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:14,253
people like you and me
are never really satisfied inside the box.

438
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,921
Not for long.

439
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,924
You're right.

440
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,301
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

441
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,596
How many dwarves are there in the world?

442
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,349
Is Cersei going to kill them all?

443
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:30,686
(FLY BUZZING)

444
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,854
Not him.

445
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,856
Are you trying to deceive your queen?

446
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,609
Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?

447
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:38,819
That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn.

448
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,197
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.

449
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,782
Mistakes will be made.

450
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,617
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you, Your Grace.

451
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,327
- Take the head.
- Pardon me, Your Grace.

452
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,413
I would take it, if you don't mind.

453
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,707
It could prove useful for my work.

454
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,750
Very good.

455
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,256
Over there will be fine.

456
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,551
You heard the man. Over there.

457
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,219
(DOOR CLOSES)

458
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,705
You're the Hand of the King?

459
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,290
No, Uncle.

460
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:37,044
Clearly it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

461
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,171
I'm merely advising my son
until he comes of age

462
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,839
and chooses a Hand for himself.

463
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,343
Your Grace,
I would be willing to serve provisionally

464
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,595
as the King's Hand
until he becomes old enough...

465
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,138
You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

466
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,598
but I don't imagine you'll have the time.

467
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,517
In addition to being Master of Ships,

468
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,312
the king has appointed you Master of Coin.

469
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,939
Oh, Your Grace.

470
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,443
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

471
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:06,198
He said he would be honored to have you
represent the crown's interests in the same.

472
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,283
The honor is all mine, Your Grace.

473
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,620
Your Grace, in the past on several occasions,

474
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,247
a grand maester has served
as the King's Hand.

475
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:18,126
The king has named Qyburn
the new Master of Whisperers.

476
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,715
Your Grace, him? This man?

477
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,010
This embarrassment to the Citadel?

478
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:32,099
Your Grace, what qualifications
can he possibly have for this post?

479
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,267
The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester.

480
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,895
That's far more than the eunuch ever had.

481
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:39,481
Far more than many ever have.

482
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,317
I must say, I cannot see...

483
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,738
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position
as commander of the Lannister armies,

484
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:50,325
it would please the king
if you would serve as his Master of War.

485
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,578
No man living better deserves the title.

486
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,831
That is kind of you to say.

487
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,208
I would like to hear it from the king himself.

488
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,543
The king is very busy at this moment.

489
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,087
He should be here
learning what it means to rule.

490
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,588
He is learning.

491
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:08,343
On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler,
he's asked me to speak on his behalf.

492
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,139
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother.

493
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:15,267
And to you. And to serve the king.

494
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,228
I did not return to serve as your puppet.

495

with sycophants.

499
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:29,990
What mission?

500
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,826
That is not your concern as Master of War.

501

I do not recognize your authority
to dictate what is and is not my concern.

You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

504
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,971
If he wants to send for me,
I will be waiting for him.

It looks like an animal.

509
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,033
Snake.

510
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,202
Snake. S.

- It's an S.
- Right, very good.

Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark,

514
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,669
was elected at the age of 10?

515

You'll learn, I promise.

517

I taught Ser Davos, and old people
are terrible at learning new things.

Well, you're a wonderful teacher.

Very patient.

I only said that the more time
that you spend practicing,

521

the faster you'll be able to read.

That's all right. We're doing just fine.

I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
have a lot to talk about.

Who taught you, your mother?

527
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,123
No, old Maester Cressen did.

528
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,667
I had a lot of time to practice.

529

They both died.

How did they cure you?

537
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:27,065
I don't remember. I was a baby.

538

What happened to your sisters?

541
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:42,163
My father made them move out of the keep
into the hut outside.

542
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,457
None of us were allowed to go near them.

543
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,003
But we heard them, especially at night.

544
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,716
They started to sound not like themselves.

547
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,516
They were covered with it.

Their faces, their arms.

549
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:07,814
They acted like animals.

550
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:12,527
My father had to drag them
out to the woods on a rope.

You need to stay away from that girl.

- Why?
- She's a wildling.

557

Her name is Gilly. She's nice.
I'm teaching her to read.

558
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:39,346
She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.

559
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,182
He executed their king for treason.

560
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,101
They could strike at him by striking at you.

561
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,062
Gilly wouldn't do that.

562

You prevented that order
from being carried out.

You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.

00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,126
A king's word is law.

568
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,130
Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

569
