1
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:07,090
My name is Chris Renaud, and to my side
is Pierre Coffin, the foreign guy.

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:11,595
We are the directors of Despicable Me.

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,139
-Yeah, this was one of those things that...
-Hello! Hello!

4
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:17,768
Hey, look! Hey! Here are Tim and Bob.
They're coming to join us. Come on in, guys.

5
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,186
Hey, guys!

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,524
Pierre has this French thing
about kissing all the actors.

7
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:28,904
Yeah, well, it's cultural.
There's nothing wrong with that, right? No?

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,199
Hey, pull up a chair, guys.
There's only one left.

9
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:35,619
-Well, just share it.
-Thank you.

10
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,914
Come on, Bob, share the seat, will you?

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,876
So, guys, we wanted to
talk about your acting methods.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,924
No, no, acting methods.
Listen, listen, acting methods! Methods!

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,933
Come on, Bob, leave him some room,
will you?

14
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,565
What did he say?

15
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:10,571
He said that the minions took a lot of
inspiration from Twinkies, Tylenol capsules,

16
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,991
-and tennis balls, which is weird.
-Sure.

17
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,159
Yeah, I don't think these guys have methods.

18
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,995
He's just saying
every yellow thing he knows.

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,749
That's true, he is.
He's just identifying things by color.

20
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,295
You don't understand me, right? You do?

21
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,298
I don't think he does.
I think he says he does, but he doesn't.

22
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,425
Okay.

23
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:41,101
One nice thing you can see here,
particularly this character and his son,

24
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,146
were some of the character designs
of Carter Goodrich

25
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,066
as realized by the modeling team in France,

26
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:53,363
and really sort of captured the quality
of his illustrations and his designs.

27
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,705
-Goodrich is the designer...
-American?

28
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,959
He's a character designer.

29
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:10,380
He obviously worked on
some of the Pixar films, notably Ratatouille,

30
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:16,011
and he brought his really distinct approach
to human characters to this film,

31
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,013
which we were very excited about.

32
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:24,436
Which kind of broke, actually,
with all the, I would say, regular CG style

33
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,730
-that there is out there.
-Yes.

34
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:31,902
And we tried, in every aspect of the design,
to just come up with some unique solutions.

35
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,491
So we've got a 3-D moment coming up here.

36
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,910
Which lasted one second
at the beginning of the movie.

37
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,746
Yes, but we liked it so much,
we kept adding time, actually,

38
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,750
‘cause it was so much fun
watching this kid enjoy his plane.

39
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:51,922
Oh, boy. There he goes.

40
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,465
-I love that joke.
-Yes.

41
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,302
This was one of our first big effect moments,

42
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,971
early effect moments,
with the deflating pyramid,

43
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:04,601
figuring out that,
and also the dust and sand that comes up,

44
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,687
So the effects team
was able to do a great job

45
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,772
with creating a believable effect there.

46
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,358
Try to protect their beloved landmarks.

47
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:17,030
-That's the French touch.
-We should probably mention,

48
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:21,576
this film was entirely animated
in France, in Paris, in fact,

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,411
so there's a lot
of little design sensibility animation

50
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:26,707
so there's a lot
of little design sensibility animation

51
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:32,671
that is really very distinct and
unique to France and Paris, I would say.

52
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,590
And here's the new...
Well the main character of the movie.

53
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,092
Yes.

54
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:41,263
Here is Gru, and, you know,
we went through several designs

55
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,473
to land on this particular character,

56
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,228
sort of wanting somebody who was
appealing, but also looked like a villain.

57
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:53,191
And we landed on some
distinct characteristics, notably his scarf,

58
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,528
which we originally were talking about
dedicating an animator,

59
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,072
-remember, to just doing that scarf.
-Yeah.

60
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,534
But we were able to
work out a simpler solution,

61
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,496
so we could have the scarf
through most of the movie.

62
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,998
Poor kid.

63
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,460
So, obviously,
from a story point of view here,

64
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,671
we wanted to show
that Gru was the type of character

65
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,299
who was maybe not so nice to children,

66
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,762
and that was a clear way to establish it,
particularly as he moves through the movie

67
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,055
and his attitude changes.

68
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:30,061
It was actually interesting, also, finding all
the sorts of physicality this guy could have.

69
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:37,444
Our inspirations were
a John Cleese, Mr. Bean type of guy.

70
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,112
-Peter Sellers.
-Peter Sellers.

71
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:43,950
The things we talked about was just trying
to show that he had joy in his villainy,

72
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:47,329
like, just his laugh
when he shoots the freeze ray,

73
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,416
or drinking his coffee while his giant tank
pushes other cars off the road.

74
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:56,379
Always that he enjoyed being bad.
He sort of delighted in it.

75
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,132
There's his...

76
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,469
We were looking for
what Gru's house would look like,

77
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,639
and we took the idea of a standard suburb,

78
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,100
and then Gru's house
was kind of a similar shape,

79
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,269
but was really a black spot on the world.

80
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:15,440
He'd taken his house,
made it bigger, and painted it entirely black,

81
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,650
so that's kind of where we...

82
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:21,112
That car that Gru was driving
was one of our early designs

83
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,074
from Eric Guillon, the art director,

84
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,869
but also one
of our chief concept developers, visually,

85
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,664
and it really became
a touchstone image for us

86
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:34,543
and sort of defined Gru,
with his Cold War-era machinery.

87
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,841
This is some other things
that Eric had done...

88
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,678
There's Kyle. Get to that in a second.
With the interior of Gru's house,

89
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:49,933
it took us a while to land
what Gru's house would look like inside.

90
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,685
We wanted to have a lot of...

91
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,522
There's a lot of Charles Addams design cues.

92
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,776
The paintings on the wall, the disasters,
the suits of armor, the taxidermy.

93
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,698
Remember how the design
used to be very clogged?

94
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:08,034
-Yes.
-And it became almost... Not Zen-ish,

95
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:12,873
but gained in clarification,

96
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,709
Just because we couldn't find
the character in there anymore.

97
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,378
Yeah, and I think we ended up
putting things back in

98
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:18,879
to get the little bit of the clutter,

99
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,714
to get the little bit of the clutter,

100
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,217
the neat bric-a-brac
that Gru has in his house.

101
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,804
So we did a journey with
a little too much stuff, not enough stuff,

102
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,974
and then we found a nice balance.

103
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:31,892
In terms of designs also, the girls were
actually interesting, in terms of process,

104
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,811
In terms of designs also, the girls were
actually interesting, in terms of process,

105
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,897
just because these girls
that you see in the movie today

106
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,736
weren't designed that way
at the beginning at all. They were...

107
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,573
I don't know if they were more realistic,
but they certainly were a design

108
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:51,912
that went into 3-D...
In CG, sorry, in a very bad way.

109
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:58,251
Either our translation of it or just their
design initially didn't work out so well,

110
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:02,088
-S0 we went back to the drawing board and...
-And we made them more stylized.

111
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,258
Some of our inspirations
were the Peanuts characters,

112
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:10,013
even the designs of some of The Simpsons
characters, how they're very graphic,

113
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,434
and we started thinking about those ideas
as we developed the girls,

114
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,941
and just making them more graphic
and more stylized.

115
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,694
So, here's Gru making his way.

116
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:29,449
We wanted that kind of Get Smart,
contraption-converting idea,

117
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,870
so here is where we first see his elevator
down to his underground lab,

118
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,874
where Dr Nefario works,
who we just met in the previous scene.

119
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,126
It feels a very complicated way
just to get down there.

120
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,130
It does! And we actually had all kinds
of problems making it work, remember?

121
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,800
It was, like, the door opens one way,
then it opens another way.

122
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,135
Couldn't he just take an elevator
down there?

123
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,346
Sliding down that pole there,
and then that's it.

124
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:56,768
In the end, it works out all right.
So here's a first glimpse of Gru's minions,

125
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:03,942
which started as typical-type henchmen
or stormtroopers,

126
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:10,448
and then we came upon the idea
of making them more like drones,

127
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,911
and that they're cloned little mole people

128
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,832
that are truly just innumerable.

129
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,876
There are so many of them.
I don't know if that's a word, "innumerable,"

130
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,295
but there's just a ton of them,
and they all look the same.

131
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:30,719
There's basically six different body shapes,
I think, in here, that we use throughout,

132
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,806
but it creates a faceless army of thousands.

133
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,892
I think we have three body shapes
and six different haircuts.

134
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,104
And eye configuration.

135
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:47,027
So, yeah, some have one eye,
some have two.

136
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,237
And so, yeah, here they're gathering,

137
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,159
and this is the scene where we get
the first glimpse at Gru's master plan

138
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,995
to steal the moon.

139
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,831
All right! Simmer down.

140
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,834
One of the things that we see also here,

141
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,337
this is one of the earlier scenes
we recorded with Steve Carell,

142
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:11,176
is really the accent that Steve developed

143
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:15,430
through the course of creating the film
and the character,

144
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:20,435
and in his own words, "Somewhere between
Bela Lugosi and Ricardo Montalban."

145
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,855
Sort of an accent
from everywhere and nowhere,

146
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,900
obviously with a European influence.

147
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:31,696
And this was one of the first scenes
where he started playing with the dialogue

148
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,282
and creating these Gru-isms.

149
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,994
Basically where he would turn a phrase,
a catchphrase,

150
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,998
and he would mix up the cadence
or sort of put an "S" on the end of a word

151
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:47,670
and would make it his own,
as he was going through the character.

152
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,299
I think it's very gutsy, too,
at least from the production side of things,

153
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:56,346
to take very famous actors
and not necessarily recognize their voices.

154
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,225
Even Jason Segel and...

155
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,062
-Yeah.
-Miss Hattie.

156
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:09,067
Kristen Wiig and Julie Andrews
really playing against type.

157
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,906
I mean, we tried to...
Clearly, when Steve set the bar here,

158
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,408
we talked to the other actors
about creating characters

159
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,078
versus just using their ordinary voice,

160
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:24,582
and everybody
was really enthusiastic about that,

161
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,877
and I think really created a unique character,

162
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,715
which was, I think, a lot of fun to animate,
but also to create a story around.

163
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,095
-Russell Brand as Dr Nefario.
-Yeah, he's great.

164
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,473
Could you check just a little bit...
I'm asking you the questions here.

165
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,101
Our mediator, Pierre Coffin.

166
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,355
No, it's really interesting, just because
I had preconceived ideas about...

167
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:52,944
Okay, a written script has these,
well, little gems of dialogues in there.

168
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,322
How much direction do you give actors?

169
00:10:56,406 --> 00:11:00,660
Do they have liberty to go beyond the text
and try to find something else?

170
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,330
Do any of the changes they provide

171
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:08,084
influence a rewriting of some sort?

172
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,296
They do. I think it's usually within the script,

173
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,174
and it sort of depends on the scene.
We'll see Sleepy Kittens later,

174
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,135
which was a scene
that was beautifully written on the page,

175
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,721
and there's actually not much adlibbing
in there.

176
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:24,934
And then some scenes... I think this one,
in some ways, had more than others,

177
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:30,773
‘cause it was one of the early scenes,
and I think one of the first that we recorded,

178
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,109
but also one of the first
that we wrote and storyboarded,

179
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,861
or we didn't write, but Cinco and Ken wrote.

180
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:41,492
So the actor had an opportunity here
to contribute in a bigger way,

181
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:45,246
‘cause it was so early in the process.
I think this scene in particular

182
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,042
was where we landed some of those,
like I said, Gru-isms,

183
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,378
where he took the dialogue
and made it his own,

184
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,006
‘cause he was creating this character, really,
with this scene

185
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,508
as one of the main building blocks,

186
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:01,596
‘cause it's where the character
announces his plan and all that kind of stuff.

187
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,766
Once we had those recordings

188
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,099
and built the scene
as a radio play, practically,

189
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,311
and built the scene
as a radio play, practically,

190
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:12,190
the writers, Cinco and Ken,
were able to think about that

191
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:16,903
as they were creating successive pages
and scenes.

192
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,532
So, yeah, the voice that the actor
helped create off an early scene...

193
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,576
Yeah, you take it back,

194
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,830
and it influences
how the rest of the pages are written,

195
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,709
or how the ideas for the scenes come about.

196
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,756
It's actually cool,
because in animated movies,

197
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,261
-you get the gift of time, just a little bit...
-Yes.

198
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:45,431
...because there's so many processes,
like writing, storyboard, layout,

199
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:50,395
where you can actually massage
these little changes in, in terms of dialogue.

200
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,439
Yes. It's definitely an iterative process.

201
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:58,111
Things like that little joke that just went by
with the tape on the floor

202
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:04,242
was contributed by a storyboard artist.
And so, it's the kind of thing

203
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:09,122
where everybody, the writers,
the actors, the storyboard artists,

204
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,418
the producers, everyone sort of contributes,

205
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:18,089
and it's definitely like building a house
one LEGO brick at a time,

206
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,342
which I think is a big difference
from live action,

207
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,136
where before you shoot,

208
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,638
you really want
everything worked out beforehand.

209
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,850
We build it as we go, I'd say, a little bit.

210
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,644
I think we can do a little better than that.

211
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:36,482
Here's Miss Hattie.
This is Kristen Wiig, who sort of gave that...

212
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:42,822
Our idea was, on the surface,
a nice person that says terrible things.

213
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:49,537
So, she really took that and
had this nice little Southern lilt to her voice,

214
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,496
and, of course, would turn up the volume
when she had to yell at the girls.

215
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:54,125
and, of course, would turn up the volume
when she had to yell at the girls.

216
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,630
And it's a gift for animators to have
these character changes happening so fast.

217
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,550
It's just so easy to see someone nice

218
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,636
play around with the idea that,
"She's nice," and then...

219
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,930
All of a sudden
you've got the voice helping you out

220
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,559
to make the physicality
of the animation come out

221
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,228
and bring out that other character.

222
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,482
And I think what we always try to look for
are contrasts,

223
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:23,529
and here's a great one with Gru's mom.
The contrast, frankly, is in the casting.

224
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:28,743
Julie Andrews playing
a terrible mother and woman

225
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,537
who is not supportive of her son in the least,

226
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,208
So that kind of creates a nice thing
in and of itself.

227
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,169
And certainly, Gru,
who's a powerful villain on the surface,

228
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:42,799
but he's got minions who are incompetent,
his chief scientist can't hear,

229
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:47,220
so those kind of contrasts
within the characters

230
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:52,934
are just always something we would try
to find, ‘cause it just lends itself to comedy.

231
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,144
Even in terms of sequences, actually.

232
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:01,651
In the previous sequence we saw
Gru being at the top of his game, basically,

233
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,195
and now he's gonna come
into the Bank of Evil,

234
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,156
where he's not gonna be
appearing so big at all.

235
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:11,994
Yeah, he's like every man
who has to state his case

236
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,164
before somebody more powerful than him.

237
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:23,423
This is a great visual pitched
by Pierre Coffin, who came up with this.

238
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,008
-Did I really? I can't remember.
-Yes. Yeah, I'm pretty sure you did.

239
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,593
Thank you.

240
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,804
But what's great about it is,
it says everything

241
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:35,309
about, probably, how a lot of people
feel about banks these days, yeah.

242
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,688
So, anyway.

243
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:43,901
I was surprised to see how
that Lehman Brothers joke actually worked.

244
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:48,156
-Yeah. Our timing weirdly was...
-Is it gonna work in two years?

245
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:52,410
-Yeah, yeah, I don't know.
-Lehman who?

246
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,872
So, this is a moment
where we really get a sense of Gru's...

247
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,458
What he went through as a child.

248
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,836
We felt that was
an important character thing to, again,

249
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:07,717
let the audience side with this bad guy,
is that we see why he chose a life of villainy.

250
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:13,014
And as usual, it's the fault of his parents.

251
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,727
But anyway. Then this is Vector,
who was played by Jason Segel,

252
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,898
who becomes Gru's main rival
through the film.

253
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,233
Sort of an up-and-coming villain.

254
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:30,573
Our first idea, or in the original story,
it was a hero Gru was up against.

255
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,035
It went through, I think,
a few different versions,

256
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,580
and then the idea came about
to make it a rival villain,

257
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,998
So it was more about the world of villainy,

258
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:43,169
which instantly made it
a bit more interesting, I think.

259
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:48,841
That was Sergio Pablos' initial concept,
right? The superhero thing?

260
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,344
I actually don't remember
the hero portion, whether that...

261
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,347
I think that was
in the original story pitch, yes.

262
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,891
Ever seen one before?
No, you haven't. I invented it.

263
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,434
Do you want a demonstration?

264
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,021
This story originally came
from Sergio Pablos, a Disney animator,

265
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:06,234
and the main elements of
a villain with these three little girls

266
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:11,197
that he needed to break into a fortress
were all present in that original pitch.

267
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,368
It's actually funny,
because when we see his initial pitch now,

268
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:21,249
we see all these milestone images
that are actually ending up in the movie.

269
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,210
-Like the tea party.
-Yeah. Yeah, I think the narrative stuff,

270
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,463
like the shrink ray and the moon plot,
and all that stuff, came later,

271
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,384
but the core story of this villain
taking care of these three little girls

272
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,010
was definitely present in that stuff,

273
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,264
and some of the specific ideas,
which we'll see later comedically.

274
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,723
Again, talking about contrast,

275
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:42,061
here's a guy who's a super-powerful villain
brought low by these girls

276
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,772
Just instantly lent itself
to drama and comedy.

277
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:51,904
This is the banker, played by Will Arnett,
who is going for a Larry Flynt...

278
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:57,451
He just is this quintessential heavy,
and his voice is really great for that.

279
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,291
I have to mention,
there was a moment when, in this scene,

280
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:07,086
the banker was smashing many more things
besides an apple,

281
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,257
doing too many things,
and so we pulled it back to just the apple.

282
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,178
It was a bizarre scene that was funny,

283
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,890
but the pacing just didn't work
with the overall film, which is...

284
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,811
Constantly, you have to make that choice,
what to remove,

285
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:28,441
because very often people,
storyboard artists, animators, writers,

286
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,067
contribute great ideas,

287
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,612
but it becomes about
the overall pacing of the film,

288
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,072
and you have to...
That's a big part of the process.

289
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,701
It's not about what to include,
but what to take out.

290
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,078
There goes one last piranha.

291
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,881
So anyway. So here is the sequence

292
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:56,093
where Gru and a couple of his minions
come to steal the shrink ray,

293
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,262
which they need for the moon plot.

294
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,140
This was also a very early scene done,
this particular moment,

295
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,769
‘cause none of our main characters
were in the scene.

296
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,149
And you can see more
of Gru's technology in this,

297
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:14,028
and how it contrasts
with Vector's technology.

298
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,448
The thought was,

299
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:22,411
Gru's things were
Cold War-era metal rivets, iron,

300
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:27,750
and Vector was gonna be more like an iPod,
white plastic with orange accents.

301
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,381
Do you remember how these guys
started to dance at one point?

302
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,466
-Yes.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

303
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,095
It was too long. Get it out.

304
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,309
So, here comes one of the minions.
We had to design a special...

305
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,520
I think, originally, the claw,
he was just hanging on it.

306
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,647
We had to design a little, special seat
for him to be on it.

307
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:50,940
Yeah.

308
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,613
I should mention quickly, I guess,

309
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:03,369
the voice of the minions
through most of the film is Pierre.

310
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,123
I do a little bit, and also...

311
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:08,999
We got it!

312
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,001
-I'm spacing out.
-Jemaine Clement.

313
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,630
Jemaine Clement, sorry, yes.
Sorry, I spaced out.

314
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,970
So, we did quite a bit of work
trying to figure it out.

315
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:26,100
We had some sound design done,
and then Pierre basically...

316
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,102
-I spoke French.
-Yeah.

317
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:33,524
And we pitched that,
and it sounds like minions. Easy as that.

318
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:38,571
No, it's true that at some point we were
discussing, should they make noises?

319
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,114
Should they have their own language?

320
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:44,827
Should their own language have little words
that we should recognize?

321
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,914
-And we settled for that idea.
-Yeah, we kind of go on the range.

322
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,877
We started thinking that they would be mute,

323
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,254
not speak at all,
and be completely pantomime characters,

324
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,550
but it limited us a bit too much.
And I think we also thought,

325
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:03,012
"Would we go for the obvious, high-pitched
voice or would we try something different?"

326
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:07,057
But the reality is, is that in our minds,
the high-pitched just is funny,

327
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:12,646
-So there's no getting around it.
-Classic, I would say, but it does work.

328
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:20,696
And it's weird how important they got
as the movie progressed, I guess.

329
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,116
Yes. Yeah, we quickly found as we...

330
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,329
And this is one of the early scenes where
we tried to incorporate them in, actually.

331
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,497
Originally, they weren't in the scene,

332
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:35,085
and we started looking for ways
to give them a bigger part of the movie.

333
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,965
That's weird. What is going...

334
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:44,386
This was some nice work,
working with the effects team

335
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,808
on what a shrink ray would look like
and what things shrinking would look like.

336
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,228
-What clouds would look like.
-Yeah, exactly. Clouds and missiles.

337
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,564
So, this was quite a big scene.

338
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,402
Weirdly enough, even though everything
changed in the core of that scene,

339
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,071
-the ending never changed.
-No.

340
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,740
There was always that one shot of him
Sitting on the little ship.

341
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,242
I hate that guy!

342
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,747
-Is that a phone? Is that your phone?
-It's not my phone.

343
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,000
I don't know where's... Mine's off.

344
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,252
-Hello?
-Yeah.

345
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:19,421
-Yeah, yeah. It's Tim.
-Tim?

346
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,423
Tim, what did we talk about?

347
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,926
What's the number-one rule
before we come in here?

348
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,429
-What's the number-one rule?
-We're never gonna finish this.

349
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,599
No. That is not the number-one rule.
I don't even know what you're talking about.

350
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,270
-He's not even hanging up.
-No, he's not, he's...

351
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,106
You're right, he's still just talking.
Tim, who are you talking to?

352
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,776
Who's so important
you've gotta talk to them right now?

353
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,698
Listen, you need to hang up right now.

354
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,950
He's still not...

355
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,287
Yeah, Bob, could you punch Tim
in the shoulder, please?

356
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,038
Okay.

357
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,874
-So, what were we saying?
-I don't know.

358
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:59,545
Yeah, yeah, it's gonna take me awhile
to get back my train of thought.

359
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,714
-Did you invite these guys?
-No, no.

360
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,050
-Who did? Is it Production?
-I think it was, yeah.

361
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,844
-I don't know.
-John Cohen? Chris Meledandri? Who?

362
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:07,553
-I don't know.
-John Cohen? Chris Meledandri? Who?

363
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:12,141
Janet Healy? It can't be Janet Healy, right?
Yeah, they should be in the room with us.

364
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:15,811
Yeah, to control them, exactly.

365
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:26,405
We play with this a couple of times
in the movie, is Gru in disguise,

366
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:31,160
which was the thing we were talking about
from the Peter Sellers films,

367
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,995
you know,
particularly the Pink Panther movies,

368
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,915
where he was always in some kind
of crazy disguise, which made no sense,

369
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,750
So we made that
an element of this character,

370
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,168
which we use a couple of times.

371
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:48,677
With Vector, you know, we were
talking about having his technology be

372
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,600
almost impersonal,
like just the push of a button,

373
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,186
where Gru is more hand-to-hand combat,
you know?

374
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,022
He's out there, he's got
the night-vision goggles, he's trying...

375
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,107
-In broad daylight.
-In broad daylight, of course.

376
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:04,360
Where are the neighbors?

377
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,363
And I think another thing
we tried to do here in the beginning

378
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:12,451
is have a cartoon quality to the violence,
for lack of a better word,

379
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:16,121
because these are villains with guns
and missiles and weapons,

380
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:20,626
and so we felt that, to make it work,

381
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,712
we had to give it a Warner Bros. quality,

382
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,299
where it was obviously ineffective
and cartoonish.

383
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,468
This scene, this moment,
a perfect example of that.

384
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:37,142
It's such a cool beginning of the movie,
at least in the front part,

385
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,895
being very cartoony, because it sells...

386
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:44,566
It doesn't prepare for what's coming up next,
which is emotional and...

387
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,736
Right. And it lets us get away with things,
you know,

388
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,073
particularly when you're including guns
and things like that.

389
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:55,077
-And sharking Gru. How'd he survive that?
-Yeah, exactly!

390
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,497
-Tell the people how Gru survived that.
-You don't want to know.

391
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,084
Whoa! Cool.

392
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:07,006
So, here is really a pivotal story moment,

393
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:11,343
and that's why we made Vector's house
truly a living weapon,

394
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,179
with the idea that it was impenetrable,

395
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,932
and very clear, visually,
that there was no way to get inside

396
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,268
except, of course,
for these little girls selling cookies,

397
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:24,940
and so, this is where Gru hatches his plan
to use them as a Trojan horse.

398
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:29,403
So, this is the pivotal moment
of how their lives collide.

399
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,784
And again, this is another element
that we use a couple of times,

400
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:40,622
is his hallucinations, I guess,
for lack of a better word.

401
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:44,543
His visions of his life with the girls
and how he's gonna use them.

402
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,463
I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots
disguised as cookies!

403
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:48,714
What?

404
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,549
This is a phone call to Dr Nefario,

405
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,135
and this was an element
of Dr Nefario's character which,

406
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,221
it's funny, kind of went away and then we,
sort of, though, built it back slowly,

407
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,222
it's funny, kind of went away and then we,
sort of, though, built it back slowly,

408
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,224
which was that he was hard of hearing.

409
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,894
But we got a lot of good stuff,
I think, out of that idea.

410
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,229
Dr. Gru.

411
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,440
There's another disguise.

412
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,153
It's cool to see...
Graphically, that side shot is great,

413
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,824
just because you see how awkward it is
for a big guy to sit on a little chair.

414
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,159
Yeah.

415
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,663
Always has that strong pause
that makes the image interesting.

416
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,251
So, Pierre, can you tell us anything
about the minions there,

417
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:31,340
-as far as the development of the language?
-I... I don't want to.

418
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,802
-I'm putting you on the spot.
-Yeah. No, no. Nothing...

419
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:41,767
I remember making all these sounds.
I didn't bring myself over to the studio yet,

420
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,437
and I was recording this
with my kids banging on my door,

421
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,607
asking me what I was doing.

422
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,692
On certain tracks
you can actually hear my son

423
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,528
asking me to come out.

424
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,950
Nobody will ever know, but the language...
You had the framework there

425
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,786
that you'd done with the storyboards,
and I just illustrated it,

426
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:06,041
giving it character, basically,
in terms of voicing, vocal performance,

427
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,711
and that's the secret, I guess,
to making it come to life.

428
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,714
I think the magic thing is to...
Whatever word you're saying,

429
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:18,554
you've gotta feel what the intent is,
and that's universal. Whatever.

430
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,141
You can say it by words,
but you can certainly say it the way...

431
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:26,645
By the way you're saying it, you totally
understand what the guys are saying.

432
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,815
And that was an early moment
for the minions,

433
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,902
where we discovered a personality thing
that we all thought worked,

434
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,654
which was that they're irresponsible.

435
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,991
They get lost. They're trying to help,
they're trying to do their duty,

436
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,910
and then they sort of veer off
into fighting each other,

437
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,747
and so, as we started putting
the pieces together of these characters,

438
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,750
that was one of the early ones
that we thought would really work well

439
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:50,377
and be funny.

440
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,672
Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes
to come to the lobby.

441
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:03,265
So, just one of the things
with the girls is that,

442
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,769
in the early part of the film,
we were treating them all as the same.

443
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:11,440
Basically just little visions
of childhood innocent...

444
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:14,526
Sort of like Agnes, I suppose.
Three different Agneses.

445
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,362
But as we went along, we quickly discovered

446
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:21,200
that we needed
to make them individual, strong characters,

447
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:24,620
and so Agnes became
the young, innocent, cute one.

448
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:30,042
Edith was a bit of the rebel who acts out,
and then Margo was the...

449
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,376
I'll go with voice of reason.

450
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,547
She has the unenviable job of being
the one trying to talk sense into her sisters

451
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:37,299
and into Gru.

452
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,637
-But an important role, actually.
- Totally.

453
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,472
So that worked much better,

454
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,141
and that was obviously
what informed the design

455
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,726
and the voice casting.

456
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,729
You know, we went
with Miranda Cosgrove for Margo,

457
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,981
who's actually much older
than Margo is in reality,

458
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:59,905
but it's nice. It gives her voice some weight.
You know, she feels like the sensible one.

459
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,408
And then Elsie Fisher, who plays Agnes,
was just...

460
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:08,080
Just had this great, genuine quality
that is hard to match.

461
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:12,501
You know, she instantly... Her dad
would actually tickle her in the session,

462
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,754
and that's how we got
some of these great laughs

463
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:20,008
-that we recorded and used for her character.
-How did you do it when she cried?

464
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:24,096
That was... That was...
Listen, there's child labor laws.

465
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,264
I'm not gonna go into...

466
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:29,601
And then Dana Gaier, who played Edith,
Just had this great kind of...

467
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:33,355
We compared her to Peppermint Patty
in the Peanuts cartoons.

468
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,817
This nice, husky quality
that made her very distinctive.

469
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,611
She's very good, actually, just because...

470
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,197
The character of Edith
is really great just because...

471
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:47,035
Again, an animator's dream,
just because she has a boyish charm to her,

472
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,708
and everything is about
her physical movements,

473
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,044
and you gotta make that little effort
to understand what she's feeling,

474
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,048
and that's always fulfilling for an audience.

475
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,885
So, this moment was about
checking back in with Vector

476
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:09,558
and the rivalry,
and what he's up to with the shrink ray,

477
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:15,564
-as he plays with it in the bathroom.
-Is that your joke? The shrinking toilet?

478
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,319
Is it? I don't know, actually.
It might be from Cinco and Ken.

479
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,905
I think the toilet exploding, that was...
That was the...

480
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,657
That was the part that I was able to...

481
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:29,578
With the board artist, David Berthier,
I was able to work on.

482
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,163
Okay, bye.

483
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,251
So whenever we have a toilet explode
in a character's face, I'm all for that.

484
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,670
-It's always funny.
-Yeah, it is.

485
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,756
-You've seen that in the past, right?
-Yeah, that's right.

486
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:41,923
A lot of classic films.

487
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:47,095
Yeah, we've seen a lot of classic films
use the miniature toilet explosion.

488
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,517
So anyway,
this is the girls' first view of the house,

489
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,855
and then Gru's dead lawn.

490
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,108
You can see, particularly on the house,
the front of the house,

491
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,944
and in this hallway,
there's some beautiful texturing,

492
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:08,700
and really... All kinds of little paintings
and things that Gru has, you know?

493
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:14,623
That's a Jesse James "Wanted" poster.
There's headlines of his past deeds,

494
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,877
and all kinds of interesting things
in his house that you'll never see,

495
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,298
but the modeling, surfacing,
art direction teams

496
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:27,886
really did amazing work filling out his world.

497
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,307
When we got adopted by a bald guy,
I thought this'd be more like Annie.

498
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:38,730
There's a giant Venus flytrap which
we wanted to animate, but never could.

499
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:43,819
This is Kyle, who we saw earlier,
who is Gru's sort of dog.

500
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,405
We never really... He's not really a true dog.

501
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,740
We always figured
he was a genetic mutation,

502
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:54,413
much along the lines of the minions,
that Gru took a liking to and keeps as a pet,

503
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,498
even though he's a bit afraid of him.

504
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:02,587
-Do you remember when Kyle was Kragul?
-Yes, Kyle was Kragul,

505
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:09,010
and Gru had an Igor-like sidekick
named Kyle, who was human.

506
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,181
Very often in these films,
you get to the point

507
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,600
where you're like,
"We've got too many characters to service

508
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,269
"and to do justice to,"

509
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,855
So you have to make some decisions,
again, about what to put in

510
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,692
and what not to put in.
We really wanted always to focus on Gru

511
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:28,780
as a character and really make him
appealing as the centerpiece of this movie,

512
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:33,952
and as a result,
we gave the name "Kyle" to the dog

513
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,539
and got rid of the human sidekick.

514
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:41,293
And I think Nefario actually came up
a little bit as a result,

515
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,296
sort of filling that hole.

516
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:48,800
It was kind of weird, having a talking pet.
I remember scenes in it where...

517
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:52,888
-That's true.
-The dog talked for a time. Yes, we tried that.

518
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,642
Rule number one.

519
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,060
Russell Brand was a good sport.

520
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,147
He went from being a talking dog
to Dr Nefario.

521
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,902
He did a great job with Dr Nefario.
It was so great to have him take that role.

522
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:09,529
It was much better than the talking dog.

523
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,701
-Where did you get that?
-Found it.

524
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,332
Again, you can see in the kitchen,
there's all kinds of great things in there.

525
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:25,003
There's a brain in the water cooler,

526
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,256
there's a chainsaw hanging on the wall,
there's a flamethrower.

527
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,092
There was a scene at one point
of Gru cooking breakfast,

528
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,844
using all his implements of evil.

529
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,431
Yeah, that was supposed to be
the opening scene.

530
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,601
Yeah, that was an opening scene,
and so a lot of the items

531
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:44,856
that were created for that scene
are still in the kitchen.

532
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,566
So, there's some interesting things in there.

533
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,195
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

534
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,281
And, of course, an espresso machine,
you can see back there.

535
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,951
Some ordinary things as well.
Yeah, that's right.

536
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:07,963
-That's Nefario's first screw-up, is it?
-l think it is, yes.

537
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,799
So this was a moment of, again,

538
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:15,136
establishing Nefario's inability
to hear the mission,

539
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:18,890
and he creates boogie robots
instead of cookie robots.

540
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,309
An understandable mistake.

541
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:26,064
So, we really went for the
Saturday Night Fever lighting scenario here,

542
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,568
‘cause that felt like the most fun.

543
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,319
Boogie!

544
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,573
Look at this. Watch me!

545
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,577
And the lab set is...

546
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,580
You know, what we tried to do
is create something that was simple,

547
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:45,584
but would feel
as If it was really cool and interesting,

548
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,587
So there's not a lot of detail in there,
but it still has a neat feel to it.

549
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,678
This is the girls heading out,

550
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:03,643
trying to figure out what's going on,
and they stumble upon Gru's elevator.

551
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,606
TV!

552
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,362
-She's never gonna reach it.
-Yeah.

553
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,115
This is one of those staging cheats,
where she's got no...

554
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,284
She's, like, one-foot high.

555
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,537
Which you do all the time, you know?
That's the fun thing about animation,

556
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:26,124
is we always have fo...
Pierre would say to me, “Let's cheat it,"

557
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:31,713
and so very often we did that,
Just to get things to work and play.

558
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,381
Come on!

559
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,884
I don't think he's a dentist.

560
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,387
And this, yeah, the door in the elevator
opens differently here

561
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,974
than it does when Gru first goes downstairs.

562
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:49,898
So this is my favorite scene in the movie,
which is a terrible thing to admit because

563
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,484
-it's completely surface...
-Well, I don't know if it's the scene...

564
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,985
I don't know if it's the scene
or just one shot.

565
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,403
Or the moment. The moment.

566
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,405
-/ love this one, too. You can...
-Yeah, that's true.

567
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,826
So this whole bit was... We wanted
to do something with Nefario as Q

568
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:07,082
in the Bond films,
and sort of show his ineptitude.

569
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,917
So, Bob, what can you tell us...

570
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,003
What do you remember about this moment,
when we were on the set?

571
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:22,931
Yeah, he says the worst they made him do
was the dart gun. I could see why.

572
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:27,102
But he says the smell was something
like burned cabbage, which is...

573
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:30,730
-Doesn't sound good.
-That didn't sound like cabbage.

574
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:41,282
So finally Nefario creates the cookie bot,

575
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:45,870
which is what Gru needs
to carry out his plan.

576
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:49,541
And, of course, it's interrupted by the girls.

577
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,293
So, this was a scene
that we worked on quite a bit.

578
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,965
We kept changing it, what was happening,

579
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:01,553
trying to make it feel like
the girls were really interrupting something,

580
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,724
and also that they were suspicious of Gru,
that they weren't just innocents

581
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,310
that weren't like,
"Hey, what's going on here with this guy?”

582
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:14,232
And Gru comes up with a lie
that he's a spy, which was nice.

583
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:18,987
It gave the girls...
They didn't seem like fools, I guess,

584
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:22,240
or just so innocent
that they wouldn't operate in our world.

585
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,491
You know what I mean?

586
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,660
So they felt like kids
that you could relate to a little bit.

587
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,745
Hey!

588
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,581
My unicorn!

589
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,251
That gun that Edith's holding,
we never could agree

590
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,837
which end was the end that shot, remember?

591
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,590
-I think we got it wrong in the end.
-Chris! Chris! Chris!

592
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,801
-What? What? What do you need, Bob?
-What does he want?

593
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,597
-What?
-He's gotta go to the bathroom.

594
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,932
-We're in the middle of recording.
-Bob. Bob, come on.

595
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,434
This is the... Okay.

596
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,353
The DVD people listening to this
commentary are gonna be super interested.

597
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:56,524
-You can't hold it for two...
-He's gone, he's gone.

598
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,610
Hey, close the door! Thank you!

599
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,779
-We're still recording in here.
-Thank you, Bob.

600
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:02,614
Please don't... Yeah.

601
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,283
-He flushed.
-Yeah, he flushed.

602
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,035
Great. Thanks a lot, Bob.

603
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,040
Feeling better? What? Yes? Okay.

604
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,627
Listen, just take your seat.
You two share the seat

605
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,463
and just keep it down
for the rest of this audio commentary, okay?

606
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,631
Okay, okay.

607
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,385
Tim just left the room also.

608
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,889
Monkey see, monkey...
Minion see, minion do.

609
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,308
Hey, you know what?
I think I'm gonna go, too.

610
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,559
You're not leaving me here with these two.

611
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,065
-Big moment.
-Yes, this was a big moment.

612
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:41,986
This was...
We'd started with the idea the minions...

613
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,907
I can't remember if they were going out
to get a toy originally or not,

614
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:52,330
but we called it "The Minion Mission,"
and it was quite a long bit at some point.

615
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,916
-They always went to a store first...
-Yeah.

616
00:38:55,041 --> 00:39:00,755
...but then it was they foiled robbery,
won some money, bought a car.

617
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,175
We had this idea of having them...

618
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:08,513
That little trip to the corner shop
or whatever

619
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,348
was supposed to go like...
Carry them to the other side of the world.

620
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,768
-Yes.
-And then they were, maybe...

621
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:18,106
We were thinking of having them come back
and save the day.

622
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,942
In the third act,
or maybe they didn't come back,

623
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:26,531
and we picked up with them in the credits.
So, we played with this idea for awhile.

624
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,785
But basically what happened,
which very often happens,

625
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,788
is that the narrative of it just...

626
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:37,876
It was too much material
that was outside of the narrative drive,

627
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,963
which at this point in the movie
is Gru trying to get the moon

628
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,047
and his bonding with the girls,

629
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:43,548
and his bonding with the girls,

630
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:48,219
so eventually we made it the moment
that you see, where they're in the store.

631
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,143
It was your cousin's idea.

632
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,644
What?

633
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,813
That's you.

634
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,234
-How come that got left in?
-I know, that's right.

635
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:07,906
That was one of the few minion voices
that's not Pierre.

636
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:11,117
So here's Gru putting the girls to bed
in these bomb beds,

637
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,747
which was, again, one of the early designs.

638
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,083
If you look on the shelves in this room,

639
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:22,503
there's all kinds
of early robotic minion prototypes,

640
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:25,673
little models of Gru's car and his plane.

641
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:31,429
There's a mobile of the planet Earth
and the moon that's in the ceiling,

642
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,598
which I'm not sure
you ever get a clear shot of, actually,

643
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,685
but there's all kinds of cool stuff
in this room that we filled it with.

644
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,190
I think there's some paintings,
like a Cézanne,

645
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:47,362
and all kinds of stuff
that he's stolen over the years.

646
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:52,367
So, it was a fun set to come up
with different ideas of what to put in there.

647
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,497
He's just kidding, Agnes.

648
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:05,213
So, anyway, Tim, can you tell me a little bit
about this moment? Do you remember this?

649
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,809
Pierre, I don't remember it that way.
Do you remember it that way?

650
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,229
I think he's...
I'm sorry to say, Tim, I think you're lying.

651
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:24,816
Yeah, yeah. What I remember is
you screaming at both of us,

652
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,568
and then you stormed off
to your trailer for two hours.

653
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:30,029
It's true. You know it's true.

654
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,246
I remember that idea
came super late in the day.

655
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:42,583
Yes, yes.
Keep that floating minion perpetual...

656
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,669
Perpetually floating through the film.

657
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,673
We had to figure a way to identify him,
so we had him hold that beaker,

658
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,009
and that's how we were like,
"Okay, well, we know.

659
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:55,179
"Hopefully the audience will recognize
that it's the guy from the lab scene.”

660
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,265
That's the one thing, when setting up jokes,

661
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,934
is thinking about when you set them up

662
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,187
and how to try to pay them off.
Like, was the timing right?

663
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:07,275
Especially an idea like that,
that's a couple of scenes previous,

664
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,778
So you hope that everybody remembers
where it came from.

665
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,280
Do you remember that scene?

666
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,032
-How long it used to be?
-Yes.

667
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:19,704
I think... What was the timing that we...
How much movie did we make?

668
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,957
Did we go over 20 minutes or something
of material?

669
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:28,212
I don't know
how much we went through to animation,

670
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:35,053
but we did it pretty quickly, actually.
I mean, things that you make a decision...

671
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:39,474
This was a scene where we had Gru sort of...

672
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,729
He was counting,
trying to get the girls back into the car.

673
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:49,150
Basically the idea of,
"Get in this car or I'm gonna count to three.”

674
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:54,405
And he sort of... We played it out,
and there was some fun material,

675
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:59,577
but the scene itself
didn't feel like it had much drive,

676
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,581
So we eventually came to
what you're about to see,

677
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:07,835
where his counting
cuts right to the dance class.

678
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,922
So, we basically removed
the whole middle portion there.

679
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,841
Which is really,
really super elegant, actually.

680
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:18,137
-Yes.
-It turned out beautifully, in terms of pacing.

681
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:25,770
And I think that's... Part of the trick is
that we try to figure out what...

682
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,439
How many beats do you need
to establish an idea,

683
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,024
or establish a relationship?

684
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,361
I think that's always the trick.
Does the relationship feel authentic?

685
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,696
Have you done enough?
You don't want to shortchange it.

686
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,366
Or are you doing too much?
And the moment's already there.

687
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:41,494
Or are you doing too much?
And the moment's already there.

688
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,791
-Is this our favorite sequence?
-I think it's gotta be up there.

689
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,127
This is the whole point of the movie,
in some ways.

690
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,129
This is the reason he's gotten the girls,

691
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:56,259
this is the mission,
to steal the shrink ray back from Vector.

692
00:43:56,342 --> 00:44:01,097
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!

693
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,601
So I think we had this car, and then
we never really had an interior for it.

694
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,603
There were supposed to be missiles...

695
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,230
There were supposed to be missiles
that came out,

696
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,523
so it didn't really have an interior,

697
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:15,069
So we sort of came up with
one that looked like a camper.

698
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,864
Almost over. It's almost over.

699
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,742
Girls, welcome back to the fortress.

700
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:25,705
We even, obviously, came up with
a look for Gru's computer screens,

701
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:32,420
using purples and reds.
So that has a consistent feel as well.

702
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,339
Should probably mention Yarrow,
that helped Eric

703
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,425
-in designing all these things.
-Yes, yes.

704
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,721
...two caramel clumpies
and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.

705
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:46,601
And Yarrow was great about
really making sure the design language

706
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,187
between characters and worlds
was consistent,

707
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:53,941
and really established a look
that really followed the rules.

708
00:44:58,613 --> 00:44:59,822
-He did all these, actually.
-Yeah.

709
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:04,952
Yarrow is very hands-on. He's sort of...
Like, that display he actually created.

710
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,873
-Cookie OS.
-Yeah.

711
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,292
-...nine...
-Why are you wearing pajamas?

712
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:16,088
So, the shark took on its own life as well.
He started as...

713
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:20,176
I think there was, early, early on,
a scene in Gru's lab where...

714
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,928
‘Cause villains, of course,
always have sharks.

715
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:27,475
There was a rhino-shark hybrid,
or something like that,

716
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,602
and that went away quickly.

717
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,647
And then the storyboards
for the break-in scene

718
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,859
that occurred way back,
where the shark was just a total surprise,

719
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,819
showing up eating Gru.

720
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:44,867
And then what happened is, when we were
designing the interior of this room,

721
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:51,582
the idea came about of having the shark tank
be the floor to Vector's living room,

722
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,460
and so that kind of explained
how that shark showed up,

723
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,255
where originally it was a non...

724
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:00,675
It had nothing to do with anything,
which was a surprise comedy beat.

725
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:04,095
And so the shark started taking on
a real presence in the movie,

726
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,098
and in these scene,
we actually got to use that idea,

727
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,849
and that, I think, is what cemented it.

728
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:12,103
You'll see later,
when Gru is hanging above the shark,

729
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:16,190
and it becomes an important element.

730
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:19,735
This scene, originally, we had it with Gru

731
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:25,825
in a van outside, and the cookie bots,
he was just monitoring them,

732
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,411
and then the idea came about...

733
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,998
I talked with John Cohen,
one of the producers,

734
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:38,004
about Gru coming in, and John
pitched the idea of him getting locked in,

735
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:42,675
and I think that, that then
took the scene to a whole new place,

736
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,177
with Gru really an active participant,

737
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:48,723
which was kind of a consistent... There's a...

738
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,226
Kind of a crazy idea from Mark O'Hare,
one of our story artists.

739
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,981
Kept coming up with new uses for minions.
But we always tried to make the choice

740
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,067
of having Gru be an active participant
in the scenes,

741
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:04,405
like the break-in, originally, the heist,

742
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,866
whereas I think when we first started,
he was more imperious.

743
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,785
He would send people out
to do his dirty work.

744
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:14,165
Which was less funny, actually,
because right now we see him fail miserably,

745
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:18,711
or at least get put in situations
that lead to this type of physical stuff,

746
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:24,008
where he's gonna look ridiculous,
like, in about a few seconds.

747
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,135
Like here.

748
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:30,139
-And here, obviously.
-That's gotta hurt there.

749
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,475
So, here we see the shark coming into play.

750
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:42,234
Some of the things we talked about
with this scene were,

751
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,028
of course, Mission Impossible,

752
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:49,658
but also Spider-Man, when his blood
is dripping over the Green Goblin.

753
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:55,956
Those kind of tension moments, trying
to build that, but comedically, in this case.

754
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,084
Even though the shark
obviously can't reach him,

755
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:02,713
you play the idea that maybe it can,
Just to build some tension.

756
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,424
And the music here,
which originally we had the Jaws theme,

757
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:09,553
but we scored it with Heitor.
Our composer did an amazing job

758
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:14,100
of giving us something as good
as the Jaws theme for that moment.

759
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,976
Come on, girls, let's go!

760
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:23,901
This is interesting,

761
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:28,197
‘cause the world here looks like
it's the Pacific Coast Highway in California,

762
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,950
and the city where Gru lives
is sort of everywhere and nowhere.

763
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:34,453
Like, the city, in some ways,
has water towers on the buildings,

764
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:37,331
So it looks a little bit like Brooklyn
or an East Coast city,

765
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:42,002
and then here it feels like the West Coast,
I suppose, of the United States.

766
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:46,841
So we tried to keep it not very...
As unspecific as we could.

767
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,634
-Please?
-Please?

768
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,469
We'll never ask for anything else,
ever again!

769
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:51,720
-Pretty please?
-Please?

770
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:59,562
There's another one of Gru's fantasies,
sending the...

771
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:04,191
That was, again,
another last-minute thing that we did.

772
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,404
Do you remember
when that whole Super Silly Fun Land

773
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:12,741
-was supposed to be a matte painting?
-Yes. I was just thinking that.

774
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:20,291
Particularly for the 3-D,
we wanted to do the roller coaster,

775
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,794
and so it quickly became apparent that

776
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,714
we were gonna have to
build it in some form or fashion,

777
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:32,011
so I think we built a rough outline
of the track, put a camera on it,

778
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:37,057
and then decided what pieces we needed
to build out more specifically

779
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,393
when we edited it together.

780
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:44,773
So anyway,
this scene was a lot of fun to construct

781
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,108
-because...
-3-D moment.

782
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:51,113
Yeah, and it's on a roller coaster.
Who doesn't love to ride a roller coaster?

783
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:59,413
Tim, what's wrong? Are you okay?
You getting motion sickness?

784
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,999
Why doesn't anyone tell us these things?

785
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:06,504
This is really disgusting.
It's not very interesting for a DVD extra.

786
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:13,135
I'll just tell our listening audience,
just be glad you're not here with us.

787
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,970
Can somebody get Tim a bag?

788
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:19,141
-What do we do with this?
-I don't know.

789
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,726
Bob, is there anything... You know?

790
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:25,481
Okay, why don't you come over here by us.
Don't want to get your shoes dirty.

791
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,526
Oh, man. You okay? Yeah?

792
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:33,322
Tim, why don't you lie down?
We'll come back to you in a little bit, okay?

793
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,825
How much for the fluffy unicorn?

794
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:44,875
And then this is Jack McBrayer,
who plays the Carnival Barker.

795
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:50,381
He's just perfect for it,
giving Gru a hard time.

796
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:56,929
We wanted this moment to be the first time,
in some ways, Gru bonds with these girls,

797
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:02,351
so we tried to make it a relatable situation,
where he feels injustice

798
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:08,399
when the girls get cheated, basically,
by this Carnival Barker.

799
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,858
Again!

800
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:12,528
-Wait!
-Come on. One more time!

801
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:13,904
Just one more.

802
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,447
I accidentally closed my eyes.

803
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:20,202
So, this gave us some experience
with animating crowds,

804
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:22,913
and getting a lot of people in there,

805
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:27,626
So you could really fill out
the whole carnival to make it feel alive.

806
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:31,380
Especially that shot.
It took us, literally, weeks,

807
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:35,050
and the end result is
that everything is out of focus.

808
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,386
Yeah.

809
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:41,056
You do all that work,
and then you put depth of field on it.

810
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,267
And then you get
a bunch of animators hitting you.

811
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,060
Yeah.

812
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,397
It feels natural, though. It's good.

813
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,443
That little tin spaceship?
You see how it's not knocked over?

814
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,986
Do you know what that means?

815
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,990
We tried, mostly at Pierre's behest,

816
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:04,330
to make the camera feel natural
with depth of field, lens flares.

817
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,707
Things that were a little tricky
to manage in 3-D, actually,

818
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:12,838
but certainly give it a less CG feel,

819
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,051
where you feel like
you're really with these characters.

820
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:29,021
We tried to create a different,
distinctive look for each of Gru's weapons.

821
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:35,361
The shrink ray, the freeze ray,
and this was the death ball ray, I don't know.

822
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,321
So when the effects department
came up with the idea

823
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,282
of it forming into a ball of plasma,
we were like, "That's cool,"

824
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:41,950
‘cause we hadn't seen it before.

825
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:46,205
So, we tried to create a real,
distinct language for each weapon.

826
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:48,499
Let's go. Let's try another game!

827
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,922
It's funny because that previous sequence,

828
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,966
if you really look carefully
at all the background characters,

829
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,261
-you've seen them somewhere.
-Yes.

830
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:05,557
Just because we tried to be witty
about reusing background characters,

831
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:11,021
but I'm pretty sure that,
for the experienced eye, you can notice.

832
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:18,821
-"I've seen that guy before."
-It was a great idea to have Gru's face paint.

833
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,658
We can't afford any distractions!

834
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,996
Delivering those lines with face paint.

835
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,585
Another scene that
the minions were incorporated into.

836
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:40,384
I figured that you would want to see this!

837
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,344
What?

838
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:50,936
So that little moment with Mr. Perkins there,
where he goes, "What?"

839
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:55,524
That was just a little thing we dropped in
that will pay off later,

840
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:59,903
when we see that Mr. Perkins is actually
working against Gru behind the scenes.

841
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:04,658
Setting up his role with his son.

842
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,119
-Did I just ruin that?
-I think so. It's a spoiler.

843
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:12,291
Well, hopefully you've watched the movie
already before listening to this.

844
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,294
Could you excuse me for just one second?

845
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:19,339
We gave him a solid gold laptop there.

846
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:21,759
Hey, can we order pizza?

847
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:23,886
Pizza? You just had lunch.

848
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,262
Not now, for dinner.

849
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,472
Dinner?

850
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:29,558
Again, this scene is about...

851
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:33,353
If you've ever worked at home
and you've had little kids around,

852
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,606
you know how hard it is
to get anything done,

853
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:39,610
So it seemed like... Doing a teleconference
seemed like a logical way

854
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,405
to have the girls get in the way
of Gru's work

855
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:49,453
in a very real way, that actually ends up
having consequences down the road.

856
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:54,374
If you look, in the upper corner there
of Mr. Perkins' desk is actually the photo,

857
00:54:54,458 --> 00:55:00,547
you'll also see later, of him with Vector,
who's his son. Don't tell anyone.

858
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:01,799
What?

859
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,680
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.

860
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,307
Believe me, I am...

861
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:14,812
Some of the art direction cues,
in Gru's apartment, especially...

862
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,147
Those wood floors are floors that...

863
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:22,319
The way the planks are laid out
is something you really find here in Paris.

864
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:25,447
Most of the floors in the United States
are usually just slats,

865
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,491
So it's interesting,
there's little things here and there.

866
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:31,370
I think the doorknob
on Miss Hattie's orphanage is in the middle.

867
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:35,833
So those little design cues... I know
I always say that, but I think that's neat.

868
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:39,002
Those little design cues
that are unique to France.

869
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,130
-You guys aren't normal.
-It's true.

870
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:47,636
-You'd have put carpet everywhere in there.
-I know, it's probably freezing in there.

871
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:57,020
Another interesting thing in that moment
is the way Gru drew himself here.

872
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,522
-He's bald.
-Yeah.

873
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:04,486
He knew exactly
how he was gonna turn out later.

874
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:07,990
These three moments
are something we played with a lot,

875
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,367
like Gru as an artist

876
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:14,037
going through different things.
He did a painting...

877
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,831
And we played with them
several different ways.

878
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:21,128
Then there was a moment where he was
getting photographed with an astronaut,

879
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,921
and his mom asked him
to get out of the picture.

880
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:28,385
So we really... It was trying to find a balance
between something that was funny,

881
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:33,265
but also made you feel for him.
It didn't feel too cruel.

882
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,059
So anyway,
I think we ended up in a good place.

883
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,604
It sort of reinforced his character,

884
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:41,857
and that he was obsessed
with getting to the moon.

885
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:46,111
I don't know
what that guy has with apples, but...

886
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,698
I don't know
what that guy has with apples, but...

887
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:53,493
Feels like he only has them around
Just to squish them.

888
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,538
This was a fun set.

889
00:56:56,622 --> 00:57:01,877
It was sort of the rec room for the minions,
and there's all kinds of things in there.

890
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,255
-Drinks and a pinball machine.
-Pinball.

891
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:09,176
-Ping-Pong game.
-Every video game system known to man.

892
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:13,013
An espresso machine,
a coffee machine, back there.

893
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,850
And originally we talked about
staging this scene in the lab,

894
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,978
where Gru originally gives the talk
about stealing the moon,

895
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:23,231
but we just felt it needed
to be more casual than that.

896
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:27,527
So, I think there's a little posting back there
of somebody looking for...

897
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,905
-The carpet is great.
-The carpet, yeah.

898
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,282
It looks like they can play soccer.

899
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:37,329
But it gave it a fun...
You catch the minions in their downtime.

900
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:46,171
Sorry, that's one of my favorites.
Drunk minion. Drunk on milk.

901
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,256
Yeah, not drunk at all.

902
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,719
As I suggest that all of you do, as well.

903
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,888
What is it?

904
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,099
This also was an animator's dream,

905
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:00,102
Just because of Carell's performance,
in terms of voicing.

906
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:05,273
How he played very optimistic,
but saying horrible stuff.

907
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,988
Followed by this very silent moment.

908
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,994
-The music is great, also, in that moment.
-Yeah, it's very...

909
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:22,374
Again, this is Heitor
creating the emotional swell here.

910
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,709
It was really nice.

911
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:29,923
And the themes were based on
some of the songs of Pharrell Williams,

912
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:36,096
which gave us a rich material
to create the tapestry of the score.

913
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:42,978
And the next scene, in fact, we're gonna
go into a song called Prettiest Girls,

914
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:49,026
which Pharrell wrote and recorded,
which is great and just defines the moment

915
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:51,028
as they're carrying off all kinds of stuff.

916
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,155
We keep saying that everything is great
in that movie.

917
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:58,160
Yeah, that's true. We should talk about...
You know what I didn't like?

918
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:02,122
That shot wasn't that good.
And the animation is kind of...

919
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,333
You know what? You're right.
It is getting a little boring here.

920
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,294
That is terrible! No.

921
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:14,885
Anyway, it's a nice song,
and it really carries the moment,

922
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,262
gives it the lift that it needs.

923
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:21,391
We went through different ideas
of what this montage should be about,

924
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:28,482
and we landed on it being a little bit
about Gru and Nefario's relationship,

925
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:33,445
where Gru... We really get the sense
that Gru is getting pulled away from his job,

926
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,781
and I've always liked to say that the movie,
at the end of the day,

927
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,991
is about the choice
that a lot of us have to make,

928
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:42,913
which is family versus career,
and that's kind of what this scene is about.

929
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,539
What did you choose?

930
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:52,422
Don't put me on the spot like that.
My wife's gonna listen to this. No.

931
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:54,549
In his Sunday best.

932
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,010
He looks like a girl!

933
00:59:57,511 --> 01:00:01,098
Gru's mom there
is wearing the same shoes as Margo.

934
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,060
-We didn't have any money anymore.
-That's right.

935
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,772
-For budget reasons.
-We didn't have wardrobe.

936
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:16,238
Those marshmallows
should be much blacker,

937
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:22,452
but we decided to
go for having them look edible.

938
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,499
Here we can see the girls
starting to transform their surroundings,

939
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:31,962
like they paste pictures on the wall,
hang up a curtain,

940
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,589
Just trying to
make Gru's rather inhospitable home...

941
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:37,175
-Pink. Kyle...
-Make Kyle...

942
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:41,930
So, they're sort of becoming
the dominant force in changing his world.

943
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,607
This is the moment
where Gru is slacking on the job, so...

944
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:02,159
Some nice effects there
with the sliding pancake.

945
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:06,496
-Our character effects.
-What? Oh, my God!

946
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,291
Okay.

947
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:14,462
We had Vector...
It just sort of gave it a nice...

948
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:19,217
It reinforced the family element
of the movie, actually,

949
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:22,095
in that this is another side of parenting.

950
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,392
You have a spoiled brat as a kid.

951
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:32,939
The dad is giving his son everything,
and he still can't seem to make it work.

952
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:37,360
Financing his... So anyway, we just thought
that it was a nice way to reinforce...

953
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:40,906
Maybe a nice surprise,
but also reinforcing the family themes,

954
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:44,951
the dysfunctional family themes
of the movie.

955
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,287
-Hey, it is all about that, right?
-Yeah.

956
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,998
The girls don't have any parents,
they're searching for ones,

957
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,542
but those who have parents
actually have problems with them.

958
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,670
Yeah, that's right. What are we saying?

959
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,467
There's a squid on my face!

960
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,637
Don't worry.

961
01:02:04,179 --> 01:02:08,016
Nice. The squid acting. A fully-rigged squid.

962
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:09,893
Nice. The squid acting. A fully-rigged squid.

963
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:16,066
This is a scene that we called
"Sleepy Kittens," based on the book,

964
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:19,653
and it was really a beautifully written scene
by Cinco and Ken.

965
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:24,115
I remember first reading it, and it actually
made me laugh and touched me.

966
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:28,286
-I'm admitting that, sorry.
-You wuss.

967
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:34,209
But it is a great moment in the movie,
and nothing really happens, action-wise.

968
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:38,421
It's really just about
this guy reading to these girls,

969
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:42,300
and I think a lot of the movie
is about bad parenting,

970
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:45,303
which I think a lot of people watching it
can relate to. I know I can.

971
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:50,976
Making the bad choice or reading a book,
you're like, "Oh, God, this is terrible,"

972
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:56,314
but you... It becomes about
making the sacrifices for your kids,

973
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,066
and for Gru's case, his adopted kids.

974
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:02,237
He finally agrees to read this book,
which he wants nothing to do with.

975
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,825
What's actually cool about Gru
is that he speaks his mind.

976
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:10,996
-Yes. He says what we think.
-Yeah, exactly.

977
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:15,875
What we wouldn't say to our kids,
he's just says. "This is garbage."

978
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,463
So very early on,
even after we storyboarded it,

979
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:24,092
and as I said, nothing happens,
they just sit there through the scene,

980
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:29,973
we kind of knew, and particularly
when we got Carell's dialogue in here...

981
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,145
Or, I'm sorry, his recordings in here,
we felt we had something special,

982
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:40,233
and again, it really represents a turn
for Gru's character.

983
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,987
"Fine, but at least
you should brush your fur."

984
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,947
Now you brush the fur.

985
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,410
So, it's one of
those puppet books, obviously,

986
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,996
which I think is designed incorrectly,

987
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:59,294
‘cause his hand goes in the wrong side,
but anyway, it works.

988
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,589
Here you can get a clear...

989
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:05,216
From an art direction point of view,
you can get a clearer vision

990
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,261
of how the girls
have started transforming the room.

991
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:12,265
We changed the lighting
from being very cold to warmer,

992
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:16,102
helped along by that big blanket
that they've hung behind their beds,

993
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,438
and the soft lights,

994
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:23,568
and the bombs have been arranged
on the floor, so it's just much cozier,

995
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:26,363
versus the rather...
When they're on the rack on the wall,

996
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:29,407
very cold and very utilitarian in feel.

997
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:33,995
But again, they've transformed
the world around them to suit their needs.

998
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,914
And this is a turn in the character here.

999
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:40,085
"Good night kittens, close your eyes.
Sleep in peace..."

1000
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:43,505
Again, an animator's dream,
Just to get carried away by the voice

1001
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:48,385
and the performance
and the actual meaning of the scene.

1002
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:53,306
We tried to play it not over the top,
So hopefully we've been subtle about it.

1003
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,352
Just to make that turn work.

1004
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,646
-Wait!
-What?

1005
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,149
Yeah, some of the facial expressions of Gru
in this scene

1006
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:07,612
are really some of the best in the movie.
Even the one I missed early on,

1007
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:11,324
where he goes, "Okay."
It's just the way his eyes blink.

1008
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:16,204
I think that's the key to great animation
that the team here has been able to hit,

1009
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:21,376
is that, try to do something
that's unexpected, but also identifiable,

1010
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:25,547
and that's kind of cool,
when you see life in these characters.

1011
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:31,302
There's Gru's family tree,
which is a funny illustration.

1012
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:34,431
You don't really see it that much,
but I think there's a werewolf in there,

1013
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:40,812
and all kinds of things that have lead to Gru.
Of course the girls connect themselves to it.

1014
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,397
All systems are go.

1015
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,525
About that.

1016
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:49,195
And Gru is reduced to picking up toys.

1017
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:56,453
That's probably the biggest sequence shot
in the movie, right there.

1018
01:05:56,536 --> 01:06:00,582
I believe this is the last shot rendered,
actually. It was so big, it took forever

1019
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:05,211
to get it out of the computers,
So we could put it in the movie.

1020
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,799
This was also one of the...
I think one of the...

1021
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,802
I don't know if it was the last set,
but it was definitely one of those things

1022
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,472
where you had to, like,
"Where we gonna stage this?"

1023
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:19,684
We created this quick hallway set
somewhere outside of the girls' room,

1024
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,853
which we ended up using later again,
I believe,

1025
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,147
when Gru steps out at the end of the movie.

1026
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,565
-Yeah, with the minions.
-Yeah.

1027
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,775
But these girls
are becoming a major distraction!

1028
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:29,736
They need to go.

1029
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:34,365
If you don't do something about it,
then I will.

1030
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,701
Great job there on Nefario's hair.

1031
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:39,412
We debated that a little bit,
‘cause the hair is so thin.

1032
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,373
You know, "Would you ever see it?"
But it's just a funny thing.

1033
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:51,216
What are they looking at? Hey, guys, guys,
listen. Wait. You're not helping.

1034
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:55,929
-Guys. Please. Please.
-What's making them...

1035
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:02,435
-l think it's... Well, it is funny. He's right.
-What?

1036
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,440
-He's xeroxing, and he said...
-The "butt" thing?

1037
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:11,110
Yeah. He said the word "butt,"
which is good.

1038
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:13,571
I know this scene's funny, but...

1039
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:14,989
-Butt?
-Butt!

1040
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,663
Now I see what's so funny.

1041
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:25,458
-They're photocopying their butts and...
-You guys.

1042
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:29,587
You guys are right, this is funny,
but please, you gotta keep it down.

1043
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,301
Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?

1044
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:36,803
I'm here for the girls.

1045
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:40,765
That was a callback to a joke
from the previous scene together,

1046
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,684
with the Spanish dictionary.

1047
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:45,103
And also,
I did purchase a Spanish dictionary.

1048
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:50,942
One thing we always tried to think of, we
had to figure out set-dressing on our sets.

1049
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:54,112
We'd always be shooting scenes and be like,
"There's no cars or anything,"

1050
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,489
so we'd have to go back
Just to make the world lived in.

1051
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:59,576
The funny thing with CG is that,
‘cause you have to create everything,

1052
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:04,414
you always have to think about
what needs to go...

1053
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,915
It's not like going to a city street.

1054
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,586
You have to, like, "We've got the street,
but there's nothing on it."

1055
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:13,673
To make it feel like it's a world
that is believable and lived in,

1056
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:19,178
including seat belts,
which we added into this moment.

1057
01:08:20,388 --> 01:08:21,556
Thanks for everything.

1058
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:28,980
-Which she puts on. Very quickly.
-Yes, she does. There we go.

1059
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:41,200
The front of the house, we had some trouble.

1060
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:45,121
We made the front of the house
before we had all the characters finished,

1061
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:48,166
and we basically had to
create a second front of the house.

1062
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,668
-Bigger.
-Bigger, so we could get this shot

1063
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:55,381
with the window, ‘cause it was very stylized,
everything very high, tall and thin,

1064
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:56,591
and so we had to create a...

1065
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:59,260
-And actually, Gru didn't fit in that door.
-Gru did not fit in the door,

1066
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,928
-So0 we had to cheat.
-He had to walk sideways,

1067
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,430
which made it weird.

1068
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:16,027
So, here's a nice... It's a twofold thing.

1069
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:19,530
My daughter has one of these heads,
and they're always kind of creepy.

1070
01:09:19,614 --> 01:09:21,282
It's like this disembodied head,

1071
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,868
So it seemed like a good opportunity
to do an homage to The Godfather.

1072
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,496
So it seemed like a good opportunity
to do an homage to The Godfather.

1073
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,915
-It's for you, Francis.
-Yeah.

1074
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:35,088
There's the pink suit, which was another,
we felt, very strong image,

1075
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:41,511
after the girls wash their tutus
with the space suit, and Gru comes out.

1076
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:47,183
So it'd be a nice visual reminder of the girls
as we go through the third act,

1077
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,309
in which the girls actually aren't present,

1078
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:52,313
‘cause they've been taken back
to Miss Hatftie's.

1079
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:01,406
We kept the shrunken minion
as an important part of the story.

1080
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,658
We always thought he was funny.

1081
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:06,786
The recital?

1082
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:12,834
It's interesting how we didn't get lost
in all those arcs. The small minion, the...

1083
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:16,003
Kyle, also, has a nice arc now.

1084
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:21,426
-The floating minion.
-Yeah.

1085
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:26,055
So, in order to reinforce the idea

1086
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:29,600
that they had made the rocket
out of things they found,

1087
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:33,771
a lot of the engines on the bottom,
there's a steam train, I think,

1088
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:37,734
a locomotive, there's a steam ship,
there's parts of aeroplanes,

1089
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:41,320
and the cockpit has a blender, a toaster...

1090
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:47,160
Gosh. Everything we could find prop-wise,
we threw into that cockpit.

1091
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:51,831
-There's a shower.
-Yeah, there's a showerhead,

1092
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:56,002
to make it feel like it was just put together
with spare parts.

1093
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:03,342
Here's McDade, Gru's neighbor,
played by Danny McBride,

1094
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:06,596
and he's sort of the hapless neighbor
who's, like, just witnessing...

1095
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,724
Powerless as all these things
are going on around him,

1096
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:11,851
including dueling super-villains.

1097
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:17,690
Finally got to use that squid launcher.

1098
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:18,983
Oh, yeah!

1099
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:23,529
Nice work, Doctor. All systems go.

1100
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:28,034
There's the piranha gun again.
Completely ineffective.

1101
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,535
Again.

1102
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:36,334
This is where we started getting into
figuring out how to do our clouds,

1103
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:39,253
which was a lot of work.

1104
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:42,215
Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty...

1105
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,973
There's the floating minion.

1106
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:55,019
This shot was added,
So we had to figure out

1107
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:57,188
the progression of the rocket
through the sky,

1108
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,357
So we had to go back and forth
a little bit on that

1109
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,568
to make sure that shot made sense.

1110
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,241
So that means
the minions don't breathe air, right?

1111
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:11,619
Yeah, that's right.
They don't breathe air, they can glow.

1112
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:15,164
We just would give them attributes
as we needed them.

1113
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:18,626
That's what makes them
great animated characters.

1114
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:32,431
Well, one cool thing about Gru in space is,
in 3-D, one of the coolest things

1115
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:36,352
is just an object floating
in the middle of nothing,

1116
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:40,106
and of course a character floating in space
gives you a real opportunity to do that.

1117
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:46,612
So, inadvertently, this moon mission
gave us some neat 3-D opportunities,

1118
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:51,367
‘cause after this happens,
Gru's just floating there with the moon,

1119
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,703
and it's just the coolest thing
to have this thing

1120
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:57,540
that's free from the frame
and just floating there.

1121
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,417
It's really neat.

1122
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,135
I've got it!

1123
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,722
I've got the moon!

1124
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:17,393
This is the moment you were talking about.
It is true that all the 3-D aspects

1125
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:21,063
work better with slow-moving things
coming out at you

1126
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:23,316
-or floating in...
-Like this ticket.

1127
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:27,236
-Wow. Hey. Look at that timing.
-Yeah, no. It really works nicely.

1128
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,907
It's a great way to get the most out of 3-D.

1129
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:36,829
-There are moments like that.
-Plus, it's not aggressive, so...

1130
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,666
Here we go.

1131
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:45,421
Yeah, so we needed a way for Nefario
to witness that trouble's a-brewing,

1132
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:50,009
and so we enlarged Kevin, or Stuart,
whoever that ended up being,

1133
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:54,138
one of our minions,
as Gru rushes back to Earth.

1134
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,266
He's still not here.

1135
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,602
Why would he come? He gave us up.

1136
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,354
But he pinky promised!

1137
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:05,107
So again, it's a spin on the classic situation

1138
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:11,781
of a dad trying to get home from work early.
This time he happens to be at work in orbit.

1139
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:17,203
In order to see his kids' dance recital,
in this case.

1140
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,540
Gru makes that choice up there

1141
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:25,294
after he's got the moon, which he thought
was gonna fulfill the hole in his heart,

1142
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:27,797
but turns out it doesn't.

1143
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:34,887
So, Nefario tries to warn him,
and then you get a nice, old-man cart joke.

1144
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:41,477
Okay, we had talked about
using that cart more, but we never...

1145
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:55,241
One thing we always debated, too,
IS what is the role of the world in this?

1146
01:14:55,324 --> 01:15:01,414
Like, the moon shrinking.
Is there pandemonium, earthquakes, waves?

1147
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:04,333
At the end of the day,
what we decided was to make it simple,

1148
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,920
and that the moon, he takes the moon,
it's an object, and he goes,

1149
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:13,259
and it becomes a very... It's really a story
of Gru and the girls, and so other things,

1150
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:16,679
like there's a moment coming up
where you see this rocket fall,

1151
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,598
and there's kids on a playground
and they laugh at it.

1152
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:24,020
But moments of
the world at large witnessing all this,

1153
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,439
we kind of kept that to a minimum,

1154
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:33,362
because it becomes another story
that we probably didn't have time to tell.

1155
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:37,033
And I'm not even sure we wanted to tell,

1156
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:40,786
because the way this is now,
it's very focused.

1157
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:44,790
You have all this grand imagery
of a rocket landing in the street

1158
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,709
as a guy's trying to get home from work,

1159
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:50,796
but we don't go into
what people around the rocket think.

1160
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,631
-"Where are the cops?”
-"Where are the cops?”

1161
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:56,969
That's what we always kept saying.
"Where's the Army?”

1162
01:15:57,053 --> 01:16:02,058
So we just kind of went around those things,
and I think it was definitely the right choice.

1163
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:07,146
Yeah. It would've overcomplicated the thing.
It's not really the story.

1164
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,236
From a lighting perspective here,

1165
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,823
we really tried to
go for that golden hour thing,

1166
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:21,410
and all of the third act is done that way.

1167
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:24,914
We're thinking of Maxfield Parrish
and some of the beautiful paintings he did

1168
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:25,456
of the clouds in his work,
and the light breaking across them,

1169
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:29,418
of the clouds in his work,
and the light breaking across them,

1170
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:34,590
So we just wanted it to have
that feeling of the end of day.

1171
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,929
Plus, it kind of helped us. We were
going back to the same location, so...

1172
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:44,683
Yeah. It helps it feel different,
like it's something new.

1173
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:52,316
Nice acting there,
as Gru gives pause for a second.

1174
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:55,027
The animation team did a great job.

1175
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:58,197
I think I'll hold on to them
a little while longer.

1176
01:16:58,405 --> 01:16:59,490
No!

1177
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:02,243
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!

1178
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:05,955
So the idea here, we wanted to...
And I always think this is a cool moment

1179
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:10,126
in movies, is sort of where the hero,
in this case Gru,

1180
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:13,420
Just almost takes on superhuman powers,

1181
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:16,298
and this was something
that Chris Meledandri had mentioned,

1182
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:18,884
like becoming The Terminator,
and that can always be a satisfying moment,

1183
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:24,014
and I think the music actually here
really reinforces it.

1184
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:26,892
The funny thing I always think about
with this is, like, now all of a sudden

1185
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:30,813
these missiles are dangerous.
I mean, earlier in the film

1186
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,399
he was shot by a hundred of these
and it had no effect.

1187
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,569
So that's kind of the fun of, tonally,
Just sort of shifting it,

1188
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:41,198
making it feel like there's weight this time
in these weapons.

1189
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:46,537
The idea always was... Originally, Gru was
just trying to break in to steal a shrink ray.

1190
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,498
Now he's breaking in for his daughters,
or for love,

1191
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:54,170
and so the meaning of it,
even though it's the same location,

1192
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,422
the same weapons, is much different.

1193
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:02,178
And, of course, the shark doesn't eat him
this time. He gets punched in the face.

1194
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:08,726
We had briefly talked about Vector's house
becoming a walking robot,

1195
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,270
which we thought
would've been kind of interesting, too,

1196
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:14,231
but we went with the escape pod idea.

1197
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:19,862
And then being able to use the pyramid

1198
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,489
that Vector's got
So cleverly hidden back there

1199
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:25,743
as Gru's method
of catching up with the ship

1200
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:28,954
just to tie everything together.

1201
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:33,417
Hang on, Gru.

1202
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:41,634
You want to talk anything about
some of the staging challenges in this?

1203
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:48,015
God, they were all over the place.
Yeah, it was very, very complicated.

1204
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:54,521
Like, the next few shots you're gonna see,
that whole moon enlarging, girls escaping,

1205
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:59,568
Gru trying to have the girls
Jump towards him,

1206
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:03,530
and in the meantime, you have the moon
still rolling inside Vector's ship,

1207
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:09,745
plus the fact that the girls have to jump
at a particular timing, was a nightmare.

1208
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:13,207
One thing, too, is the ship originally,
Gru's ship here, which enlarged,

1209
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:16,835
didn't have an opening at the top,
So we had to redesign it,

1210
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,421
so we could actually pull off
what we needed to.

1211
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:20,547
Did you see that?

1212
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,509
-Vector! Help!
-Vector!

1213
01:19:23,592 --> 01:19:24,760
-Over here!
-Hey!

1214
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:26,011
What are you girls doing back there?

1215
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:29,390
And then, of course, the moon enlarging.

1216
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:32,685
-We didn't talk about the Nefario Principle.
-We skipped the Nefario Principle!

1217
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,229
Man, it's the important thing in the movie.

1218
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:38,774
Obviously, the ship, everything,
the timing was a little off,

1219
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:41,652
So we came up with the explanation
that the larger the mass

1220
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:45,864
the less time it stays shrunk,
which, of course, makes no sense,

1221
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:50,577
and Russell Brand was able to add,
"I call it the Nefario Principle,”

1222
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:56,625
-which sort of made it work, in a weird way.
-What's nice about it is just the timing of it.

1223
01:19:56,709 --> 01:20:01,463
Like, instead of a very long explanation,
it's like, "I just came up with it now."

1224
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,056
-Mr. Gru, up here!
-Mr. Gru!

1225
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,475
I think this sequence
got edited numerous times.

1226
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:19,898
Yes. We had to find the right balance
of, really, how much we needed,

1227
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:26,238
because the moment is basically...
Once he attaches himself to the ship,

1228
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:30,451
it's about him... There's two things.
There's the action you want to keep going,

1229
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:34,955
but also the emotional moment
of him getting them,

1230
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:36,415
particularly Margo, to trust him,

1231
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:40,669
So balancing those two things...
Some shots we took out,

1232
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:43,172
which I think helped a lot,

1233
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,716
because if somebody's
about to jump to their death

1234
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,802
and you're talking about your emotions,
it doesn't make any sense.

1235
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:54,266
So you try to make that as quick
as possible, so you get both things to work.

1236
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,231
So, obviously, this is...

1237
01:21:01,315 --> 01:21:05,778
-Would you jump? Really?
-It looks dangerous. It really does.

1238
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,783
Remember the sawfish gun we had there
for a minute?

1239
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:15,371
We couldn't get it to work,
so we were like, "Just use the piranha gun.”

1240
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:18,957
It never worked, so let's just use that.

1241
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:27,299
So we started with the tightrope thing,
and then it just felt unbelievable, so...

1242
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,717
That's how we had it in the storyboards,

1243
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:32,513
but then animation took it
and made it more buy-able,

1244
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:37,017
and also I think it felt more dangerous,
‘cause it felt more real,

1245
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:39,812
like what you'd have to do
to rescue somebody.

1246
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,815
The minions just broke that.

1247
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:46,652
The idea you're gonna see
came super late in the day also,

1248
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:50,030
this minion chain.

1249
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:54,326
And what was cool was, we'd had the idea
of, when Gru landed in the ship earlier

1250
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:57,413
and waves at all the minions
and it's kind of a fun reveal,

1251
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:59,832
and then this idea, as Pierre said, came later,

1252
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:06,505
but it was a nice way to justify
why all those minions were in the ship.

1253
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:10,134
-And they were actually useful in the end.
-Yeah.

1254
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:14,555
This was another moment we had
to make the decision where less is more,

1255
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,683
just in, like,
"How do we get that moon up there?”

1256
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:22,187
So the idea was the ship
was pushing it along on its jet thrusters,

1257
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:25,899
and then, of course, we see Vector with...

1258
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:29,278
-Again, a nice effects thing where...
-Yeah, with the bubble.

1259
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:32,614
The bubble helmet had a little life of its own.

1260
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:37,244
But once again, law enforcement is baffled,
leaving everyone to wonder,

1261
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,954
who is this mysterious hero?

1262
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:41,457
This was another thing,
just trying to tie everything together.

1263
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:41,582
The newscaster we see in the beginning,
and he says, "Who is this new hero?”

1264
01:22:41,582 --> 01:22:45,085
The newscaster we see in the beginning,
and he says, "Who is this new hero?”

1265
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,130
Instead of the new villain.

1266
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:51,675
So the newscaster became
the viewpoint of the world,

1267
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:54,553
in a very abbreviated form.

1268
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:04,396
Here we see that Kyle became tamed.
Became Agnes' best friend.

1269
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:10,694
Nothing scares animals and pets
like little kids.

1270
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:14,031
So here, again,
this is the full progression of Gru,

1271
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:19,745
where he now has made a book for the girls,
and tells them a story.

1272
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:23,123
But, yes, it probably will be.

1273
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:24,416
Here we go.

1274
01:23:25,167 --> 01:23:30,672
It's obviously the full journey
to him being a parent, and a good one.

1275
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:35,093
-He's quite an artist.
-Yeah, he is.

1276
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:38,430
"And turned his whole life upside down."

1277
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:40,974
Some of the props, obviously,
have changed in here.

1278
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:46,355
Our kids have done some drawings
that are hanging over there.

1279
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,608
And obviously,
all their beds have their own character,

1280
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:56,073
where Agnes' looks like a unicorn,
and Margo's looks like a princess.

1281
01:23:58,242 --> 01:24:02,079
And Edith's is slipping my mind right now,
but it's something.

1282
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:04,289
I think it's... Yeah, it's just a brass bed.

1283
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:08,502
So the bombs have been completely
converted into a very nice...

1284
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:14,967
So again, this scene is the third
where the kids are going to bed,

1285
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,679
and we see the full progression of
the characters coming together as a family.

1286
01:24:20,806 --> 01:24:24,768
And again, we tried being super subtle
in terms of animation.

1287
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:30,482
On this shot, for example. Just to make
this one a little bit more surprising.

1288
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:38,323
Just like the reactions of the girls.
Agnes looks up, Edith just smiles.

1289
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:40,826
I love you.

1290
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:43,161
And the lighting's got a nice warmth,
and that's...

1291
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:46,456
‘Cause Margo was the most resistant,

1292
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:50,836
and to have her give a hug
was a nice moment.

1293
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:53,171
And minions again.

1294
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:55,924
And the minions
asking for a kiss good night.

1295
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:58,594
I think that's a great comic relief,
like, coming out of that scene.

1296
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:00,429
You feel something,
even if you don't show it,

1297
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,849
and then you see the minions telling you,
"You're allowed to laugh now."

1298
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:07,144
-Yeah.
-That helps.

1299
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:18,697
This is a great bit of Gru
getting visually scolded by his mom.

1300
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,157
That was something the animation team did.
It was great.

1301
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:23,160
So, what's cool about this,

1302
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:27,623
that we were always debating
about dancing at the end of animated films.

1303
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:29,916
But what we like about this is that,

1304
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:33,378
this was actually
a great way to end this story,

1305
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:35,756
because Gru never got to see their recital.

1306
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:42,095
So the girls are presenting a recital
for Gru down in the lab,

1307
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:47,142
and of course the minions and Gru's mom
and Nefario and everybody can participate.

1308
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:53,732
So again, continuing along the idea
of Gru's transformation as a character,

1309
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,526
‘cause now they haven't changed
Just his home,

1310
01:25:56,610 --> 01:26:00,364
they're also changing his workplace,
which happens.

1311
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:07,913
So anyway, we wanted to use

1312
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:14,503
some kind of song we felt was very iconic
to just get the characters dancing,

1313
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:17,506
and so we chose the Bee Gees here.

1314
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,591
That's gotta be because we're 40-ish.

1315
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:24,596
-Yeah, yeah, maybe it's that, I guess, right?
-We could put Grease in there, too.

1316
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:30,352
But Gru's probably 40-ish, too,
So it probably makes sense.

1317
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:31,937
-Actually, he looks like us.
-Yeah.

1318
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,773
No, actually, he looks like Chris Meledandri.

1319
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:38,610
He looks more like me than you,
that's for sure.

1320
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:43,615
So anyway,
then you just see Gru cutting loose.

1321
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:50,706
And we went, again, for
that Saturday Night Fever lighting,

1322
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,625
just to make it as fun as possible.

1323
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:58,880
And also using that platform
that we see Gru,

1324
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:04,052
when he's announcing his plan to steal
the moon in the early scenes of the movie.

1325
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:06,638
We had another opportunity to use it here.

1326
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:10,225
Nefario's got something going
with Gru's mom there.

1327
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,898
That's a lot of minions
to animate right there.

1328
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:19,985
There's Vector. He's okay.

1329
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:23,572
I love that moment.
I love doing a non sequitur cut,

1330
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:25,323
and then there's the floating minion.

1331
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:31,663
And this image was always the image
we wanted as the last image of the film.

1332
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,248
-It was nice we figured out a way...
-This one?

1333
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:34,833
This one here.

1334
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:35,375
...to make that work,
‘cause we had several different versions.

1335
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:39,004
...to make that work,
‘cause we had several different versions.

1336
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:44,926
-Janet Healy.
-Our great producers, Chris and Janet.

1337
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,763
Chris Meledandri put it all together.

1338
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:54,019
I'm trying to say, have we mentioned
everybody and what they've done?

1339
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,772
-I think now's the time.
-Here we go, yeah.

1340
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,273
-What about this moment, Chris?
-Yeah, right.

1341
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:01,276
-What about this moment?
-Yeah. Who did that?

1342
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:06,364
So anyway, this was an idea
that started with Chris Meledandri

1343
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:11,787
about trying to do something
that was very fun and unique for 3-D.

1344
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:14,706
And so, it was really
at the end of the production,

1345
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:18,960
so he came in with the idea of
the minions having a competition

1346
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:25,133
of who could poke something deeper into...
Who could poke further into 3-D space.

1347
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:29,971
So it starts with their hands, and then goes
to one standing on the end of a plunger,

1348
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:34,059
and the little guy on the right is the referee
with his tape measure,

1349
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:39,689
and so it's kind of an abstract idea,
but in 3-D it works.

1350
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:44,069
So you people at home
watching it in 2-D DVD...

1351
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:49,282
Hopefully 3-D TVs are out by now.
So anyway...

1352
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:53,411
So yes, we created this little sequence

1353
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:56,373
that was then punctuated by the credits.

1354
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,876
And John actually really pushed the 3-D
on that little sequence.

1355
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:06,007
Yeah, John Benson.
And again, 3-D tends to work best

1356
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,134
when it's an object
coming from the deep distance

1357
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:10,720
into the deep foreground slowly,

1358
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:16,309
and this little sequence was really
Just designed to take advantage of that idea,

1359
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:20,856
and also have a little bit of fun
with the minions.

1360
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:24,943
That's an old Harpo Marx joke.

1361
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:29,114
Should I admit that?
I guess I shouldn't. I don't know.

1362
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:34,953
Anyway, so the minion there
obviously can't get them to stop.

1363
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:39,374
We always wondered, in this shot,
where he's going.

1364
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:42,043
He's heading off somewhere.

1365
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:47,424
-Did we mention Bruno?
-No.

1366
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:50,176
Did a great job. Robert.
He's sitting here with us,

1367
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,720
-So we have to...
-Oh, God, yeah, Robert.

1368
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:55,307
Great, great associate producer.

1369
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:58,727
The classic, the cartoon canon. Here we go.

1370
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:04,983
So we're trying to think of ways
to have this come to an end,

1371
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,861
So the minion actually comes all the way out

1372
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:10,947
through the audience, was the idea,
into the projection booth.

1373
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:13,074
But when you think about it,
it doesn't make any sense, right?

1374
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:14,492
-Because it's digital, right?
-Yes.

1375
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:16,786
-It's digital...
-Don't tell anyone.

1376
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:21,750
This is all gonna have to be edited out,
I think. "Leave us in.”

1377
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:33,845
So then, it's a shadow-puppet thing
at the end there,

1378
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:39,684
and then we have Gru come in,
and we end the movie the way we started it,

1379
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:43,396
which is with Gru's
rather distinctive silhouette,

1380
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,274
which we saw on the Despicable Me logo.

1381
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:56,409
-Look at it.
-Look, what an ego on that guy!

1382
01:30:56,493 --> 01:31:00,080
I think I'm five times.
Hey, I negotiated six times.

1383
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:05,460
I had them take one off. I couldn't take it.

1384
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:11,424
-Where are you? I didn't see you, Chris.
-I know. I'm nowhere.

1385
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:14,761
Yeah, that was great.

1386
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:18,014
This is the whole French crew, actually,
that did the...

1387
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:20,642
That was the story team.
What are you talking about?

1388
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:23,812
Those are Americans up there, my friend.

1389
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:27,232
No. Actually, there were some French...
We had the story people all over the world.

1390
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,985
That was the one department that was...

1391
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:33,279
We had them in Spain,
we had them in Canada,

1392
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:38,451
Ohio, California, New Jersey.
And here comes the French team.

1393
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:42,664
So basically the rest of the movie,
from layout up till the finish,

1394
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:46,376
was all created in France.

1395
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:49,004
There's a lot of names there
I can't pronounce.

1396
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,341
Or I can't pronounce correctly, I should say.

1397
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:57,595
Hopefully we're better at making movies
than at playing football.

1398
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:06,229
Actually, the song here is
the one that was from Super Silly Fun Land.

1399
01:32:06,312 --> 01:32:08,314
It's Pharrell Williams,

1400
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:13,778
and he'd originally talked about it
for the opening scene, but we used it...

1401
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:15,864
It was perfect,
‘cause it was called Fun, Fun, Fun.

1402
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:18,116
It was perfect for Super Silly Fun Land,

1403
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:22,495
and we liked it so much,
we put it here in the end credits as well.

1404
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:32,088
So anyway, did you guys feel at any point
that this movie was going to be a huge hit?

1405
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:54,944
-He just said yes, right?
-Yeah.

1406
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:57,655
I still have problems
understanding these guys.

1407
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:01,826
Yeah, I know. It's like they have
their own language or something.

1408
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:03,328
So, I guess that's it, right?

1409
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:05,705
-Are we gonna stay...
-Till the bitter end?

1410
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:08,583
What are you doing afterwards?

1411
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:13,421
I think we're gonna have to
stay and do this over again.

1412
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:16,674
That's right.
I know we're gonna listen back to this,

1413
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:20,553
and it's not gonna be nearly as funny
as we think it is.

1414
01:33:20,678 --> 01:33:24,015
We're gonna wish
we had just kept our mouths shut.

1415
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:32,649
The sound post, that was also done
over at Skywalker in the US.

1416
01:33:32,732 --> 01:33:34,400
-Great guys over there.
-Yeah.

1417
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:35,777
Awesome.

1418
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:40,532
I think what's super interesting
in terms of experience...

1419
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:44,285
Like, when did we start doing this film?
Two years and a half, or two years...

1420
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:48,456
-Yeah, yeah. 2008.
-2008. It took us two years.

1421
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,835
Yeah, some of the sound work was great,

1422
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:53,753
‘cause that's the cool thing
about an animated movie,

1423
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:58,883
is that there really is the need
to create a world of sound

1424
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:02,512
that's unique to the film.
And the guys at Skywalker,

1425
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:05,431
particularly their experience with machines
and things like that,

1426
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:07,517
really gave us some great stuff,

1427
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,230
particularly for Gru and Vector
and all their technology.

1428
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:19,654
-Should we say goodbye?
-We should say goodbye.

1429
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:21,739
The logos are showing up. That's the end.

1430
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:25,160
What was that?

1431
01:34:25,743 --> 01:34:28,913
Man, what was that?
Is that supposed to be a French word?

1432
01:34:28,997 --> 01:34:30,248
Thank you for listening.

1433
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:32,417
-Goodbye, everyone.
-Yes.
