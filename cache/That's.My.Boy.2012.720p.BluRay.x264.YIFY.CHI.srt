Who, Fab? He's a fucking

458
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,200
That would be huge, dude.
How much money?

- Very sexy.
- Mmm-hmm.

We could shoot it
this weekend.

You could give me
the money.

My kid?
What about my kid?

He... He's got to be

No. What are you talking about?
He's doing great.

483

He's, like, a hot shit now.
He's getting married

homeboy leaps down there,

608
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,280
and he tries
to retrieve the burrito.

609
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,160
Okay? I see a train
whizzing at him.

610
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,720
I'm like, "This guy's about to
die, and he don't know it."

611
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,200
I fucking leap down
there myself, right,

612
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,000
and I give him a little
shove on the heinie.

613
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,600
"Get out of the way, buddy!"

614
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,000
Next thing you know,
I realize

615
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,760
this thing's
going to hit me.

616
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,440
I fucking remember,
though,

617
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,720
I had a kung fu instructor

618
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,080
who taught me how to
tighten the diaphragm,

619
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,960
and I bring it in there.

620
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,280
And I feel the train go by.

621
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,400
My eyes are closed.

622
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,240
Rips my shirt off my body, okay?
I open my eyes.

623
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,360
I see all these chicks just kind of
looking at me, going, "What is that?"

624
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,840
"That's the fucking most
chiseled guy I've ever seen."

625
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,280
I worked out at the time.

626
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,120
Anyways, the place
goes bananas for me,

627
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,241
I sign a couple of titties,

628
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,080
and I started hanging out
with this guy ever since.

629
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,721
Best friends, right?
Here you go, my boy.

630
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,360
I just can't believe I've never
heard that story before.

631
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,960
Why wouldn't you just get
another burrito, Todd?

632
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,040
Uh, wouldn't it
be dirty?

633
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,640
Great questions.

634
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,960
Uh, it's one of the many
things about this story

635
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,920
that's pretty hard
to believe.

636
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,720
So, uh, where are you
staying, Donny?

637
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,200
Oh, he's not staying.

638
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,360
No.

639
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,520
I can't stay.
Yeah, no, he's right.

640
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,960
Oh, pshaw. I mean,
invite him to stay here.

641
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,520
You have to stay.

642
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,840
He's your best friend.
You're his best friend.

643
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,320
Sheesh, I'm not
messing with her.

644
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,880
I mean, you are my
best friend, guy.

645
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,320
And, Jamie, you can be
my breast friend.

646
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,240
<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHTER)</font>
Oh.

647
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,040
Breast, with an
With an.

648
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,600
Oh! Ooh!

649
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,560
By the way, dude,
you look fantastic.

650
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,360
You lost all the weight,
homeboy.

651
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,640
I miss the titties.

652
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,960
You saved my life?
Seriously?

653
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,920
What?
They ate that up.

654
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,680
You came up with a
whole lot of nothing.

655
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,640
That's a nice suitcase,
by the way.

656
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,761
What is that,
Louis Vuitton?

657
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,720
This is a Hefty bag.

658
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,560
What the fuck
are you talking about?

659
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,360
What do you want, Donny?
Money?

660
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,160
You heard I was doing well, so
you came looking for a handout?

661
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,600
I don't want none of your money.
How is that? Okay?

662
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,080
I get it.
You don't like me.

663
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,560
I exploded.

664
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
I wish you had exploded.

665
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,000
That way, I wouldn't have to
see your stupid face anymore!

666
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Did you happen to notice

667
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,160
I created a whole fake life just
so I could get away from you?

668
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,920
Your mother's sick,
by the way.

They don't know
how long she's got.

What is that, nunchuks?

673
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,120
I told her you would
visit her up at the prison.

674
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,600
I'm kind of thinking
you're the kind of guy

675
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,520
who would pull through
for Mumsie.

676
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,600
Know what I'm saying?

677
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,600
She'd do the same for you.

678
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
Really?

679
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,960
Yeah. Saturday's the
last visiting day

680
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,560
before the big surgery,
so...

681
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,000
So let me
get this straight.

682
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,240
You want me to go
visit my "sick mom"

683
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,440
that I haven't talked to
in years, in prison,

684
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,960
the day before my wedding.

685
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,280
Correct.

686
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,720
Not happening, asshole.

687
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,920
What the fuck
did I do to you

688
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,080
to make you
hate me so much?

689
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,680
I am fucking baffled
right now.

690
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,800
Well, maybe you
don't remember,

691
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,640
but you were basically
the worst parent ever.

692
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,840
Me? I did everything
for you, buddy,

693
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,400
and I never gave you an ounce
of shit about nothing.

694
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,120
You never
gave me nothing.

695
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,440
I gave you a snake.

696
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,120
Yeah, and then it died after
it ate all your Quaaludes.

697
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,440
That was the only time anybody's
ever seen a king cobra laugh.

698
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
And I take pride in that,
so fuck you.

699
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,120
Yeah, great.
You know what?

700
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,240
I basically had
to raise myself, Donny.

701
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,680
I never learned
how to swim.

702
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,240
I don't even know
how to ride a bike.

703
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,921
You know how fucking
humiliating that is?

704
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,920
What about Mr. Mitty?
Remember him?

705
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,000
What? No. What's that?

706
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Mr. Mitty. I used to put
an oven mitt on my hand.

707
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,840
He would cheer you up all
the time when you were sad.

708
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,520
"Don't be upset,
young man."

709
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,120
"I'm your best friend."

710
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,160
"Even though
I'm an oven mitt."

711
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,080
No, I don't remember that, okay?

712
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,241
You know what
I do remember?

713
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,480
You making me drive you
home from the beach

714
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,640
'cause you got
too drunk.

715
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,200
It makes sense to me.

716
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,560
When somebody's hammered, they
have another guy drive home.

717
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,920
I was eight!

718
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,120
Well, you looked 14 'cause you
were such a huge fat fuck.

719
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
I'm sorry.

00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,800
Oh, you are
such an asshole.

a millionaire now,

722

and you're marrying
that hot chick.

723

job as a dad, don't you think?

724
