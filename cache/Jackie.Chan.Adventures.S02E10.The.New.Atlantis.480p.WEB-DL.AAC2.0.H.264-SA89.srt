1
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,310
Hurry, Jackie!

2
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,478
I know.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,912
We mustn't
allow shendu

4
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,881
to release
the water demon.

5
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,616
No, hurry!

6
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:20,753
Uncle's legs are getting
a big cramp!

7
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,911
Join us, sister dearest.

8
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,850
(Screeches)

9
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,639
Whoa,
fish outta water.

10
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,876
At last, liberation!

11
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:53,745
And now,
- for some libation...

12
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:00,719
Which will require
moister climes than this.

13
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,887
Uh-uh-uh...

14
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,322
Now that
I have opened

15
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:06,358
the last portal,
sister bai tza,

16
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,160
it is time
to liberate me

17
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:10,195
from my prison
of flesh.

18
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,296
Gah!

19
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,233
You dare request
your freedom?

20
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:16,301
Have I not
earned it?

21
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,137
As promised,
I have released

22
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,339
all our brothers
and sisters.

23
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:23,108
How curious, then,

24
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,912
that 6 demon sorcerers
remain trapped in the void!

25
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,114
I should obliterate you
on their behalf.

26
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:30,182
(Gasps)

27
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,885
I held my part
of the bargain.

28
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,786
You cannot blame me
for the meddlings

29
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,355
of Jackie chan.

30
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,990
(Engine)

31
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,496
Speaking of whom...

32
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,299
(Gasps) Quick, uncle!
The chi spell!

33
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,935
(Struggles)
Jackie, I am stuck.

34
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,339
I will not repeat
the mistakes of the others!

35
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,720
Finn: Chariot race
is over, chan.

36
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,422
It's gladiator time!

37
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,091
Strength
and honor.

38
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,159
Uhh.
Ech.
My suit!

39
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,895
Uncle, get in.

40
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:18,697
Ohhh.

41
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,405
(Growls)

42
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,341
Is it over?

43
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,643
Am I free of shendu?

44
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:34,980
Uh, the mermaid
said no deal, big v.

45
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,182
Uhh!

46
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,387
Quick, uncle.
The chi spell!

47
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,726
(Chants)

48
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,330
Your spells may have
quelled my siblings,

49
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:54,032
but I am the slippery one.

50
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,269
Aah!

51
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,607
(Slowed chanting)

52
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,482
Aah!

53
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,862
(Jittery chanting)

54
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,672
(Gasps)

55
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:34,973
(Honk honk)

56
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,017
Jade: Well,
guess we won't
be needing

57
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,318
that chi spell
after all.

58
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,753
Don't be so sure, Jade.

59
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:48,820
Eh...Jade!

60
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,455
I thought I told you
to stay with...

61
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,991
Tohru.

62
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,794
She is
- very persuasive.

63
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,195
Uhh, help me out.

64
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,665
I must cast
the chi spell.

65
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,510
<i>Mamma Mia!</i>

66
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,545
Aah!

67
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,484
(Quickly chanting)

68
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,574
Uhh!

69
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,694
Uncle:
The water demon
will return

70
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,030
to her undersea
empire.

71
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,233
Then, not even
my most powerful
chi spell

72
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,168
will stop her.

73
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,269
So forget the books.

74
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,805
Let's pack our
flippers and--uhh!

75
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,006
Research!

76
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,142
Bai tza's empire
is also known

77
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:20,245
as the lost continent
of Atlantis.

78
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,413
Atlantis?

79
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:23,315
I thought
it was merely
a myth.

80
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:26,518
No one has ever
been able to find it.

81
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,687
Heh. Hence
the "lost" part.

82
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,401
My empire lies in ruins!

83
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:45,203
Time has done its worst,

84
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,872
which means it is time

85
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:50,075
for me to claim
a new empire.

86
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,349
Wearing the skirt
is demeaning enough,
shendu...

87
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:00,018
But this
is over the line!

88
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,154
Shendu:
Do you think
I am pleased

89
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,322
with our union,
valmont?

90
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,826
If I am to remain
in your pathetic body,

91
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:11,396
I must at least make
a few cosmetic improvements.

92
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:14,833
Now hold still
while I sprout our tail.

93
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,368
Valmont: You'll
do nothing of the--

94
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,736
shendu:
Do not try to--

95
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,371
valmont:
I'll fight you
with every last--

96
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,772
shendu:
And you will lose!

97
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,809
Shendu!

98
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,244
Good madam,
free me of shendu.

99
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,813
I beg you.

100
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,948
Look what he did
to my head!

101
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,383
Oh!

102
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:36,388
My answer to you
and my sniveling
brother remains...

103
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,456
No.

104
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,492
Hoo-hoo.
Nasty piranha.

105
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,593
Bai tza: You!

106
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,661
Who, him?

107
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,629
Huh!

108
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,833
(Chuckles)
Hey, you're a fish.
I'm Finn.

109
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,168
We're simpatico--unh!

110
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,171
Direct me
to a suitable
new empire.

111
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,273
Uh, <i> mi casa es su casa,</i>

112
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,143
your amphibiousness.

113
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,078
A fish cannery?

114
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,580
See your point.

115
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,982
Well, there's lots
of nice places

116
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,083
here in San Fran,

117
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,785
and it's all
by the water.

118
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,220
Yeah,
great town.

119
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,088
Mm...Except
for the quakes.

120
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,557
Earthquakes?

121
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,292
Uh, that's right.

122
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:17,095
The San Andreas fault
runs right through downtown.

123
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,196
Better idea...

124
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,031
You should move
to the east coast.

125
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,099
Uhh!

126
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,168
So be it.

127
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,570
Your San Fran
shall be the cradle

128
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,406
of my new
undersea empire.

129
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,243
Uh, but isn't
your undersea
empire

130
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,278
supposed to be,
you know...

131
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,913
Undersea?

132
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,681
And so it shall be...

133
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,684
Once I sink this city.

134
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,401
She's gonna sink
the city?

135
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,737
Uh, can we be
excused, shendu?

136
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,105
Yeah, seein'
as how we opened

137
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,840
all the portals
for ya. Heh heh.

138
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,074
You don't need
us to carry

139
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,843
old pan ku
anymore.

140
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:07,379
Never seeing
any of you ever again

141
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,482
would make me
a very happy dragon.

142
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:11,816
Say bye-bye
to valmont.

143
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,418
Finn: I hear
Utah's nice
this time of year.

144
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,820
Chow: Anywhere but here.

145
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,323
Valmont: Weren't
you listening, shendu?

146
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,693
If we stay here,
we will drown.

147
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,995
Shendu:
Not if we have gills.

148
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,998
Valmont:
If you change so much

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,100
as another hair
on my head, I'll--

150
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,069
shendu:
You will what?

151
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,409
Do not be a fool.

152
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:40,579
The pan ku box is
forged of good magic.

153
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,048
You know
we cannot touch it.

154
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,420
Valmont:
No, <i> you</i> cannot
touch it.

155
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,326
Aaaaah!

156
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,128
Uhh.

157
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,366
(Gasps) My face...
He's gone.

158
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,002
He's gone!
He's--

159
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,705
out cold.

160
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,176
I found Atlanta.

161
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,377
Does that count?

162
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,613
Uncle, this
is impossible.

163
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,715
Scientists
have been trying
to find Atlantis

164
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,149
for centuries.

165
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,618
(Bell jingles)

166
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:21,653
(Gasps)

167
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,789
Good evening.

168
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,157
What do you want?

169
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,793
Shh. You will
wake shendu.

170
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,130
He's napping?

171
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,999
I rendered him
unconscious.

172
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,668
Now please,
you must help me.

173
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,604
I want him exorcised!

174
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,406
Like we're gonna
help shendu

175
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,507
get in shape!

176
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,542
Ex-or-cised, Jane.

177
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,711
He wants
to remove
shendu's spirit

178
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,046
from his body.

179
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,714
But why should
we help you?

180
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,116
Because there
is nothing

181
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,617
that either of us
wants more

182
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,487
than to be rid
of that blasted
fire demon.

183
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,689
A dark hand trick.

184
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,659
N-no tricks. I will
tell you anything
you want to know.

185
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,161
Uh, our hideout...

186
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,397
It's the helms
fish cannery.

187
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,498
That's nice,

188
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,099
but we have
bigger fish to fry.

189
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,202
Like finding the demon
you unleashed, remember?

190
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,005
Unh...She's
in San Francisco!

191
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,073
Bai tza?

192
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,374
Here?
Where?

193
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,310
(Clears throat)

194
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,681
You scratch my back,
I scratch yours.

195
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,718
Hmm. Hmmmm...

196
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,655
(Gags)

197
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,425
Bai tza's planning
to sink San Francisco

198
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,993
by causing an earthquake?

199
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,361
But how?

200
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,430
Just because I am
possessed by a demon

201
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,665
doesn't mean I can
read their minds.

202
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,801
She would need
to jar the fault

203
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,703
with an explosion or--

204
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,870
a flood.

205
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,739
Tea, <i> sensei?</i>

206
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:48,907
Thank you.

207
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,241
Valmont:
Jolly good, tohru.

208
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,509
I would love a spot.

209
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,911
(Growls)

210
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,513
Uhh, right, then.

211
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,489
This <i> han zi</i>
àwill suppress
shendu's spirit

212
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,224
until I am able
to concoct

213
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,526
a true
exorcism spell.

214
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,099
Well, it's more becoming
than a horn, I suppose.

215
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,167
Tohru, you must go
with Jackie to cast

216
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,369
the water demon's
chi spell.

217
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,105
Yes, <i> sensei.</i>

218
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,773
Ta-ta.
Best of luck.

219
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,041
Come with us.

220
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,109
Awesome!

221
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,510
Not you,
Jade.

222
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:26,611
You.

223
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:27,679
Aww.

224
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:28,747
But...

225
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,315
The exorcism
spell.

226
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,150
You have resources.

227
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,918
We need them.

228
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,723
It's a big city,
chan.

229
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,158
Jackie:
I am following
what we know

230
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,693
to be the path
of the fault line

231
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,762
for any sign of bai tza...

232
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,765
That is, unless you have
any better ideas?

233
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,134
Just like old times,
eh, tohru?

234
00:12:49,136 --> 00:12:50,702
(Growls)

235
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,138
I recommend you watch
your back, chan.

236
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,907
Tohru turned coat
on me, you remember?

237
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,109
You forced me
to fight a demon.

238
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,879
Oh, yes, that's
completely different

239
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,714
from what chan
has you doing.

240
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:03,815
Jackie: Shh!

241
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:08,820
Down!

242
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,640
1, 2...

243
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,741
(Battle cries)

244
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,209
Hyah!

245
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,179
Heh. Thought you guys
looked fishy.

246
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,181
So this is why
your niece

247
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:37,482
is always
with you.

248
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,817
And here
I just thought

249
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,286
you were horribly
irresponsible.

250
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,654
Jade, how did--

251
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,055
had section 13
hook me up

252
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:46,491
with satellite
surveillance. Duh.

253
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,559
Bai!

254
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,627
And good-bye
to you, Jade.

255
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,462
No. Bai tza!

256
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,601
Why embarcadero
station?

257
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:58,369
Perhaps
she's hopping Bart

258
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,737
to the bay aquarium.

259
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,585
(Chanting)

260
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,089
I have seen
such symbols
in uncle's books

261
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,091
used for
summoning spells.

262
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,492
What's
she trying
to summon?

263
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:22,894
Enough water
for a flood?

264
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,896
The station's
lower levels
are underground,

265
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,264
closer to the fault.

266
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,733
And I can't imagine
the subway system was built

267
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,702
to withstand
the crushing pressure

268
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,704
of raging
floodwaters.

269
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,305
Quickly, tohru.
The chi spell!

270
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,643
I need
preparation time.

271
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,311
I will run interference.

272
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,953
(Chanting)

273
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,594
Safe!

274
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,335
(Screams)

275
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,837
Aaaaah!

276
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,940
How nice
to just stand back

277
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,009
and watch chan work.

278
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,612
I must be within range.

279
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,183
If Jade does not
remain safe,

280
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,753
I will turn you
inside out.

281
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,589
(Nervous)
Ah ha ha ha.

282
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,592
I wont let her
out of my sight,
old chap.

283
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:33,965
Aah!

284
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,166
Uhh!

285
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,069
Uh-uh-uh.

286
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,605
Stay right here
with uncle valmont.

287
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,973
(Growls)

288
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,342
(Chanting)

289
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,644
(Chanting)

290
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,054
(Both chanting
respective spells)

291
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,470
Aaaaaah!

292
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,742
Aaaaaah!

293
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:18,977
Uhh!

294
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,617
I hate fish.

295
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,954
Where is...
The gourd!

296
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,361
Lose something?

297
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,895
Oof!

298
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:38,997
Hyah!

299
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,266
(Struggles)

300
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,869
I want to hold your hand.

301
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,337
Oof!

302
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,507
(Angry roar)

303
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,251
Uncle, we need
another gourd.

304
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,519
And while
you're at it,

305
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,121
we need to break
a water-summoning
spell.

306
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,389
Aiyaaa!

307
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:06,424
Too many spells!

308
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,093
Um, and how's
that exorcism
spell coming?

309
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,563
(Angry roar)

310
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,165
I'm going
for the gourd.

311
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,333
(Deep breath)

312
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,555
Welcome to my world, chan!

313
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,332
Whoa!

314
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:54,872
Jackie!

315
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,674
Funny, I'm not sure
who to root for.

316
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,509
Ow!

317
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,710
Go Jackie.

318
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,412
Go valmont.

319
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,815
And ruin
my Italian shoes?

320
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,917
And keep shendu
for a roommate?

321
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,186
Oh, all right.

322
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,358
(Battle cry)

323
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,701
You dare
to betray me, shendu?

324
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,404
Yes, he does.

325
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,506
I insist you remove him
from me at once

326
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:30,174
and give him a trouncing.

327
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,711
Ohh!

328
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,853
(Gasps) Valmont?

329
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,523
Ahh...Chan?!

330
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:50,228
They've been
playing tricks
on you, brother.

331
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,631
Then they shall suffer
a dragon's fury!

332
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,201
Aaah!

333
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,837
(Choking coughs)

334
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,710
(Water draining)

335
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:07,845
Aah!

336
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,848
(Chanting)

337
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,850
¶ Uncle broke
your spe-ell ¶

338
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,919
(chants)

339
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,256
Aah!

340
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,395
Uncle! Exorcism!

341
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,863
(Snarls)

342
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,901
We scared him off!

343
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,304
Uncle,
you did not remove

344
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,805
shendu
from valmont--ow!

345
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,474
With what spell?

346
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,409
Too many
interruptions!

347
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,610
I had to concoct

348
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,813
anti-water-summoning
spell first!

349
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,650
So bai tza and shendu
remain at large.

350
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,685
Jackie, hello?

351
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,588
You just
saved the city
from the big one!

352
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,396
She will return.

353
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,730
And when she does,

354
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,399
we'll hook her
like a trout.

355
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,867
Now come on.

356
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,136
I say we treat you
to a pan ku breakfast.

357
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,674
Pan ku...

358
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,842
I meant pancake. Duh!

359
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,544
Now <i> that</i> sounds
good, Jade.

360
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,012
I can sell these

361
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,289
hey, Jackie.
Are you a good swimmer?

362
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,258
No, I'm--

363
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,760
I'm...Very bad.

364
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:33,664
I do swim
in the private pool.

365
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:37,501
First time I went
to the deep sea,

366
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,970
you know, on the boat,
I was like...

367
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,571
When we stopped,
we had to go to the beach.

368
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,672
Everybody jumped.

369
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:42,974
One by one jumped.
I say, "they jump?

370
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,775
I jump." You know,
I jumped down,

371
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,577
but I come into--
(Gasps)

372
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,112
I'm scared about swimming.
