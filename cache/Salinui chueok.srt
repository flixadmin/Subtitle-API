2
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,925
Junk car!

3
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,179
Get out of here, kid.

4
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,000
I told you to get out of here.

5
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,957
Go home, kid.

6
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,928
Little brat.

7
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,332
What the hell are they doing?

8
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:25,829
Hey you!

9
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,737
Put that back!

10
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,810
Hey, leave it there. Go away.

11
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:35,812
Hey you!

12
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,716
That's important, don't touch!

13
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,249
Those kids.

14
00:04:19,432 --> 00:04:24,926
MEMORIES OF MURDER

15
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,262
What?

16
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,393
You dated the dead girl, and
she dumped you last August?

17
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,436
Is that right?

18
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,271
That's correct.

19
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,141
That's correct? Take off
your hat, you damn punk.

20
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,841
Do women like guys like you?

21
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:50,053
After watching Body Heat...

22
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,125
Body Heat?
That an action movie?

23
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,296
A, c, t...

24
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,002
Damn punk...

25
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:11,600
...since it's a rape
and murder case and all...

26
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,942
well...

27
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:19,485
...if she was sexy,
or pretty, that sort of thing.

28
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,075
Your impressions?

29
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,915
Well,

30
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,390
she didn't seem
like a country girl...

31
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,690
Don't blink.

32
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,428
You blinked, didn't you?

33
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:37,025
Hey, look at me.

34
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,704
Don't look at the ceiling,
look at me!

35
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,204
Was he born that way?
One, two...

36
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,120
Didn't you want to go
to the Military Academy?

37
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,525
Did you take the exam?

38
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,530
You need to study hard
to get in there.

39
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,069
- Receipt!
- You didn't ask for one.

40
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:15,265
What? I told you to bring one.

41
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,707
- I told you.
- No you didn't.

42
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,142
That's what you said last time...

43
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,976
Here's one, here.

44
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:28,420
You answered the phone,
you lying bastard...

45
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:33,424
I need a receipt from the restaurant.
Not from a bicycle shop.

46
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,364
Why didn't you rope
the place off?

47
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,067
At least get some sticks
to drive them in, morons.

48
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,303
Inspector Park, over here!

49
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,006
- What is this?
- It's a footprint.

50
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,443
- When did you find it?
- This morning, sir!

51
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,747
Go help those jerks over there.

52
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,913
You called the forensics team?

53
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,184
Yes, they're on their way.

54
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,990
But, where's the
person who reported this?

55
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:16,361
No forensics team,
this is total chaos!

56
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,403
Jesus, look at him!

57
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:20,934
Hey!

58
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,398
Get out of here!

59
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,744
Who received the call on this?

60
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,446
Did you find out
who reported it?

61
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,143
The phone... The crime
site is getting ruined.

62
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,618
Damn forensics team's
not here, this is a mess.

63
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,087
What are you talking about?

64
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:42,389
Take pictures when I tell you!

65
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,591
Why'd you bring
so many reporters?

66
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,929
They were all here when I arrived.

67
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,095
Reporter Park's not here.
Must be on vacation.

68
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,695
I don't see him.

69
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,273
Feels great with
that shithead gone.

70
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,775
Why does this have
to happen to me?

71
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,438
How can I investigate like this?

72
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,916
Hey, tractor!

73
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,486
Tractor!

74
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:13,548
Tractor, stay away! Detour!

75
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,931
If someone waves,
shouldn't you look?

76
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,829
Shit, is he deaf?

77
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,494
Shit! Look at this.

78
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,698
Now those bastards show up.

79
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,771
What the hell took you so long?

80
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,781
The crime scene's ruined!

81
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:40,819
Jesus, look at these sliding fools!

82
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,820
What's going on?

83
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,895
How can you look at
those photos while eating?

84
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,365
If I keep staring at them,

85
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,836
one moment it'll hit me.

86
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,031
Instinctively.

87
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,505
Are you a fortune teller?

88
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,703
Open up a shop then.

89
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:11,846
Chief, I may know nothing else,
but my eyes can read people.

90
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,014
It's how I survive as a detective.

91
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,319
There's a reason people
say I have shaman's eyes.

92
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,586
OK, then.

93
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,261
You see those two guys there?

94
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:31,634
One of them's a rapist, and the
other is the victim's brother.

95
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:40,173
He caught the guy doing this to
his sister, and dragged him in.

96
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:48,146
So tell me,
which one's the rapist?

97
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,192
- Hey.
- What?

98
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:03,666
I think it fell out.

99
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,168
Really?

100
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,364
Let's do this properly.

101
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,473
I'll give this to you
especially today.

102
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,606
I'm so grateful.

103
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,915
It's just a flu shot.

104
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,648
Know how much this costs?

105
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,958
- Kwak Sul-young?
- Yeah?

106
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:33,828
You must be earning more
now than at the hospital.

107
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,798
I hear everyone in
town comes to you.

108
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,998
Shh. I got something to tell you.

109
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,544
I heard this from the
old woman at the mill.

110
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:49,575
You know the Baek family
meat restaurant?

111
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,510
The Baek family?

112
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,509
You know what people call them?

113
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:56,912
What?

114
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,025
The Baek Lady Killers.

115
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,319
- Ladies?
- Yeah.

116
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,732
But the son's a little
bit retarded. Kwang-ho.

117
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:15,805
Kwang-ho used to follow
Hyang-sook around all the time.

118
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,877
Hyang-sook?
The one who was killed?

119
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,502
Yeah.

120
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,983
She was found with
a girdle over her head?

121
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,279
Right.

122
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,479
Even more important,

123
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,558
the night she was killed...

124
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:38,392
that old woman saw
Kwang-ho following her.

125
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,567
- Really?
- That's what I'm saying.

126
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,161
I heard that old hag
went senile last year.

127
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,899
No, she's fine.

128
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,742
That kid... Wait.

129
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,051
Kwang-ho? What's he look like?

130
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:05,881
This side of his face is a bit...
you know.

131
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,222
Tell me in detail.

132
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,796
Anyways, he's a poor little kid.

133
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,220
Kwang-ho.

134
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,718
Let's talk man to man.

135
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:44,694
You see a pretty girl,
you want to do her.

136
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:50,531
When I was your age, I'd go
out with friends, I understand.

137
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:56,700
You never intended to kill
Hyang-sook at first, huh?

138
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,710
"How about just
touching her breast..."

139
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,801
I couldn't touch it.

140
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,780
So you killed her?
Kill her, then you can touch it.

141
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,350
No, I didn't.

142
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,748
That guy coming down now,
he's had a hard life, like you.

143
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,883
He's nice.

144
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,394
He's really sweet.

145
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,794
He never beats anyone.

146
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,766
But sometimes,
you know,

147
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:26,099
if he gets worked up
about something...

148
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,734
God, what an ugly face.

149
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,783
Just looking at this face
makes me angry.

150
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,986
Shit.

151
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,457
Pretty?

152
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,835
This is so it won't
leave scratches, you punk.

153
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,235
Hey, hey...

154
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,939
What's with the army boots?

155
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,067
Doing this to the kid...

156
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,338
Kwang-ho, get up.

157
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,815
Are you really innocent? Huh?

158
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,319
Look in my eyes.

159
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,448
Where the hell's he looking?

160
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,220
Look in my eyes!

161
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,724
Excuse me, miss...

162
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,667
Hello?

163
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,771
Oh, miss?

164
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,636
Are you all right?

165
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,838
Why are you following me?

166
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,072
To ask directions.

167
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,273
Let me help you.

168
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,849
Let go!

169
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,216
What's wrong?

170
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,520
Rolling in the fields, huh?
Is this town rapist's paradise?

171
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:30,359
You shithead.

172
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,426
What the hell?

173
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,902
Who are you?

174
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,371
Get over here.

175
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,269
Hey miss, the victim
needs to file a report!

176
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,705
Miss!

177
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,791
Where is she going?

178
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,259
Are you a detective?

179
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,599
You should have told me.

180
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,862
My mistake.

181
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,206
How can a detective
be such a bad fighter?

182
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,071
How can a detective have
such a bad eye for criminals?

183
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,149
What's that smell?

184
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,978
Oh, sneakers.

185
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,449
They smell bad?

186
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:36,256
But these here are
evidence item #28.

187
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,278
Develop these quickly, huh?

188
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,724
- Uh, chief.
- What?

189
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,385
This guy here... from Seoul.

190
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:15,092
Nice to meet you!
I got the call...

191
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,895
But...

192
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,095
your face...

193
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,139
Did anything happen?

194
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,141
- No, nothing.
- A desk, you need...

195
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,940
Oh, I prepared a desk
over there with lots of sunlight.

196
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,013
I think... I like that corner.

197
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,049
Okay, okay! As you wish.

198
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,849
Inspector Jo, say hello.

199
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,987
From Seoul,

200
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,861
Suh Tae...yoon, senior officer.

201
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,161
Jo Yong-gu. Nice to meet you.

202
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,437
He volunteered to assist
with this investigation.

203
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,330
Quite an uncommon thing.

204
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,878
Well, go arrange your desk.

205
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,377
Yes, sit down.

206
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,381
Inspector Chief

207
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,065
The song is great.
The opening song.

208
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,861
I always watch
Inspector Chief with Dad.

209
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,095
What was my phone number?

210
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,405
Just eat.

211
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,599
Right, I need to call Dad!

212
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,109
I should call. Oh, it's Dad!

213
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,188
Hey, Kwang-ho.

214
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,016
Listen.

215
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:52,154
This footprint was found at the
site of Hyang-sook's murder.

216
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,288
Look.

217
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,861
And these are sneakers
we found at your house.

218
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,937
You wear these? Right?

219
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,767
Now, look closely.

220
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:07,676
The footprint in this photo,
and the sole of your shoe.

221
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,607
The same, right?

222
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,808
This pattern?

223
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:17,253
The circle, this indentation?
Exactly the same.

224
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,085
Am I right?

225
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,259
This part was smudged,

226
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,295
don't worry about that.

227
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:31,933
You killed all
those women, right?

228
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,004
Okay.

229
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,807
You didn't kill them all, right?

230
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:44,412
So you didn't not kill only
Hyang-sook, correct?

231
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,616
I didn't kill anyone.

232
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,519
We've got the
evidence here!

233
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,184
- Where's our shovel?
- Shovel?

234
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,097
Look at you...

235
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,725
Hey, bastard. Give me that.

236
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,862
Can't you even shovel right?
Watch me.

237
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,204
Loosen the dirt first.
Then push with your foot.

238
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,141
- Kwang-ho!
- Yes?

239
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:17,181
You punk.

240
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:21,241
Did you come here to play?

241
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,786
You know where this is?

242
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,545
We came here to bury you.

243
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:28,615
What? Why?
Why?

244
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,991
Because you won't
listen, you bastard.

245
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:34,361
- I'm a good boy.
- Then tell me!

246
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,464
Out here in the fresh air.
With that face.

247
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,231
Hey, come here.

248
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:44,173
Women hate this
face, don't they?

249
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,676
They grimace and all
fucking run away.

250
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,439
It's true.

251
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,344
I'll kill them all.

252
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:57,247
Everyone who
grimaces at my face.

253
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,221
I'll kill them all.

254
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:05,726
Those women who grimace,
they're all in my head.

255
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,293
- Hyang-sook too?
- Hyang-sook?

256
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,269
Hyang-sook. You always
followed her around.

257
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,773
- Hyang-sook is pretty.
- Oh yeah, she's pretty.

258
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:20,072
But Hyang-sook
grimaced too, huh?

259
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,009
She said, "Fuck, get away!"
Didn't she?

260
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,878
Because you liked her.

261
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,610
So you killed her, huh?

262
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,058
By the train tracks.

263
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,891
In that rice paddy.

264
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,557
The train tracks? Right.

265
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,364
Her throat. Hyang-sook's throat...

266
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,962
...strangled it tightly.

267
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,508
- With what?
- Her brassiere.

268
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,171
With her white brassiere,

269
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,807
strangled her tightly.

270
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,544
- And then?
- Her stocking.

271
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,519
- Her stocking?
- Pulled off her leg.

272
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,055
Then it was the stocking.

273
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,615
This guy's smart, huh?

274
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,785
And then?

275
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,795
What?

276
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,866
What was it?

277
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,594
Something with a strap?

278
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,402
A handbag strap?

279
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,801
Right, a bag strap.

280
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:29,245
Strangling Hyang-sook's
throat with it tightly.

281
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:31,672
And?

282
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:38,455
Then, Hyang-sook's
body shook a bit.

283
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,787
She looked completely dead.

284
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,092
And then?

285
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:49,323
Her head was covered up.

286
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,765
With what?

287
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:58,799
Her panties. Covered her
head with her panties.

288
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,345
Do you mean a girdle?
That women wear?

289
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,506
Right, girdle!

290
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:09,952
Looked like it covered
her head right up.

291
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,988
And then?

292
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,984
Um... had to dress her again.

293
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,994
And why was that?

294
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,828
I don't know.
Put the clothes back on.

295
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,798
Why was that?

296
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,604
How would I know?

297
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,267
You were doing well!

298
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,641
Bastard! What did you do next?

299
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,111
- Then... running!
- Where?

300
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,148
- It was raining!
- Where did you run?

301
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,209
- Kept running.
- Oh, you little shit!

302
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,754
The lightning struck!

303
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,256
Where the hell were you
running, you bastard!

304
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,021
Yong-gu, start digging.

305
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:51,755
Huh? Digging?

306
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,455
Lightning!

307
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,419
Citizens, this is a
civil defence drill.

308
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,390
The air raid siren
has begun to sound.

309
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,927
This is only a drill.

310
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:28,557
The entire country is now
under a civil defence drill.

311
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:36,369
A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses.

312
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:41,208
Follow the instructions
you hear in this broadcast.

313
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:47,650
Please move all flammable
materials to a safe place.

314
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:53,019
Unplug all cords, then hurry
to an underground area...

315
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,561
Shut off the lights!

316
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,910
Hey, you!

317
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,920
Come here.

318
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,291
Put this on.
Everyone ready?

319
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,987
Get in the car.

320
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,688
Turn around.

321
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,197
"Lee Hyang-sook"

322
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,461
Take off your pants.

323
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:40,729
What'll the headline be?

324
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,297
"Crime-Fighting Trio" or
"Smiles of the Unstoppable."

325
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,434
Inspector Park, in the back.

326
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,480
Make a straight line now.

327
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,681
Miss Kwon, big party tonight!
Reserve a room.

328
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,150
Smile!

329
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:59,580
This time, hold up your fist.
Tight!

330
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:04,628
- Come take a picture!
- That's okay.

331
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,560
Come on!

332
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,863
Wait a second.

333
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,213
With these webbed fingers,

334
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,580
you can't even hold
chopsticks, right?

335
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,677
They've always been this way?
Go on.

336
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,857
Kwang-ho, this is the spot, right?

337
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:41,898
I don't know.

338
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,696
What's he talking about?
It was here.

339
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:49,163
For the re-enactment,
you have to act well.

340
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,107
There are a lot of reporters here.

341
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,178
How's this?

342
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,803
A bit lower.

343
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,412
- What do we start with?
- Wait.

344
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:03,681
It's best to write down
the correct order.

345
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,382
Then why didn't you do it?
I'm fucking busy.

346
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:07,690
Chief.

347
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,620
The re-enactment
isn't going to work anyway.

348
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,791
Becomes an embarrassment.

349
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,564
Hey, I told you to stay away.
Why'd you come back here?

350
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,664
Just give them some excuse.
The suspect is sick, or...

351
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,242
Inspector Suh!

352
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:29,342
You're dumping shit
on cooked rice here!

353
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,575
I told you before,
Kwang-ho isn't guilty.

354
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,151
Just shut up!

355
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,885
Chief...

356
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:40,424
The cords around their necks
were tied with three tight knots.

357
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,790
Look at Kwang-ho's hands.
Could he do that?

358
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,726
- Get out!
- Even a child can see that.

359
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,491
Get the hell out!

360
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,164
Grab the brassiere strap...

361
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,793
Hey, concentrate!

362
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,270
Dad!

363
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,635
Kwang-ho! It's me!

364
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,369
Dad!

365
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:03,243
Hey, you're innocent!

366
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:09,118
I know! I didn't do it!

367
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:23,766
Mr. Baek Kwang-ho!
Are you denying a crime?

368
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,065
He didn't kill anyone!
My son's innocent!

369
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:32,576
You were tortured, weren't you?

370
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:33,837
My team never tortures suspects.

371
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,311
It's all gone to hell.

372
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,816
Don't bring it up.

373
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,789
Hey, did you see the look on
prosecutor Choi's face back there?

374
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,258
Fuck, how can he
revoke the warrant?

375
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:51,927
We even had evidence.

376
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,056
Evidence? That footprint?

377
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,601
How can they set him free?

378
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,104
What can we do?

379
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,404
All we had was a confession.

380
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,469
It was no ordinary confession.
You heard the tape.

381
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:14,644
All the details of the crime
came pouring out his mouth.

382
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,883
Things he'd never know
if he weren't the killer.

383
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,618
Like how she was strangled.

384
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,494
You heard it too.

385
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,759
Be honest, didn't you
rehearse that in advance?

386
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,958
What?

387
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,035
Quiet. Eat something.

388
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,070
Jesus...

389
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:42,680
What? I said to separate
the noodles and bean sauce.

390
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,949
What the fuck!

391
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,148
Investigative Team Reshuffled

392
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:55,920
Murder Case Shrouded
In Mystery Once Again

393
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:17,670
The location of
the first homicide,

394
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,875
and the second homicide.

395
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:24,444
Now, a distance of...

396
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:25,955
approximately 1000 meters.

397
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:29,652
A length of not more
than... one kilometer.

398
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:43,306
The victim, on the
12th and the 16th,

399
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:48,107
both days at twelve o'clock...

400
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,649
Ah, December 16th.

401
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,580
On December 16th,

402
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,279
at twelve o'clock,

403
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,552
Location: Yangji Teahouse,

404
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,525
Han Sung-geun

405
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:07,223
a 32-year old office worker.

406
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:12,368
An arranged date, maybe?

407
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,804
Anyway, at the crime site

408
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:21,470
...were found a footprint,
two drops of blood,

409
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:25,845
...and a drop of semen.
Semen? They found semen?

410
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,941
What? Yes.

411
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,616
The two dead women...

412
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,057
Did they have
anything in common?

413
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,754
In common...

414
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,729
Well, first...

415
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:45,860
Both of them were single.

416
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,337
They were both
extremely beautiful.

417
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,669
And?

418
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,714
The murders all
took place in the rain.

419
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,076
Rain?

420
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,877
He murdered them
on rainy nights.

421
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,319
Really?

422
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,484
And red clothes.

423
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,320
They all wore red clothes.

424
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,451
Both of them?

425
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,325
No, all three of them.

426
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:15,595
Three of them?

427
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,167
What are you talking about?

428
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,931
Three were murdered.
We just haven't found the third body.

429
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:28,375
This is a missing person form.
The name is quite unusual.

430
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:32,506
Dokko Hyun-soon, age 27.
It was two months ago, July 18.

431
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,644
Oh, her? Dokko Hyun-soon?
I know that girl.

432
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:40,190
Everyone in this town knows her.

433
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,158
A pretty girl,
that Hyun-soon.

434
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,788
Even a Miss Korea
is no match for her.

435
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,262
Did you process the missing
person form, Yong-gu?

436
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,801
Oh, shut up.

437
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,066
This is no ordinary incident, Chief.

438
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:59,007
If you look in detail.
Documents never lie.

439
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,137
It says she was
wearing a red shirt.

440
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,112
It's right here in writing.

441
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,643
What's that?

442
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:11,148
Marked here is the weather
on the day she vanished.

443
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,553
It rained on that day too.

444
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,955
Rain, red clothes...

445
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,895
She was murdered.
By the same person.

446
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,696
You don't know this town,
that's why you talk nonsense.

447
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:29,136
She always said she'd
go to Seoul one day...

448
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,504
I have an idea where the body is.

449
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,042
Look at the map.

450
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:37,075
Right here...

451
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,639
I marked where the victim went,
and where the body might be.

452
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:47,018
Give me two squadrons of
cops. I'll find her in two days.

453
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,325
You sure of this?

454
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,375
You know...

455
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:16,317
...university students,
when they go on orientation...

456
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:19,219
people say they
guys all get laid,

457
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:24,317
a big group, guys and girls,
in one room going at it...

458
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,226
Is that true?

459
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,855
I don't know. Hurry up.

460
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,637
You went to a 2-year
school, didn't you?

461
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:38,198
Student trips, orientation...
Did you go on those?

462
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:44,003
Go ask Suh, he went
to a 4-year university.

463
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,776
Whether he had group sex...

464
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,148
Shit, four years.

465
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,112
I spent 4 years in high school.

466
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,353
Shit, put that away.

467
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,335
You know, I miss
Dokko Hyun-soon.

468
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,403
You too?

469
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:11,307
She was just
too good for this town.

470
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,635
I'm telling you, she
went to Seoul.

471
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,615
What is it?

472
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,380
Lot of snakes down there.

473
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,025
Each part of a corpse
decays at a different speed.

474
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,153
Look. It's old,

475
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,289
but the inner thigh is still firm.

476
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,031
There's evidence of rape?

477
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,165
A bit of semen was found.

478
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,907
But it's so old, we can't
determine the blood type.

479
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,341
Oh, Hyun-soon...

480
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:51,874
This time too he used
items belonging to her.

481
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,077
Right, that's her stocking
around the throat?

482
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,346
Yes.

483
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,589
The victim's panties
on her face,

484
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,817
as with Hyang-sook.

485
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,326
Her hands were bound
the same way too.

486
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:09,161
His methods of killing
are quite professional.

487
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,502
He's thorough.

488
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,297
And polished.

489
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:21,308
So there hasn't been
a single witness yet.

490
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,416
Would you like
a bit more tenderloin?

491
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,951
That's okay. We're fine.

492
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:32,454
Where did Kwang-ho go?
I don't see him.

493
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:35,492
Is anything...?

494
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:40,030
I bought your son something,
give it to him later.

495
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,689
What's this?

496
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,599
Oh, last time, taking a
look at his sneakers,

497
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,934
they smelled so awful,
I felt bad for him.

498
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,771
I thought, I'll have to buy
him new shoes.

499
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,674
So I picked up some Nikes.

500
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,077
You didn't have to...

501
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:01,248
That punk, he's always sleeping
in the strangest places!

502
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,784
Kwang-ho!

503
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,122
This here...
your shoe size is 250mm, right?

504
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,924
Here, Nike. Try them on.

505
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,293
Give me that sneaker.

506
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,531
These are "Nice", not Nike.
N, I, C, E.

507
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:25,040
Nice or Nike. Who cares?

508
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:31,308
If you buy him sneakers,
you should get the real thing.

509
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,383
Cool, huh?

510
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,278
Have a drink.

511
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:43,026
I beat you because
I care for you.

512
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:47,063
So if you see me on the
street, don't run away.

513
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:51,931
Yong-gu feels bad about...

514
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:53,804
Punk.

515
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,310
Hey, where are you going again?

516
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,344
You see, Chief.

517
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:10,148
That boy is the exact opposite
of the type we're looking for.

518
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:14,418
Dragging in suspects like that
is a waste of time, so...

519
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:15,355
Inspector Suh!

520
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,791
Have some meat
before you speak.

521
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,661
I don't eat burnt meat.

522
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:34,034
"You said you'd come back to me"

523
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:40,414
"Like the singing swallows"

524
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:47,718
"On the hills, singing birds
and blooming flowers"

525
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:53,526
"Alone on the hill"

526
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,397
Sir?

527
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,269
Hey, Seoul city bumpkin.

528
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,578
What?

529
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,386
Why did you come here?

530
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,583
Out to the boondocks?

531
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,484
To catch the killer.

532
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,934
Is Seoul that big?

533
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,468
Huh? Is it big?

534
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,341
Bigger than America?

535
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,477
Give me a banana.

536
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,953
Let me tell you about America.

537
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,816
They've got the F.B.I.!

538
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,024
If you watch how they
investigate... You know how?

539
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,699
Their heads are
spinning like a top.

540
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,893
Analyzing things...

541
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,097
You know why?

542
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:13,766
It's 'cause they got so
much fucking land!

543
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,377
If you don't use your brain,
it's too much ground to cover.

544
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:26,320
So they have no choice,
those F.B.I. Bastards.

545
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:31,260
But our Republic of Korea...

546
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:37,098
using just your two legs,
you can run all over it.

547
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,634
You know why?

548
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,030
'Cause our land's
the size of my dick.

549
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:49,045
So it's said, Korean detectives
investigate with their feet.

550
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:53,242
That's folk wisdom,
you bastard.

551
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,911
So brainy geeks like you
can go the hell to America.

552
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,650
- Go there and...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

553
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,825
You bastard!

554
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,460
- Let go of me!
- What? You f...

555
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,742
Give him this.

556
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,513
Take it away! Take it!

557
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,992
Everything's clearer now.
That's much better.

558
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:44,425
I've got it now.
About the killer.

559
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,129
That bastard,

560
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,207
he'll do it again.

561
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,935
The next night it rains.

562
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:57,810
So we need to keep
one step ahead of him.

563
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,180
Pre-emptive!
Okay?

564
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:07,549
And if you two ever start
fighting in front of me again,

565
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:11,150
I'll kill you both! Understood?

566
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,043
Ladies and gentlemen!

567
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,134
In just a moment,

568
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,339
our President will be

569
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,008
driving past. Wait a minute...

570
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,630
It's raining nice.

571
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:58,570
You ready?

572
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:38,447
Ooh, Gui-ok's looking nice!

573
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:39,538
Shut up.

574
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,313
What if he grabs her for real?

575
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:51,383
Inspector Suh should be
following close behind her.

576
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:57,957
Shit, do we have to do
this every time when it rains?

577
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:00,297
But thanks to this,

578
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,804
Gui-ok puts on that red skirt.

579
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:06,774
With makeup, she looks
like a different person.

580
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,773
- So what?
- Was she always that pretty?

581
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,005
You getting hard?

582
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,082
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Let's check.

583
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,412
- We're on duty now...
- Oh, Yong-gu!

584
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,390
Hey.

585
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,225
So do you really
keep watch here?

586
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,533
These days, nobody
ever goes outside.

587
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:34,966
Someone's coming.

588
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,873
Hey, kids!

589
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:41,408
Over here.

590
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,479
That's cold.

591
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:47,914
You're so wet!

592
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:55,024
Hey, stay here
until the rain stops.

593
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,119
That umbrella's useless.

594
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,195
And we just picked it up
in front of the school.

595
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,821
Someone threw it away.

596
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,625
Miss, are you going
that way too?

597
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,396
Hey, she's a detective.

598
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,266
No way!

599
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,670
She's in the
Violent Crimes Division.

600
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,742
- Really?
- Sure.

601
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,209
Wait a minute.
We'll give you a ride.

602
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,507
Wow, in a police car!

603
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:22,608
Hey, you two. What are
you doing out so late?

604
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,915
We always stay together,
so it's okay.

605
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:28,651
You'll be fine
even if you go alone.

606
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:35,293
Nam-ju, tell them about
what you heard at school.

607
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,423
What?

608
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:39,093
You know, during cleaning
time, about the murderer.

609
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:43,299
Right! You know why they
can't catch the murderer?

610
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:46,399
This is the truth. We go to
Ansong Girls Middle School.

611
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,341
Behind our school,
there's an outhouse.

612
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:52,472
They say a crazy man lives
under there, the murderer!

613
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,016
He stays there all day,

614
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,178
and when night comes,
he sneaks out and kills women.

615
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:00,984
So when he comes out at night,

616
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,549
you must be able to smell
the shit from miles away.

617
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:07,721
That's not the story.

618
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:11,267
Yoo-jin said a crazy woman
fell in there and died.

619
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:15,767
Then I'll meet you in front of
the factory with an umbrella.

620
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:19,468
It's okay.

621
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,100
Okay.

622
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:24,840
I'll see you soon.

623
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:41,390
Don't leave me.

624
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:47,494
"I still love you.
Walking by myself..."

625
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,073
Hello?

626
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:48,090
Everyone stay where you are!

627
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:52,821
Don't touch anything near you.
Don't move one step!

628
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,454
Hey, you!

629
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:55,792
I'm talking to you!

630
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:58,299
Wait for the forensics team.

631
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,105
Look!

632
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,683
These are genuine footprints.

633
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:19,313
You see the
Remicon factory there?

634
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:23,416
He caught her near the factory,

635
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:27,588
and quietly pulled her
over 400 meters to here.

636
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,827
The footprints look
like a bride and groom's.

637
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:41,276
But you didn't find anything,
aside from the footprints?

638
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:45,781
I hoped to find fingerprints on
the umbrella, but no luck.

639
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,208
Not only that, due to the rain,

640
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,549
the footprints are all smudged.

641
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:57,292
Even after such a thorough
investigation, nothing.

642
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:05,063
Therefore, Chief, I think
this could be a hint. Hint!

643
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,692
What?

644
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:11,831
The fact that we found
nothing at the scene.

645
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,604
Always in rape cases,

646
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:18,442
at the crime scene,

647
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:23,178
there's one or two of
those hairs left behind.

648
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,810
So?

649
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:31,049
I'm saying the criminal must not
have any hair down there.

650
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,924
You mean hairless?

651
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:37,364
That's right, hairless.
A total baldie.

652
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:44,407
He can't leave hair behind,
because he doesn't have any?

653
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,135
For example,

654
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:50,373
a Buddhist monk who
shaved the hair down there.

655
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,448
It's a perfect crime.

656
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,540
Well, then.

657
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,553
Yongdeok Temple
is just next door.

658
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,179
Should we start there?

659
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:11,800
Hey Gui-ok, you've got
the radio on over there.

660
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,468
How would you like your coffee?

661
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,598
Lots of sugar for me.

662
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,870
- Inspector Suh!
- Yes, sir?

663
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:25,744
Do you have any more ideas?

664
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,780
I don't know.
As you saw today,

665
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,285
this criminal is flawless.

666
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,322
- So?
- Therefore,

667
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,984
our standard procedures
aren't going to help.

668
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:40,029
So what are we going to do?

669
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,633
Excuse me, but I've
got something to show you.

670
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,837
What will she show us today?

671
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:56,768
What's this?

672
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,416
These are documents
from an FM radio station.

673
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:03,418
Looks like a
broadcast schedule.

674
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,923
Yes, it's an evening music
program I listen to.

675
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:13,189
There's someone who keeps
requesting the song, "Sad Letter".

676
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:16,498
If you look, it lists the dates
this song was broadcast.

677
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:21,768
Actually, this isn't a very
popular song. It's quite rare.

678
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,430
A song? What letter?

679
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,203
"Sad Letter"
The singer is Yu Jae-ha.

680
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,877
Jo Young-pil's band.

681
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,448
- Sure, I heard it.
- So?

682
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:40,183
The song was broadcast on the
same days of the murders here.

683
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:43,693
Look.

684
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,356
October 20.
That's Park Bo-hee's murder.

685
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:53,062
December 19
was Lee Hyang-sook.

686
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,629
So...

687
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:59,107
...on last night's murder too,
this song was broadcast?

688
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,838
Yes. I listened to it myself.

689
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:07,479
Containing the request.

690
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:11,179
"Sent by a lonely man
from Terung District."

691
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,518
"Please broadcast it
on a rainy day."

692
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:19,991
Miss Kwon, nice! Good idea!

693
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,663
You read too many mystery
novels as a student?

694
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,768
That was a nice story.

695
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:31,132
Chief, this can't
be a coincidence.

696
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,106
Look at this.
Documents never lie.

697
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,111
Christ, here we go again.

698
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:40,047
It seems he's a real psycho.

699
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:44,052
As soon as he hears the song,
he goes crazy.

700
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:47,453
Oh Chief, now you're doing
it too. This makes no sense!

701
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,219
It does make sense, sir!
It's quite simple.

702
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:54,923
Assemblies start with the
National Anthem. It's the same.

703
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,692
Did you get the postcard?

704
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,530
I requested it,

705
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:02,264
but the radio station's
a bit disorganized.

706
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:07,409
Find it quickly.
Check the postmark,

707
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:08,875
fingerprints and handwriting.

708
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,037
Yes, sir!

709
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:14,247
Officer Kwon, call the station
and follow up on this.

710
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,317
Baldies!

711
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:24,492
- What about that?
- Huh?

712
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,687
What we mentioned before...

713
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,559
Hairless, sir!

714
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,496
How do you investigate?

715
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,626
Pull the pants off passing men?

716
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:50,880
The postcard from yesterday.
I asked you to keep it!

717
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:52,784
What postcard?

718
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:57,223
You read it on the air yesterday!
Look how many we get here!

719
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:00,588
Hey, mister!

720
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,897
Nothing. Get dressed.

721
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,300
Inspector.

722
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:10,771
They've already
carted off yesterday's trash.

723
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,035
It's no use.

724
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,751
You're not going to shower?

725
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:35,259
Enough showers, for god's sake.

726
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:39,131
My skin feels like it'll burst.

727
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:42,033
You couldn't find
any hairless men?

728
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:48,835
Like looking for dog's horns.
Just paid sauna fees.

729
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:51,311
Shit, can't even get reimbursed.

730
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,182
At least your face is clean.

731
00:55:57,287 --> 00:56:00,450
How many times in a day...
dressing, undressing, dressing...

732
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,115
I'll lose my hair there too.

733
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,861
I asked the workers
at the sauna there,

734
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,026
to call me if they saw anyone,

735
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:18,768
Bastards just smirked at me.

736
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:24,302
Don't do it all yourself,
have someone else do it.

737
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:31,352
What's that guy from Seoul
doing these days?

738
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,023
- Researching pop songs.
- What?

739
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,488
Shit, it's nothing
you've heard of.

740
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,196
Is he still talking nonsense?

741
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,628
Driving me crazy.

742
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:52,203
If you feel that way,
go see a shaman.

743
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:53,607
A shaman?

744
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:57,836
Sure, one that
tells fortunes well.

745
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:02,579
Ask her where the
murderer is hiding.

746
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:12,691
A problem at the main gate
of the police station.

747
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:17,992
It should be moved about
10m to the southwest.

748
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:24,732
A face just passed by me.
I think he's the one.

749
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:35,809
Is his face among
these pictures here?

750
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,449
Take those dirty photos away.

751
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,691
- Hey, just look...
- Put them away!

752
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,256
It's bad fortune.

753
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:54,460
- Take this, and do what I say.
- Don't try to sell that charm.

754
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,791
Wait, wait a minute.

755
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:22,525
You have to mix in dirt
from the crime scene.

756
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,355
Stir.

757
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,860
She said that
was most important.

758
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,097
Now pour it.

759
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,439
Stop.

760
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,112
Good.

761
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,791
Once this dries,

762
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:54,921
this stain will form the
shape of the murderer's face.

763
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,726
That's ridiculous.

764
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,892
Quiet, you'll break the charm.

765
00:58:59,002 --> 00:59:00,629
Know how much this costs?

766
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,032
So shut up!

767
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:10,938
Who's that?

768
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:14,813
Don't you know?

769
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:17,878
Criminals always return
to the crime scene.

770
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:53,416
Wait a sec.

771
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,123
What's he doing here?

772
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:00,923
Why'd he come?

773
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:19,640
What the fuck...

774
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:24,652
We need science here!

775
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,512
What the hell's that?

776
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,461
Still, he's got style.

777
01:03:03,779 --> 01:03:04,768
Stop there!

778
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:07,737
Hey, you!

779
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:31,169
It's getting narrow!

780
01:03:31,273 --> 01:03:32,638
Single file!

781
01:03:57,165 --> 01:03:59,861
Miss, did a strange man
just run past here?

782
01:03:59,968 --> 01:04:02,766
No.

783
01:04:02,871 --> 01:04:05,305
- It's that policeman.
- What?

784
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:08,342
- At the guard post.
- You know him?

785
01:04:09,044 --> 01:04:12,912
Damn, he's a
fast little bastard.

786
01:04:14,349 --> 01:04:15,748
He's not there?

787
01:04:19,788 --> 01:04:22,951
Did you check the
alleys properly?

788
01:04:23,058 --> 01:04:25,117
You think you
know this village?

789
01:04:26,127 --> 01:04:27,754
You stepped on a
stick back there.

790
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:30,354
A stick or a shit pile, who cares?

791
01:04:30,465 --> 01:04:32,456
He stepped on it.

792
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:40,801
What?

793
01:04:41,243 --> 01:04:42,904
Over there... Hey, you!

794
01:04:54,055 --> 01:04:57,390
Stop!

795
01:05:02,797 --> 01:05:05,891
Jesus, not again.

796
01:05:07,535 --> 01:05:09,526
Hey, over there.

797
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:39,961
Black clothes, black clothes...

798
01:05:40,468 --> 01:05:42,436
Everyone's in black except you.

799
01:05:53,982 --> 01:05:55,745
Everybody stop!

800
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,350
Don't move an inch!

801
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:27,110
- Inspector Jo!
- Yes?

802
01:06:29,084 --> 01:06:30,073
Gather them together.

803
01:06:33,621 --> 01:06:35,248
Hey, stop.

804
01:06:35,357 --> 01:06:37,188
Gather together.

805
01:06:38,393 --> 01:06:39,417
Lift up your heads.

806
01:06:40,328 --> 01:06:41,625
Everyone stand in line.

807
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:02,081
Look in my eyes.

808
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:04,946
Give me that.

809
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,692
What is it?

810
01:07:22,637 --> 01:07:24,070
You bastard!

811
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:26,197
- Give me your hands!
- What are you doing?

812
01:07:26,307 --> 01:07:30,676
You ran away from us?

813
01:07:52,801 --> 01:07:54,393
But...

814
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:58,303
Is jerking off a crime?

815
01:07:58,406 --> 01:08:00,738
It's not a crime.

816
01:08:00,842 --> 01:08:03,242
Why'd you run away?

817
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:07,338
Someone jumped out
of the woods and ran at me,

818
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:09,440
so I panicked.

819
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:14,045
Sure, but why'd you go
all the way out there to do it?

820
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:17,614
There are kids at home,

821
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:21,218
and the air's nice in the woods.

822
01:08:21,329 --> 01:08:25,891
Or did you go back to
fantasize about the dead girls?

823
01:08:27,102 --> 01:08:33,268
Your husband likes
to go out at night, huh?

824
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,071
What's this?

825
01:08:38,146 --> 01:08:39,078
Gimme that.

826
01:08:43,451 --> 01:08:45,214
What did you make these with?

827
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:03,529
These days, you know,

828
01:09:03,638 --> 01:09:09,406
real events in our town are
stronger than the magazines.

829
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:12,309
When I read the newspaper,

830
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:14,712
I start fantasizing.

831
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:16,943
I ask myself why I do this,

832
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:23,616
but when will this
chance come again?

833
01:09:23,725 --> 01:09:26,250
According to neighbors,

834
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:29,159
he looks diligently
after his sick wife,

835
01:09:29,264 --> 01:09:31,357
never misses a week at church,

836
01:09:31,466 --> 01:09:34,367
that he's honest.

837
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,897
All perverts are like that.

838
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:39,974
Nice on the outside.

839
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:43,067
But my eyes can't be fooled.

840
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:45,009
One look, and I know.

841
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:49,714
Honey,

842
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,753
I put socks in here.
Change them after dinner.

843
01:09:52,854 --> 01:09:54,412
Don't forget, or they'll smell.

844
01:09:54,522 --> 01:09:57,514
I'll take care of it.
Go feed the kids.

845
01:09:58,426 --> 01:10:00,485
Watch out for protesters.

846
01:10:02,597 --> 01:10:06,124
Release Jo Byung-soon!

847
01:10:06,234 --> 01:10:06,996
What now?

848
01:10:07,102 --> 01:10:09,127
I heard Byung-soon
confessed last night.

849
01:10:09,237 --> 01:10:10,499
Who says so?

850
01:10:10,605 --> 01:10:12,800
Oh, Chief!

851
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:18,846
When will you make
an announcement?

852
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:22,007
We know nothing.
Just wait a bit more.

853
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:24,677
You've held him 4 days
without a warrant.

854
01:10:24,786 --> 01:10:27,653
People are saying he's
detained illegally.

855
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:32,951
This time be realistic,
like in a movie.

856
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,018
Go!

857
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:37,759
You did a good job just now.

858
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:38,890
Yong-ku?

859
01:10:43,204 --> 01:10:47,106
So, you were hiding
behind the outhouse,

860
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:48,835
and you saw
Park Myung-ja

861
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:52,607
coming towards you
with a flashlight, right?

862
01:10:52,714 --> 01:10:56,445
Yes, yes, yes. It seems so.

863
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,446
Not it seems,
you bastard, be precise!

864
01:11:06,394 --> 01:11:07,918
I think I dreamed it that way.

865
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:13,590
Anyway, I snuck up behind her,

866
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:21,973
and I must have chopped
the back of her neck?

867
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,908
With my hand like this.

868
01:11:24,012 --> 01:11:24,910
Next?

869
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:30,879
Myung-ja cried out, and I
guess she collapsed?

870
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:37,687
So I laid her on the ground,
and was about to take her,

871
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:41,057
Hey, it didn't
happen there, it was...

872
01:11:41,162 --> 01:11:46,225
The pine grove!
I took her there.

873
01:11:46,334 --> 01:11:49,064
It was from the rice paddies
to the pine grove.

874
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:53,106
According to the news, more
than 200 meters, right?

875
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,835
That's so far!

876
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:59,141
So the rain was pouring, and I
dragged her through the mud.

877
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:00,646
And then?

878
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:04,480
So I threw her down
in the pine grove.

879
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,111
Then I strangled her.

880
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:09,554
- With what?
- The bag strap.

881
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:11,090
Really?

882
01:12:11,192 --> 01:12:13,160
Her stocking!

883
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,161
Right.

884
01:12:17,265 --> 01:12:21,031
Brassiere. A Venus brassiere.

885
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:28,542
I wrapped it around
her throat like this,

886
01:12:28,643 --> 01:12:30,338
So the woman,

887
01:12:30,445 --> 01:12:35,678
she took a rock and
clocked me in the head.

888
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,411
Where'd she hit you?

889
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:42,354
Right here, next to my eye.

890
01:12:42,457 --> 01:12:47,224
It still hurts, even if
it was just a dream.

891
01:12:58,406 --> 01:13:02,740
Byung-soon, are you gonna
keep saying it was a dream?

892
01:13:02,844 --> 01:13:05,540
That's enough.
Turn your head.

893
01:13:07,715 --> 01:13:09,376
So this bruise is from the rock?

894
01:13:09,484 --> 01:13:12,044
- No, this guy here...
- Shut up! Look here.

895
01:13:16,324 --> 01:13:20,658
You've done well,
now let's finish this.

896
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,665
So...

897
01:13:24,766 --> 01:13:28,327
Since she hit me
like this with the rock,

898
01:13:28,436 --> 01:13:31,166
I must have lost consciousness?

899
01:13:31,272 --> 01:13:36,574
And after lying there a while,
I woke up, and looking around...

900
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:37,975
And?

901
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:43,073
I was in the bottom
of an outhouse! A shithouse!

902
01:13:43,184 --> 01:13:47,621
And maggots were
creeping all over the place!

903
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:51,317
Not the outhouse again.
So after brushing them off,

904
01:13:51,426 --> 01:13:55,863
I grabbed some straw,
and pulled myself up.

905
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:59,161
Even in a dream, it's hard.

906
01:13:59,267 --> 01:14:00,928
But then I saw,

907
01:14:01,035 --> 01:14:05,734
this wasn't someone's home,
it was a school toilet.

908
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,331
Walking to the playground,

909
01:14:08,443 --> 01:14:12,038
I saw huge swarms of girls,

910
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:15,981
so many, and the smell...

911
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:17,312
Wait! Over here.

912
01:14:20,655 --> 01:14:23,590
Where did you hear about
that school outhouse?

913
01:14:24,592 --> 01:14:28,028
Everyone knows that story.

914
01:14:28,129 --> 01:14:30,757
I saw it in a dream.

915
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:36,569
From below the gas attack,
run in a direction...

916
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,105
...perpendicular to the wind.

917
01:14:39,207 --> 01:14:41,471
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

918
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,705
Put it down. Hey!

919
01:14:54,455 --> 01:14:55,353
Pretend you're dead!

920
01:14:59,494 --> 01:15:03,692
Last time, who told you that
story about the outhouse?

921
01:15:03,798 --> 01:15:05,629
You came because of that?

922
01:15:11,005 --> 01:15:11,733
What's wrong?

923
01:15:11,839 --> 01:15:13,966
I hurt myself in the chute.

924
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:16,043
There was a pebble in there.

925
01:15:17,845 --> 01:15:19,813
Where's the nurse?

926
01:15:21,516 --> 01:15:22,778
I'll put it on for you.

927
01:15:23,718 --> 01:15:25,015
I'll do it.

928
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:28,346
Shy? You're just a kid.

929
01:15:28,456 --> 01:15:29,354
Sit down.

930
01:15:34,262 --> 01:15:35,058
Give it to me.

931
01:15:37,932 --> 01:15:39,297
Lift up your shirt.

932
01:15:40,301 --> 01:15:44,067
Think about what I asked you.

933
01:15:46,474 --> 01:15:51,070
The murderer in the outhouse,
coming out at night...

934
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:54,945
Who might have
told that story first...

935
01:15:55,049 --> 01:15:56,380
How would I know?

936
01:15:56,484 --> 01:16:03,356
It's like asking who
made up the elephant jokes.

937
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:06,256
Why don't you go to
the outhouse yourself?

938
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:09,559
Do I look like
I have time for that?

939
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:02,310
Even still...

940
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:05,477
Some kids talk, so you
snoop around the outhouse?

941
01:17:05,586 --> 01:17:06,951
You got that much time?

942
01:17:07,555 --> 01:17:08,749
Giving me a heart attack.

943
01:17:08,856 --> 01:17:10,187
Investigating...

944
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:14,159
Is investigating such a dirty job?

945
01:17:16,464 --> 01:17:20,696
Ah! Is that why they
made up the rumor?

946
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:25,333
I saw her myself
once or twice.

947
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,429
That woman.

948
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,974
Who?

949
01:17:28,676 --> 01:17:29,938
A crying woman.

950
01:17:31,312 --> 01:17:32,404
When was it?

951
01:17:33,414 --> 01:17:37,145
I was in the outhouse then too,

952
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:39,879
when I heard a woman crying.

953
01:17:40,488 --> 01:17:42,752
When I came out,

954
01:17:42,857 --> 01:17:46,418
there was a woman
working on that hill,

955
01:17:46,527 --> 01:17:48,392
who kept crying.

956
01:17:50,164 --> 01:17:52,325
A woman was crying?

957
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,464
Yes.

958
01:17:54,635 --> 01:17:56,535
She kept crying on that hill.

959
01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:59,400
It just seemed strange.

960
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:20,489
Hello?

961
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:24,528
Excuse me.

962
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:29,132
Are you the person
who lives here?

963
01:18:31,706 --> 01:18:32,673
Who are you?

964
01:18:34,942 --> 01:18:37,638
I'd like to ask something.
I heard that...

965
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:42,238
Wait!

966
01:18:43,651 --> 01:18:44,845
Look here.

967
01:18:45,319 --> 01:18:47,947
- I'm a policeman.
- Really?

968
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:52,653
You can't stay there.
Someone might see.

969
01:18:54,595 --> 01:18:56,028
There's no one here.

970
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:01,967
Go, please.

971
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:03,759
I beg you.

972
01:19:15,883 --> 01:19:19,717
Be assured this will
remain a secret.

973
01:19:20,755 --> 01:19:24,088
As we're both women,

974
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:27,855
tell me everything
comfortably and in detail.

975
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,497
That night,

976
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,672
a light rain was falling.

977
01:19:42,643 --> 01:19:43,769
When was it?

978
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:47,938
It was...

979
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,653
last September.

980
01:20:03,731 --> 01:20:07,895
I had read all the articles...

981
01:20:08,002 --> 01:20:10,197
...about the women killed.

982
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:17,636
The methods he used
were exactly the same.

983
01:20:19,146 --> 01:20:25,210
It was the same with me.

984
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:32,892
You saw his face?

985
01:20:33,694 --> 01:20:36,288
I tried not to on purpose,

986
01:20:36,397 --> 01:20:38,490
keeping my chin down.

987
01:20:40,434 --> 01:20:41,992
My panties covered my head,

988
01:20:43,204 --> 01:20:45,138
but I closed my eyes tight.

989
01:20:46,774 --> 01:20:50,073
If I saw him,
he'd have killed me.

990
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:57,039
I don't know about the rest,
but one thing I remember.

991
01:20:58,019 --> 01:20:59,987
His hands were very soft.

992
01:21:01,155 --> 01:21:03,487
The hand over my mouth,

993
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:05,923
was delicate,

994
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,358
just like a woman's.

995
01:21:41,395 --> 01:21:44,421
We're done. Let's get
ourselves some sleep.

996
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,665
Once we get
your seal, it's done.

997
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:51,170
It's all as you said.

998
01:21:52,506 --> 01:21:53,734
Sound good?

999
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:57,036
Yes, of course.

1000
01:21:57,945 --> 01:22:00,379
Oh, it's finally over, right?

1001
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:01,875
Please let me down. Please.

1002
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,190
Let him go.
He's not the murderer.

1003
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:11,621
What?

1004
01:22:12,893 --> 01:22:15,191
Byung-soon, are
you the murderer?

1005
01:22:15,296 --> 01:22:17,287
Yes, sir, yes...

1006
01:22:17,865 --> 01:22:19,594
Shut up.
No you're not.

1007
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:21,559
I think I am...

1008
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:22,966
Let him go!

1009
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:27,264
Write down everything she said...

1010
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,205
Hey!

1011
01:22:28,309 --> 01:22:30,243
You toying with me?

1012
01:22:30,711 --> 01:22:32,372
Are you having fun?

1013
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,480
I caught the murderer, OK?

1014
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:37,813
What do you mean,
you caught him?

1015
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:44,516
Did you hang him
from the ceiling?

1016
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:46,320
Well, he kept lying, and...

1017
01:22:46,427 --> 01:22:49,191
Get hold of yourself.
Those journalists...

1018
01:22:49,296 --> 01:22:51,127
- Chief!
- Those goddamned bastards!

1019
01:22:56,804 --> 01:22:58,431
Stop!

1020
01:23:00,441 --> 01:23:01,339
Listen.

1021
01:23:04,445 --> 01:23:05,207
What is that?

1022
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:09,372
- Is it live?
- It's being broadcast now?

1023
01:23:09,483 --> 01:23:10,882
Yes, it's live.

1024
01:23:20,494 --> 01:23:23,986
First, declare a
state of emergency.

1025
01:23:24,098 --> 01:23:27,397
And send me two
garrisons of men.

1026
01:23:27,835 --> 01:23:30,895
Because our
intelligence says so!

1027
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:34,673
Tonight. There'll
be a murder tonight.

1028
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:37,576
Hello, I need to
speak to producer Im...

1029
01:23:38,345 --> 01:23:39,471
What? He quit?

1030
01:23:40,514 --> 01:23:41,811
Get me the A.D. Now.

1031
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:46,250
The song that was just
played, "Sad Letter".

1032
01:23:46,587 --> 01:23:48,782
Read the name and
address of the requester.

1033
01:23:49,256 --> 01:23:51,053
You must have the postcard.

1034
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,387
What? Prank call?

1035
01:23:54,028 --> 01:23:56,861
It's the police, bastard!
Hello?

1036
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:58,196
I'll go myself.

1037
01:23:58,999 --> 01:24:01,160
Are the garrisons coming?

1038
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:03,662
They don't even have
one man available.

1039
01:24:05,172 --> 01:24:09,370
They went to suppress
a demonstration in Suwon city.

1040
01:24:41,842 --> 01:24:45,278
Name: Ahn Mi-seon, age 28.

1041
01:24:46,747 --> 01:24:52,379
Estimated time of death, last
night between 7:30 and 8:00.

1042
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:59,626
When the two of you were
fighting like madmen. Right?

1043
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:04,490
Wait a minute.

1044
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,995
There's something
in the vagina.

1045
01:25:20,848 --> 01:25:23,180
Looks like a peach.

1046
01:25:50,244 --> 01:25:51,643
Nine pieces.

1047
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:03,788
Do you see this kind of
thing in Seoul often?

1048
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:08,127
Never.

1049
01:26:11,098 --> 01:26:12,588
You were right.

1050
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,396
What?

1051
01:26:16,270 --> 01:26:21,765
These guys were a waste
of time from the start.

1052
01:26:24,211 --> 01:26:25,235
Hey!

1053
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:27,738
A call from the radio station.

1054
01:26:28,315 --> 01:26:31,079
I think she found the postcard.

1055
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:35,484
I've got the postcard.
It has an address.

1056
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:37,589
Can you write it down?

1057
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:40,651
Jinan 1-ri, Terung District

1058
01:26:40,761 --> 01:26:43,423
#32. Park Hyun-gyu.

1059
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:19,161
Who are you?

1060
01:27:21,235 --> 01:27:24,295
We're policemen.
Where has Park Hyun-gyu gone?

1061
01:27:24,905 --> 01:27:29,171
He works at the
factory at this time.

1062
01:27:54,568 --> 01:27:55,330
Hey, Hyun-gyu.

1063
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:57,668
Park Hyun-gyu!

1064
01:28:00,374 --> 01:28:01,740
Park Hyun-gyu!

1065
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:31,705
Show me your hands.

1066
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:43,379
They're quite smooth.

1067
01:28:45,886 --> 01:28:48,081
How long have you
worked in the factory office?

1068
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:53,618
From September last year.

1069
01:28:55,295 --> 01:28:59,755
A little before the first murder.

1070
01:29:03,904 --> 01:29:08,739
So after doing your military
service, you came to this town,

1071
01:29:08,842 --> 01:29:12,278
and the murders all
began taking place.

1072
01:29:12,379 --> 01:29:13,846
Right?

1073
01:29:15,315 --> 01:29:16,839
Park Hyun-gyu.

1074
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:20,410
You sent this postcard
to the station.

1075
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:21,385
Yes.

1076
01:29:21,955 --> 01:29:23,855
You sent several others too.

1077
01:29:23,957 --> 01:29:24,821
Yes.

1078
01:29:26,026 --> 01:29:29,018
You asked it to be
played on rainy days.

1079
01:29:29,129 --> 01:29:29,857
Yes.

1080
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:36,327
"Sad Letter" You know that
each time this song played,

1081
01:29:36,437 --> 01:29:38,667
a woman was murdered?

1082
01:29:41,508 --> 01:29:42,440
No.

1083
01:29:45,212 --> 01:29:47,476
Look at the broadcast records.

1084
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:51,349
Okay.

1085
01:29:52,853 --> 01:29:57,187
The song played yesterday?
"Sad Letter".

1086
01:29:57,524 --> 01:29:58,252
Yes.

1087
01:29:58,592 --> 01:30:01,126
You listened to the program?
- Yes.

1088
01:30:01,328 --> 01:30:05,355
Your song played at 7:08, and
the program finished at 8pm.

1089
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:06,865
- You listened to the end?
- Yes.

1090
01:30:06,967 --> 01:30:08,798
- Continuously?
- Yes.

1091
01:30:08,902 --> 01:30:11,769
- What was the final song?
- I don't know.

1092
01:30:11,872 --> 01:30:13,863
- It was yesterday!
- I don't remember.

1093
01:30:13,974 --> 01:30:15,601
Because you went out!

1094
01:30:15,709 --> 01:30:16,801
I was home!

1095
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:20,368
She was killed
between 7:30 and 8pm.

1096
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:22,642
You weren't listening,
you went out!

1097
01:30:23,083 --> 01:30:23,913
Don't make me laugh.

1098
01:30:24,485 --> 01:30:27,750
You motherfucker.
Are you joking?

1099
01:30:27,855 --> 01:30:29,823
- Let go of him now!
- Hey!

1100
01:30:33,727 --> 01:30:34,716
Get back here!

1101
01:30:39,833 --> 01:30:45,533
Even kids in this town know
you torture innocent people.

1102
01:30:45,639 --> 01:30:47,163
Shut up, you!

1103
01:30:47,274 --> 01:30:48,298
Get back here!

1104
01:30:52,279 --> 01:30:53,871
Anyway, I won't be one of them.

1105
01:30:55,916 --> 01:30:57,349
Never.

1106
01:31:00,454 --> 01:31:02,786
Okay. Park Hyun-gyu.

1107
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:07,350
You say you listened
at home to the end?

1108
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:11,826
But you couldn't have
forgotten the last song.

1109
01:31:11,932 --> 01:31:15,959
Because the DJ introduced it

1110
01:31:16,069 --> 01:31:18,037
with some very striking words.

1111
01:31:18,672 --> 01:31:22,972
She mentioned you, and
the many postcards you sent.

1112
01:31:23,076 --> 01:31:27,376
If you heard it,
you couldn't have forgotten.

1113
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:30,575
Tell me! If you really
listened to the end.

1114
01:31:31,885 --> 01:31:33,716
I don't remember.

1115
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:35,378
You don't remember?

1116
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:38,119
Should I explain it for you?

1117
01:31:42,095 --> 01:31:44,359
This is the recording of
yesterday's program.

1118
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,892
Last night, you sat
listening to this song.

1119
01:31:51,104 --> 01:31:55,302
Outside the rain was
pelting down, you listened,

1120
01:31:57,477 --> 01:32:00,139
and soon you started
itching with excitement.

1121
01:32:01,148 --> 01:32:05,107
There's something you always
do when you hear this song.

1122
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:11,624
You heard a TV program playing
in the room of your landlady,

1123
01:32:11,725 --> 01:32:16,628
you left the lights on in your
own room and crept outside.

1124
01:32:17,464 --> 01:32:23,232
And in the pitch dark,
you wandered here and there.

1125
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:26,795
Who will it be today?

1126
01:32:27,941 --> 01:32:28,839
Right?

1127
01:32:30,877 --> 01:32:35,075
You hid in a reed field,
waiting for a woman to pass.

1128
01:32:35,315 --> 01:32:36,907
The rain drenching you.

1129
01:32:37,017 --> 01:32:39,645
But you find all this pleasurable.

1130
01:32:39,753 --> 01:32:41,243
Stimulating, right?

1131
01:32:41,888 --> 01:32:45,153
So yesterday you stuffed
this in that woman's body!

1132
01:32:47,594 --> 01:32:51,621
You remember how
many pieces it was?

1133
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:53,563
One piece,

1134
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:54,396
two...

1135
01:32:54,501 --> 01:32:56,298
- Three pieces...
- Shut up!

1136
01:32:56,403 --> 01:32:57,927
Four, five...

1137
01:32:58,038 --> 01:32:59,198
six, seven, eight...

1138
01:32:59,306 --> 01:33:00,796
Shut the fuck up!

1139
01:33:02,409 --> 01:33:06,869
Yong-gu!

1140
01:33:08,315 --> 01:33:11,045
I told you not to hit him.

1141
01:33:11,151 --> 01:33:14,678
Didn't I?

1142
01:33:15,155 --> 01:33:16,850
I warned you.

1143
01:33:16,957 --> 01:33:19,755
You know why
journalists snoop around here.

1144
01:33:20,193 --> 01:33:21,490
You stupid bastard.

1145
01:33:24,731 --> 01:33:29,225
Don't even think about coming
into the interrogation room again.

1146
01:33:43,216 --> 01:33:44,808
I'm going crazy.

1147
01:33:48,388 --> 01:33:51,221
No eyewitnesses,

1148
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:53,190
not one piece of evidence.

1149
01:33:54,695 --> 01:33:57,129
We need something, shit.

1150
01:33:57,931 --> 01:34:01,697
Shit, we don't need
any damn witnesses.

1151
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:03,633
Just a confession will do.

1152
01:34:04,371 --> 01:34:07,499
Just need to beat that
bastard to an inch of his life.

1153
01:34:10,444 --> 01:34:12,071
You've changed.

1154
01:34:14,681 --> 01:34:19,709
Try it and, you'll be disgraced.
Like with Kwang-ho.

1155
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:25,991
Retarded Kwang-ho...

1156
01:34:29,563 --> 01:34:32,054
I always wanted to ask you.

1157
01:34:32,632 --> 01:34:35,396
When you dragged
him up the mountain,

1158
01:34:35,502 --> 01:34:41,907
he talked about Hyang-sook's
death in so much detail.

1159
01:34:42,709 --> 01:34:43,573
So?

1160
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:49,146
Did you really not rehearse
that dialogue with him?

1161
01:34:49,249 --> 01:34:52,116
I told you I didn't!

1162
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:57,386
But how did he know the
way she was strangled...

1163
01:34:57,491 --> 01:34:58,719
That's my point!

1164
01:35:02,162 --> 01:35:05,256
The tape... Where's the tape
from the mountain?

1165
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:07,299
Miss Kwon? Gui-ok.

1166
01:35:08,268 --> 01:35:12,136
Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit.

1167
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,901
She looked completely dead.

1168
01:35:15,008 --> 01:35:16,942
Listen to how he speaks here.

1169
01:35:17,043 --> 01:35:21,946
Covered up Hyang-sook's head.

1170
01:35:22,048 --> 01:35:24,439
With what?
- Her panties.

1171
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:29,714
Her head was covered
with her panties.

1172
01:35:29,823 --> 01:35:32,724
He's talking like
it was someone else.

1173
01:35:32,826 --> 01:35:34,054
And then?

1174
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:39,155
He's describing what he saw.

1175
01:35:42,035 --> 01:35:43,696
Kwang-ho is the witness.

1176
01:35:56,016 --> 01:35:57,108
Where did Kwang-ho go?

1177
01:35:58,718 --> 01:36:00,208
Kwang-ho...

1178
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:02,886
No, no. We came for a drink.

1179
01:36:03,523 --> 01:36:05,218
Some meat, please.

1180
01:36:07,494 --> 01:36:09,325
What are you doing here?

1181
01:36:18,438 --> 01:36:19,871
Control yourself, huh?

1182
01:36:21,107 --> 01:36:23,598
He's not in his room.
I'll check outside.

1183
01:36:24,478 --> 01:36:26,241
Try the game arcade.

1184
01:36:28,582 --> 01:36:30,413
How long have you been here?

1185
01:36:31,351 --> 01:36:35,447
Have you seen Kwang-ho?

1186
01:36:45,966 --> 01:36:48,901
It is now 23 months since
the incident first surfaced.

1187
01:36:49,002 --> 01:36:52,335
Before interrogating
Detective Moon...

1188
01:36:53,173 --> 01:36:56,040
They should cut off
all detective's dicks!

1189
01:36:56,142 --> 01:36:57,871
Nah, it's not worth it.

1190
01:36:57,978 --> 01:37:00,845
They are stupid bastards.

1191
01:37:00,947 --> 01:37:01,777
Be quiet.

1192
01:37:14,728 --> 01:37:17,629
The trial of detective Moon,
suspected of police torture

1193
01:37:17,731 --> 01:37:21,827
and sexual assault,
opened today.

1194
01:37:42,689 --> 01:37:44,816
You fucked your professor,
didn't you, bitch!

1195
01:37:44,925 --> 01:37:47,826
Your parents pay good money...

1196
01:37:50,864 --> 01:37:51,796
Hey, Yong-gu!

1197
01:38:26,499 --> 01:38:28,228
Kwang-ho!

1198
01:38:29,235 --> 01:38:32,727
Kwang-ho!
Don't run away!

1199
01:38:32,839 --> 01:38:33,828
Hey, Kwang-ho!

1200
01:38:34,641 --> 01:38:37,303
Kwang-ho!

1201
01:38:44,117 --> 01:38:46,210
Kwang-ho!

1202
01:38:48,021 --> 01:38:48,919
I'm sorry...

1203
01:38:49,022 --> 01:38:50,216
What's wrong with you?

1204
01:38:50,323 --> 01:38:52,450
We're not here to catch you.

1205
01:38:52,559 --> 01:38:53,787
Come down.

1206
01:38:55,061 --> 01:38:57,529
You're gonna kill me?

1207
01:38:57,631 --> 01:39:01,362
We'll forget that any of
that happened.

1208
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:03,766
If a fight breaks out,
that can happen.

1209
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:06,202
It's okay,

1210
01:39:06,306 --> 01:39:08,001
just come down, huh?

1211
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:10,508
If I do, you'll kill me?

1212
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:11,838
I know it.

1213
01:39:11,945 --> 01:39:14,812
We won't kill you,
just come down.

1214
01:39:14,914 --> 01:39:18,281
Okay, just stay there for now.
We've something to ask you.

1215
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:21,320
You...

1216
01:39:21,421 --> 01:39:22,718
You remember Hyang-sook?

1217
01:39:22,822 --> 01:39:25,416
The girl that died.

1218
01:39:25,525 --> 01:39:28,323
Hyang-sook is pretty.

1219
01:39:29,262 --> 01:39:32,231
That's right. You used
to follow after her.

1220
01:39:32,332 --> 01:39:34,960
But that night,

1221
01:39:35,068 --> 01:39:39,198
when it rained,
you saw her killed, huh?

1222
01:39:39,906 --> 01:39:42,670
That? I told you already.

1223
01:39:42,776 --> 01:39:46,974
In the forest.
I told you already...

1224
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:50,982
You saw when Hyang-sook was
murdered, didn't you? Here?

1225
01:39:51,084 --> 01:39:53,416
Yeah, here.

1226
01:39:54,254 --> 01:39:57,246
The paddy next to
the train tracks.

1227
01:40:00,593 --> 01:40:01,992
That night,

1228
01:40:02,095 --> 01:40:05,155
did you see the killer's face?

1229
01:40:05,265 --> 01:40:07,927
- Yeah.
- Really?

1230
01:40:08,935 --> 01:40:10,596
Lightning, ka-rang!

1231
01:40:13,873 --> 01:40:17,104
I saw everything
from inside here.

1232
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:21,271
So you saw his face?

1233
01:40:21,381 --> 01:40:23,110
Three times.

1234
01:40:24,451 --> 01:40:27,318
Do you remember him in detail?

1235
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:29,553
He was handsome.

1236
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:32,817
More than me.

1237
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:40,596
Was this the face you saw?

1238
01:40:43,403 --> 01:40:44,665
Look at the picture.

1239
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:57,015
You know how hot
that fire was?

1240
01:40:57,117 --> 01:40:58,948
Look at the photo!

1241
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:01,645
It was so hot!

1242
01:41:01,755 --> 01:41:03,814
Snap out of it!

1243
01:41:04,257 --> 01:41:06,657
Here, look closely.

1244
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:09,320
Hot hot hot hot!

1245
01:41:09,429 --> 01:41:11,522
Look at the photo!

1246
01:41:11,631 --> 01:41:13,394
Hey. Kwang-ho.

1247
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,400
When I was young,

1248
01:41:15,502 --> 01:41:18,960
he threw me in the fire.
That man.

1249
01:41:19,072 --> 01:41:20,937
- Kwang-ho!
- You bastards!

1250
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,064
What the hell!

1251
01:41:22,175 --> 01:41:26,168
Please forgive him.

1252
01:41:26,246 --> 01:41:31,809
What are you students doing?

1253
01:41:31,918 --> 01:41:33,442
We're police!

1254
01:41:33,553 --> 01:41:35,521
Bullshit!
Then we're the F.B.I.!

1255
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:52,030
Hey, Kwang-ho!

1256
01:41:52,772 --> 01:41:55,036
We're looking for you.

1257
01:41:56,109 --> 01:41:56,905
Hey!

1258
01:41:57,811 --> 01:42:00,006
A train's coming!
Come here!

1259
01:42:06,486 --> 01:42:08,181
Out of the way, quick!

1260
01:42:09,589 --> 01:42:10,954
It's dangerous there.

1261
01:42:11,391 --> 01:42:13,859
Out of the way! You idiot!

1262
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:16,758
Stay away. Go...

1263
01:42:56,469 --> 01:42:59,996
It's okay for you to be here?
They'll be looking for you.

1264
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:37,665
Yes, yes.

1265
01:43:37,777 --> 01:43:41,474
Journalists tend
to be like that.

1266
01:43:41,948 --> 01:43:45,475
Sir, as I said last time...

1267
01:43:46,019 --> 01:43:47,452
Hello?

1268
01:43:47,754 --> 01:43:48,686
Hello?

1269
01:43:49,422 --> 01:43:51,652
Assholes!

1270
01:43:51,758 --> 01:43:53,783
High-ranking bastards...

1271
01:43:54,394 --> 01:43:56,225
- Chief!
- What?

1272
01:43:56,729 --> 01:44:00,358
It's Investigative Crimes.
They found semen.

1273
01:44:00,633 --> 01:44:01,657
They found what?

1274
01:44:01,768 --> 01:44:03,258
Take a look.

1275
01:44:03,369 --> 01:44:06,270
The semen was found
on the victim's clothing.

1276
01:44:06,372 --> 01:44:10,638
Maybe he masturbated
on the corpse,

1277
01:44:10,743 --> 01:44:12,608
and semen fell on her clothes.

1278
01:44:12,712 --> 01:44:14,043
Wait.

1279
01:44:14,147 --> 01:44:15,842
So...

1280
01:44:15,949 --> 01:44:19,077
...if the DNA in this semen

1281
01:44:19,185 --> 01:44:21,983
is confirmed to match
that of Park Hyun-gyu,

1282
01:44:22,088 --> 01:44:28,220
then the game's over, isn't it?

1283
01:44:28,328 --> 01:44:31,661
Yes, that would be quite
strong evidence.

1284
01:44:32,031 --> 01:44:36,832
The problem is, we don't have
the technology in Korea

1285
01:44:36,936 --> 01:44:39,063
to carry out such tests.

1286
01:44:39,372 --> 01:44:41,397
It must be sent to America.

1287
01:44:41,507 --> 01:44:43,600
There's no other way.

1288
01:44:44,844 --> 01:44:48,473
Once the test's complete,
the results will be released.

1289
01:44:48,581 --> 01:44:52,017
So we just have to wait for
the documents from America?

1290
01:44:52,118 --> 01:44:53,085
That's right.

1291
01:44:54,487 --> 01:44:57,752
You sent people to
watch over Park Hyun-gyu?

1292
01:44:57,857 --> 01:45:01,816
Yes! They're watching
him 24 hours a day.

1293
01:45:02,562 --> 01:45:04,723
Once the result
comes in from America,

1294
01:45:04,831 --> 01:45:08,289
wait until we get our
hands on that bastard.

1295
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:28,213
What's wrong with your leg?

1296
01:45:28,321 --> 01:45:29,515
Why?

1297
01:45:29,822 --> 01:45:30,948
Did you go to the hospital?

1298
01:45:31,057 --> 01:45:33,719
For this little scratch?
Come here.

1299
01:45:33,826 --> 01:45:36,260
It's okay.
I put on some medicine.

1300
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:43,162
- What is that?
- Oh, that night...

1301
01:45:43,269 --> 01:45:44,634
It keeps swelling.

1302
01:45:44,904 --> 01:45:46,701
Come on, let's go.

1303
01:45:46,806 --> 01:45:47,738
Just get in.

1304
01:45:48,808 --> 01:45:51,936
So, you have to amputate?

1305
01:45:52,045 --> 01:45:54,411
Should I explain it again?

1306
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:57,312
It was pierced, but why
cut off a healthy leg?

1307
01:45:57,417 --> 01:46:00,409
If you don't, he'll die.

1308
01:46:00,686 --> 01:46:04,178
Tetanus is a brutal thing.

1309
01:46:04,290 --> 01:46:07,316
For rusty nails, you need
to see a doctor fast.

1310
01:46:07,427 --> 01:46:09,895
Bunch of dim-witted boneheads.

1311
01:46:10,863 --> 01:46:15,425
Be grateful it's under the knee.

1312
01:46:16,769 --> 01:46:18,327
Crazy bastards.

1313
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:19,336
Let's go.

1314
01:46:22,875 --> 01:46:23,773
Are you family?

1315
01:46:23,876 --> 01:46:26,470
He doesn't have any,
but I'm like his brother...

1316
01:46:26,579 --> 01:46:28,376
Anyway, you came together, right?

1317
01:46:28,481 --> 01:46:32,508
The authorization for surgery.
Read it, then sign.

1318
01:46:50,503 --> 01:46:52,334
You fucker...

1319
01:47:07,553 --> 01:47:08,645
Hello, post office?

1320
01:47:09,689 --> 01:47:11,714
It's Suh Tae-yoon,
Investigative Crimes.

1321
01:47:13,226 --> 01:47:15,387
Have the documents
from America arrived?

1322
01:47:18,431 --> 01:47:19,989
Have you checked 100%?

1323
01:47:21,467 --> 01:47:24,459
I keep calling because
it's important!

1324
01:47:25,438 --> 01:47:30,034
Since it's so important, please
call as soon as it comes.

1325
01:47:33,746 --> 01:47:34,713
Hello?

1326
01:47:38,451 --> 01:47:39,440
Uh, now?

1327
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:43,245
Why'd you call me out?

1328
01:47:43,356 --> 01:47:46,018
Why?
Can't I do that sometimes?

1329
01:47:47,026 --> 01:47:48,994
Your face looks worn,

1330
01:47:49,095 --> 01:47:50,153
Are you sleeping well?

1331
01:47:52,665 --> 01:47:54,633
What kind of
detective sleeps well?

1332
01:47:57,036 --> 01:47:58,367
What's wrong with you?

1333
01:47:58,471 --> 01:48:00,962
Fishing? Damn free-riders.

1334
01:48:05,578 --> 01:48:07,637
Why'd you call out a busy man?

1335
01:48:12,385 --> 01:48:14,615
You look like a corpse.

1336
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:20,991
It may be no use asking,

1337
01:48:21,093 --> 01:48:22,617
but can you do anything else?

1338
01:48:24,931 --> 01:48:26,626
Can you quit your job?

1339
01:49:48,347 --> 01:49:49,441
Violent Crimes Dept!

1340
01:49:50,082 --> 01:49:51,049
Violent Crimes!

1341
01:49:51,651 --> 01:49:54,017
How many visits in one night?

1342
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:56,213
Is money that important?

1343
01:49:58,758 --> 01:50:01,852
Bo-kyung's grandmother
collapsed again. I have to go.

1344
01:50:02,395 --> 01:50:05,831
You deserve a medal.

1345
01:50:05,931 --> 01:50:08,229
Get one from
the Health Ministry.

1346
01:50:18,277 --> 01:50:19,437
Chief!

1347
01:50:19,545 --> 01:50:21,706
Park Hyun-gyu hasn't
come home for 2 hours.

1348
01:50:21,814 --> 01:50:25,147
It's only six stops from
there to his house.

1349
01:50:25,484 --> 01:50:27,475
So he must have gotten off.

1350
01:50:27,586 --> 01:50:30,111
Would a man under
investigation act so wild?

1351
01:50:30,222 --> 01:50:33,248
He's capable of it.

1352
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:37,728
- He's instinctively crazy.
- You seem like the crazy one!

1353
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:43,826
Once the DNA tests arrive,
he's through. Stop it.

1354
01:50:44,236 --> 01:50:46,761
I let him go...

1355
01:50:46,872 --> 01:50:49,602
Don't get so upset!

1356
01:52:30,743 --> 01:52:32,142
Citizens,

1357
01:52:32,244 --> 01:52:35,338
this is a civil defense drill.

1358
01:52:35,448 --> 01:52:42,354
A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses...

1359
01:53:54,393 --> 01:53:58,056
Will you make any special
investigation into this incident?

1360
01:54:13,512 --> 01:54:16,310
A razor wound in the breast...

1361
01:54:19,151 --> 01:54:20,379
What the hell?

1362
01:54:22,187 --> 01:54:24,519
Something is stuck
inside of the vagina.

1363
01:54:26,091 --> 01:54:29,583
Huh?
Looks like a ball point pen,

1364
01:54:30,062 --> 01:54:31,393
and a spoon.

1365
01:54:33,198 --> 01:54:34,187
Jesus...

1366
01:54:37,536 --> 01:54:40,130
Look inside, closely.

1367
01:54:47,646 --> 01:54:49,671
Wait, what's that?

1368
01:54:50,616 --> 01:54:51,674
An old band-aid.

1369
01:55:06,332 --> 01:55:08,527
What are you doing?

1370
01:55:10,336 --> 01:55:12,600
Why are you touching a corpse?

1371
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:38,924
What?

1372
01:55:42,468 --> 01:55:43,526
Get up, you bastard!

1373
01:55:51,276 --> 01:55:53,210
You fucker!

1374
01:55:56,949 --> 01:55:58,177
Get up, you fucker.

1375
01:56:02,955 --> 01:56:03,853
Are you human?

1376
01:56:16,969 --> 01:56:21,030
Nobody will care if I kill you.

1377
01:56:31,483 --> 01:56:32,643
Tell me!

1378
01:56:34,286 --> 01:56:35,844
Tell me you killed them!

1379
01:56:38,657 --> 01:56:39,885
Tell me!

1380
01:56:40,793 --> 01:56:43,626
You killed all those women!

1381
01:57:03,682 --> 01:57:05,445
Yeah.

1382
01:57:05,551 --> 01:57:09,078
I killed them.

1383
01:57:09,188 --> 01:57:10,815
I killed them all.

1384
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:17,025
That's what you want
to hear, right?

1385
01:57:18,397 --> 01:57:19,557
Right?

1386
01:57:20,999 --> 01:57:23,467
You feel better?

1387
01:57:27,773 --> 01:57:30,298
Inspector Suh!

1388
01:57:31,543 --> 01:57:33,636
The papers from America!

1389
01:57:34,413 --> 01:57:35,277
Read them!

1390
01:57:36,982 --> 01:57:38,313
You asshole.

1391
01:57:40,686 --> 01:57:41,482
You fucker!

1392
01:57:43,188 --> 01:57:44,348
You mocked us, didn't you!

1393
01:57:44,456 --> 01:57:46,117
You bastard!

1394
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:49,391
You mocked us!

1395
01:58:06,912 --> 01:58:07,742
What's wrong?

1396
01:58:40,212 --> 01:58:43,613
There's a mistake.

1397
01:58:52,524 --> 01:58:55,084
This document is a lie.
I don't need it.

1398
01:59:09,074 --> 01:59:11,406
What does it say, huh?

1399
01:59:19,685 --> 01:59:20,947
It really wasn't you?

1400
01:59:29,494 --> 01:59:30,688
Look in my eyes.

1401
02:00:02,494 --> 02:00:03,791
Look in my eyes!

1402
02:00:18,810 --> 02:00:20,368
Fuck, I don't know.

1403
02:00:27,886 --> 02:00:29,615
Do you get up each morning too?

1404
02:00:34,226 --> 02:00:35,158
Go!

1405
02:00:37,963 --> 02:00:39,897
Just go, fucker!

1406
02:00:43,802 --> 02:00:45,394
Bastard.

1407
02:01:54,973 --> 02:01:56,531
That's enough.

1408
02:02:37,282 --> 02:02:39,648
Chi-hyuk.

1409
02:02:39,751 --> 02:02:41,912
You played computer
games all night, right?

1410
02:02:43,455 --> 02:02:46,288
Did you or didn't you?

1411
02:02:51,096 --> 02:02:52,723
Look in my eyes, son.

1412
02:02:53,899 --> 02:02:55,389
Eyes all bloodshot.

1413
02:02:56,601 --> 02:02:58,262
Do you play well?

1414
02:02:58,370 --> 02:02:59,234
Yeah!

1415
02:02:59,538 --> 02:03:02,598
You don't study, might as
well be good at games.

1416
02:03:04,142 --> 02:03:08,203
If you won't study,
go get some exercise.

1417
02:03:08,313 --> 02:03:10,873
Sitting in front
of the computer...

1418
02:03:10,982 --> 02:03:12,506
I really didn't!

1419
02:03:12,784 --> 02:03:14,581
What do you mean you didn't?

1420
02:03:14,686 --> 02:03:16,813
Think you can fool my eyes?

1421
02:03:18,156 --> 02:03:20,852
He said he didn't.
Believe him.

1422
02:03:20,959 --> 02:03:27,228
No, two days ago Manager Oh
called my company.

1423
02:03:27,332 --> 02:03:31,598
He kept saying you can't do
this to people, it's not fair.

1424
02:03:32,070 --> 02:03:35,437
You can't believe him.

1425
02:03:36,108 --> 02:03:39,373
Did I do anything wrong?

1426
02:03:39,478 --> 02:03:43,847
I'm on the road now
with our product.

1427
02:03:45,517 --> 02:03:50,454
Sure, let's have dinner
with Manager Oh.

1428
02:03:51,223 --> 02:03:52,986
It's been a while.

1429
02:03:56,294 --> 02:03:58,956
Chul-yong!
Pull over a minute!

1430
02:05:37,262 --> 02:05:38,786
Is something in there?

1431
02:05:40,665 --> 02:05:42,098
Is anything in there?

1432
02:05:43,602 --> 02:05:44,967
No...

1433
02:05:46,304 --> 02:05:47,931
Then why are you looking?

1434
02:05:50,242 --> 02:05:51,903
I'm just looking.

1435
02:05:52,777 --> 02:05:54,711
That's so weird.

1436
02:05:56,448 --> 02:05:57,472
What is?

1437
02:05:59,317 --> 02:06:00,875
A while back,

1438
02:06:00,986 --> 02:06:05,116
a man was here
looking into that hole.

1439
02:06:08,927 --> 02:06:11,919
I asked him the same question.

1440
02:06:12,464 --> 02:06:14,489
Why he was looking there.

1441
02:06:14,599 --> 02:06:15,793
What did he say?

1442
02:06:17,102 --> 02:06:18,865
What was it?

1443
02:06:18,970 --> 02:06:20,631
Right...

1444
02:06:20,739 --> 02:06:25,005
He remembered doing
something here long ago,

1445
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:28,807
so he came back
to take a look.

1446
02:06:42,727 --> 02:06:44,558
Did you see his face?

1447
02:06:49,934 --> 02:06:51,401
What did he look like?

1448
02:06:53,238 --> 02:06:54,398
Well...

1449
02:06:56,374 --> 02:06:57,841
Kind of plain.

1450
02:07:00,345 --> 02:07:01,243
In what way?

1451
02:07:04,516 --> 02:07:05,778
Just...

1452
02:07:08,086 --> 02:07:09,849
ordinary.
