Hello, Hank.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,320
You're supposed
to be in Moscow.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,200
I took a detour...

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,400
Through your defense lab.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,480
Tell me that isn't
what I think it is.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,560
That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to
replicate my work.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,960
Even for this group,
that takes nerve.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,560
You were
instructed to go to Russia.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,840
I'm a scientist.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,560
Then act like one.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,160
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary
science ever developed.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,360
Help us put it to good use.

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,880
I let you turn me
into your errand boy,

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,880
and now you try to
steal my research?

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,280
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,880
Ah...

20

(GROANS)
Easy, Hank.

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,960
You mention my wife again

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,080
and I'll show you ferocity.

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,720
Don't look at me. You said it.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,160
I formally
tender my resignation.

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,520
We don't accept it. Formally.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,880
Hank,

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,720
we need you.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,120
The Pym Particle is a miracle.
Please.

29

Don't let your past
determine the future.

get that formula.

32

We shouldn't let him
leave the building.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,000
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to
go to war with him?

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,640
Yes.

35
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,720

haven't come close
to replicating his work.

He just kicked
your ass, full-size.

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,440
You really want to
find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,120
I've known Hank
Pym for a long time.

39
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,680
He's no security risk.

Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce
a very special guest.

205
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,440
This company's
founder and my mentor,

206
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Dr. Hank Pym.

207
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,720
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

208
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,000
I immediately started
researching a particle

209
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,840
that could change
the distance between atoms,

210
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,720
while increasing
density and strength.

211
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,320
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

212
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,520
beneath
the dust and cobwebs of

213
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
Hank's research,
I couldn't tell you.

214
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
But just imagine,

215
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,040
a soldier
the size of an insect.

That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

221
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,160
Silly, I know.

222
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,720

Tales to astonish!

224
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,320
Trumped-up BS to
scare the USSR.

225
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,240
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

226
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,800
every single time I asked you,

227
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,920
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

228
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
Just a tall tale.

229
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,760
Right.

230
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,920
Because how could anything
so miraculous
possibly be real?

231
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,960
Well,
I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

232
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,880
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

233
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,960
I thought,
could it be possible
to shrink a person?

234
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,440
Could that be done?

235
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,280
Well,
it's not a legend anymore.

I tell you this as a friend,

and as the first
love of my life.

340
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,360
Your fiance is an asshat.

341

He's not an asshat.

342
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,000
Hey, watch your language.
Okay?

343

Come on!
You could marry
anyone you want,

347
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,360

get engaged to a cop?

348
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,040
At least he's not a crook.

351
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,720
I wanna provide.

352
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,320
I had a lot of
time to think about it
and I love her.

353
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,440

354
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,840
I've missed so much time
and I wanna be

356
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,960

357
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,960
get a job, pay child support.

358

You know,
I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

And today,
during my morning meditation,

381
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,720
an interesting
thought occurred to me,

382
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,280
and I think it
might apply to you, too.

what we had to do,

to do it, didn't he?

But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

394

I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

692
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,040
I did. She's great.

We don't.
We can do this ourselves.

I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

696
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,720
and then Hope
has you arrested.

697
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,840
Okay, we can try
this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

698
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,520
She's a little bit anxious.

699
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,560
It has to do with this job,

700
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,120
which, judging by the fact
that you're
sitting opposite me,

701
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,480
I take it that
you're interested in.

how you managed to get
past my security system.

was particularly clever.

robbed Vista Corp.

"Burgled" Vista Corp.

713
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,080

the most advanced
in the business.

00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,960
Yeah, thanks.

You know what? I'm okay.

How do you make them do that?

721
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,960
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

They build, farm,
they cooperate
with each other.

723
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,880
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

to stimulate their

and see everything.

absolutely nothing.

raise your hand, Scott.

733
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,320
Sorry,
I just have one question.

734
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,520
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

735

and can I go back to jail now?

Come with me.

737
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,360
40 years ago,
I created a formula

738
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,480
that altered atomic
relative distance.

739
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,760
SCOTT: Huh?

740
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,080
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

741
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,840
That's what powers the suit.

742
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,600
That's why it works.

743
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840

But it was dangerous.

746
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,600
It was too dangerous.

747
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
So I hid it from the world.

748
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,600
And that's when
I switched gears
and I started my own company.

749

Pym Tech.

750
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,800
Yes.

751
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,560
I took on a young protege
called Darren Cross.

752
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,880
SCOTT: Darren Cross.

753
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,040
He's a big deal.

754
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,560
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

755
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,000
I thought I saw
something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

756
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,400
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

757
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,040
he began to suspect
that I wasn't
telling him everything.

758
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,800
He heard rumors about
what was called
the Pym Particle,

759
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,040
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

760
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,640
But I wouldn't help him.

761
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,560
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out
of my own company.

762
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,160
How could he do that?

763
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,040
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

764
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,440
She was the deciding vote.

765
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,040
But she came back to me

766
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,480
when she saw how close
Cross was to
cracking my formula.

767

The process is
highly volatile.

the brain's chemistry.

Darren realizes this,

771

and, you know, he's not
the most stable
guy to begin with.

772

So, what do you want from me?

773

that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

the first time these guys

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,040
have tried to get their hands
on game-changing weaponry.

796
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,200
That's Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of
Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

797
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,640
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

798
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,040
He always wanted my tech.

799
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,480
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

800
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,640
and destroy all the data,

Darren Cross is
gonna unleash chaos
upon the world.

802

first move should be
calling the Avengers.

(HANK SCOFFS)

804
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,240
I spent half my life

00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,520
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

806
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,360
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

807
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,800
This is not some
cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

808
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,440
This could change
the texture of reality.

809
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,320
Besides,
they're probably too busy

810
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
dropping cities
out of the sky.

811
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,000
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

812
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,760
Scott, they are ants.

813
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,800
Ants,
they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

814
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,240
Somebody that could
infiltrate a place

815
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,720

prevent infiltration.

I'm a good thief,

Cross is capable of.

I know how Cross thinks.

I need you to be the Ant-Man.

In the right hands,

857
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,880
the relationship
between man and suit
is symbiotic.

858
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,720
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

859
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,600
You need to be skillful,
agile,
and above all,

860
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,920
you need to be fast.

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,920
You should be able
to shrink and grow

on a dime.

So your size
always suits your needs.

Now dive through the keyhole,

When you're small,
energy's compressed,

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,880
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

You punch too hard,
you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

It's bad enough
you won't tell
me how she died.

00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,800
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

You know,
I think this regulator
is holding me back.

Do not screw
with the regulator.

893

If that
regulator is compromised,

894
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,200
you would go subatomic.

895
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,680
What does that mean?

896
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,920
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

897
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,440
What does that mean?

898
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,720
It means that you
would enter a reality

899
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,040
where all concepts
of time and space

900
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,160
become irrelevant

You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see
him for two weeks.

He was in grief.

Yeah,
so was I, and I was seven.

And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

He just sent me off

just maybe we
might have a chance
of making peace.

But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

He trusts you.

it's why I'm in the suit

You know,
I didn't know
you had a daughter

when I called the cops on you.

1005

What's her name?

1006

Cassie.

1007
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,360
It's a pretty name.

1008

You have to clear
your mind, Scott.

1009

You have to make
your thoughts precise.

1010
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,600
That's how it works.

1011
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,200
Think about Cassie.

1012
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,160
About how badly
you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

1013
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,720
Open your eyes

1014
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,120
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

1015
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,200
That's good!

1016
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,000
Your mother convinced me

1017
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:57,160
to let her join
me on my missions.

1018
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,840
They called her the Wasp.

1019
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,160
She was born to it.

1020
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,720
And there's not
a day that goes by

1021
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,640
that I don't
regret having said yes.

1022
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,800
It was 1987.

1023
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:21,040
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

1024
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,560
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

1027
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,160
<i>I knew I had to shrink between</i>
<i>the molecules to</i>
<i>disarm the missile.</i>

1028

Janet! No!

1032

She turned off her regulator

1033
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,600
and went subatomic

1034
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,120
to deactivate the bomb.

1035
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,760
And she was gone.

1036
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,320
Your mom died a hero.

1037
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,360
And I spent the next 10 years

1038

trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

1039

You were trying
to bring her back.

1040
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,720
But all I learned
was we know nothing.

1041
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,520
It's not your fault.

1042
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,360
She made her choice.

1043
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:09,560
(VOICE BREAKING)
But why didn't you
tell me that sooner?

1044
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,600
I was trying to protect you.

1045
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,040
I lost your mother.

1046
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,960
I didn't mean
to lose you, too.

1047
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,160
I'm sorry.

1048

Appreciate it.
So, who the hell are you?

1106
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,600
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

1107
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,400
Just for a few days.
I'm gonna return it.

1108
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,120
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

1109
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,600
I know exactly how that is.

1110
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,560
Located the breach.

1111
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,800
Bringing him in.
Sorry about this!

1112
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,120
What the hell are you doing?

1113
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,280
FALCON:
Breach is an adult male,

1114
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,720
who has some sort
of shrinking tech.

1115
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,120
SCOTT: Sorry!

1116
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,720
Look, I'm sorry about this.
Sorry.

1117
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,520
That's enough!

01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,240
Ant-thony! A little help!

1120
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,960
I've lost visual.

He's inside my pack!

1123
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,600
Sorry!

1124
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,240
You seem like
a really great guy.

(GRUNTING)

1126
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,400
It's really important to me
that Cap never
finds out about this.

1127
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,160
That was
completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

1128
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,120
You jeopardized everything!

1129
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,680
You got it.

1130
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,640
Well done.

1131
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,720
SCOTT: Wait a minute.

1132
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,200
Did you just compliment me?

1133
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,440
He did, didn't he?

1134
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:08,720
Kind of sounded like he did.

1135

(BEEPING SOFTLY)

(SCOFFS)

1138
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:17,280
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought
an Avenger and didn't die?

1139
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,800
Let us not dwell on the past.

1140
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,040
We gotta finish our planning.

1141
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,040
HOPE: Don't mind him.

1142
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,600
You did good.

1143
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,720
Darren.

1144
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,360
How the hell did
you get in here?

1145
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,880
You left
the front door open, Hank.

1146
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,240
It's official.

1147
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,400
You're old.

1148
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,200
The plans.

1149
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,200
He will kill him.

1150
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,120
Well, to what do I
owe this pleasure?

1151
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,640
I have good news.

1152
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,960
Really?

1153
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,760
What's that?

1154
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:08,000
Pym Tech,
the company you created,

1155
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,960
is about to
become one of the most

1156
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,920
profitable
operations in the world.

1157
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,760
We're anticipating
$15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

1158
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,520
You're welcome.

1159
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,320
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

1160
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,960
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

1161
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,800
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1162
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,200
I'll be there.

1163
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,640
What did you see in me?

1164
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,280
I don't know what you mean.

1165
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,760
All those years ago,
you picked me.

1166
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,360
What did you see?

1167
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,280
I saw myself.

1168
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,280
Then why did you push me away?

1169
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,200
Because I saw
too much of myself.

1170

HOPE: <i>He knows.</i>
<i>He's baiting you.</i>

1171
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,240
We have to call it off.

1172
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:30,520
We're all taking risks.

1173
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,920
What if he saw me here?

1174
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,320
He didn't. There's no way.

1175
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,480
How do you know that?

01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,560

1178
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,440
Hope, where are you right now?

1179
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,240
I'm at home. Why?

1180
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,080
<i>I just saw Hank.</i>

1181
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,000
<i>I still get nothing</i>
<i>but contempt from him.</i>

1182
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:56,600
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

1183
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,200
<i>We need to start</i>
<i>everyone working</i>
<i>around the clock.</i>

1184

<i>Get the assembly</i>
<i>line up and running.</i>

1185
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,440
<i>And I'm tripling security.</i>

1186
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,520
Full sensors at all entrances

1187
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:08,000
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1188
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,720
Great. Good idea.

1189
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:14,120
<i>Thank you, Hope.</i>
<i>I'm so lucky to</i>
<i>have you on my team.</i>

1190
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,040
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind,
and he's onto you.

1191
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,080
But he is not onto you.

1192
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,480
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

1193
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,320
and closing exterior vents.

1194
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,360
How are we gonna
get Scott inside?

The water main.

1196
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,440
You can't add
security to a water main.

1197
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,800
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

1198
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,120
that's how I get in.

1199
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,400
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

1200
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,800
to change the water pressure.

1201
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:44,240
Hank and I will
be beside Cross.

1202
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,640
How are we
supposed to do that?

1203
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,240
So we expand our team.

1204
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,800
What do we need?

1205
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,560
A fake security
guard on the inside

1206
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,320
to de-pressurize
the water system,

1207
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,200
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

1208
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,720
and kill the laser grid,

1209
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,120
and a getaway guy.

1210
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:02,160
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three wombats.
No way.

the coffee, ma'am.

Because we just robbed you.

for stealing
a smoothie machine, right?

1215
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,320

01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,000
Are you sure they
can handle this?

1217
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,520
Oh, we can handle it.
We're professionals.

1218

You'll forgive us if we're not
instilled with confidence.

1219
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,960
Well,
hey, everybody just kick back
and relax a little bit, man.

1220
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,360
We know our business.

1221
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,800
We broke into this
spooky-ass house,
didn't we?

1222
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,320
I let you.

1223
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,680
Well, one could say
that I let you let me.

1224
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,360
Look, it's okay.
They can handle this.

1225
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,040
Yeah, we can handle it.

He's in the system.

I'm in the system?

1228

You're in the system.

Yeah, we're doomed.

Now, look,
this is gonna get weird,
all right?

1238
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,960
It's pretty freaky,
but it's safe.

1239

There's no
reason to be scared.

1240

Oh, no, no.
Daddy don't get scared.

1241
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,960
Really?
Yeah.

That's witchcraft.

Wow, that's amazing.

That's like some

That's some kind of wizardry.

Look at your shoulder.

and his only daughter
in the process.

1739
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,760
<i>But you know me, I'm more</i>
<i>like a Neo-Cubist</i>
<i>kind of guy, right?</i>

1740
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,520
<i>But there was this one Rothko</i>
<i>that was sublime, bro!</i>
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1741
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:19,640
Luis.

1742
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,760
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1743
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,840
You know,
I just get excited and stuff.

1744
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,840
<i>But anyway, Ignacio tells me,</i>

1745
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,720
<i>"Yo, I met this</i>
<i>crazy-fine writer chick</i>

1746
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,560
<i>"at the Spot last night.</i>
<i>Like fine-fine.</i>

1747
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:29,760
<i>"Like crazy-stupid fine."</i>
<i>And he</i>

1748
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,000
<i>"goes up to</i>
<i>the bartender and goes,</i>

1749
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:32,800
<i>"Look at the girl I'm with.</i>
<i>You know what I'm sayin'?</i>

1750
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,160
<i>"She's</i>
<i>crazy-stupid fine, right?"</i>

1751
01:46:34,240 --> 01:46:36,840
<i>The bartender's all like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."</i>

1752
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:38,840
<i>So this writer</i>
<i>chick tells Ignacio,</i>

1753
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:41,720
<i>"Yo, I'm like a boss</i>
<i>in the world of</i>
<i>guerrilla journalism,</i>

1754
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:43,520
<i>"and I got mad connects</i>
<i>with the peeps</i>
<i>behind the curtains,</i>

1755
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,600
<i>"you know what I'm saying?"</i>

1756
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:46,200
<i>Ignacio's like, "For real?"</i>

1757
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:47,640
<i>And she's like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, you know what,</i>

1758
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,200
<i>I can't tell you</i>
<i>who my contact is,</i>

1759
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:50,720
<i>"because he works</i>
<i>with the Avengers."</i>

1760
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,040
Oh, no.

1761
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:54,560
Yeah, and this dude sounds
like a badass, man.

1762
01:46:54,640 --> 01:46:55,800
Like,
he comes up to her and says,

1763
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:57,880
<i>"Yo, I'm looking for this dude</i>
<i>who's new on the scene,</i>

1764
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,120
<i>"who's flashing</i>
<i>his fresh tack,</i>

1765
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,720
<i>"who's got,</i>
<i>like, bomb moves, right?</i>
<i>Who you got?"</i>

1766
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,360
<i>And she's like,</i>
<i>"Well, we got everything</i>

1767
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:04,960
<i>nowadays.</i>
<i>We got a guy who jumps.</i>

1768
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,120
<i>"We got a guy who swings,</i>
<i>we got a guy who</i>
<i>crawls up the walls.</i>

1769
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:08,880
<i>"You gotta be more specific."</i>

1770
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,840
<i>And he's like,</i>
<i>"I'm looking for</i>
<i>a guy that shrinks."</i>

1771
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,560
And I'm, like, "Damn!"
I got all nervous

1772
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:14,360
'cause I'd keep mad
secrets for you, bro.

1773
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:15,480
So I asked Ignacio,

1774
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,560
<i>"Did the badass tell</i>
<i>the stupid-fine writer chick</i>

1775
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,880
"to tell you to tell me,
because I'm
tight with Ant-Man,

1776
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,200
"that he's looking for him?"

1777
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:24,440
And? What'd he say?

1778
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,160
He said, "Yes."

1779
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:26,520
There's something
I want to show you.

1780
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:31,960
I realized you
can't destroy power.

1781
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:37,600
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

1782
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:46,480
This is an advanced prototype

1783
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:49,440
that your mother and I
worked on together.

1784
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,480
She never got to use it.

1785
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:58,520
But now I
realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

1786
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:07,680
Maybe it's time
we finished it.

1787
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,800
It's about damn time.

1788
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:18,480
FALCON: <i>Hey, Cap!</i>

1789
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:35,200
This would have
been a lot easier
a week ago.

1790
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,200
If we call Tony...
He won't believe us.

1791
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:38,280
Even if he did...

1792
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:40,040
Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

1793
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,160
We're on our own.

1794
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:45,880
Maybe not.

1795
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:49,560
I know a guy.
