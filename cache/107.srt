1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,860
Did something happen on Friday?

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,500
I think Jonas was with Ingrid.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,060
Why are you lying to me?
-I'm not lying!

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,160
Were you with Jonas last Friday?
Just answer me!

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,520
Last Friday? Yeah.
Yeah I was with Jonas.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,680
Eva, this is Iben. My girlfriend.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,300
I'll meet William again soon.
There really can be something between us.

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,780
Ingrid's brother deals.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,780
I trust you 100%.

10
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,540
First there's Ring Lord
instead of Lord of the Rings.

11
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,200
Then we have The Lion King.
Taking Lion literally, you can have sex in the woods.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,400
I won't!

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,420
Or instead of the Hunger Games,
we'll say the Thirst Games.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,640
The Thirst Games!

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,500
Because we drink. And we
don't drink Pepsi Max, if you know what I mean.

16
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,520
No? It's about
Smirnoff Light here.

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,720
Did you know Diet Coke won in
the Pepsi Max versus Diet Coke test?

18
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,420
So Pepsi Max really
isn't that great. It isn't!

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,300
No!

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,060
What are you doing on your plate, Vilde?

21
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,900
I'm just sorting my salad.

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,540
I don't think you have to sort it anymore.

23
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,680
When should we talk
about what happeend at the Halloween party?

24
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,740
That William and Sara hooked up.
-Who are they?

25
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,020
Were you upset?

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,760
No, dear god. It was a hook up party. It was completely
normal to hook up at the party. Everyone hooked up with each other.

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,280
Penetrator Henrik hooked up with Frida from 1STE.

28
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,940
Borkis hooked up with Elise from 1STB.

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,180
Chris hooked up with someone.
And then there's William and Sara.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,720
Chris, who did you hook up with?
No, not this Chris. Penetrator Chris.

31
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,920
Who did he hook up with?

32
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,620
I don't know. I just
heard he hooked up with someone.

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,000
Hello.
-Hi.

34
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,960
What are you doing today?
-Thought I'd go skate.

35
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,780
Can I come? And watch?

36
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,120
Yeah.. When did you get into that?

37
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,800
I feel like being with you.

38
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,600
But I have to go now.
We'll talk later.

39
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,620
Love you!
-Yeah, you too.

40
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,460
Question.

41
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,160
Is Isak available?

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,560
Yeah. Why?

43
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,060
I felt there was some
 electric chemistry going on here.

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,060
Some really hot vibes between us.

45
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,200
Seriously.

46
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,460
I see it's going
better with you and Jonas.

47
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,600
Yes.

48
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,380
You don't want to say why?

49
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,500
No, we just talked some stuff out.

50
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,080
I fucked up badly.
-What?

51
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,720
What did you do?

52
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,220
Isak.

53
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,040
If I tell you this, you have
to promise not to say anything to Jonas.

54
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,340
Okay, I promise.

55
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,560
Seriously.

56
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,000
Otherwise you could
ruin our relationship.

57
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,140
I'm not gonna tell anyone, okay?
You can trust me.

58
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,120
What did you do?

59
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,240
You know how I thought
there was something between Ingrid and Jonas?

60
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,540
Hm-hm.

61
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,460
So I asked Ingrid if they
had been together.

62
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,320
And they had been.

63
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,620
Seriously?

64
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,840
But there was a reason for it. It was..

65
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,700
But Ingrid didn't tell me that.

66
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,480
So I was really pissed. And sad.

67
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,140
I hooked up with Chris.

68
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,340
You hooked up with Chris?!

69
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,340
The girl who keeps eye fucking me?

70
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,320
No, no!

71
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,300
Chris from the third year. Christoffer.

72
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,520
So you hooked up with a third year?

73
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,320
Fuck! It's really-

74
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,620
It was just hooking up, right? 
Nothing more happened?

75
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,920
No, no.

76
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,840
It would've been worse
if it wasn't just hooking up.

77
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,920
If it had meant something to you.
But you were just angry.

78
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,780
Yeah..

79
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,560
It feels shit not
to say it to Jonas.

80
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,020
Honestly, Eva..

81
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:26,280
If I had a girl who had hooked up
with someone else, I wouldn't have wanted to know.

82
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:33,060
Things like that fuck up a relationship. 
You don't have to do it if it meant nothing.

83
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,520
Also, it seems like you're more in love with
 him now than you were before, right? Maybe it was a good thing?

84
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,200
It was just a little hook up, right?

85
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:56,020
It'll be okay, but make sure no one knows.
That it won't come from someone else.

86
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,020
Especially from Chris, right?

87
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,920
It'll be okay.

88
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,520
Thanks.

89
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,340
For what?

90
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,920
You know.

91
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,760
Vilde!

92
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,640
Hi!

93
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,520
I have to ask you something.

94
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,840
Yesterday you said Chris
hooked up with someone at the Halloween party.

95
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,100
What do you know about it?

96
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,420
I just heard he
hooked up with someone.

97
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,320
Okay.. Who said that?

98
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,440
Or was it Robin who hooked up with someone?
-Robin?

99
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,840
Now that I think about
it, it was Robin. Chris has a girlfriend.

100
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,580
Yeah, okay.

101
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,340
Do you like him?

102
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,160
Huh? No, no!

103
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,140
Think of how perfect it would be if I'm 
together with William, and you're with Chris.

104
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,480
Vilde, seriously?!

105
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,120
It was just a suggestion..

106
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,500
You can't walk around in that
sweater thinking you'll be together with William.

107
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,520
Come here.

108
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,080
You see that girl over there?

109
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,540
She has slept with William.

110
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,440
See her over there?

111
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,840
She has also slept with William.
There comes another one.

112
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,900
There, and up there.

113
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,340
You can't know that all those girls slept
with William! There's a lot of guys on their bus.

114
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,080
Vilde, it's marked on the sweater.

115
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,880
The one you've slept
with is marked in red.

116
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,620
You're walking around like some
 living trophy now. You have to forget William!

117
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,100
Give him back the sweater,
and take back your integrity!

118
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,420
He's the loser, not you.

119
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,960
I know you should think, that if a guy doesn't like you 
it's not you there's something wrong with. It's him.

120
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,040
But how does one think like that?

121
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,100
I keep thinking it's
me there's something wrong with.

122
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,420
Hi.
Hello.

123
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,800
What are you doing here?

124
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,580
What do you mean by that?

125
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,680
Hi.

126
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,300
Hello.
-Are you okay?

127
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,340
Yeah, I'm fine. What about you?
-Good. I was reading.

128
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,960
Yeah, what?

129
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,280
Elle.

130
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
Are you gonna get that, or?

131
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,800
Yeah!

132
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,580
Hallo?

133
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,340
You're such a stalker!

134
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,020
Hi, mom! I can't talk
right now. Someone's visiting.

135
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,840
Mom?! What kind of
sick game are you playing?

136
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,640
I'll call you afterwards, okay?

137
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,840
Okay, my girl! We'll call afterwards.

138
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,600
Okay, bye!
-Wait, one more thing.

139
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,780
Have you done your homework?
-Bye!

140
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,240
Was that your mom?
-Yeah!

141
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,760
"Someone's visiting"?!

142
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,240
<i>[It's REALLY important that you shut up
about what happened on Halloween, okay?]</i>

143
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,260
Have you still not told her we're together?

144
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:36,140
You know what? You had the chance to meet my
mom but you chose to smoke marijuana with Ingrid's brother.

145
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,300
What?

146
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,580
It's sweet that you call it marijuana.

147
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,580
<i>[I'll keep my mouth shut. No worries.]</i>

148
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,560
What's sweet about it? That's what it's called.

149
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah.

150
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,620
But..
-But?

151
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,900
Only old people say it.

152
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,100
Old people?! I'm a little
older than you. Little smarter.

153
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,680
What do you say about drugs?

154
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Drugs..

155
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,040
I don't know. We just
call it greens or something.

156
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,000
But it's the same.
And it's not good for you.

157
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,800
You're really far away now. Do you see me?

158
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,240
I'm perfectly fine.

159
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,800
Then you're an alcoholic.
You've tried drinking alcohol.

160
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,680
You can't compare those!
-That's what you're saying!

161
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,020
Okay, great. So I'm a junkie
for trying it sometimes. -Sometimes?!

162
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,060
How many times?
-I don't know.

163
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,600
Are you awake all night?
-No.

164
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,200
Can't you stop for my sake?

165
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,380
I can do everything for your sake.

166
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,440
Yeah?
-Yeah.

167
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,400
You can't buy pink uggs!
-Uggs in general.

168
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,600
Why not?
-They're super comfortable, though.

169
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,140
They look insanely ugly.

170
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,540
I've decided on what
I'm going to say to William.

171
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,960
Say?

172
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,900
What are you talking about?
-My integrity.

173
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,000
You don't have any. Next subject.

174
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,520
What are you gonna say?

175
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,360
I will say that I will not be
treated like this.

176
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:41,900
Huh?

177
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,340
And then, I'll return the sweater.

178
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,080
You can't do that.
-Why not?

179
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,880
We're finally in with the Penetrator guys,
and now you're going to fuck everything up?

180
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,000
Says you, who ruined things for
all first years the first time we were invited to a party.

181
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,900
Sana, it's good that Vilde will explain
to William that she will not be treated like crap.

182
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,540
She can't tell him! It won't work.
It's better to be completely cool.

183
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,280
It's possible to be cool and to speak up.

184
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,100
There he is.

185
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,200
You're going to say it now?!

186
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,260
Yes.

187
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,940
He's with his friends.
-I don't give a shit who he's with!

188
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,560
Hi.
-Hi?

189
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,960
If you think I would walk around like
some living trophy, you're terribly wrong.

190
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,660
Don't play dumb!
You know what I mean.

191
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,300
What's your name again?

192
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,360
Vilde.

193
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
Okay, Vilde. Take a deep breath.

194
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,160
I think there's a
small miscommunication here.

195
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,940
I'm sure it's my fault.

196
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,880
If you think I look
at you look some trophy, you're wrong.

197
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,840
Because you're not good enough.

198
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,760
What an awesome guy you are!

199
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,820
Who are you?

200
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:26,240
What happened that made
you have such a large inferiority complex..

201
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,140
.. that you have to piss on the feelings of
a first year girl for you to feel cool?

202
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,340
Were you never validated as a child, or?

203
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,280
Did mommy never compliment your drawings?

204
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,480
Or did daddy never come to
any of your graduations?

205
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,820
You didn't have hair on your
dick in 7th grade and you were bullied for it?

206
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,200
Anyway, you have to seriously
get over it and start behaving like a human.

207
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,200
Stop walking around like a fucking cliche.

208
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,280
I have to go to Norwegian.

209
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,220
No..
-I have to!

210
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,220
But seriously, I really have to go.
I've been late way too many times.

211
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,820
We'll talk!

212
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,300
Fucking hell, you
were so awesome yesterday.

213
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,160
Yeah, you were legendary.

214
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,100
Are you doing okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Completely over William.

215
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,480
Good.

216
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,320
Anyway, nobody cares about what happened. Everyone's
thinking about that rumor that's going around about Chris.

217
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,740
What rumor about Chris?

218
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,260
Chris hooked up with someone  at the Halloween party, 
and his girl found out. She went psycho!

219
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,300
But you said it wasn't Chris!

220
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,100
Chris hooked up with
someone at the party. I saw it.

221
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,640
You saw it?

222
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,580
On the staircase.
-Staircase?!

223
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,440
You fucking whore!
