1
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:17,957
Sir.

2
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,167
General.

3
00:03:30,332 --> 00:03:31,074
Sir.

4
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:47,775
Lean and hungry.

5
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:52,220
Still nothing?

6
00:03:52,894 --> 00:03:54,159
Not a sign.

7
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:55,432
How long has he been gone?

8
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:56,972
Nearly two hours.

9
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:01,186
Will they fight, sir?

10
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,217
We shall know soon enough.

11
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:04,232
Soldier,

12
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:06,186
I ordered you to move
those catapults forward.

13
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:07,881
They are out of range.
Range is good.

14
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:12,323
The danger to the cavalry...
Is acceptable.

15
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:13,454
Agreed?

16
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:24,265
They say no.

17
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,307
People should know when
they are conquered.

18
00:05:03,313 --> 00:05:04,492
Would you Quintus?

19
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:07,047
Would I?

20
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:25,557
Strength and honor.
Strength and honor.

21
00:05:32,383 --> 00:05:33,622
At my signal...

22
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:35,755
unleash hell.

23
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,710
Load the catapults.

24
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:02,577
Infantry form up for advance.

25
00:06:04,082 --> 00:06:05,144
Archers ready.

26
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:06,500
Archers!

27
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:08,085
Nock!
Nock!

28
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:32,937
Fratres!

29
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:35,780
Maximus!
Maximus!

30
00:06:36,614 --> 00:06:37,801
Three weeks from now,

31
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,874
I will be harvesting my crops.

32
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:42,265
Imagine where you will be,

33
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,229
and it will be so.

34
00:06:45,957 --> 00:06:47,186
Hold the line!

35
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:48,760
Stay with me!

36
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,268
If you find yourself alone,

37
00:06:52,254 --> 00:06:54,892
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face,

38
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:57,861
do not be troubled.

39
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:00,867
For you are in Elysium,

40
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:03,204
and you are already dead!

41
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:06,080
Brothers,

42
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:09,619
what we do in life,

43
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:12,733
echoes in eternity.

44
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:22,359
Pull!

45
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:39,941
Cohorts ready sir!

46
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:51,918
Archers!

47
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:53,314
Ignite!

48
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:54,647
Ignite!

49
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:55,631
Ignite!

50
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,012
Archers!

51
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:04,386
Draw!

52
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,909
Loose!

53
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:40,392
Alright men, ready!

54
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:47,811
Hold the line!

55
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,347
Loose!

56
00:08:59,066 --> 00:08:59,879
Reload!

57
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:06,944
Hold the line!

58
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:08,161
Draw!

59
00:09:08,443 --> 00:09:09,748
Loose!

60
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:14,287
Stay with me!

61
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:20,858
Stay with me!

62
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,186
Roma Victor!

63
00:13:09,757 --> 00:13:11,303
Do you think he is really dying?

64
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:14,725
He is been dying for 10 years.

65
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,836
If he were not really dying,
he would not have sent for us.

66
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,250
Maybe he just misses us.

67
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:22,836
And the senators?

68
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:25,500
He would not have summoned them if...
Peace, Commodus.

69
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:26,966
After two weeks on the road,

70
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:29,076
your incessant scheming
is hurting my head.

71
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:38,556
He is made his decision.

72
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:40,555
He is going to announce it.

73
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,563
He will name me.

74
00:13:49,046 --> 00:13:50,421
The first thing I shall do...

75
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:52,671
when...

76
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:57,925
Is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

77
00:13:58,889 --> 00:13:59,800
For now,

78
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:01,753
the first thing I shall do,

79
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:03,878
is have a hot bath.

80
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:06,474
Your Highness?

81
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:12,567
We seem to be almost there, sir.

82
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,306
Sire.

83
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:21,470
Where is the Emperor?

84
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:22,516
He is at the front sire.

85
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:24,608
They ave been gone for 19 days.

86
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:27,084
The wounded are still coming in.

87
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:28,628
My horse.

88
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:30,316
My lord.

89
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:35,371
Kiss?

90
00:15:11,503 --> 00:15:12,983
You have proved your valor...

91
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,823
yet again Maximus.

92
00:15:17,176 --> 00:15:18,239
Let us hope,

93
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:19,886
for the last time.

94
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:22,045
There is no one left to fight sire.

95
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,600
There is always someone left to fight.

96
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:26,622
How can I reward,

97
00:15:26,747 --> 00:15:28,240
Rome's greatest general?

98
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:34,955
Let me go home.

99
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:38,932
Home.

100
00:15:57,883 --> 00:15:59,195
They honor you, Caesar.

101
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:00,781
It's for you Maximus.

102
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:02,336
They honor you.

103
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:26,330
Have I missed it?

104
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:27,759
Have I missed the battle?

105
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:31,017
You have missed the war.

106
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:32,271
Father,

107
00:16:32,611 --> 00:16:33,707
congratulations.

108
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,671
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.

109
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:37,905
Save the bulls.

110
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:39,612
Honor Maximus.

111
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,148
He won the battle.

112
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:42,406
General.

113
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:43,952
Highness.

114
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:45,868
Rome salutes you,

115
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,742
and I embrace you as a brother.

116
00:16:48,453 --> 00:16:49,992
It has been too long, my old friend.

117
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:51,187
Highness.

118
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:52,791
Here Father.

119
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,312
Take my arm.

120
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:57,213
I think it is time...

121
00:16:58,135 --> 00:16:59,444
for me to leave.

122
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:15,314
So much...

123
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,522
for the glory of Rome.

124
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:48,511
Magnificent battle Maximus.

125
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:14,162
General. Still alive?

126
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,273
Still alive.

127
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,218
The gods must have a sense of humor.

128
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,353
The gods must love you.

129
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,060
Valerius.

130
00:19:20,413 --> 00:19:21,732
Back to barracks General?

131
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:22,962
Or to Rome?

132
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:23,734
Home.

133
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:26,205
My wife, my son, the harvest.

134
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,113
Maximus the farmer.

135
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:30,209
I still have difficulty imagining that.

136
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:32,984
You know, dirt cleans off a lot
easier than blood, Quintus.

137
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:34,869
Here he is.

138
00:19:35,195 --> 00:19:35,975
Highness.

139
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,886
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

140
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:39,458
Beware of Gaius.

141
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:41,248
He will pour a honeyed potion
in your ear,

142
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:43,295
and you will wake up one
day and all you will say is,

143
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,216
Republic, republic, republic.

144
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:47,671
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

145
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:48,926
Yes and in a republic,

146
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:50,422
the senate has the power.

147
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,742
But Senator Gaius isn't influenced
by that, of course.

148
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:54,098
Where do you stand General?

149
00:19:54,122 --> 00:19:55,602
Emperor or Senate?

150
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:57,458
A soldier has the advantage

151
00:19:57,483 --> 00:20:00,623
of being able to look his
enemy in the eye, Senator.

152
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:02,398
Well with an army behind you,

153
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,772
you could be extremely political.

154
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:05,943
I warned you.

155
00:20:06,075 --> 00:20:07,681
Now I shall save you.
Senators.

156
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:19,091
Maximus.

157
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,606
I am going to need good men like you.

158
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:27,610
How may I be of service, Highness?

159
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:29,909
You are a man who knows
what it is to command.

160
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:32,261
You give your orders,

161
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:34,159
the orders are obeyed
and the battle is won.

162
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:35,556
But these senators...

163
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:39,038
scheme squabble and flatter and deceive.

164
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,149
Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

165
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:43,814
Can I count on you...

166
00:20:44,462 --> 00:20:45,750
when the time comes?

167
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,554
Highness, when your father releases me, 
I intend to return home.

168
00:20:54,579 --> 00:20:55,409
Home?

169
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:56,452
Well,

170
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,019
no one is earned it more.

171
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,831
Don't get too comfortable.

172
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:02,733
I may call on you before long.

173
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,336
Lucilia is here.

174
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:07,817
Did you know?

175
00:21:08,318 --> 00:21:09,603
She is not forgotten you.

176
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:13,658
And now you are the great man.

177
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,278
If only you had been born a man,

178
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:32,008
what a Caesar you would have made.

179
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:34,794
Father.

180
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:42,399
You would have been strong.

181
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:44,082
I wonder,

182
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:46,367
would you have been just?

183
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:48,976
I would have been what
you taught me to be.

184
00:21:51,903 --> 00:21:53,148
How was your journey?

185
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:54,384
Long.

186
00:21:54,601 --> 00:21:55,761
Uncomfortable.

187
00:21:56,511 --> 00:21:57,542
Why have I come?

188
00:21:57,836 --> 00:21:58,836
I need your help.

189
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,558
With your brother.

190
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:01,933
Of course.

191
00:22:02,664 --> 00:22:03,560
He loves you.

192
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:04,868
He always has.

193
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:06,766
And...

194
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,108
he will need you now,

195
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:12,214
more than ever.

196
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:18,402
Enough of politics.

197
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:20,494
Let us pretend...

198
00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:22,206
that you are a loving daughter,

199
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:23,622
and I...

200
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:25,186
I am a good father.

201
00:22:30,776 --> 00:22:32,172
This is a pleasant fiction,

202
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,213
isn't it?

203
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:47,486
Good morning to you.

204
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:03,058
I need three more horses.

205
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:13,213
One!

206
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:14,381
Two!

207
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:15,941
Three!

208
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,261
Four!

209
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:18,468
One!

210
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,041
Two!

211
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:37,533
You sent for me Caesar?

212
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:43,884
Caesar?

213
00:23:44,101 --> 00:23:45,788
Tell me again Maximus.

214
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:48,476
Why are we here?

215
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,491
For the glory of the empire, sire.

216
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:53,983
Yes.

217
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:57,737
Yes, I remember.

218
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:03,057
Do you see that map, Maximus?

219
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:06,065
That is the world which I created.

220
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:09,018
For 25 years,

221
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,812
I have conquered,

222
00:24:10,836 --> 00:24:13,229
spilt blood, expanded the empire.

223
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:18,758
Since I became Caesar,
I have known four years without war.

224
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:21,343
Four years of peace in 20.

225
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:22,560
And for what?

226
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,875
I brought the sword.

227
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:34,356
Nothing more.

228
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,926
Caesar, your life...

229
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:37,551
Please.

230
00:24:38,082 --> 00:24:39,230
Please don't call me that.

231
00:24:39,863 --> 00:24:40,675
Come.

232
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,156
Please.

233
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:43,784
Come sit.

234
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,264
Let us talk...

235
00:24:46,811 --> 00:24:47,941
together now,

236
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:49,726
very simply,

237
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:51,014
as men.

238
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,279
Well, Maximus,

239
00:24:55,712 --> 00:24:56,545
talk.

240
00:24:59,942 --> 00:25:02,342
Five thousand of my men are out
there in the freezing mud.

241
00:25:03,028 --> 00:25:04,821
Three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved.

242
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:06,305
Two thousand will never
leave this place.

243
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,248
I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

244
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:11,310
And what would you believe?

245
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,541
They fought for you...

246
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:15,234
and for Rome.

247
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:17,051
And what is Rome, Maximus?

248
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:21,060
I have seen much
of the rest of the world.

249
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,717
It is brutal,

250
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:23,760
and cruel,

251
00:25:23,784 --> 00:25:24,678
and dark.

252
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:25,783
Rome is the light.

253
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:27,248
Yet you have never been there.

254
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:29,849
You have not seen what it has become.

255
00:25:30,413 --> 00:25:32,144
I am dying...

256
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:33,631
Maximus.

257
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,552
When a man sees his end,

258
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,274
he wants to know there was
some purpose...

259
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,639
to his life.

260
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,201
How will the world speak
my name in years to come?

261
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:44,748
Will I be known as the philosopher?

262
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:46,271
The warrior?

263
00:25:47,055 --> 00:25:48,232
The tyrant?

264
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:52,038
Or will I be, the Emperor...

265
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:54,625
who gave Rome back her true self?

266
00:25:55,605 --> 00:25:57,641
There was once a dream that was Rome.

267
00:25:58,037 --> 00:25:59,087
You could only...

268
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,708
whisper it.

269
00:26:00,944 --> 00:26:02,424
Anything more than a whisper,

270
00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:03,786
and it would vanish,

271
00:26:04,114 --> 00:26:05,388
it was so fragile.

272
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:07,262
And I fear...

273
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,795
that it will not survive the winter.

274
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:12,459
Maximus,

275
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:14,686
let us...

276
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:16,666
whisper now,

277
00:26:17,002 --> 00:26:18,285
together, you and I.

278
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:20,433
You have a son.

279
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:23,673
Tell me about your home.

280
00:26:30,557 --> 00:26:33,064
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

281
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:35,954
A very simple place.

282
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:38,868
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

283
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:43,297
A kitchen garden that
smells of herbs in the day,

284
00:26:44,321 --> 00:26:45,421
Jasmine in the evening.

285
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:49,694
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

286
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:51,640
Figs,

287
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:52,682
apples,

288
00:26:53,162 --> 00:26:55,227
pears. The soil, Marcus, black.

289
00:26:55,703 --> 00:26:57,505
Black like my wife's hair.

290
00:26:58,543 --> 00:27:00,646
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

291
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:02,359
Wild ponies play near my house.

292
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:03,868
They tease my son.
He wants to be one of them.

293
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:06,634
When was the last time you were home?

294
00:27:06,718 --> 00:27:09,420
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

295
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:13,328
I envy you, Maximus.

296
00:27:13,828 --> 00:27:14,900
It's a good home.

297
00:27:16,478 --> 00:27:17,744
Worth fighting for.

298
00:27:21,024 --> 00:27:22,394
There is one more duty,

299
00:27:23,693 --> 00:27:25,730
that I ask of you before you go home.

300
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:29,668
What would you have me do, Caesar?

301
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:32,097
I want you to become,

302
00:27:32,246 --> 00:27:34,144
the protector of Rome after I die.

303
00:27:35,426 --> 00:27:36,685
I will empower you

304
00:27:37,037 --> 00:27:38,332
to one end alone,

305
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:40,752
to give power back,

306
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,368
to the people of Rome,

307
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:44,359
and end the corruption,

308
00:27:44,383 --> 00:27:45,798
that has crippled it.

309
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:55,505
Will you accept this great
honor that I have, offered you?

310
00:27:57,373 --> 00:27:58,758
With all my heart, no.

311
00:28:01,564 --> 00:28:02,588
Maximus,

312
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,046
that is why...

313
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:06,721
it must be you.

314
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,258
But surely a prefect,

315
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,605
a senator, somebody who knows
the city, who understands her politics.

316
00:28:11,788 --> 00:28:14,749
But you have not been
corrupted by her politics.

317
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:20,937
And Commodus?

318
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:23,330
Commodus is not a moral man.

319
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:26,280
You have known that
since you were young.

320
00:28:27,132 --> 00:28:28,944
Commodus cannot rule.

321
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:31,436
He must not rule.

322
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:34,242
You are the son,

323
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,033
that I should have had.

324
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:39,289
Commodus,

325
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:41,330
will accept my decision.

326
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:44,794
He knows...

327
00:28:45,263 --> 00:28:46,546
that you command...

328
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:48,428
the loyalty of the army.

329
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:54,950
I need some time, sire.

330
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:55,925
Yes.

331
00:28:56,578 --> 00:28:57,599
By sunset,

332
00:28:58,326 --> 00:28:59,878
I hope you will have agreed.

333
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,074
Now embrace me as my son.

334
00:29:06,904 --> 00:29:09,100
And bring an old man another blanket.

335
00:29:25,774 --> 00:29:27,045
My father favors you now.

336
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:28,297
My lady.

337
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:30,090
It was not always so.

338
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,820
Many things change.

339
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:33,027
Many things.

340
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,441
Not everything.

341
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:39,488
Maximus stop!

342
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,811
Let me see your face.

343
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,067
You seem upset.

344
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:50,662
I lost many men.

345
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:53,201
What did my father want with you?

346
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:56,850
To wish me well before
I leave for home.

347
00:29:58,515 --> 00:29:59,553
You are lying.

348
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,194
I could always tell when you were lying,
because you were never any good at it.

349
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,506
I never acquired your comfort with it.

350
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,396
True.

351
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:07,967
But then you never had to.

352
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,014
Life is more simple for a soldier.

353
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,194
Or do you think me heartless?

354
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:18,967
I think you have a talent for survival.

355
00:30:25,542 --> 00:30:26,913
Maximus stop.

356
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:31,788
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

357
00:30:32,257 --> 00:30:34,475
No. I am tired from battle.

358
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,850
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

359
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:44,775
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

360
00:30:46,896 --> 00:30:49,478
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

361
00:30:52,443 --> 00:30:54,095
I will always serve Rome.

362
00:30:56,531 --> 00:30:57,517
Do you know,

363
00:30:58,408 --> 00:31:00,330
I still remember you in my prayers.

364
00:31:01,953 --> 00:31:02,932
Oh, yes.

365
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,689
I pray.

366
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,232
I was sad to hear
of your husband's death.

367
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,540
I mourned him.

368
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:15,445
Thank you.

369
00:31:15,992 --> 00:31:17,428
And I hear you have a son.

370
00:31:19,137 --> 00:31:20,077
Yes.

371
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:21,749
Lucius.

372
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,080
He will be nearly eight years old.

373
00:31:25,288 --> 00:31:26,915
My son is also nearly eight.

374
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:31,580
I thank you for your prayers.

375
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,168
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

376
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,957
Blessed Mother, come to me with
the gods' desire for my future.

377
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,233
Blessed Father, watch over my
wife and son with a ready sword.

378
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:56,351
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

379
00:31:58,259 --> 00:31:59,657
Ancestors, I honor you,

380
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:03,930
and will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

381
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,712
Cicero.

382
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:34,501
Sir.

383
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:41,099
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

384
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:46,865
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

385
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:48,830
The rest of the time,

386
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,746
I do what I have to.

387
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:55,480
We may not be able to go home, after all.

388
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:49,703
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?

389
00:33:53,293 --> 00:33:54,336
Yes Father.

390
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:57,581
You will not be emperor.

391
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:03,495
Which wiser, 
older man is to take my place?

392
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:04,614
My powers...

393
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,339
will pass to Maximus,

394
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,488
to hold in trust,

395
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:11,537
until the Senate is ready to rule...

396
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:13,128
once more.

397
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:15,291
Rome,

398
00:34:16,144 --> 00:34:18,144
is to be a republic again.

399
00:34:19,942 --> 00:34:20,922
Maximus.

400
00:34:21,765 --> 00:34:22,504
Yes.

401
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:30,211
My decision disappoints you?

402
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:35,797
You wrote to me once,

403
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:40,132
listing the four chief virtues.

404
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:43,414
Wisdom,

405
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:44,929
Justice,

406
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,507
fortitude,

407
00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:48,565
and Temperance.

408
00:34:51,408 --> 00:34:53,573
As I read the list,
I knew I had none of them.

409
00:34:55,436 --> 00:34:57,198
But I have other virtues, Father.

410
00:34:59,107 --> 00:35:00,081
Ambition.

411
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:04,081
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

412
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:07,218
Resourcefulness,

413
00:35:08,276 --> 00:35:09,074
courage.

414
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,723
Perhaps not on the battlefield but...

415
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:14,454
there are many forms of courage.

416
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:16,978
Devotion,

417
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,334
to my family,

418
00:35:20,461 --> 00:35:21,385
to you.

419
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,471
But none of my virtues were on your list.

420
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:31,115
Even then it was as if you
didn't want me for your son.

421
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:32,794
Commodus,

422
00:35:34,058 --> 00:35:35,411
you go too far.

423
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:38,865
I searched the faces of the gods

424
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:42,045
for ways to please you,

425
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,802
to make you proud.

426
00:35:45,528 --> 00:35:47,123
One kind word,

427
00:35:47,947 --> 00:35:49,404
one full hug,

428
00:35:50,032 --> 00:35:52,919
where you pressed me to your
chest and held me tight,

429
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:57,950
would have been like the sun
on my heart for 1,000 years.

430
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:03,567
What is it in me you hate so much?

431
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:04,902
Commodus.

432
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:07,855
All I have ever wanted,

433
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:09,697
was to live up to you,

434
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:12,637
Caesar.

435
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,786
Father.

436
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,407
Commodus,

437
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,925
your faults as a son,

438
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:25,505
is my failure...

439
00:36:26,105 --> 00:36:27,238
as a father.

440
00:36:38,361 --> 00:36:39,251
Come.

441
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:44,103
Father.

442
00:36:59,574 --> 00:37:01,722
I would butcher the whole world,

443
00:37:03,105 --> 00:37:05,159
if you would only have loved me!

444
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:44,792
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.

445
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:45,966
It's urgent.

446
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:53,179
Lament with me brother.

447
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:56,273
Our great father is dead.

448
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:24,615
How did he die?

449
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:28,225
The surgeons say there was no pain.

450
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:30,607
His breath gave out as he slept.

451
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:41,842
Father.

452
00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:47,218
Your emperor asks
for your loyalty Maximus.

453
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:49,963
Take my hand.

454
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:54,706
I only offer it once.

455
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:10,123
Quintus.

456
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:01,939
Hail Caesar.

457
00:40:03,244 --> 00:40:04,515
I must talk to the senators.

458
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:05,870
I need their counsel.

459
00:40:05,955 --> 00:40:07,618
Wake Gaius and Falco.

460
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:09,186
Gaius and Falco.
Sword.

461
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:10,788
Sword.

462
00:40:13,522 --> 00:40:14,358
Maximus,

463
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,377
please be careful.
That was not prudent.

464
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:17,301
Prudent?

465
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:19,160
The Emperor has been slain.

466
00:40:19,593 --> 00:40:21,859
The emperor died of natural causes.

467
00:40:23,848 --> 00:40:25,913
Why are you armed, Quintus?
Guards!

468
00:40:29,232 --> 00:40:30,771
Please don't fight, Maximus.

469
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:35,013
I am sorry. Caesar has spoken.

470
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:37,130
Ride until dawn,

471
00:40:39,222 --> 00:40:40,332
and then execute him.

472
00:40:40,656 --> 00:40:41,719
Quintus look at me.

473
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,074
Look at me!

474
00:40:43,512 --> 00:40:45,535
Promise me that
you will look after my family.

475
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:49,738
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

476
00:41:14,857 --> 00:41:15,778
Kneel.

477
00:41:19,653 --> 00:41:21,935
<font color=#ffff80><i>Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son.</i></font>

478
00:41:22,114 --> 00:41:24,612
<font color=#ffff80><i>Whisper to them that
I live only to hold them again.</i></font>

479
00:41:27,828 --> 00:41:29,542
At least give me a clean death.

480
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,221
A soldier's death.

481
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:56,168
The frost,

482
00:41:56,371 --> 00:41:58,443
sometimes it makes the blade stick.

483
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:20,092
Praetorian!

484
00:43:40,002 --> 00:43:41,877
<font color=#ffff80><i>When was the last time
you were home?</i></font>

485
00:43:42,004 --> 00:43:44,642
<font color=#ffff80><i>Two years, 264 days and this morning.</i></font>

486
00:43:46,592 --> 00:43:48,881
<font color=#ffff80><i>Blessed Father, watch over
my wife and son with a ready sword.</i></font>

487
00:43:48,906 --> 00:43:50,887
<font color=#ffff80><i>I will try to live with
the dignity you have taught me.</i></font>

488
00:43:50,971 --> 00:43:53,306
<font color=#ffff80><i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i></font>

489
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:55,931
<font color=#ffff80><i>With a ready sword,
for all else is dust and air.</i></font>

490
00:43:55,956 --> 00:43:58,119
<font color=#ffff80><i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i></font>

491
00:43:59,271 --> 00:44:00,887
<font color=#ffff80><i>For all else is dust and air.</i></font>

492
00:45:01,834 --> 00:45:02,701
<i>Papa!</i>

493
00:45:02,912 --> 00:45:03,810
<i>Papa!</i>

494
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:48,744
<i>Don't die.</i>

495
00:47:55,716 --> 00:47:57,020
<i>You will meet them again.</i>

496
00:47:59,428 --> 00:48:00,551
<i>Not yet.</i>

497
00:48:09,442 --> 00:48:10,250
No.

498
00:48:10,547 --> 00:48:11,585
They will clean it.

499
00:48:11,812 --> 00:48:12,950
Wait and see.

500
00:48:47,434 --> 00:48:48,551
Don't die.

501
00:48:49,618 --> 00:48:51,332
They will feed you to the lions.

502
00:48:52,175 --> 00:48:53,816
They are worth more than we are.

503
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:05,573
Better now?

504
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:08,909
Clean. You see?

505
00:49:39,665 --> 00:49:40,651
Proximo!

506
00:49:41,295 --> 00:49:42,478
My old friend.

507
00:49:43,954 --> 00:49:46,579
Every day is a great day
when you are here,

508
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:48,473
but today,

509
00:49:49,126 --> 00:49:51,539
is your most fortunate day.

510
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,231
Those giraffes you sold me,

511
00:49:56,691 --> 00:49:58,050
they won't mate.

512
00:49:58,175 --> 00:49:59,526
What?
They just...

513
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:00,944
walk around eating,

514
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,612
and not mating.

515
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:05,032
You sold me...

516
00:50:05,478 --> 00:50:06,789
queer giraffes.

517
00:50:07,514 --> 00:50:08,910
I want my money back.

518
00:50:09,481 --> 00:50:10,604
Not a chance.

519
00:50:13,812 --> 00:50:15,334
I do special price for you.

520
00:50:15,459 --> 00:50:16,748
On what?

521
00:50:18,734 --> 00:50:20,172
Have you seen my new stock?

522
00:50:20,414 --> 00:50:21,651
Come and see them.

523
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:36,897
Do any of them fight?

524
00:50:37,294 --> 00:50:38,437
I have got a match coming up.

525
00:50:38,462 --> 00:50:40,794
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

526
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,584
You need both, I think.

527
00:50:43,759 --> 00:50:44,782
Get up.

528
00:50:53,105 --> 00:50:54,340
What's your trade?

529
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:56,562
I was a Hunter.

530
00:50:56,646 --> 00:50:58,896
No, no. I bought him from a...

531
00:50:58,921 --> 00:51:00,567
salt mine in Carthage.

532
00:51:00,971 --> 00:51:02,091
Sit down.

533
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:08,134
Mark of the legion.

534
00:51:08,909 --> 00:51:09,867
Deserter.

535
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,805
Maybe so, but who cares?

536
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,305
He is a Spaniard.

537
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:15,435
I will take six. For 1,000.

538
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,603
1,000?

539
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,802
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

540
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,045
These slaves are rotten.

541
00:51:21,129 --> 00:51:22,484
It all adds to the flavor.

542
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,384
No, no, no, wait! Wait!

543
00:51:24,886 --> 00:51:26,079
I can negotiate.

544
00:51:27,695 --> 00:51:29,032
I will give you 2,000,

545
00:51:29,925 --> 00:51:31,823
and 4,000 for the beasts.

546
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,885
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

547
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,519
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

548
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:57,042
I am Proximo.

549
00:51:57,894 --> 00:52:00,334
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

550
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,712
which will be the last
of your miserable lives,

551
00:52:02,821 --> 00:52:06,196
than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world.

552
00:52:07,482 --> 00:52:10,157
I did not pay good money for you
for your company.

553
00:52:11,888 --> 00:52:14,742
I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.

554
00:52:15,905 --> 00:52:17,414
And as your mother,

555
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:19,485
was there at your beginning,

556
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:23,217
so I shall be there at your end.

557
00:52:24,693 --> 00:52:27,283
And when you die and die you shall,

558
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,468
your transition shall be
to the sound of...

559
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:37,522
Gladiators.

560
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:40,218
I salute you.

561
00:52:45,172 --> 00:52:46,007
Red.

562
00:52:49,885 --> 00:52:50,681
Yellow.

563
00:52:52,438 --> 00:52:53,281
Yellow.

564
00:53:04,357 --> 00:53:05,215
Good.

565
00:53:06,276 --> 00:53:07,551
Red.
Red.

566
00:53:12,574 --> 00:53:13,475
Spaniard.

567
00:53:47,234 --> 00:53:48,837
That's enough for the moment!

568
00:53:49,903 --> 00:53:51,244
His time will come.

569
00:53:55,097 --> 00:53:56,067
Next.

570
00:54:09,191 --> 00:54:09,971
Spaniard,

571
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,057
why don't you fight?

572
00:54:14,029 --> 00:54:15,299
We all have to fight.

573
00:54:15,512 --> 00:54:16,846
Well, I don't fight.

574
00:54:17,889 --> 00:54:20,552
I should not be here, I am a scribe,
I write down words,

575
00:54:21,184 --> 00:54:22,865
and speak seven languages.

576
00:54:23,144 --> 00:54:24,013
Good.

577
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:27,474
Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

578
00:54:36,668 --> 00:54:39,675
Perhaps the scribe will be
the one who wins his freedom.

579
00:54:40,787 --> 00:54:41,831
Freedom?

580
00:54:43,281 --> 00:54:44,589
What do I have to do?

581
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,409
You go in the arena and you kill me.

582
00:54:47,872 --> 00:54:48,823
And him,

583
00:54:50,273 --> 00:54:51,417
and the Numidian,

584
00:54:51,965 --> 00:54:53,182
and the deserter.

585
00:54:55,176 --> 00:54:56,333
And 100 more.

586
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:58,116
And when there is no more to fight,

587
00:54:58,568 --> 00:54:59,560
you are free.

588
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:01,911
I can't do that.

589
00:55:03,077 --> 00:55:04,029
No?

590
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:11,685
But I can.

591
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,161
Is that the sign of your gods?

592
00:55:34,955 --> 00:55:36,408
Will that not anger them?

593
00:55:58,198 --> 00:55:59,635
The gods favor you.

594
00:56:00,178 --> 00:56:02,346
Red is the gods' color.

595
00:56:03,787 --> 00:56:05,526
You will need their help today.

596
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:46,953
Proximo!

597
00:56:52,293 --> 00:56:53,921
Still leading with the German?

598
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:56,561
The crowd love a barbarian.

599
00:56:57,241 --> 00:56:59,007
Besides that, he is making me rich.

600
00:56:59,092 --> 00:57:01,553
Has that Numidian fought before?

601
00:57:02,613 --> 00:57:04,197
No, first time.

602
00:57:04,356 --> 00:57:05,243
And that one,

603
00:57:05,395 --> 00:57:06,286
laborer?

604
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:07,168
Soldier?

605
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,792
He is a Spaniard.

606
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,823
He might as well be a eunuch for
what he brings to the ring.

607
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:16,981
500 sestertii, the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.

608
00:57:17,503 --> 00:57:18,673
And 1,000,

609
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,762
that the Numidian
makes it through alone.

610
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:23,928
Are you asking me to...

611
00:57:24,225 --> 00:57:25,747
bet against my own man?

612
00:57:27,454 --> 00:57:28,700
It's unethical.

613
00:57:29,038 --> 00:57:30,568
What if I make it 2,000?

614
00:57:45,306 --> 00:57:47,596
Some of you are thinking you won't fight,

615
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:50,947
some that you can't fight.

616
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:53,416
They all say that...

617
00:57:54,844 --> 00:57:56,171
until they are out there.

618
00:57:58,485 --> 00:57:59,504
Listen.

619
00:57:59,736 --> 00:58:00,423
Kill!

620
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:01,341
Kill!

621
00:58:01,498 --> 00:58:02,395
Kill!

622
00:58:09,788 --> 00:58:11,706
Thrust this into another man's flesh,

623
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,134
and they will applaud
and love you for that.

624
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:16,712
And you,

625
00:58:19,047 --> 00:58:20,830
you may begin to love them,

626
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:22,754
for that.

627
00:58:27,347 --> 00:58:28,535
Ultimately...

628
00:58:29,863 --> 00:58:30,942
we are all dead men.

629
00:58:33,394 --> 00:58:35,120
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

630
00:58:37,143 --> 00:58:39,339
but we can decide how
we meet that end,

631
00:58:40,652 --> 00:58:42,862
in order that we are remembered,

632
00:58:45,073 --> 00:58:46,112
as men.

633
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:51,391
On the left!

634
00:58:51,766 --> 00:58:52,903
Draw your shields!

635
00:58:53,748 --> 00:58:54,727
On the right!

636
00:58:55,278 --> 00:58:56,272
Draw your swords!

637
00:58:56,417 --> 00:58:57,188
Kill!

638
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,022
Kill!

639
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,137
Kill!

640
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:01,963
Pair them up, red with yellow.

641
00:59:07,554 --> 00:59:08,291
Next!

642
01:02:33,576 --> 01:02:35,084
Usurper!

643
01:02:56,783 --> 01:02:59,493
Go away!
You will never rule us, Commodus!

644
01:03:29,899 --> 01:03:32,296
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.

645
01:03:33,525 --> 01:03:34,611
But what has he conquered?

646
01:03:34,904 --> 01:03:36,896
Give him time, Gracchus.
He is young.

647
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,614
I think he could do very well.

648
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:41,974
For Rome or for you?

649
01:03:48,393 --> 01:03:49,689
Go to your mother Lucius.

650
01:03:49,713 --> 01:03:51,073
It's what she would like.

651
01:03:57,844 --> 01:03:58,656
Lucius!

652
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,844
Mother!

653
01:04:02,181 --> 01:04:03,359
Hail Caesar.

654
01:04:03,808 --> 01:04:04,812
Senators.

655
01:04:08,938 --> 01:04:11,385
Rome greets her new emperor.

656
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:14,690
Your loyal subjects
bid you welcome, Highness.

657
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:16,799
Thank you Falco.

658
01:04:17,488 --> 01:04:19,260
And for the loyal subjects I...

659
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:21,316
trust they were not too expensive.

660
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,660
Caesar.
Gracchus.

661
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:26,246
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

662
01:04:26,493 --> 01:04:29,189
There are many matters
that require your attention.

663
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:33,733
To order please.

664
01:04:34,185 --> 01:04:35,172
To order.

665
01:04:35,849 --> 01:04:37,224
For your guidance Caesar,

666
01:04:37,508 --> 01:04:39,974
the Senate has prepared
a series of protocols

667
01:04:40,386 --> 01:04:43,018
to begin addressing
the many problems, in the city,

668
01:04:43,628 --> 01:04:47,331
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter,

669
01:04:48,204 --> 01:04:49,457
to combat the plague,

670
01:04:49,481 --> 01:04:51,008
which is already springing up there.

671
01:04:51,856 --> 01:04:53,258
So, if Caesar...

672
01:04:55,776 --> 01:04:57,268
Don't you see Gracchus?

673
01:04:59,207 --> 01:05:00,994
That's the very problem isn't it?

674
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:04,244
My father spent all his time at study,

675
01:05:06,315 --> 01:05:07,433
at books of...

676
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:09,693
learning and philosophy.

677
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:13,283
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

678
01:05:15,087 --> 01:05:16,692
And all the while the people...

679
01:05:17,274 --> 01:05:18,298
were forgotten.

680
01:05:19,126 --> 01:05:20,782
But the senate is the people sire,

681
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:23,074
chosen from among the people,

682
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:24,847
to speak for the people.

683
01:05:25,431 --> 01:05:28,409
I doubt many of the people eat
so well as you do Gracchus.

684
01:05:29,769 --> 01:05:31,972
Or have such splendid mistresses Gaius.

685
01:05:32,313 --> 01:05:34,074
I think I understand my own people.

686
01:05:34,482 --> 01:05:37,595
Then perhaps Caesar
will be so good as to teach us,

687
01:05:38,503 --> 01:05:41,130
out of his own extensive experience.

688
01:05:44,909 --> 01:05:46,127
I call it love.

689
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:48,516
I am their father.

690
01:05:48,932 --> 01:05:50,213
The people are my children.

691
01:05:50,627 --> 01:05:53,071
And I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

692
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:55,727
Have you ever embraced someone
dying of plague sire?

693
01:06:02,802 --> 01:06:03,614
No.

694
01:06:03,937 --> 01:06:05,396
But if you interrupt me again,

695
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:08,288
I assure you that you shall.

696
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:10,684
Senator, my brother is very tired.

697
01:06:11,686 --> 01:06:13,187
Leave your list with me.

698
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:15,880
Caesar shall do all
that Rome requires.

699
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,545
My lady,

700
01:06:18,136 --> 01:06:21,361
as always, your lightest
touch commands obedience.

701
01:06:28,571 --> 01:06:30,479
Who are they to lecture me?

702
01:06:31,038 --> 01:06:31,934
Commodus,

703
01:06:32,331 --> 01:06:33,713
the Senate has its uses.

704
01:06:33,798 --> 01:06:34,854
What uses?

705
01:06:35,222 --> 01:06:36,604
All they do is talk.

706
01:06:37,753 --> 01:06:38,931
It should be just...

707
01:06:40,057 --> 01:06:41,321
you and me

708
01:06:41,595 --> 01:06:42,358
and Rome.

709
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:43,904
Don't even think it.

710
01:06:43,983 --> 01:06:45,605
There is always been a Senate.

711
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,558
Rome has changed.

712
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,368
It takes an emperor,

713
01:06:50,027 --> 01:06:51,230
to rule an empire.

714
01:06:51,350 --> 01:06:52,371
Of course but,

715
01:06:52,395 --> 01:06:53,491
leave the people their...

716
01:06:53,516 --> 01:06:54,615
illusions?

717
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,576
Traditions.

718
01:06:58,898 --> 01:07:00,961
My father's war against the barbarians.

719
01:07:02,153 --> 01:07:04,195
He said it himself,
it achieved nothing.

720
01:07:04,738 --> 01:07:05,836
But the people loved him.

721
01:07:05,906 --> 01:07:07,782
The people always love victories.

722
01:07:07,867 --> 01:07:08,628
Why?

723
01:07:09,997 --> 01:07:11,542
They didn't see the battles.

724
01:07:12,872 --> 01:07:14,503
What do they care about Germania?

725
01:07:14,915 --> 01:07:16,821
They care about the greatness of Rome.

726
01:07:17,335 --> 01:07:18,782
The greatness of Rome.

727
01:07:21,213 --> 01:07:22,571
Well, what is that?

728
01:07:25,718 --> 01:07:26,710
It's an idea.

729
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:28,975
Greatness.

730
01:07:32,683 --> 01:07:33,996
Greatness is a vision.

731
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:35,122
Exactly.

732
01:07:35,513 --> 01:07:36,469
A vision.

733
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:39,592
Do you not see Lucilia?

734
01:07:41,626 --> 01:07:44,734
I will give the people a vision of Rome
and they will love me for it.

735
01:07:46,238 --> 01:07:50,086
And they will soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

736
01:08:01,921 --> 01:08:04,538
I will give the people the greatest
vision of their lives.

737
01:08:56,475 --> 01:08:59,394
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

738
01:09:07,695 --> 01:09:08,812
Games.

739
01:09:11,305 --> 01:09:14,348
One hundred and fifty days of games.

740
01:09:14,702 --> 01:09:16,244
He is cleverer than I thought.

741
01:09:16,328 --> 01:09:17,214
Clever.

742
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,998
The whole of Rome would
be laughing at him,

743
01:09:20,814 --> 01:09:22,959
if they were not so afraid
of his Praetorians.

744
01:09:23,043 --> 01:09:24,231
Fear and wonder.

745
01:09:24,356 --> 01:09:25,768
A powerful combination.

746
01:09:27,256 --> 01:09:30,004
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

747
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:32,239
I think he knows what Rome is.

748
01:09:32,348 --> 01:09:33,598
Rome is the mob.

749
01:09:34,409 --> 01:09:37,107
Conjure magic for them,
and they will be distracted.

750
01:09:37,975 --> 01:09:39,371
Take away their freedom,

751
01:09:39,701 --> 01:09:41,107
and still they will roar.

752
01:09:41,829 --> 01:09:43,584
The beating heart of Rome,

753
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,350
is not the marble of the Senate.

754
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:48,412
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

755
01:09:50,237 --> 01:09:51,928
He will bring them death,

756
01:09:54,033 --> 01:09:55,897
and they will love him for it.

757
01:10:19,158 --> 01:10:21,036
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

758
01:10:21,268 --> 01:10:23,278
The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.

759
01:10:23,771 --> 01:10:25,520
We want them to keep coming back.

760
01:10:25,968 --> 01:10:27,002
So don't just...

761
01:10:27,104 --> 01:10:29,485
hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.

762
01:10:32,733 --> 01:10:33,766
Spaniard.

763
01:10:35,287 --> 01:10:36,225
Spaniard.

764
01:10:37,717 --> 01:10:38,483
Spaniard.

765
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:43,178
So entertain!

766
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,127
Are you not entertained?

767
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,857
Are you not entertained?

768
01:11:54,903 --> 01:11:56,512
Is this not why you are here?

769
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:04,787
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

770
01:12:04,871 --> 01:12:12,583
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

771
01:12:22,056 --> 01:12:23,200
What do you want?

772
01:12:26,352 --> 01:12:27,240
Girl?

773
01:12:28,562 --> 01:12:29,599
Boy?

774
01:12:30,648 --> 01:12:31,794
You sent for me.

775
01:12:31,818 --> 01:12:32,899
Yes I did.

776
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:36,567
You are good, Spaniard,
but you are not that good.

777
01:12:37,154 --> 01:12:38,520
You could be magnificent.

778
01:12:38,568 --> 01:12:40,511
I am required to kill, so I kill.

779
01:12:40,933 --> 01:12:42,106
That is enough.

780
01:12:42,812 --> 01:12:45,208
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

781
01:12:49,207 --> 01:12:50,478
The young emperor...

782
01:12:50,563 --> 01:12:53,559
has arranged a series of spectacles to...

783
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,938
commemorate his father,

784
01:12:56,008 --> 01:12:57,442
Marcus Aurelius.

785
01:12:58,026 --> 01:12:59,450
I find that amusing,

786
01:13:00,395 --> 01:13:02,324
since it was Marcus Aurelius,

787
01:13:02,456 --> 01:13:03,441
likewise,

788
01:13:03,513 --> 01:13:06,199
the all knowing Marcus Aurelius
that closed us down.

789
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:12,292
So finally after five years of...

790
01:13:12,316 --> 01:13:13,981
scratching a living in...

791
01:13:14,126 --> 01:13:16,071
flea infested villages,

792
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,633
we are finally going back
to where we belong.

793
01:13:20,114 --> 01:13:21,204
The Colosseum.

794
01:13:24,044 --> 01:13:26,704
You should see the Colosseum Spaniard.

795
01:13:28,252 --> 01:13:29,985
Fifty thousand Romans,

796
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:32,062
watching...

797
01:13:32,981 --> 01:13:34,919
every movement of your sword,

798
01:13:36,393 --> 01:13:38,106
willing you to make that killer blow.

799
01:13:40,008 --> 01:13:41,613
The silence before you strike,

800
01:13:42,566 --> 01:13:43,992
and the noise afterwards.

801
01:13:44,638 --> 01:13:45,784
It rises.

802
01:13:46,511 --> 01:13:47,786
It rises up like,

803
01:13:47,810 --> 01:13:48,804
like...

804
01:13:49,476 --> 01:13:50,897
like, like a storm.

805
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:54,015
As if you were the thunder god himself.

806
01:13:54,648 --> 01:13:55,919
You were a gladiator?

807
01:13:56,669 --> 01:13:57,866
Yes, I was.

808
01:14:04,032 --> 01:14:05,424
You won your freedom?

809
01:14:06,326 --> 01:14:08,322
A long time ago the Emperor...

810
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,415
presented me with a rudius, it's...

811
01:14:12,499 --> 01:14:13,353
just...

812
01:14:14,306 --> 01:14:15,650
a wooden sword.

813
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,627
The symbol of your freedom.

814
01:14:21,341 --> 01:14:22,905
He touched me on the shoulder,

815
01:14:22,997 --> 01:14:24,411
and I was free.

816
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:28,147
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

817
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:31,393
I did not say I knew him. I said
he touched me on the shoulder once.

818
01:14:33,103 --> 01:14:34,565
You asked me what I want.

819
01:14:36,523 --> 01:14:38,776
I too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor,

820
01:14:40,736 --> 01:14:41,812
as you did.

821
01:14:42,237 --> 01:14:43,509
Then listen to me.

822
01:14:44,664 --> 01:14:45,656
Learn from me.

823
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:49,577
I was not the best because
I killed quickly.

824
01:14:50,788 --> 01:14:53,055
I was the best because
the crowd loved me.

825
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:55,813
Win the crowd,

826
01:14:56,453 --> 01:14:57,906
and you will win your freedom.

827
01:15:02,341 --> 01:15:03,606
I will win the crowd.

828
01:15:06,428 --> 01:15:08,739
I will give them something
they ave never seen before.

829
01:15:10,891 --> 01:15:11,912
So Spaniard,

830
01:15:11,936 --> 01:15:13,760
we shall go to Rome together,

831
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:16,330
and have bloody adventures.

832
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,355
And the great whore will suckle us

833
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,965
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

834
01:15:21,026 --> 01:15:22,236
And then...

835
01:15:23,671 --> 01:15:25,197
when enough men have died,

836
01:15:27,908 --> 01:15:29,815
perhaps you will have your freedom.

837
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:35,602
Here.

838
01:15:36,446 --> 01:15:37,473
Use this.

839
01:16:00,858 --> 01:16:02,254
It's somewhere out there,

840
01:16:03,045 --> 01:16:04,233
my country.

841
01:16:05,112 --> 01:16:06,193
My home.

842
01:16:07,614 --> 01:16:09,475
My wife is preparing food.

843
01:16:10,742 --> 01:16:12,745
My daughters carry water from the river.

844
01:16:14,788 --> 01:16:16,331
Will I ever see them again?

845
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:19,167
I think no.

846
01:16:19,977 --> 01:16:21,862
Do you believe you will see
them again when you die?

847
01:16:22,462 --> 01:16:23,503
I think so.

848
01:16:24,464 --> 01:16:25,193
But then...

849
01:16:26,326 --> 01:16:27,644
I will die soon.

850
01:16:29,177 --> 01:16:31,223
They will not die for many years.

851
01:16:32,431 --> 01:16:33,747
I will have to wait.

852
01:16:34,182 --> 01:16:35,203
But you would...

853
01:16:35,531 --> 01:16:36,458
wait.

854
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,036
Of course.

855
01:16:40,349 --> 01:16:41,282
You see,

856
01:16:42,753 --> 01:16:43,774
my wife...

857
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:46,883
and my son,

858
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:49,586
are already waiting for me.

859
01:16:50,324 --> 01:16:51,637
You will meet them again.

860
01:16:53,112 --> 01:16:54,265
But not yet.

861
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:59,211
Not yet.

862
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:02,047
Unless...
Not yet.

863
01:17:06,715 --> 01:17:07,758
Not yet.

864
01:17:20,896 --> 01:17:22,138
There he is.

865
01:18:11,571 --> 01:18:12,321
Out.

866
01:18:13,907 --> 01:18:15,594
Move, go, out!

867
01:18:28,547 --> 01:18:30,367
Good to see you again, old friend.

868
01:18:36,388 --> 01:18:37,723
Bring me fortune.

869
01:18:42,686 --> 01:18:44,770
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

870
01:18:46,648 --> 01:18:48,804
I didn't know men could
build such things.

871
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:00,475
Win the crowd.

872
01:19:00,996 --> 01:19:02,142
Get inside.

873
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:03,330
Move.

874
01:19:03,415 --> 01:19:04,577
Inside.

875
01:19:53,924 --> 01:19:56,111
He sleeps so well because he is loved.

876
01:19:59,596 --> 01:20:00,534
Come, brother.

877
01:20:00,995 --> 01:20:01,916
It's late.

878
01:20:05,268 --> 01:20:07,530
I will make Rome the wonder of the ages.

879
01:20:10,899 --> 01:20:13,539
That is what Gracchus
and his friends don't understand.

880
01:20:14,739 --> 01:20:17,781
All my desires are splitting
my head to pieces.

881
01:20:24,913 --> 01:20:25,934
Commodus,

882
01:20:26,763 --> 01:20:28,038
drink this tonic.

883
01:20:37,498 --> 01:20:39,248
I think the time is almost right.

884
01:20:40,053 --> 01:20:41,982
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate,

885
01:20:43,056 --> 01:20:44,881
at the celebration to honor our father.

886
01:20:45,225 --> 01:20:46,490
Do you think I should?

887
01:20:47,936 --> 01:20:49,256
Are the people ready?

888
01:20:51,982 --> 01:20:53,678
I think you need your rest now.

889
01:21:00,282 --> 01:21:01,516
Will you stay with me?

890
01:21:02,152 --> 01:21:04,141
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

891
01:21:11,376 --> 01:21:12,290
Still.

892
01:21:14,421 --> 01:21:15,405
Always.

893
01:21:17,424 --> 01:21:18,737
Stay with me tonight.

894
01:21:19,034 --> 01:21:20,444
You know I won't.

895
01:21:24,764 --> 01:21:25,931
Then kiss me.

896
01:21:35,108 --> 01:21:36,338
Sleep brother.

897
01:22:29,454 --> 01:22:31,444
Having servants who are deaf and mute

898
01:22:31,665 --> 01:22:34,077
at least ensures I live a little longer.

899
01:22:36,211 --> 01:22:37,694
They are arresting scholars now.

900
01:22:38,723 --> 01:22:40,402
Anyone who dare speak out.

901
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:42,679
Even satirists and chroniclers.

902
01:22:43,093 --> 01:22:44,468
And mathematicians.

903
01:22:46,221 --> 01:22:48,347
And all to feed the arena.

904
01:22:50,016 --> 01:22:52,434
The Senate did not
approve martial law.

905
01:22:52,519 --> 01:22:55,139
This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians.

906
01:22:56,523 --> 01:22:58,528
I am afraid to go out after dark.

907
01:22:58,733 --> 01:23:01,528
You should be more afraid of
your activities during the day.

908
01:23:02,362 --> 01:23:04,175
The Senate is full of his spies,

909
01:23:04,988 --> 01:23:07,208
led by that whore master, Falco.

910
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:10,098
But what is in his mind?

911
01:23:11,081 --> 01:23:12,910
That's what I trouble myself with.

912
01:23:13,623 --> 01:23:16,542
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed,

913
01:23:16,626 --> 01:23:18,795
planning the festival
to honor your father.

914
01:23:19,546 --> 01:23:22,475
He neglects even the most
fundamental task of government.

915
01:23:23,883 --> 01:23:25,803
So just what is he planning?

916
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:27,959
And what pays for it?

917
01:23:28,179 --> 01:23:30,493
These daily games are costing a fortune,

918
01:23:30,986 --> 01:23:32,530
yet we have no new taxes.

919
01:23:33,143 --> 01:23:34,373
The future.

920
01:23:35,937 --> 01:23:37,569
The future pays for it.

921
01:23:39,441 --> 01:23:41,237
He is started selling the grain reserves.

922
01:23:42,402 --> 01:23:43,948
This can't be true.

923
01:23:44,863 --> 01:23:46,878
He is selling Rome's
reserves of grain.

924
01:23:47,949 --> 01:23:50,138
The people will be starving in two years.

925
01:23:51,471 --> 01:23:52,971
I hope they are enjoying the games,

926
01:23:52,996 --> 01:23:55,099
because soon enough they will
be dead because of them.

927
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:58,188
Rome must know this.

928
01:23:58,212 --> 01:23:59,043
And how?

929
01:23:59,544 --> 01:24:01,248
He is going to dissolve the Senate.

930
01:24:02,505 --> 01:24:04,436
And who will tell them
before it's too late?

931
01:24:04,783 --> 01:24:05,679
You Gracchus?

932
01:24:07,427 --> 01:24:08,490
You Gaius.

933
01:24:09,012 --> 01:24:10,646
Will you make a speech
on the floor of the Senate,

934
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:11,991
denouncing my brother?

935
01:24:13,099 --> 01:24:15,186
And then see your family
in the Colosseum?

936
01:24:16,603 --> 01:24:17,532
Who would dare?

937
01:24:27,155 --> 01:24:29,842
I have been living in
a prison of fear every day,

938
01:24:30,283 --> 01:24:32,295
because my son is heir to the throne.

939
01:24:38,458 --> 01:24:39,504
He must die.

940
01:24:44,297 --> 01:24:45,668
Quintus and the Praetorians

941
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,937
would simply seize control for themselves.

942
01:24:48,176 --> 01:24:48,905
No.

943
01:24:49,937 --> 01:24:52,054
Cut off the head and
the snake cannot strike.

944
01:24:52,138 --> 01:24:53,843
Lucilia, Gaius is right.

945
01:24:54,265 --> 01:24:56,246
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians,

946
01:24:57,195 --> 01:24:58,507
we can achieve nothing.

947
01:24:59,938 --> 01:25:01,179
So we do nothing?

948
01:25:01,523 --> 01:25:02,585
No child.

949
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:04,476
We keep our counsel.

950
01:25:05,318 --> 01:25:06,521
We prepare.

951
01:25:07,604 --> 01:25:09,259
As long as the people support him,

952
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:12,399
we are voices without steel.

953
01:25:13,076 --> 01:25:14,388
We are air.

954
01:25:17,497 --> 01:25:20,290
But with every day that passes,
he makes enemies.

955
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:23,414
One day, he will have more
enemies than friends.

956
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:25,316
And on that day,

957
01:25:25,769 --> 01:25:26,865
we will act.

958
01:25:27,215 --> 01:25:29,091
Then we will strike.

959
01:25:30,009 --> 01:25:31,513
But until then,

960
01:25:32,929 --> 01:25:34,000
we are docile.

961
01:25:34,973 --> 01:25:37,141
We are obedient.

962
01:25:38,937 --> 01:25:40,414
And we are treacherous.

963
01:25:49,362 --> 01:25:50,529
Come on, this way.

964
01:25:59,372 --> 01:26:01,415
Alright, that's enough.

965
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:25,380
The Emperor wants battles,

966
01:26:25,398 --> 01:26:27,425
and I don't want to sacrifice
my best fighters.

967
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:30,503
The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.

968
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:32,717
You get the battle of Carthage.

969
01:26:32,741 --> 01:26:34,084
Massacre of Carthage.

970
01:26:36,618 --> 01:26:38,149
Well, why don't you go down to the prison,

971
01:26:38,174 --> 01:26:39,974
round up all the beggars and thieves?

972
01:26:39,999 --> 01:26:41,170
We have done that.

973
01:26:41,456 --> 01:26:43,952
If you want to give away
the best gladiators

974
01:26:43,977 --> 01:26:46,713
in the whole of the empire,
then I want double the rates.

975
01:26:47,378 --> 01:26:50,612
You will get your contract rates,
or you will get your contract canceled.

976
01:26:51,257 --> 01:26:52,385
You don't like it?

977
01:26:52,759 --> 01:26:56,167
Then you can crawl back down that
shit hole that you came from.

978
01:26:59,807 --> 01:27:01,669
Cassius, please.
You can free us.

979
01:27:31,798 --> 01:27:34,696
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

980
01:27:34,884 --> 01:27:35,798
Yes.

981
01:27:36,928 --> 01:27:38,555
They said you were a giant.

982
01:27:39,222 --> 01:27:41,910
They said you could crush
a man's skull with one hand.

983
01:27:42,475 --> 01:27:43,988
A man's? No.

984
01:27:45,562 --> 01:27:46,472
A boy's.

985
01:27:48,898 --> 01:27:50,878
Do they have good horses in Spain?

986
01:27:51,285 --> 01:27:52,464
Some of the best.

987
01:27:53,486 --> 01:27:54,632
This is Argento.

988
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:56,775
This is Scarto.

989
01:27:57,991 --> 01:27:59,142
They were my horses.

990
01:28:00,702 --> 01:28:01,970
They were taken from me.

991
01:28:03,079 --> 01:28:04,350
I like you Spaniard.

992
01:28:05,426 --> 01:28:06,598
I shall cheer for you.

993
01:28:07,004 --> 01:28:08,146
They let you watch the games?

994
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:10,137
My uncle says it makes me strong.

995
01:28:10,336 --> 01:28:11,733
And what does your father say?

996
01:28:12,246 --> 01:28:13,481
My father is dead.

997
01:28:15,383 --> 01:28:17,145
Master Lucius, it is time.

998
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:19,824
I have to go.

999
01:28:20,179 --> 01:28:21,332
Your name is Lucius?

1000
01:28:23,891 --> 01:28:24,912
Lucius Verus,

1001
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:26,726
after my father.

1002
01:28:57,216 --> 01:28:58,575
Lower!

1003
01:29:04,057 --> 01:29:05,161
Claudius!

1004
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:06,786
Yes?

1005
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:08,974
More shields!
Alright.

1006
01:29:28,581 --> 01:29:30,144
When the Emperor enters,

1007
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:31,938
raise your weapons,

1008
01:29:32,185 --> 01:29:33,264
salute him,

1009
01:29:33,419 --> 01:29:35,092
and then speak together.

1010
01:29:36,255 --> 01:29:37,485
Face the Emperor

1011
01:29:37,719 --> 01:29:39,739
and don't turn your back on him.

1012
01:29:40,937 --> 01:29:41,823
Go,

1013
01:29:41,948 --> 01:29:43,716
and die with honor.

1014
01:30:39,018 --> 01:30:40,690
Hail mighty Caesar!

1015
01:30:44,073 --> 01:30:47,117
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

1016
01:30:47,201 --> 01:30:50,648
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

1017
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:54,332
We who are about to die salute you!

1018
01:30:56,043 --> 01:30:57,391
On this day

1019
01:30:58,337 --> 01:31:01,594
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

1020
01:31:02,216 --> 01:31:05,886
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall

1021
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:08,175
of mighty Carthage!

1022
01:31:11,726 --> 01:31:13,179
On the barren...

1023
01:31:13,741 --> 01:31:14,665
plain...

1024
01:31:14,923 --> 01:31:16,124
of Zama

1025
01:31:16,859 --> 01:31:19,897
there stood the invincible armies...

1026
01:31:20,234 --> 01:31:22,861
of the barbarian Hannibal.

1027
01:31:23,571 --> 01:31:26,740
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

1028
01:31:26,765 --> 01:31:29,291
from all brute nations,

1029
01:31:29,363 --> 01:31:31,807
bent on merciless...

1030
01:31:32,605 --> 01:31:33,807
destruction,

1031
01:31:34,457 --> 01:31:35,682
conquest.

1032
01:31:36,751 --> 01:31:38,105
Your emperor...

1033
01:31:38,649 --> 01:31:40,680
is pleased to give you

1034
01:31:40,981 --> 01:31:43,938
the barbarian horde!

1035
01:31:52,326 --> 01:31:53,784
Anyone here been in the army?

1036
01:31:54,352 --> 01:31:55,081
Yes.

1037
01:31:55,331 --> 01:31:57,266
I served with you at Vindobona.

1038
01:31:58,324 --> 01:31:59,383
You can help me.

1039
01:32:01,192 --> 01:32:02,969
Whatever comes out of these gates,

1040
01:32:04,487 --> 01:32:07,471
we have got a better chance
of survival if we work together.

1041
01:32:08,366 --> 01:32:09,596
Do you understand?

1042
01:32:12,262 --> 01:32:14,305
If we stay together, we survive.

1043
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:15,768
The Emperor is pleased to bring you...

1044
01:32:16,082 --> 01:32:18,729
the legionnaires of Scipio...

1045
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:21,254
Africanus!

1046
01:32:31,931 --> 01:32:33,640
To the death!

1047
01:32:37,436 --> 01:32:40,021
Kill! Kill! Kill!

1048
01:32:43,901 --> 01:32:45,002
Stay close!

1049
01:32:51,489 --> 01:32:52,637
Come together!

1050
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,142
Stay close.

1051
01:32:56,275 --> 01:32:58,199
Staggered columns!

1052
01:33:11,929 --> 01:33:13,271
You don't have a chance.

1053
01:33:25,318 --> 01:33:26,380
Lock your shields.

1054
01:33:26,404 --> 01:33:27,505
Stay as one.

1055
01:33:29,363 --> 01:33:30,497
Hold!

1056
01:33:32,992 --> 01:33:35,994
Hold! As one!

1057
01:33:38,915 --> 01:33:40,025
Well done.

1058
01:33:52,136 --> 01:33:53,199
Hold.

1059
01:33:53,918 --> 01:33:56,011
Down low! Down low!

1060
01:34:01,771 --> 01:34:02,497
Yes!

1061
01:34:15,076 --> 01:34:16,015
Hagen!

1062
01:34:40,434 --> 01:34:41,997
This column to the chariot!

1063
01:34:42,255 --> 01:34:44,137
This column stay with me!

1064
01:34:47,608 --> 01:34:48,801
Quickly!

1065
01:34:49,652 --> 01:34:51,499
Get out there.
Hurry!

1066
01:35:33,612 --> 01:35:34,779
Maximus!

1067
01:35:47,258 --> 01:35:49,501
Single column! Single column!

1068
01:36:41,514 --> 01:36:43,867
My history is a little hazy Cassius,

1069
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:47,769
but should not the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

1070
01:36:47,853 --> 01:36:49,604
Yes, sire.

1071
01:36:51,524 --> 01:36:52,829
Forgive me sire.

1072
01:36:52,983 --> 01:36:53,838
No,

1073
01:36:54,065 --> 01:36:55,688
I rather enjoy surprises.

1074
01:36:56,487 --> 01:36:57,493
Who is he?

1075
01:36:57,696 --> 01:37:00,698
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

1076
01:37:03,202 --> 01:37:04,602
I think I will meet him.

1077
01:37:05,204 --> 01:37:06,118
Yes sire.

1078
01:37:08,749 --> 01:37:10,548
Hail to the barbarians!

1079
01:37:25,599 --> 01:37:26,662
Forward!

1080
01:37:26,686 --> 01:37:28,740
Arms at ready!

1081
01:37:42,575 --> 01:37:43,719
Drop your weapons.

1082
01:37:48,247 --> 01:37:49,226
Gladiator,

1083
01:37:49,250 --> 01:37:51,046
the Emperor has asked for you.

1084
01:37:51,792 --> 01:37:53,468
I am at the Emperor's service.

1085
01:38:20,636 --> 01:38:21,675
Rise.

1086
01:38:22,393 --> 01:38:23,457
Rise.

1087
01:38:32,208 --> 01:38:34,459
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

1088
01:38:34,543 --> 01:38:36,718
I don't think there is ever
been a gladiator to match you.

1089
01:38:37,129 --> 01:38:39,710
As for this young man, he insists
you are Hector reborn.

1090
01:38:40,132 --> 01:38:41,296
Or was it Hercules?

1091
01:38:43,221 --> 01:38:45,851
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

1092
01:38:49,016 --> 01:38:50,186
You do have a name.

1093
01:38:51,435 --> 01:38:53,006
My name is Gladiator.

1094
01:38:56,607 --> 01:38:58,337
How dare you show your back to me?

1095
01:38:58,993 --> 01:39:00,088
Slave!

1096
01:39:01,293 --> 01:39:03,689
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

1097
01:39:16,252 --> 01:39:18,588
My name is Maximus
Decimus Meridius,

1098
01:39:19,129 --> 01:39:20,793
commander of the armies of the north,

1099
01:39:21,087 --> 01:39:22,777
general of the Felix Legions,

1100
01:39:23,592 --> 01:39:26,886
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius,

1101
01:39:28,305 --> 01:39:30,069
father to a murdered son,

1102
01:39:30,933 --> 01:39:32,678
husband to a murdered wife,

1103
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,374
and I will have my vengeance,

1104
01:39:36,062 --> 01:39:37,623
in this life or the next.

1105
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:45,583
Arms!

1106
01:39:58,794 --> 01:40:02,130
Live! Live! Live! Live!

1107
01:40:02,214 --> 01:40:05,593
Live! Live! Live! Live!

1108
01:40:49,599 --> 01:40:52,309
Arms, at rest!

1109
01:41:44,650 --> 01:41:49,112
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1110
01:42:37,202 --> 01:42:38,369
Father.

1111
01:43:52,736 --> 01:43:54,204
Why is he still alive?

1112
01:43:55,864 --> 01:43:57,001
I don't know.

1113
01:43:57,975 --> 01:43:59,321
He should not be alive.

1114
01:44:00,285 --> 01:44:01,407
It vexes me.

1115
01:44:03,455 --> 01:44:04,746
I am terribly vexed.

1116
01:44:16,468 --> 01:44:17,905
I did what I had to do.

1117
01:44:19,137 --> 01:44:20,570
If Father had had his way,

1118
01:44:20,756 --> 01:44:22,474
the empire would have
been torn apart.

1119
01:44:23,267 --> 01:44:24,357
You do see that.

1120
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:26,185
Yes.

1121
01:44:31,275 --> 01:44:32,462
What did you feel,

1122
01:44:33,485 --> 01:44:34,485
when you saw him?

1123
01:44:36,613 --> 01:44:37,821
I felt nothing.

1124
01:44:40,293 --> 01:44:41,962
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

1125
01:44:43,787 --> 01:44:45,997
No more than I wounded him.

1126
01:44:50,502 --> 01:44:52,204
They lied to me in Germania.

1127
01:44:54,423 --> 01:44:56,048
They told me he was dead.

1128
01:44:58,569 --> 01:45:00,610
If they lie to me,
they don't respect me.

1129
01:45:01,179 --> 01:45:03,422
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

1130
01:45:05,851 --> 01:45:07,742
Then you must let the legions know,

1131
01:45:08,358 --> 01:45:09,374
their treachery...

1132
01:45:10,015 --> 01:45:11,530
will not go unpunished.

1133
01:45:12,232 --> 01:45:13,522
Poor sister.

1134
01:45:14,109 --> 01:45:15,827
I would not want to be your enemy.

1135
01:45:17,779 --> 01:45:18,864
What will you do?

1136
01:45:32,502 --> 01:45:33,541
This way.

1137
01:46:09,206 --> 01:46:12,667
Rich matrons pay well to be
pleasured by the bravest champions.

1138
01:46:12,751 --> 01:46:14,635
I knew your brother would send assassins.

1139
01:46:15,754 --> 01:46:17,588
I didn't realize he would send his best.

1140
01:46:20,008 --> 01:46:21,302
Maximus, he doesn't know.

1141
01:46:23,053 --> 01:46:25,982
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

1142
01:46:26,264 --> 01:46:28,185
I knew nothing...
Don't lie to me!

1143
01:46:35,273 --> 01:46:36,554
I wept for them.

1144
01:46:37,109 --> 01:46:38,561
As you wept for your father?

1145
01:46:39,087 --> 01:46:40,970
As you wept for your father?

1146
01:46:40,995 --> 01:46:43,898
I have been living in a prison
of fear since that day.

1147
01:46:45,117 --> 01:46:47,707
To be unable to mourn your
father for fear of your brother.

1148
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:51,351
To live in terror,

1149
01:46:51,375 --> 01:46:53,040
every moment of every day,

1150
01:46:53,125 --> 01:46:54,949
because your son is heir to the throne.

1151
01:46:57,796 --> 01:46:58,973
I have wept.

1152
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:03,324
My son was innocent.

1153
01:47:04,261 --> 01:47:06,303
So is mine.

1154
01:47:08,306 --> 01:47:10,910
Must my son die too,
before you will trust me?

1155
01:47:12,853 --> 01:47:14,957
What does it matter
if I trust you or not?

1156
01:47:16,690 --> 01:47:18,086
The gods have spared you.

1157
01:47:18,169 --> 01:47:19,458
Don't you understand?

1158
01:47:19,818 --> 01:47:23,279
Today I saw a slave become more
powerful than the emperor of Rome.

1159
01:47:23,304 --> 01:47:24,661
The gods have spared me?

1160
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:26,419
I am at their mercy,

1161
01:47:26,669 --> 01:47:28,632
with the power only to amuse a mob.

1162
01:47:28,785 --> 01:47:30,179
That is power.

1163
01:47:30,829 --> 01:47:31,954
The mob is Rome.

1164
01:47:32,038 --> 01:47:34,647
And while Commodus controls
them he controls everything.

1165
01:47:36,001 --> 01:47:37,296
Listen to me.

1166
01:47:38,086 --> 01:47:40,983
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

1167
01:47:41,298 --> 01:47:42,968
But while the people follow him,

1168
01:47:43,633 --> 01:47:46,226
no one would dare stand up
to him until you.

1169
01:47:47,637 --> 01:47:49,930
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

1170
01:47:50,015 --> 01:47:53,187
There are some politicians who have
dedicated their lives to Rome.

1171
01:47:53,852 --> 01:47:55,390
One man above all.

1172
01:47:56,688 --> 01:47:57,959
If I can arrange it,

1173
01:47:58,827 --> 01:48:00,006
will you meet him?

1174
01:48:00,225 --> 01:48:01,545
Do you not understand?

1175
01:48:02,277 --> 01:48:04,736
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow.

1176
01:48:04,761 --> 01:48:05,998
I am a slave!

1177
01:48:06,573 --> 01:48:08,669
What possible difference can I make?

1178
01:48:09,525 --> 01:48:11,700
This man wants what you want.

1179
01:48:11,870 --> 01:48:13,981
Then have him kill Commodus!

1180
01:48:16,708 --> 01:48:18,372
I knew a man once,

1181
01:48:19,419 --> 01:48:20,711
a noble man.

1182
01:48:21,713 --> 01:48:24,536
A man of principle who loved my father,

1183
01:48:25,550 --> 01:48:27,635
and my father loved him.

1184
01:48:29,596 --> 01:48:31,764
This man served Rome well.

1185
01:48:36,102 --> 01:48:37,602
That man is gone.

1186
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:40,437
Your brother did his work well.

1187
01:48:41,191 --> 01:48:42,453
Let me help you.

1188
01:48:48,782 --> 01:48:49,511
Yes,

1189
01:48:50,203 --> 01:48:51,907
you can help me.

1190
01:48:55,205 --> 01:48:56,559
Forget you ever knew me,

1191
01:48:57,250 --> 01:48:58,916
never come here again.

1192
01:49:02,587 --> 01:49:03,566
Guard!

1193
01:49:03,894 --> 01:49:05,370
The lady is finished with me.

1194
01:49:33,785 --> 01:49:34,933
What's your name?

1195
01:49:38,456 --> 01:49:39,769
Julian Crassus.

1196
01:49:45,547 --> 01:49:46,420
Name?

1197
01:49:48,091 --> 01:49:49,545
Marcus sire.

1198
01:49:50,713 --> 01:49:51,873
My father's name.

1199
01:49:59,728 --> 01:50:01,741
They must have known
of Maximus' escape,

1200
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:03,940
when they found the bodies
of the four men.

1201
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:07,362
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

1202
01:50:08,904 --> 01:50:10,467
These are good men, sire.

1203
01:50:10,491 --> 01:50:11,896
Loyal to the Emperor.

1204
01:50:19,414 --> 01:50:21,123
Load your arrows!

1205
01:50:28,757 --> 01:50:30,506
Prepare to fire!

1206
01:50:51,196 --> 01:50:52,384
Then perhaps...

1207
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:54,735
it was you who knew,

1208
01:50:55,325 --> 01:50:56,641
and never told me.

1209
01:50:57,285 --> 01:50:58,306
I didn't know.

1210
01:50:58,696 --> 01:50:59,902
You didn't know?

1211
01:51:01,039 --> 01:51:02,143
But a general,

1212
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:03,898
is always in control.

1213
01:51:05,251 --> 01:51:06,523
Always in command,

1214
01:51:07,984 --> 01:51:08,921
isn't he?

1215
01:51:10,465 --> 01:51:11,582
Yes Caesar.

1216
01:51:25,855 --> 01:51:27,127
Then give the command.

1217
01:51:27,924 --> 01:51:28,995
Say it.

1218
01:51:45,458 --> 01:51:46,357
Fire.

1219
01:52:21,828 --> 01:52:22,953
Maximus.

1220
01:52:23,913 --> 01:52:25,226
You commanded legions?

1221
01:52:25,757 --> 01:52:27,041
You had many victories?

1222
01:52:27,721 --> 01:52:28,646
Yes.

1223
01:52:29,075 --> 01:52:30,337
In Germania?

1224
01:52:32,047 --> 01:52:33,401
In many countries.

1225
01:52:35,383 --> 01:52:36,486
General.

1226
01:53:25,809 --> 01:53:27,215
You have a great name.

1227
01:53:29,187 --> 01:53:31,426
He must kill your name
before he kills you.

1228
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:42,533
Yes, at the far end.

1229
01:53:42,617 --> 01:53:44,136
Senator Gaius.
Hello.

1230
01:53:45,036 --> 01:53:46,449
Senator Gracchus.

1231
01:53:48,641 --> 01:53:52,060
Don't often see you enjoying
the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

1232
01:53:52,085 --> 01:53:54,752
I don't pretend to be a man
of the people Senator,

1233
01:53:55,296 --> 01:53:57,798
but I do try to be a man for the people.

1234
01:54:14,228 --> 01:54:17,258
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

1235
01:54:17,283 --> 01:54:20,713
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

1236
01:54:23,825 --> 01:54:25,450
People of Rome!

1237
01:54:27,877 --> 01:54:30,337
On the fourth day of Antioch,

1238
01:54:30,832 --> 01:54:32,228
we can celebrate,

1239
01:54:32,445 --> 01:54:35,210
the 64th day of the games.

1240
01:54:35,837 --> 01:54:36,649
And...

1241
01:54:37,563 --> 01:54:40,090
in his majestic Charity,

1242
01:54:40,842 --> 01:54:45,053
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome

1243
01:54:45,638 --> 01:54:49,057
with an historical final match.

1244
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:54,438
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement,

1245
01:54:55,968 --> 01:54:56,878
Caesar,

1246
01:54:57,476 --> 01:54:59,318
is pleased to bring you...

1247
01:54:59,402 --> 01:55:03,256
the only undefeated champion

1248
01:55:03,281 --> 01:55:05,240
in Roman history,

1249
01:55:05,325 --> 01:55:06,971
the legendary.

1250
01:55:07,182 --> 01:55:10,692
Tigris of Gaul!

1251
01:55:31,809 --> 01:55:34,978
He knows too well how
to manipulate the mob.

1252
01:55:35,063 --> 01:55:37,773
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

1253
01:55:37,857 --> 01:55:39,087
This is not it.

1254
01:55:39,111 --> 01:55:40,651
This is not it!

1255
01:55:40,735 --> 01:55:43,570
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

1256
01:55:44,405 --> 01:55:46,796
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

1257
01:55:47,659 --> 01:55:49,785
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

1258
01:55:49,810 --> 01:55:53,688
Representing the training
lyceum of Antonius Proximo,

1259
01:55:53,831 --> 01:55:57,224
Caesar is proud to give you.

1260
01:55:57,585 --> 01:56:01,421
Aelius Maximus!

1261
01:56:14,227 --> 01:56:16,426
They embrace him like
he is one of their own.

1262
01:56:16,688 --> 01:56:18,167
The mob is fickle, brother.

1263
01:56:19,159 --> 01:56:20,840
He will be forgotten in a month.

1264
01:56:23,361 --> 01:56:24,090
No,

1265
01:56:24,988 --> 01:56:26,290
much sooner than that.

1266
01:56:28,116 --> 01:56:29,345
It's been arranged.

1267
01:56:48,428 --> 01:56:50,006
We who are about to die,

1268
01:56:50,433 --> 01:56:51,723
salute you.

1269
01:56:54,726 --> 01:56:56,404
We are with you, Maximus!

1270
01:57:39,103 --> 01:57:40,657
Fight on, finish it!

1271
01:58:09,133 --> 01:58:10,801
Pull, pull!

1272
01:58:43,167 --> 01:58:44,709
Loose! Loose!

1273
01:59:12,822 --> 01:59:14,665
Gut him!
Kill!

1274
01:59:15,343 --> 01:59:19,892
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

1275
01:59:40,101 --> 01:59:42,648
Kill!

1276
02:00:20,306 --> 02:00:22,516
Maximus the Merciful!

1277
02:00:31,692 --> 02:00:35,195
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1278
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:39,059
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1279
02:00:44,664 --> 02:00:46,937
Forward, arms at ready!

1280
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:19,162
What am I going to do with you?

1281
02:01:20,825 --> 02:01:22,263
You simply won't...

1282
02:01:23,451 --> 02:01:24,653
die.

1283
02:01:29,041 --> 02:01:30,749
Are we so different, you and I?

1284
02:01:32,443 --> 02:01:34,191
You take life when you have to,

1285
02:01:34,589 --> 02:01:35,624
as I do.

1286
02:01:36,841 --> 02:01:38,988
I have only one more life to take.

1287
02:01:39,772 --> 02:01:40,890
Then it is done.

1288
02:01:40,998 --> 02:01:42,406
Then take it now.

1289
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:57,235
They tell me your son

1290
02:01:58,654 --> 02:01:59,967
squealed like a girl,

1291
02:02:00,928 --> 02:02:02,680
when they nailed him to the cross.

1292
02:02:04,702 --> 02:02:05,823
And your wife,

1293
02:02:07,622 --> 02:02:08,995
moaned like a whore

1294
02:02:10,666 --> 02:02:11,812
when they ravaged her,

1295
02:02:12,687 --> 02:02:13,522
again...

1296
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:15,463
and again...

1297
02:02:16,547 --> 02:02:17,619
and again.

1298
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:26,399
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end,

1299
02:02:31,562 --> 02:02:32,696
Highness.

1300
02:02:47,203 --> 02:02:50,163
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1301
02:03:00,466 --> 02:03:01,445
General!

1302
02:03:02,805 --> 02:03:03,887
General!

1303
02:03:05,614 --> 02:03:06,622
General!

1304
02:03:06,896 --> 02:03:07,825
General!

1305
02:03:08,307 --> 02:03:10,100
General!
Cicero!

1306
02:03:17,566 --> 02:03:19,067
General!
Where are you camped?

1307
02:03:19,092 --> 02:03:20,050
Ostia.

1308
02:03:26,909 --> 02:03:29,869
We love you, Maximus!
Praise the Victor!

1309
02:03:29,954 --> 02:03:32,455
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.

1310
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,807
Move along!
Find me!

1311
02:04:00,276 --> 02:04:01,385
Can they hear you?

1312
02:04:05,823 --> 02:04:06,719
Who?

1313
02:04:06,743 --> 02:04:07,678
Your family...

1314
02:04:08,116 --> 02:04:09,477
in the afterlife.

1315
02:04:11,711 --> 02:04:12,495
Yes.

1316
02:04:13,004 --> 02:04:14,438
What do you say to them?

1317
02:04:18,043 --> 02:04:19,040
To my boy,

1318
02:04:21,189 --> 02:04:23,040
I tell him I will see him again soon,

1319
02:04:23,763 --> 02:04:26,231
to keep his heels down
when he is riding his horse.

1320
02:04:28,846 --> 02:04:29,887
To my wife,

1321
02:04:32,850 --> 02:04:34,252
that is not your business.

1322
02:04:42,651 --> 02:04:45,048
And now they love
Maximus for his mercy.

1323
02:04:46,906 --> 02:04:49,877
So I can't just kill him or it
makes me even more unmerciful.

1324
02:04:51,786 --> 02:04:53,140
The whole thing is like some...

1325
02:04:53,445 --> 02:04:54,262
great...

1326
02:04:55,031 --> 02:04:56,145
nightmare.

1327
02:04:57,291 --> 02:04:58,731
He is defying you.

1328
02:04:59,210 --> 02:05:02,587
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1329
02:05:02,671 --> 02:05:04,526
The mob sees this,

1330
02:05:04,550 --> 02:05:06,257
and so do the Senate.

1331
02:05:07,051 --> 02:05:09,928
Every day he lives they grow bolder.

1332
02:05:11,472 --> 02:05:13,223
Kill him.
No.

1333
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:17,056
I will not make a martyr of him.

1334
02:05:24,693 --> 02:05:26,560
When I went to the Senate today,

1335
02:05:27,410 --> 02:05:30,591
I purposefully told them about using
the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1336
02:05:33,798 --> 02:05:35,431
And did you note what happened?

1337
02:05:35,871 --> 02:05:37,017
Nothing.

1338
02:05:37,041 --> 02:05:38,060
Exactly.

1339
02:05:38,677 --> 02:05:39,675
Nothing.

1340
02:05:40,084 --> 02:05:41,915
Not a single word of protest.

1341
02:05:42,503 --> 02:05:45,277
Even the insolent Senator
Gracchus was silent as a mouse.

1342
02:05:46,215 --> 02:05:47,316
Why?

1343
02:05:49,152 --> 02:05:50,614
I have been told...

1344
02:05:51,332 --> 02:05:52,863
of a certain sea snake

1345
02:05:52,888 --> 02:05:56,933
which has a very unusual
method of attracting its prey.

1346
02:05:57,393 --> 02:05:58,539
It will lie,

1347
02:05:58,563 --> 02:06:01,104
at the bottom
of the ocean as if wounded.

1348
02:06:01,621 --> 02:06:03,585
Then, its enemies,

1349
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:07,610
will approach and yet it will lie quite, still.

1350
02:06:07,945 --> 02:06:11,799
And then, its enemies will
take little bites of it,

1351
02:06:11,824 --> 02:06:15,193
and yet, it remains, still.

1352
02:06:18,330 --> 02:06:19,357
So...

1353
02:06:20,833 --> 02:06:22,084
we will lie still...

1354
02:06:23,335 --> 02:06:25,232
and let our enemies come to us...

1355
02:06:25,779 --> 02:06:27,006
and nibble.

1356
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,428
Have every senator followed.

1357
02:06:47,735 --> 02:06:49,078
Cicero, my old friend.

1358
02:06:49,570 --> 02:06:51,490
I thought perhaps I had seen you
for the last time.

1359
02:06:51,530 --> 02:06:52,593
I thought you were dead.

1360
02:06:52,617 --> 02:06:53,547
Close.

1361
02:06:54,158 --> 02:06:55,783
How long have the men been in Ostia?

1362
02:06:55,868 --> 02:06:56,821
All winter.

1363
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,766
And how do they look?

1364
02:06:59,055 --> 02:07:00,485
Fat and bored.

1365
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:02,770
Who is in command?

1366
02:07:02,919 --> 02:07:04,336
Some fool from Rome.

1367
02:07:06,211 --> 02:07:08,046
How soon do you think they
could be ready to fight?

1368
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:09,511
For you, tomorrow.

1369
02:07:11,383 --> 02:07:13,058
I need you to do something for me.

1370
02:07:18,538 --> 02:07:19,956
Come, see, witness.

1371
02:07:19,981 --> 02:07:22,929
If you have not been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1372
02:07:23,050 --> 02:07:26,678
Giant Maximus is defeating
our emperor, Commodus.

1373
02:07:26,857 --> 02:07:29,419
What are we to do?
He is just defying everyone,

1374
02:07:29,444 --> 02:07:31,111
by doing this to him, they do...

1375
02:07:32,488 --> 02:07:33,724
My goodness!

1376
02:07:35,616 --> 02:07:37,763
He got him, he is defeated.

1377
02:07:37,787 --> 02:07:39,366
Give way! Give way!

1378
02:07:45,292 --> 02:07:46,271
My lady?

1379
02:07:46,295 --> 02:07:47,877
I served your father at Vindobona.

1380
02:07:47,962 --> 02:07:49,182
Back.
My lady?

1381
02:07:49,588 --> 02:07:51,471
I served your father at Vindobona.

1382
02:07:52,091 --> 02:07:52,909
Back!

1383
02:07:53,258 --> 02:07:54,780
And I served General Maximus.

1384
02:07:54,804 --> 02:07:56,036
I serve him still.

1385
02:07:57,972 --> 02:07:58,700
Stop.

1386
02:07:59,294 --> 02:07:59,997
Stop.

1387
02:08:00,099 --> 02:08:00,927
Stop!

1388
02:08:02,184 --> 02:08:03,099
Stand back.

1389
02:08:04,895 --> 02:08:07,473
The general sends word,
he will meet your politician.

1390
02:08:09,629 --> 02:08:10,921
For your loyalty soldier.

1391
02:08:10,945 --> 02:08:12,059
Thank you my lady.

1392
02:08:13,289 --> 02:08:14,054
Up!

1393
02:08:22,705 --> 02:08:23,675
Leave us.

1394
02:08:29,753 --> 02:08:30,948
Senator Gracchus.

1395
02:08:45,269 --> 02:08:46,227
General.

1396
02:08:47,646 --> 02:08:50,692
I hope my coming here
today is evidence enough that...

1397
02:08:51,716 --> 02:08:53,583
you can trust me.

1398
02:08:57,865 --> 02:08:59,052
The Senate is with you?

1399
02:08:59,318 --> 02:09:00,336
The Senate?

1400
02:09:01,827 --> 02:09:02,764
Yes.

1401
02:09:03,414 --> 02:09:04,537
I can speak for them.

1402
02:09:05,164 --> 02:09:07,390
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1403
02:09:08,876 --> 02:09:09,921
To what end?

1404
02:09:11,795 --> 02:09:13,492
Get me outside the city walls.

1405
02:09:14,715 --> 02:09:17,924
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia.
My army is encamped there.

1406
02:09:18,768 --> 02:09:22,072
By nightfall of the second day,
I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.

1407
02:09:22,097 --> 02:09:23,916
But the legions all have
new commanders,

1408
02:09:24,433 --> 02:09:25,595
loyal to Commodus.

1409
02:09:25,934 --> 02:09:29,103
Let my men see me alive, and you
shall see where their loyalties lie.

1410
02:09:29,188 --> 02:09:30,611
This is madness.

1411
02:09:31,523 --> 02:09:34,759
No Roman army has entered
the capital in 100 years.

1412
02:09:34,784 --> 02:09:37,174
I will not trade one
dictatorship for another!

1413
02:09:37,199 --> 02:09:39,593
The time for half measures
and talk is over,

1414
02:09:40,171 --> 02:09:41,198
Senator.

1415
02:09:41,349 --> 02:09:43,263
And after your glorious coup,

1416
02:09:43,802 --> 02:09:44,623
what then?

1417
02:09:45,552 --> 02:09:48,018
You will take your 5,000
warriors and...

1418
02:09:48,435 --> 02:09:49,256
leave?

1419
02:09:49,342 --> 02:09:50,326
I will leave.

1420
02:09:51,418 --> 02:09:53,412
The soldiers will stay
for your protection,

1421
02:09:53,437 --> 02:09:54,919
under the command of the Senate.

1422
02:09:55,276 --> 02:09:56,153
So...

1423
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:58,862
once all of Rome is yours,

1424
02:09:58,886 --> 02:10:00,817
you will just give it back to the people?

1425
02:10:02,585 --> 02:10:03,763
Tell me why.

1426
02:10:09,561 --> 02:10:11,880
Because that was the last
wish of a dying man.

1427
02:10:15,776 --> 02:10:17,091
I will kill Commodus.

1428
02:10:19,571 --> 02:10:20,550
The fate of Rome,

1429
02:10:21,623 --> 02:10:22,657
I leave to you.

1430
02:10:24,409 --> 02:10:26,273
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1431
02:10:28,539 --> 02:10:29,434
His daughter...

1432
02:10:29,660 --> 02:10:30,625
trusts you.

1433
02:10:34,586 --> 02:10:35,883
I will trust you.

1434
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:38,070
But we have little time.

1435
02:10:39,327 --> 02:10:40,593
Give me two days,

1436
02:10:41,802 --> 02:10:43,781
and I will buy your freedom.

1437
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:45,891
And you,

1438
02:10:47,558 --> 02:10:49,289
you stay alive,

1439
02:10:50,644 --> 02:10:52,172
or I will be dead.

1440
02:10:54,273 --> 02:10:55,500
Now we must go.

1441
02:11:22,926 --> 02:11:25,953
He will be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1442
02:11:26,597 --> 02:11:27,875
He will find you.

1443
02:12:12,351 --> 02:12:13,407
It won't work.

1444
02:12:14,770 --> 02:12:16,555
The Emperor knows too much.

1445
02:12:17,648 --> 02:12:19,039
And as for me,

1446
02:12:20,984 --> 02:12:22,438
it's becoming dangerous.

1447
02:12:24,321 --> 02:12:26,032
You will be paid on my return.

1448
02:12:28,572 --> 02:12:29,852
I give you my word.

1449
02:12:30,702 --> 02:12:31,723
Your word?

1450
02:12:32,412 --> 02:12:33,788
What if you don't return?

1451
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:37,162
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1452
02:12:37,999 --> 02:12:38,998
Trust?

1453
02:12:43,590 --> 02:12:44,868
Who am I to trust?

1454
02:12:45,926 --> 02:12:47,447
I will kill Commodus.

1455
02:12:47,775 --> 02:12:49,095
Why would I want that?

1456
02:12:49,888 --> 02:12:51,056
He makes me rich.

1457
02:12:56,728 --> 02:12:59,337
I know that you are a man
of your word, General.

1458
02:13:01,316 --> 02:13:03,111
I know that you would die for honor.

1459
02:13:05,237 --> 02:13:06,720
You would die for Rome.

1460
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:10,673
You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.

1461
02:13:11,451 --> 02:13:12,777
But I, on the other hand,

1462
02:13:16,456 --> 02:13:17,855
I am an entertainer.

1463
02:13:21,795 --> 02:13:22,668
Guard!

1464
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:29,613
He killed the man who set you free.

1465
02:13:39,604 --> 02:13:41,043
Praetorians, master.

1466
02:13:47,612 --> 02:13:48,575
Halt!

1467
02:14:53,929 --> 02:14:55,184
Where have you been?

1468
02:14:56,181 --> 02:14:57,301
I sent for you.

1469
02:14:59,351 --> 02:15:00,489
Please, brother.

1470
02:15:06,775 --> 02:15:08,059
What's troubling you?

1471
02:15:11,071 --> 02:15:12,747
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1472
02:15:15,242 --> 02:15:16,223
I don't know.

1473
02:15:18,745 --> 02:15:20,356
I thought you had seen him.

1474
02:15:21,775 --> 02:15:24,277
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1475
02:15:26,002 --> 02:15:28,368
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1476
02:15:29,631 --> 02:15:31,037
And he will bleed too.

1477
02:15:32,551 --> 02:15:33,638
Very soon.

1478
02:15:35,429 --> 02:15:36,716
But not tonight.

1479
02:15:52,112 --> 02:15:54,040
Do you remember what
our father said once?

1480
02:15:56,366 --> 02:15:57,563
It's a dream,

1481
02:15:59,911 --> 02:16:01,262
a frightful dream,

1482
02:16:04,374 --> 02:16:05,614
life is.

1483
02:16:08,420 --> 02:16:09,749
Do you think that's true?

1484
02:16:11,256 --> 02:16:12,437
I don't know.

1485
02:16:16,344 --> 02:16:17,491
I think it is.

1486
02:16:20,640 --> 02:16:22,671
And I have only you to share it with.

1487
02:17:00,972 --> 02:17:02,206
Open your mouth.

1488
02:17:39,886 --> 02:17:41,221
You know I love you.

1489
02:17:43,765 --> 02:17:44,995
And I love you.

1490
02:18:22,012 --> 02:18:23,554
Out. Get out!

1491
02:18:24,764 --> 02:18:25,832
Move!

1492
02:18:30,687 --> 02:18:32,209
Congratulations, General.

1493
02:18:32,814 --> 02:18:33,960
You have got very...

1494
02:18:34,648 --> 02:18:35,978
persuasive friends.

1495
02:18:41,615 --> 02:18:43,535
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1496
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:45,638
We dare not wait any longer.

1497
02:18:46,129 --> 02:18:47,386
We must leave tonight.

1498
02:18:47,746 --> 02:18:50,121
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1499
02:18:52,042 --> 02:18:53,396
Your servant, Cicero,

1500
02:18:53,420 --> 02:18:54,973
will be waiting there with horses.

1501
02:18:57,666 --> 02:18:58,860
You have done all this?

1502
02:18:59,485 --> 02:19:00,387
Yes.

1503
02:19:01,217 --> 02:19:02,848
You risk too much.

1504
02:19:03,887 --> 02:19:05,888
I have much to pay for.

1505
02:19:08,308 --> 02:19:09,764
You have nothing to pay for.

1506
02:19:10,602 --> 02:19:11,706
You love your son.

1507
02:19:12,592 --> 02:19:13,912
You are strong for him.

1508
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:19,234
I am tired of being strong.

1509
02:19:21,196 --> 02:19:23,176
My brother hates all the world,

1510
02:19:24,061 --> 02:19:25,407
and you most of all.

1511
02:19:25,963 --> 02:19:27,472
Because your father chose me.

1512
02:19:28,241 --> 02:19:29,090
No.

1513
02:19:30,330 --> 02:19:32,330
Because my father loved you.

1514
02:19:36,503 --> 02:19:38,921
And because I loved you.

1515
02:19:41,508 --> 02:19:42,832
A long time ago.

1516
02:19:47,931 --> 02:19:49,778
Was I very different then?

1517
02:19:56,606 --> 02:19:57,793
You laughed more.

1518
02:20:02,445 --> 02:20:04,655
I have felt alone all my life,

1519
02:20:06,157 --> 02:20:07,523
except with you.

1520
02:20:10,912 --> 02:20:11,955
I must go.

1521
02:20:12,956 --> 02:20:13,799
Yes.

1522
02:20:42,569 --> 02:20:43,576
There.

1523
02:20:55,331 --> 02:20:56,362
And I got you.

1524
02:20:59,878 --> 02:21:01,795
Isn't it late to be
playing legionnaire?

1525
02:21:01,880 --> 02:21:03,198
I am not a legionnaire.

1526
02:21:04,299 --> 02:21:05,320
Not a legionnaire?

1527
02:21:05,468 --> 02:21:06,685
I am a gladiator.

1528
02:21:08,178 --> 02:21:09,388
A gladiator?

1529
02:21:10,346 --> 02:21:12,247
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1530
02:21:13,099 --> 02:21:16,518
Would not you rather be a great
Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1531
02:21:16,603 --> 02:21:18,946
I am Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1532
02:21:22,025 --> 02:21:23,509
The savior of Rome?

1533
02:21:31,766 --> 02:21:33,183
And who said that?

1534
02:21:42,420 --> 02:21:43,604
Where is Lucius?

1535
02:21:45,215 --> 02:21:46,972
He is with the Emperor, my lady.

1536
02:21:50,553 --> 02:21:52,129
She could not.
Yes, she did.

1537
02:21:52,347 --> 02:21:54,027
She took it from a basket,

1538
02:21:55,975 --> 02:21:57,580
and pressed it to her breast,

1539
02:21:57,767 --> 02:21:59,498
right here above her heart.

1540
02:22:01,356 --> 02:22:02,835
It bit her in the breast?

1541
02:22:03,639 --> 02:22:04,631
Yes.

1542
02:22:05,235 --> 02:22:06,381
You see Lucius,

1543
02:22:06,553 --> 02:22:07,548
sometimes...

1544
02:22:08,157 --> 02:22:09,344
royal ladies,

1545
02:22:09,697 --> 02:22:11,260
behave very strangely,

1546
02:22:11,602 --> 02:22:13,659
and do very odd things
in the name of love.

1547
02:22:13,743 --> 02:22:14,931
I think it's silly.

1548
02:22:15,368 --> 02:22:16,587
So do I.

1549
02:22:18,414 --> 02:22:19,507
So do I.

1550
02:22:20,291 --> 02:22:21,187
Sister,

1551
02:22:21,749 --> 02:22:22,516
join us.

1552
02:22:23,002 --> 02:22:24,632
I have been reading to dear Lucius.

1553
02:22:24,838 --> 02:22:26,765
I have been reading too.
Yes.

1554
02:22:26,923 --> 02:22:28,444
He is a very clever little boy.

1555
02:22:29,190 --> 02:22:30,822
He will make a grand emperor one day.

1556
02:22:32,804 --> 02:22:34,200
We have been reading about the great...

1557
02:22:34,510 --> 02:22:36,549
Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.

1558
02:22:36,724 --> 02:22:38,646
And the queen killed
herself with a snake.

1559
02:22:39,352 --> 02:22:41,833
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1560
02:22:42,857 --> 02:22:44,326
If you are very good,

1561
02:22:44,691 --> 02:22:47,294
tomorrow night, I will tell you
the story of Emperor Claudius.

1562
02:22:48,718 --> 02:22:49,960
He was betrayed,

1563
02:22:51,489 --> 02:22:53,062
by those closest to him.

1564
02:22:55,493 --> 02:22:56,882
By his own blood.

1565
02:22:58,580 --> 02:23:00,424
They whispered in dark corners,

1566
02:23:01,124 --> 02:23:02,799
and went out late at night,

1567
02:23:03,668 --> 02:23:04,981
and conspired,

1568
02:23:05,825 --> 02:23:07,416
and conspired.

1569
02:23:09,632 --> 02:23:12,246
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1570
02:23:13,595 --> 02:23:15,840
He knew they were busy little bees.

1571
02:23:18,099 --> 02:23:20,372
And one night he sat down
with one of them,

1572
02:23:21,936 --> 02:23:23,262
and he looked at her,

1573
02:23:24,689 --> 02:23:25,918
and he said.

1574
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:29,985
Tell me what you have been doing,

1575
02:23:30,653 --> 02:23:32,231
busy little bee.

1576
02:23:34,657 --> 02:23:37,473
Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.

1577
02:23:38,912 --> 02:23:41,955
You shall watch as I bathe in their blood.

1578
02:23:45,668 --> 02:23:47,519
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1579
02:23:50,173 --> 02:23:52,473
The little bee had
wounded him more deeply

1580
02:23:52,552 --> 02:23:54,371
than anyone else
could ever have done.

1581
02:23:57,305 --> 02:23:59,215
What do you think
happened then, Lucius?

1582
02:24:00,808 --> 02:24:02,183
I don't know Uncle.

1583
02:24:09,150 --> 02:24:11,396
The little bee told him everything.

1584
02:25:09,627 --> 02:25:12,629
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1585
02:25:13,464 --> 02:25:14,580
Proximo!

1586
02:25:15,633 --> 02:25:18,760
Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!

1587
02:25:19,595 --> 02:25:20,668
Proximo!

1588
02:25:23,141 --> 02:25:24,543
Open the gates!

1589
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:32,733
Open the gates, Proximo.

1590
02:25:33,192 --> 02:25:35,444
Do you want to die, old man?

1591
02:25:36,654 --> 02:25:37,572
Here.

1592
02:25:38,364 --> 02:25:39,910
Everything is prepared.

1593
02:25:40,616 --> 02:25:42,379
It seems you have won your freedom.

1594
02:25:43,161 --> 02:25:44,140
Proximo,

1595
02:25:44,762 --> 02:25:46,747
are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1596
02:25:51,836 --> 02:25:52,690
Juba.

1597
02:25:52,714 --> 02:25:55,672
All enemies of the Emperor, die!

1598
02:25:56,215 --> 02:25:57,629
Open the gates!

1599
02:26:03,890 --> 02:26:05,132
Pull!

1600
02:26:07,766 --> 02:26:10,311
Move! Form a column on the left!

1601
02:26:14,556 --> 02:26:17,298
I only need moments, so do not
be careless with your lives.

1602
02:26:17,945 --> 02:26:20,405
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1603
02:26:20,490 --> 02:26:22,741
We will wait here for you, Maximus.

1604
02:26:22,825 --> 02:26:24,266
Strength and honor.

1605
02:26:24,702 --> 02:26:25,579
Go.

1606
02:26:26,621 --> 02:26:28,352
Strength and honor.

1607
02:26:31,084 --> 02:26:33,919
Aim. Arch your bows!

1608
02:27:41,028 --> 02:27:42,278
Shadows and dust.

1609
02:28:24,238 --> 02:28:25,198
Maximus!

1610
02:28:30,953 --> 02:28:31,839
I am sorry.

1611
02:28:58,773 --> 02:28:59,718
It's done.

1612
02:29:07,114 --> 02:29:08,549
And what of my nephew?

1613
02:29:09,935 --> 02:29:11,314
And what of his mother?

1614
02:29:14,069 --> 02:29:16,181
Should they share her lover's fate?

1615
02:29:18,417 --> 02:29:19,904
Or should I be merciful?

1616
02:29:23,172 --> 02:29:24,632
Commodus the Merciful.

1617
02:29:31,514 --> 02:29:33,346
Lucius will stay with me now.

1618
02:29:35,017 --> 02:29:36,143
And if his mother...

1619
02:29:38,187 --> 02:29:40,032
so much as looks at me...

1620
02:29:41,653 --> 02:29:43,329
in a manner that displeases me,

1621
02:29:45,945 --> 02:29:46,910
he will die.

1622
02:29:50,998 --> 02:29:52,304
If she decides,

1623
02:29:53,249 --> 02:29:54,374
to be noble,

1624
02:29:55,871 --> 02:29:57,217
and takes her own life,

1625
02:29:59,542 --> 02:30:00,585
he will die.

1626
02:30:04,630 --> 02:30:05,740
And as for you,

1627
02:30:09,135 --> 02:30:10,412
you will love me,

1628
02:30:11,721 --> 02:30:12,900
as I have loved you.

1629
02:30:15,099 --> 02:30:16,829
You will provide me with an heir,

1630
02:30:17,789 --> 02:30:18,900
of pure blood,

1631
02:30:19,729 --> 02:30:20,939
so that Commodus,

1632
02:30:22,359 --> 02:30:24,689
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1633
02:30:29,739 --> 02:30:31,114
Am I not merciful?

1634
02:30:53,346 --> 02:30:55,972
Am I not merciful!

1635
02:31:08,194 --> 02:31:12,637
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1636
02:31:39,642 --> 02:31:40,913
I am a soldier.

1637
02:31:41,507 --> 02:31:42,556
I obey.

1638
02:31:45,264 --> 02:31:48,599
Nothing happens to anyone that
he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1639
02:32:22,351 --> 02:32:23,495
Maximus.

1640
02:32:24,620 --> 02:32:25,720
Maximus.

1641
02:32:26,945 --> 02:32:28,045
Maximus.

1642
02:32:30,025 --> 02:32:31,189
They call for you.

1643
02:32:33,821 --> 02:32:34,800
The general...

1644
02:32:35,617 --> 02:32:36,914
who became a slave.

1645
02:32:38,301 --> 02:32:40,446
The slave who became a gladiator.

1646
02:32:42,079 --> 02:32:44,683
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1647
02:32:46,962 --> 02:32:48,339
A striking story.

1648
02:32:49,712 --> 02:32:52,229
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1649
02:32:55,301 --> 02:32:57,230
Only a famous death will do.

1650
02:32:59,472 --> 02:33:01,457
And what could be more glorious

1651
02:33:02,664 --> 02:33:05,710
than to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?

1652
02:33:08,387 --> 02:33:09,668
You would fight me?

1653
02:33:10,692 --> 02:33:11,754
Why not?

1654
02:33:12,610 --> 02:33:14,097
Do you think I am afraid?

1655
02:33:15,571 --> 02:33:18,277
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1656
02:33:18,699 --> 02:33:20,512
Unlike Maximus the invincible,

1657
02:33:21,114 --> 02:33:22,553
who knows no fear?

1658
02:33:28,167 --> 02:33:30,834
I knew a man who once said,
Death smiles at us all.

1659
02:33:32,421 --> 02:33:34,600
All a man can do is smile back.

1660
02:33:36,631 --> 02:33:37,725
I wonder,

1661
02:33:38,761 --> 02:33:40,737
did your friend smile at his own death?

1662
02:33:41,931 --> 02:33:43,143
You must know.

1663
02:33:46,352 --> 02:33:47,602
He was your father.

1664
02:33:52,024 --> 02:33:53,664
You loved my father, I know,

1665
02:33:55,861 --> 02:33:57,056
but so did I.

1666
02:33:59,059 --> 02:34:00,931
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1667
02:34:04,203 --> 02:34:05,975
Smile for me now, brother.

1668
02:34:11,835 --> 02:34:13,107
Strap on his armor.

1669
02:34:13,131 --> 02:34:14,483
Conceal the wound.

1670
02:35:09,101 --> 02:35:11,060
Ring formation!

1671
02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:04,121
Quintus, sword.

1672
02:37:05,968 --> 02:37:07,175
Give me your sword.

1673
02:37:11,181 --> 02:37:12,641
Sword! Give me a sword!

1674
02:37:14,685 --> 02:37:15,845
Sheathe your swords.

1675
02:37:16,379 --> 02:37:18,212
Sheathe your swords!

1676
02:39:33,657 --> 02:39:34,867
Maximus.

1677
02:39:40,372 --> 02:39:41,422
Maximus.

1678
02:39:42,249 --> 02:39:43,225
Quintus.

1679
02:39:45,057 --> 02:39:46,256
Free my men.

1680
02:39:48,088 --> 02:39:50,006
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1681
02:39:52,092 --> 02:39:53,568
There was a dream that was Rome.

1682
02:39:54,845 --> 02:39:56,342
It shall be realized.

1683
02:39:57,264 --> 02:39:59,404
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

1684
02:40:00,934 --> 02:40:02,766
Free the prisoners. Go!

1685
02:40:27,711 --> 02:40:28,750
Maximus.

1686
02:40:30,923 --> 02:40:32,312
Lucius is safe.

1687
02:40:48,815 --> 02:40:49,908
Go to them.

1688
02:41:40,033 --> 02:41:41,243
You are home.

1689
02:42:08,103 --> 02:42:10,306
Is Rome worth one good man's life?

1690
02:42:14,526 --> 02:42:15,837
We believed it once.

1691
02:42:19,531 --> 02:42:21,101
Make us believe it again.

1692
02:42:25,162 --> 02:42:26,851
He was a soldier of Rome.

1693
02:42:31,037 --> 02:42:32,091
Honor him.

1694
02:42:32,961 --> 02:42:34,466
Who will help me carry him?

1695
02:43:19,883 --> 02:43:21,179
Now we are free.

1696
02:43:27,933 --> 02:43:29,443
I will see you again.

1697
02:43:32,687 --> 02:43:33,810
But not yet.

1698
02:43:35,148 --> 02:43:36,091
Not yet.
