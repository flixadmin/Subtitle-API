1
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:08,028
Any chance of getting
this thing running again?

2
00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:10,430
The simplicity
of the thermosiphon cooling

3
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:12,131
is sheer elegance.

4
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:14,099
The capitalist dictate
of constant improvement

5
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:16,102
often pushes us past
the pinnacle of achievement

6
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:18,371
into inferior products.

7
00:00:18,395 --> 00:00:20,172
And this is your brain off of drugs?

8
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:22,842
Hey, don't weed-shame me. I know stuff.

9
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:24,309
Okay, so is that a yes?

10
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,778
Because soon enough, someone's gonna see

11
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:26,912
that J. Edgar Hoover's missing

12
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:28,082
and the timeline's gonna start changing.

13
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:30,149
If I can find some water, yes.

14
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:31,354
Oh! Uh, Gary,

15
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:32,956
can you check the back seat
for some water please?

16
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,555
I think I saw something
under Hoover's coat.

17
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:37,089
Please don't mention his name.

18
00:00:37,113 --> 00:00:39,525
This guy's giving me
terrible indigestion.

19
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:41,828
That's probably all the cigars. Ugh.

20
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:44,151
Or all the bigotry.

21
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,469
Uh, we've got some soda. Does that work?

22
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:53,805
- We'll find out.
- Oh, how about this?

23
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,807
A radio.

24
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:59,100
Oh, we can pick up some newscasts.

25
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,948
The lovely and
lethal Bullet Blondes

26
00:01:03,972 --> 00:01:05,351
remain at large,

27
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,853
last seen driving east
on the Bankhead Highway.

28
00:01:07,877 --> 00:01:09,055
Caution advised.

29
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,490
They are considered armed and dangerous.

30
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:13,492
Huh, I can't believe the name stuck.

31
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:15,127
Yeah, and they didn't mention Hoover,

32
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:17,162
which means they think he's still alive.

33
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:19,120
Yeah. Well, he's not.

34
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:21,889
Wha...

35
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,270
Hey. What's up?

36
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,239
We've gotten out
of tighter spots than this.

37
00:01:27,263 --> 00:01:28,573
Have we?

38
00:01:28,597 --> 00:01:30,942
Mick's gone. Astra's down for the count.

39
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,845
Zari is nursing a broken heart
in a pocket dimension,

40
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,814
- and I killed J. Edgar Hoover.
- And it was an accident.

41
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:38,550
And it could have happened
to any man of steel.

42
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:39,818
That's not funny.

43
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:42,087
I spent my whole life studying history

44
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:44,289
and making sure
it's preserved and passed on.

45
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:45,390
By killing Hoover,

46
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:47,530
I personally messed up
the entire 20th century.

47
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,432
- Look, we're gonna fix it, okay?
- Are we?

48
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:51,368
Because without Gideon or the ship,

49
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:53,035
there's no way you can guarantee that.

50
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:55,572
- Nate, you are spinning.
- I murdered a man, Sara.

51
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:58,207
And for the first time in our lives,

52
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:01,177
we have to accept that
that could be permanent.

53
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,445
- Okay, look...
- Uh, wife? Nate?

54
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:04,714
We got a big problem.

55
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:05,916
Hoover was supposed to be on a train

56
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,751
to New York from Midland this afternoon.

57
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:10,542
If he's not there,
the whole timeline's screwed.

58
00:02:11,444 --> 00:02:12,588
No, it won't be.

59
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:15,285
Nate, history needs saving,

60
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,254
and you are just the man to do it.

61
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:19,623
So long as the world thinks
that Hoover is still alive,

62
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:21,592
then the timeline remains on track.

63
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:23,694
No, no, no. I know what you're thinking.

64
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:25,395
No, there's no way
I can impersonate Hoover

65
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,496
all the way to New York.

66
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,887
I could barely do it
in some Podunk Texas town.

67
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,935
- Gary!
- Huh?

68
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,525
Can you do some kind of spell
and make him look like Hoover?

69
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,544
Technically, yes. But, um...

70
00:02:40,568 --> 00:02:44,233
I'd need some of
Hoover's spit or fingernails...

71
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:52,377
Or hair.

72
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:55,958
We're mobile, people.

73
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:57,260
Well, good.

74
00:02:57,284 --> 00:03:01,516
Because J. Edgar Hoover has
a train to catch.

75
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:16,234
- Synced and corrected by Firefly -
- www.addic7ed.com -

76
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:28,325
I did a spell to resurrect a machine.

77
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:29,793
I don't know what this is.

78
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:32,829
I'd recognize that smug
little smile anywhere.

79
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,531
It is Gideon.

80
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:36,333
She doesn't look like a machine.

81
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:38,969
Well, not a machine exactly, Mami.

82
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:42,472
A computer who speaks.

83
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:43,995
Usually.

84
00:03:44,865 --> 00:03:46,598
Hello, computer.

85
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:49,079
Well, on the upside,

86
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,914
looks like you got
your magic working again.

87
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:54,050
My magic is clearly garbage.

88
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:55,185
Stop that.

89
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:57,954
She's still Gideon though, right?

90
00:03:57,978 --> 00:03:59,208
What's two plus two?

91
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:04,213
There you go.

92
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:10,688
Wow, computers are... are very exciting.

93
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:13,755
Uh... sorry.

94
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,178
- Is it ready?
- Not yet.

95
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:24,780
It needs to fully ferment.
This is just the primary stage.

96
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:26,115
Okay, well, we need to come up

97
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,417
with some kind of distraction
or something,

98
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:28,718
because that train leaves
in five minutes,

99
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:30,219
and Hoover needs to be on it.

100
00:04:30,243 --> 00:04:33,055
And to the public eye, he will be.

101
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,957
Look, because they're not
gonna be looking at him.

102
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:36,692
- No. They...
- What are you doing?

103
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:38,227
Are going to be looking

104
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:41,530
at the most wanted women in America.

105
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:43,266
What?

106
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,167
Oh, I'm not sure about this.

107
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:48,136
Just follow my lead. Come on.

108
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,560
My safe word is core competency.

109
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,942
Coming through here.

110
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:56,645
Look out, we got the Bullet Blondes.

111
00:04:56,669 --> 00:04:58,346
This isn't the last you're gonna hear

112
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,648
of the Bullet Blondes.

113
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:01,082
That's right, coppers.

114
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:02,417
Who you calling the cops?

115
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:03,918
We're the Bureau of Investigation.

116
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:04,953
That's right,

117
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:07,288
and J. Edgar Hoover
always gets his man. Or woman.

118
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:09,758
Or gender non-conforming individual.

119
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:13,161
I need four extra tickets
for my associates.

120
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:15,764
Are those the Bullet Blondes?

121
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:17,865
Well, we're not a pair
of canceled stamps.

122
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:18,934
Pleasure.

123
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,925
Mr. Hoover, let me find some
seats for you and your men.

124
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:30,700
Our most secure cabin
is the honeymoon suite.

125
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:38,452
In the name of J. Edgar Hoover,
I'm commandeering this cabin.

126
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:40,721
Oh, no. No need to commandeer.

127
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:42,389
We don't want to spoil your honeymoon.

128
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:44,292
Spoil? Phonus balonus.

129
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:45,693
Well, after them Palmer raids,

130
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:48,481
we'd be proud to help out
a patriot like Mr. Hoover.

131
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:54,969
- Squeeze on by here.
- Congratulations.

132
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:57,493
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, best wishes.

133
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,045
Whew. That was close.

134
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,402
Can you please take these off now?

135
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,316
What are the Palmer raids?

136
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,718
After World War I,

137
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:13,486
America was freaking out
about Communism,

138
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,390
so Hoover and the DOJ arrested
thousands of immigrants,

139
00:06:17,414 --> 00:06:20,227
union workers, anything that
smelled like organized labor.

140
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:22,262
Real champion of civil liberties.

141
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:24,365
Oh, he pretty much codified racial bias

142
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,799
into our judicial system.

143
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:29,102
Okay, look, morally, he's repulsive.

144
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:31,472
Historically, however,

145
00:06:31,496 --> 00:06:33,940
he's one of the most important
men of the 20th century.

146
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:36,577
He founded the FBI.
He ran it till he died.

147
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:39,832
Yeah, well, great men
aren't usually good guys, so.

148
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:43,950
And that is our cue to disappear.

149
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,353
Oh, B, key me.

150
00:06:46,377 --> 00:06:47,821
The key.

151
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:51,179
Time Bureau manual
and some honeymoon chocolates.

152
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:53,848
Say hi to Z for me.

153
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:05,872
Capi-tans, hey.

154
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:09,074
Are we home yet?
How did your bank robbery go?

155
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:11,711
Did we find out who blew up
the Waverider yet or no?

156
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:14,013
Am I talking too much?
Am I talking not too much?

157
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:16,148
- I think she's a little high.
- I'd say very.

158
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,950
We're still in 1925.

159
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:20,019
And now, we are on a train.

160
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:22,644
What? Where are we going?

161
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:26,659
But really where is
anybody really going?

162
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:28,995
You okay, Z? I thought
you didn't partake.

163
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:30,996
No, no, no.

164
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,633
I know, but you see
I found myself on a journey.

165
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:38,737
And that journey is
with these tiny, little bears.

166
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:42,430
And I'm going on that
journey a la carte.

167
00:07:46,202 --> 00:07:49,281
A la carte. "Allah" carte.

168
00:07:49,305 --> 00:07:50,582
Okay. Well, we'll be upstairs.

169
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:51,817
Yeah, if you need anything,

170
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,785
please don't hesitate
to come and find us.

171
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:56,055
Actually, hesitate a little.

172
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,325
Oh, hesitate a lot.

173
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:01,912
Ew, that's gross, moms.

174
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:08,834
Hey, maybe we won't
even need that potion.

175
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:10,058
We just hide out in the cabin.

176
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:13,304
You in there, Speed?

177
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:15,373
- Speed?
- That was Hoover's nickname.

178
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:17,175
Only his closest friends call him that.

179
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,811
It's Francis Baker. Junior, of course.

180
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:23,348
Oh, the GW boys are gonna go wild

181
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,749
when I tell them I saw you.

182
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:28,186
- Gary, potion.
- Uh, it's frothing and ready.

183
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:30,488
All right. How long does the spell last?

184
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:32,056
Uh, it depends upon your metabolism.

185
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,591
Could be an hour. Could be 24.

186
00:08:33,615 --> 00:08:36,827
Hey, it sounds like Hoover
was a supreme douche.

187
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:39,197
You really sure you want to be him?

188
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:41,354
I have to clean up my mess, B.

189
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:46,459
No, but wait. Wait.
Don't drink it in front of us.

190
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,110
- Did it work?
- We don't know.

191
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,645
Since you drank it
in front of us, we'll only know

192
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:56,213
if the magic works
when someone else sees you.

193
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:58,781
Oh, for the love of...

194
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,550
This is silly.

195
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,908
Let me see your...

196
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:05,744
face.

197
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,380
Edgar. There's that handsome look.

198
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,250
Let me buy you lunch, Speed.

199
00:09:23,274 --> 00:09:26,252
The oysters here give Old Ebbitt's a run

200
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:27,472
for their money.

201
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:39,031
Director of the Bureau
of Investigation at 29.

202
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:41,267
Speed indeed.

203
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,603
I think you fellows will be

204
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:46,260
more comfortable elsewhere.

205
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:53,501
Yeah. Sure. More comfortable.

206
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:09,161
No thank you.

207
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:10,696
She made a little doll.

208
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,497
I wish the Legends
would just get back already.

209
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:13,966
They would know exactly
what to do with her

210
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,801
and her creepy outsider apple art.

211
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,089
They can't find this
Dr. Davies guy soon enough.

212
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:25,077
Gideon!

213
00:10:25,101 --> 00:10:29,203
Great. Now she's broken.

214
00:10:36,044 --> 00:10:38,444
Hey. You okay?

215
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,693
Yeah. Why?

216
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:43,698
Oh, man.

217
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:45,763
Are you mad that we're
honeymooning in your house,

218
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:47,398
after everything
that happened with John or...

219
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:51,608
Shh. Aves, I love you.

220
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:53,376
I love you both.

221
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,240
I love your love.

222
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:57,842
I love that you're loving
each other right now,

223
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,311
even if that love is happening
directly above me

224
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:03,347
while I eat sugar foam.

225
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,650
Okay.

226
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:07,285
Well, if you ever want to talk
or anything, just come find...

227
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:08,586
No, seriously.

228
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,615
I am A-okay. I am golden.

229
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:16,526
You know what?
Just... just hear me out, Z.

230
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,462
No judgment, okay? I'm just...

231
00:11:19,486 --> 00:11:21,664
I think you and Behrad
are very different people,

232
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:24,301
and I think that maybe
your coping mechanisms

233
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:26,725
might not be the same
as his coping mechanisms.

234
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:29,506
You know, honestly, I'm not sure

235
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,274
that I'm doing
this stoned thing correctly,

236
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:35,584
because I either feel,
like, very hungry or tired,

237
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:36,980
all of the time.

238
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:38,648
That can't be it, can it?
Can that be it?

239
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:40,750
I don't know. You're a doer though.

240
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:41,851
You know? You're like me.

241
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,486
Oh, it's true. I love a project.

242
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,054
You love a project.
Let's find you a project.

243
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:47,590
Ooh, cleaning. Cleaning.
That's a good one.

244
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:49,091
I ought to clean this place.

245
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:51,160
I'ma clean this place.
Clean the John vibes.

246
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:53,095
Yes. Yes! That's my girl.

247
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,531
You know, at minimum,
it will give me an excuse

248
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:59,835
to leave this room, because
you guys are very loud.

249
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:02,026
What? Come on. We're not loud.

250
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:06,208
Core competency.

251
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:07,365
Boop.

252
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:12,070
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

253
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:29,331
So tell me. Is there a Mrs. Hoover?

254
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:31,199
Oh, no, ma'am. I'm married to my job.

255
00:12:31,223 --> 00:12:33,934
Oh, well, let me give you my card,

256
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,026
in case you and your job
ever get divorced.

257
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,476
My purse. It's gone.

258
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,111
Never fear, madam.

259
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,237
You have the nation's finest
detective at your service.

260
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:51,908
Should we round up the usual suspects?

261
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,583
Those are my men.

262
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:15,848
No one is leaving this car,
till we get that purse back.

263
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:19,885
Now, what was in your purse?

264
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:21,567
Jewelry?

265
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:27,443
Money?

266
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:33,448
Anything of note?

267
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:40,299
Hmm. My calling card, my comb,

268
00:13:40,323 --> 00:13:41,968
and one of those delightful pastries

269
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:43,670
from the breakfast cart.

270
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:47,062
You never know when you might
get a flash of the grumblies.

271
00:13:57,274 --> 00:13:59,085
Goldie!

272
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:02,255
I believe this is
what you are looking for.

273
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,424
- Huzzah!
- Thank you, Mr. Hoover.

274
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:07,059
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

275
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,494
- Thank you.
- Hip-hip!

276
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:11,551
Hooray.

277
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:20,205
Well, I must get back to work.

278
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:21,807
If only all of the bad guys

279
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:24,577
was easy to catch as Goldie here.

280
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:25,878
Marvelous seeing you,

281
00:14:25,902 --> 00:14:28,547
Francis Baker, Junior, of course. Okay.

282
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:30,482
It's working.

283
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:31,784
They're buying it.

284
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:33,585
Yeah, they're buying that
Gary and I are petty thieves,

285
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:34,687
'cause of our looks.

286
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:37,293
I'm trying to be as authentically
Hoover as possible.

287
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:39,023
I wouldn't mind a little
less authenticity.

288
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,358
- You understand...
- Hey, whoa.

289
00:14:40,382 --> 00:14:42,127
Why don't we go back to Plan A?

290
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:44,085
- Hunkering.
- You're right.

291
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:46,049
We should play it safe,
till we get to New York.

292
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:03,582
- Director Hoover, thank God.
- We just got word from HQ.

293
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:05,217
There's a plot afoot to kidnap you.

294
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:07,274
We need to get you off this train.

295
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:12,679
Give me a minute.

296
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:15,959
I'm sure we can find a way

297
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,361
to get to New York that doesn't involve.

298
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:19,763
- Hoover cosplay or kidnapping...
- Listen.

299
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,866
The real J. Edgar Hoover
was never kidnapped.

300
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,367
- So he must have solved this.
- No.

301
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,369
This is getting way too out of control.

302
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:27,270
I mean, I'm sure we can fix
this with a do-over.

303
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,372
What if there's no more do-overs?

304
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:29,473
What if this is it?

305
00:15:29,497 --> 00:15:31,097
We owe it to history to make it right.

306
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:35,980
Gentlemen, this sounds like a case

307
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:37,867
for the Bureau of Investigation.

308
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,488
Has she had anything to drink?

309
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,056
She doesn't need anything to drink.

310
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,613
She's not a person.

311
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,463
I may not know what a computer is,

312
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,232
but I know a heartbeat.

313
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,055
And you made that, Astra.

314
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:04,239
You are not only a very powerful witch.

315
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,374
You're also a mother now.

316
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,610
- I am nobody's mother.
- Dang.

317
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:12,346
Now, what will the team do
with a human Gideon?

318
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,348
Probably just give her Rory's old room.

319
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:16,650
There's always space
for one more with the Legends.

320
00:16:16,674 --> 00:16:18,652
And where are your Legends now, anyway?

321
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:21,054
They went to New York,
to meet this time travel guy.

322
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:23,646
Once they find him,
they're gonna come get us.

323
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:27,227
Okay. I'm no expert, but seems to me,

324
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:30,831
if you have a machine
that can travel through time,

325
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,532
wouldn't you just go back to right

326
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:35,969
after the moment you left?
I mean, unless...

327
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:37,827
It didn't work.

328
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:46,638
- What was the word from HQ?
- Not a lot of detail.

329
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:50,205
The Dallas field office
intercepted a telegram.

330
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:54,955
"Hoover on tren, northbond".

331
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:56,924
"Train" and "northbound"
are both misspelled.

332
00:16:56,948 --> 00:17:00,282
- So he's a foreigner.
- Or a bad speller.

333
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:03,230
Men in Little Rock are gonna alert D.C.

334
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:05,064
Plan to have agents at
every station along the route.

335
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,166
Good.

336
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,402
Mr. Hoover says
we're looking for a foreigner.

337
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:10,470
- I didn't say that.
- Stay put in here, Mr. Hoover.

338
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:11,805
We'll turn this train upside-down,

339
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,907
till we find our man.

340
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:16,310
Hoover doesn't run
an investigation from behind.

341
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:18,311
All right.

342
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,978
All we got to go on is this telegram,

343
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:22,148
which doesn't give us
a motive or a means.

344
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:26,085
But its timing does narrow down
the list of possible suspects.

345
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,153
Donovan, Rodgers.

346
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:29,088
Get me a list of all the passengers

347
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:31,958
that got on this train
since Midland. Go.

348
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:33,225
On it, sir.

349
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:34,660
The three of us are gonna start

350
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:35,694
at the front of the train,

351
00:17:35,718 --> 00:17:37,096
and we're gonna work our way back.

352
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,264
We're looking for anyone

353
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,388
who has a reason to hurt Hoover.

354
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:45,193
Who would possibly want
to hurt that guy?

355
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:48,762
"Please" would have been nice.

356
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:52,744
Is there anyone on this train

357
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:55,681
you may suspect of having
anti-government sentiment?

358
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:57,249
Anti-government?

359
00:17:57,273 --> 00:17:59,518
The government is the only
thing keeping this country

360
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:01,052
from going to the dogs.

361
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:04,444
Have you heard anyone talk
about anarchy or...

362
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:07,781
socialism?

363
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:09,895
Well, that depends.

364
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,365
Would you call a working wage socialism?

365
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:16,524
Then yeah. I'd say
we're all talking about it.

366
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:20,494
Lovely to see America by train car.

367
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:23,876
Be a lot lovelier
if I wasn't being spied on

368
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,777
by a bunch of dicks.

369
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:28,713
- By "dick" do you mean cop?
- Hmm.

370
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:30,014
Well, you think someone

371
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:32,116
on this train is a ne'er-do-well?

372
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,351
Well, good luck pulling one over

373
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,453
on America's finest law man.

374
00:18:36,477 --> 00:18:38,389
That's very nice of you.

375
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:42,599
Hoover? That man is cursed.

376
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:45,469
You have no idea.

377
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:46,836
Hoover?

378
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,639
Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

379
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:51,997
Ugh, tell me about it.

380
00:18:53,795 --> 00:18:55,872
Everybody on this train loves Hoover.

381
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,741
Yeah, everybody
with first-class tickets.

382
00:18:57,765 --> 00:19:01,244
The people we talked to would
be happy to kill "Hoover".

383
00:19:01,268 --> 00:19:03,847
If we're looking for motive, we got it.

384
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:04,949
Lots of it.

385
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:07,151
Yeah, which is as good
as finding none at all.

386
00:19:07,175 --> 00:19:08,852
We're switching this investigation away

387
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:12,356
from the "why" and onto the "how".

388
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,292
And with agents in every city,
it'll be pretty hard

389
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:17,194
pulling off a kidnapping
in any of the stations.

390
00:19:17,218 --> 00:19:18,295
They'd get caught immediately.

391
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,319
Or congratulated.

392
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:24,201
But if you could get
the train off the main route...

393
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:25,535
No one would be guarding the track.

394
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,738
And if you can redirect the train,

395
00:19:27,762 --> 00:19:29,205
you have control of the train.

396
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:30,941
Ooh! Ooh! Inside job.

397
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:32,476
- Inside job.
- Inside job.

398
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,179
Director Hoover, meet Igor Lewandowski.

399
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:37,447
Train's engineer.

400
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:39,348
A Russian and a labor organizer.

401
00:19:39,372 --> 00:19:40,650
He wasn't scheduled to work today,

402
00:19:40,674 --> 00:19:42,052
but had a change of heart.

403
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:43,620
Joined the crew back in Midland.

404
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:44,921
Awfully convenient.

405
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:46,422
- Did he confess?
- He won't say diddly,

406
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,257
but he's our guy. I'm sure of it.

407
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:49,659
Trust you can get the...

408
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:52,884
confession we need. Do your worst, boss.

409
00:19:54,221 --> 00:19:55,417
Yeah.

410
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:04,340
Oh, boy.

411
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:06,809
Very sad party of one happening here.

412
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,211
Doesn't matter.

413
00:20:08,235 --> 00:20:12,237
Zen in ten, here I come.
Starting with the fridge.

414
00:20:14,807 --> 00:20:18,106
See, even I know you don't keep
whiskey in the fridge.

415
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:38,274
- Aves.
- Hi, Z.

416
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:40,175
How many bottles of whiskey
are there on the table?

417
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:42,077
Um, two.

418
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:43,746
Two!

419
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,681
The fridge is making whiskey.

420
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:47,616
What? That's fantastic.

421
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,585
- The Waverider.
- Yeah?

422
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:53,388
I guess it's kind of like the Waverider.

423
00:20:53,412 --> 00:20:55,757
Although the fridge doesn't
take requests like Gideon.

424
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:58,560
No, no, no, this bottle...
this bottle is the Waverider.

425
00:20:58,584 --> 00:21:02,196
And this bottle is the mystery
Waverider that blew us up.

426
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,425
So if there's two Waveriders,
who's to say there isn't...

427
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:13,029
third Waverider?

428
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,701
And a fourth. It will never end.

429
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:20,748
Oh, I get it.

430
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:22,283
You're still really stoned.

431
00:21:22,307 --> 00:21:24,885
So... so, let's say we go back
and stop the mystery Waverider

432
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,087
from blowing us up. That's great.

433
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:27,422
But that Waverider came from somewhere.

434
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:29,356
Which means if one showed up,
then another one could.

435
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,792
And another, and another, and another.

436
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:33,094
Okay. Wait. Let's just
slow this train down.

437
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:35,729
Take this. Remember this?
Here. Grab this. Hi, hi, hi.

438
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,666
Look, squirt. Squirt, squirt.
Squirt and wipe!

439
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,334
Squirt and wipe, and the
gummies are gonna wear off,

440
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:42,369
and then you're gonna be

441
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:44,437
feeling the natural
high of a job well done.

442
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:46,039
Look. Show me. Show me. I'm watching.

443
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:48,096
- Aves, I...
- Squirt and wipe.

444
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:54,548
You got this. You got this.
You can be mean.

445
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:56,436
You can be mean as hell.

446
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:03,157
He's all ready for you, sir.

447
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:04,691
Good.

448
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:07,150
Uh, "sir", quick word?

449
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:09,863
How are you gonna swing this, Nate?

450
00:22:09,887 --> 00:22:12,098
I don't know. I don't want
to hurt the guy, but...

451
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,499
No way, man.

452
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:15,335
Look, those two agents
are expecting Hoover.

453
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,002
They have all the evidence they need.

454
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:18,071
That's more than enough.

455
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:20,406
It's not enough. I need a confession.

456
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,341
Look, Nate, I know you feel like this is

457
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:23,410
the end of the world,

458
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:26,078
but you're just a good guy
who made a bad mistake.

459
00:22:26,102 --> 00:22:27,947
What was the alternative?
Let him kill you?

460
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,449
You're worth a thousand Hoovers.

461
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:32,518
By comparison to Hoover,
I am nobody in the timeline.

462
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:34,721
Come on, Nate. You know that's not true.

463
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:36,575
You've gotta forgive yourself.

464
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:46,421
This isn't about me.

465
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:52,600
So what are we gonna do?

466
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:54,770
You ever hear the one about
the black lady, the brown lady,

467
00:22:54,794 --> 00:22:57,773
and the broken computer
who walked into a bar, in 1925?

468
00:22:57,797 --> 00:22:59,342
- Uh, no.
- Yeah.

469
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:01,342
Because it would never happen.
Let's face it.

470
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:04,568
There's nothing we can do.
The Legends are on their own.

471
00:23:09,675 --> 00:23:12,740
Great. More decapitated apple heads.

472
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:24,654
I think she's trying to
tell us something, Astra.

473
00:23:26,257 --> 00:23:29,559
An apple a day. Easy as apple pie.

474
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,374
Don't put all your apples in one box.

475
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:35,877
- That is not a thing.
- Okay.

476
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:38,246
It's six apples in a box,
off the table, on the floor.

477
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,681
Thank you, Dr. Seuss.

478
00:23:40,705 --> 00:23:43,039
It's clearly apple...

479
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:46,509
Sauce.

480
00:23:49,814 --> 00:23:51,158
Okay, you know what enough?

481
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:53,159
Just stop trying to tell us things.

482
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:54,427
I wish I could just shove you back

483
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:55,562
in the wires, and the sockets,

484
00:23:55,586 --> 00:23:57,031
or whatever makes you work
on the Waverider,

485
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:59,488
because then maybe
you could actually help us.

486
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,978
So why are you so mad at Gideon?

487
00:24:12,002 --> 00:24:14,014
She hasn't done anything to you.

488
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:15,615
Because...

489
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:18,606
she's a constant reminder
of my giant failure.

490
00:24:19,443 --> 00:24:22,344
That's why you don't want
to go after the Legends.

491
00:24:23,246 --> 00:24:27,432
- I'm useless to them, Spooner.
- You made one mistake, Astra.

492
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:31,525
Ease up on yourself.
At least you still have magic.

493
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:35,334
Hey, you have things to offer too.

494
00:24:35,358 --> 00:24:36,768
Like what?

495
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:39,393
Without aliens, what do
I bring to the table?

496
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:44,910
- Ranch wear?
- Okay. You know what?

497
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:46,812
I guess we're both pretty useless.

498
00:24:46,836 --> 00:24:48,380
You mean the three of us are...

499
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,404
What is that?

500
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,248
Gideon, no!

501
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,121
Gideon?

502
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:16,707
Why did you do that?

503
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:20,100
Wires and sockets. She understood you.

504
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:27,986
Hey, Z.

505
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,454
Can Sara and I grab one
of those bottles of...

506
00:25:30,478 --> 00:25:33,491
- whiskey?
- Oh, hey, girl.

507
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:35,158
Hey, buddy.

508
00:25:35,182 --> 00:25:36,994
Uh, what did we talk about?

509
00:25:37,018 --> 00:25:39,296
More cleaning. No more gummies, yeah?

510
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,632
Oh, no. I'm not stoned. I'm enlightened.

511
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:44,635
See, I finally realize
why John gave me this key.

512
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:47,605
To clear my head and think
about the bigger picture.

513
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,139
See, I was so focused on
my phones, and skincare sales,

514
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:52,209
and romantic entanglements
that I never stopped to think

515
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,912
about what was really
going on with the team.

516
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:57,915
- The team. Our team?
- Yeah.

517
00:25:57,939 --> 00:26:01,452
See, without those distractions
I was able to dig deep

518
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,853
and really think about how we got here.

519
00:26:03,877 --> 00:26:05,922
So I read your Time Bureau
agent manual earlier.

520
00:26:05,946 --> 00:26:08,525
What? That thing's over 200 pages.

521
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:10,026
Yeah, and I started thinking,

522
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,195
it's not about the how they blew us up.

523
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:14,731
It's about the who.

524
00:26:14,755 --> 00:26:17,434
I made a list of suspects.
Do you want to see?

525
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:20,525
- Um, yes. Yes I do.
- Great.

526
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:27,198
Time to spill the beans, Lewandowski.

527
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:32,449
What'd you say?

528
00:26:32,473 --> 00:26:34,717
Please, you're making a mistake.

529
00:26:34,741 --> 00:26:38,042
I'm making a mistake?
I'm making a mistake!

530
00:26:46,286 --> 00:26:48,252
Get out. Out!

531
00:26:55,228 --> 00:26:58,596
No, no, no. Please.

532
00:27:05,405 --> 00:27:08,384
Sounds like he's really
putting the screws on him.

533
00:27:08,408 --> 00:27:09,986
Let me know if he needs backup.

534
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,043
I gotta take a leak.

535
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:18,182
Don't do this, Nate.

536
00:27:23,823 --> 00:27:27,402
What are you doing?

537
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:30,338
I'm trying to tell you that you don't...

538
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:32,374
Have to tell me...

539
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,243
Anything
you don't want to, because...

540
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:38,013
I will find the answers I want...

541
00:27:38,037 --> 00:27:39,603
some other way, okay?

542
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:44,342
This is even worse than last time.

543
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:47,255
I've interrogated you before?

544
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,058
Of course you don't remember.

545
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:54,062
You and your men came
after me and my family,

546
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:58,272
and hundreds of others on your
manhunt for Emma Goldman,

547
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:00,207
back in 1919.

548
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:01,808
I knew nothing about her,

549
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:04,934
but because of your Red Scare,
no one believed me.

550
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:07,842
My wife and children had to flee,

551
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:10,299
and your men beat me for being Russian.

552
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:13,269
I lost everything, because of you!

553
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:21,978
I'm sorry, Igor.

554
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:27,684
That makes total sense why you
were planning on kidnapping me.

555
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,653
Me?

556
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,436
I try to stay as far away
from you as possible.

557
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,971
But when you're looking for enemies,

558
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:38,561
that's all you see.

559
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:43,299
Makes it easy to miss what's
going on right in front of you.

560
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:53,453
Where'd those mountains go?

561
00:28:53,477 --> 00:28:55,288
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

562
00:28:55,312 --> 00:28:58,391
Somebody switched tracks 15 miles back.

563
00:28:58,415 --> 00:29:00,594
Igor, thank you, Igor.

564
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:02,596
I'll untie you in a minute.

565
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,817
Grab him!

566
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,390
Jig is up, Hoover. Get over here.

567
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:12,973
It's kind of silly, huh?

568
00:29:12,997 --> 00:29:14,173
Put on the right kind of suit,

569
00:29:14,197 --> 00:29:16,342
and you can fool anybody you want.

570
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:18,599
Even America's best detective.

571
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:27,552
Pretty dumb pulling
a gun on a Bureau agent.

572
00:29:27,576 --> 00:29:29,722
You think you're the smart guy here?

573
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:32,157
If you hadn't made such
a stink back in Midland,

574
00:29:32,181 --> 00:29:33,993
we never would have known
you were on this train.

575
00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:36,962
Funny thing is we've been
trying to pinch you for months.

576
00:29:36,986 --> 00:29:39,131
Snorky's offering a nice chunk of cash

577
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:41,122
to whoever brings you in first.

578
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:46,872
Snorky. Snorky-Snorky?

579
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:48,941
Who the heck is Snorky?

580
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:51,076
These guys work for Al Capone.

581
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,633
Come out with your hands up, Hoover.

582
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,584
So do all of them.

583
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:02,072
You got two minutes!

584
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:15,037
I ain't got all day, Edgar!

585
00:30:15,061 --> 00:30:18,495
Come out, or we start
popping passengers.

586
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:25,736
Oh, we can totally take these guys.

587
00:30:26,706 --> 00:30:27,938
No.

588
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:32,254
Without Gideon it's hard
to keep track of the timeline,

589
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:34,846
but Hoover wasn't killed
by mobsters, right?

590
00:30:35,615 --> 00:30:37,479
So don't we have to fight?

591
00:30:37,884 --> 00:30:40,162
In the real timeline,
none of this happened.

592
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:42,820
And the world still thinks I'm Hoover.

593
00:30:44,023 --> 00:30:45,890
I'm gonna have to make this right.

594
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:00,671
Come on.

595
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,871
Well, congratulations.

596
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:25,161
You got me.

597
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:31,868
Who are you?

598
00:31:36,674 --> 00:31:37,841
Damn it.

599
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:41,922
Give the multiverse a low probability.

600
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:44,057
- I mean what even is a paragon?
- Mm-hmm.

601
00:31:44,081 --> 00:31:46,860
I think we are onto something
very important here, Z.

602
00:31:46,884 --> 00:31:47,896
Me too, Aves.

603
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,664
Okay, so who's left
on our villains list?

604
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,098
Damien Darhk.

605
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:53,300
Loves us way too much
to kill us I think.

606
00:31:53,324 --> 00:31:56,670
Mm-hmm. Mallus. Malice? Whatever.

607
00:31:56,694 --> 00:31:59,540
Big Beebo... aww, David Bowie.

608
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:01,574
You know, he got that
really great song out of us.

609
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:02,943
- Yeah. It was very catchy.
- Yeah.

610
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,277
Let's put him in the "maybe" pile.

611
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:05,378
Okay.

612
00:32:05,402 --> 00:32:06,980
What about those guys, over there?

613
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:09,449
Ah, these guys over here.
We got time pirates.

614
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:10,784
Time wraiths. Time witches. Clones.

615
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:13,486
Doppelgangers. Ourselves. Time itself.

616
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,223
Okay. Let's call that
the "why the hell not" pile.

617
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:18,043
Copy that.

618
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,183
And then there's this one.

619
00:32:22,854 --> 00:32:26,800
I mean that's too out there, right?

620
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:29,001
Zari, we've been chased by a demon dog.

621
00:32:29,025 --> 00:32:30,870
Who's to say that
we're not being hunted by...

622
00:32:30,894 --> 00:32:34,239
- Sara! Ava!
- Is that...

623
00:32:34,263 --> 00:32:40,068
Guys? Hello? Anybody. Hello?

624
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,470
We got a Hoover-shaped Nate problem.

625
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,573
- That does not sound good.
- Guys?

626
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:46,674
Hate to cut it short,

627
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,142
but we could really use
some backup out here.

628
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:52,067
Yeah, Nate's been kidnapped
by Al Capone's men.

629
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,415
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

630
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:57,985
We need to find a way to stop
this with zero casualties.

631
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,275
What, with weed gummies and magic booze?

632
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,022
- Yes.
- Yes?

633
00:33:03,046 --> 00:33:04,390
I ain't gonna ask you again.

634
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:06,693
We got Hoover. Not some nobody clown.

635
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:08,583
You're right, I am a nobody.

636
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:12,587
But I'm a nobody
who killed J. Edgar Hoover.

637
00:33:13,924 --> 00:33:15,434
- Killed?
- Yeah.

638
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:16,870
I'm surprised to bring in the head

639
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,204
of the Bureau of Investigation.

640
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:20,139
Instead, I got Mr. Nobody.

641
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:22,174
This is not the plan.

642
00:33:22,198 --> 00:33:23,610
Yeah. Tell me about it.

643
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:26,446
Oh, Snorky's gonna pop me, for sure.

644
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,980
That doesn't seem fair.

645
00:33:28,004 --> 00:33:29,615
I mean, how could you have known the guy

646
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:31,617
you were supposed to kidnap
ended up getting killed?

647
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:33,252
Some things are outside of your control.

648
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:35,887
I could just bump you off and
mess your face up real good.

649
00:33:35,911 --> 00:33:37,390
Pass you off as Hoover's body.

650
00:33:37,414 --> 00:33:40,714
You could do that.
May work, for a while, but...

651
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,135
you can't outrun the lie forever.

652
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,271
Eventually, you just end up hurting

653
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:53,939
the people you care about.

654
00:33:53,963 --> 00:33:55,874
Sometimes, it's easier
just to face the music

655
00:33:55,898 --> 00:33:58,166
and accept the fact
that you made a mistake.

656
00:33:59,135 --> 00:34:02,566
Hey, take a deep breath
with me. Come on.

657
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:11,794
Now, repeat after me. I forgive myself.

658
00:34:11,818 --> 00:34:15,664
- I forgive myself.
- There!

659
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:16,932
Now, don't you feel better?

660
00:34:16,956 --> 00:34:18,790
- No.
- Oh.

661
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:22,100
But that makes me feel better.

662
00:34:22,124 --> 00:34:25,037
- You all right there, big guy?
- Better now.

663
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:27,005
Hoover's death must have been
quite the shock,

664
00:34:27,029 --> 00:34:28,774
so we brought you a little something

665
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:30,275
to soothe your grieving souls.

666
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:32,377
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

667
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:34,912
Oh, never-ending, one could say.

668
00:34:34,936 --> 00:34:36,714
Holy smokes.

669
00:34:36,738 --> 00:34:40,943
The Bullet Blondes?
The big fellow loves you gals.

670
00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:46,324
I would like to formally apologize

671
00:34:46,348 --> 00:34:48,081
for how I treated you both.

672
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:50,895
And I would like to ask for a do-over.

673
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:52,852
- Already done.
- My man.

674
00:34:53,822 --> 00:34:55,819
Your photographs don't do you justice.

675
00:35:00,762 --> 00:35:03,493
That's a lot of company,
for the middle of nowhere.

676
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:28,164
Boys. Ladies.

677
00:35:28,188 --> 00:35:29,666
Another Hoover?

678
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:31,923
Thought you said you killed him.

679
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,360
I... I did.

680
00:35:39,174 --> 00:35:40,932
Okay. Two Waveriders and two Hoovers.

681
00:35:40,956 --> 00:35:42,565
That cannot be a coincidence.

682
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:45,424
Is it me, or does he look
even more pissed off now?

683
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,804
We're kidnapping you.

684
00:35:47,828 --> 00:35:49,673
And I'm arresting you.

685
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:51,341
In fact, you're all under arrest.

686
00:35:51,365 --> 00:35:53,076
Over our dead bodies!

687
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,545
Maybe we should just
skedaddle right over here.

688
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:57,699
- Yeah?
- Everybody, take cover!

689
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,299
Get in there. Come on, move it. Go!

690
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:18,889
We can't let Hoover die again.

691
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:22,166
Don't think we need to worry about that.

692
00:36:30,603 --> 00:36:32,303
Jeez, ah!

693
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:37,119
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, slow.

694
00:36:37,143 --> 00:36:38,942
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait...

695
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:41,757
Guys, this is out of control.

696
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:44,193
The timeline's at serious
risk of changing.

697
00:36:44,217 --> 00:36:45,316
What are you doing?

698
00:36:57,129 --> 00:36:58,328
Come on.

699
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:07,303
Oh, no. Did we kill him again?

700
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:13,955
There's no blood.

701
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:16,543
Whoa. That dude is tough.

702
00:37:20,517 --> 00:37:22,429
I don't even think he is a dude.

703
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:23,819
I think he's a...

704
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:32,161
Robot.

705
00:37:33,697 --> 00:37:35,042
What are the chances?

706
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:37,900
Wait, so robots blow up the Waverider?

707
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:43,283
J. Edgar Hoover, a robot.
That explains a lot.

708
00:37:43,307 --> 00:37:45,885
I ate a robot?

709
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:47,320
Sorry, stomach,

710
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:49,389
and small intestine,
and small stomach, and...

711
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:51,958
Gary, shush. Shush.
You did not eat a robot.

712
00:37:51,982 --> 00:37:53,093
You ate the real Hoover.

713
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,394
This... this must be his replacement.

714
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:57,518
You guys, what... what is he doing?

715
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:00,032
Rebooting himself?

716
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:03,835
Self-destruct sequence
initiated. 20 seconds.

717
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:06,004
Um, guys, I don't think that... yeah.

718
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:08,807
We gotta go! Come on. Let's go. Move it.

719
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:11,043
Oh, I hope Spooner and Astra are okay.

720
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,744
They're probably having
the chillest time

721
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:14,380
at Gloria's right now.

722
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:15,900
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

723
00:38:32,754 --> 00:38:35,188
Hey, Gideon. Hey...

724
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:40,771
I'm sorry. I'm so used to the old you.

725
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:43,096
The one who always had all the answers.

726
00:38:43,798 --> 00:38:46,099
I never thought you'd be
the one needing help from us.

727
00:38:47,836 --> 00:38:50,703
Do you think we could try again?

728
00:38:55,244 --> 00:38:59,023
I wish we could figure out
a way to communicate with her.

729
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,847
I mean, she's obviously trying.

730
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:07,186
Amor, you'll find a way. You always did.

731
00:39:09,624 --> 00:39:12,791
Esperanza, you didn't speak
until you were six years old.

732
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,073
I don't remember that.

733
00:39:17,097 --> 00:39:19,876
You communicated with me in other ways.

734
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,479
We always understood
each other, you and I,

735
00:39:22,503 --> 00:39:24,214
even if we weren't using words.

736
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:27,351
You would come over and hug me

737
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:31,109
or hold my hand.

738
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:35,113
Your little touch,
it made me feel heard.

739
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,484
It's your gift, Esperanza.

740
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:43,755
Gracias, Mami.

741
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:03,441
I know this must be tough for you.

742
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,788
I get it.

743
00:40:05,812 --> 00:40:08,558
And it must be really hard
when no one understands

744
00:40:08,582 --> 00:40:10,393
what you're trying to tell them.

745
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:13,296
And I hope you know
that you're not useless.

746
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,653
You're just figuring it out.

747
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,405
I'm terrified. How did I even get here?

748
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:24,172
I'm so lost. Why can't
they understand me?

749
00:40:24,196 --> 00:40:25,907
I can hear her.

750
00:40:25,931 --> 00:40:27,942
I can hear Gideon's thoughts.
She's scared.

751
00:40:27,966 --> 00:40:29,977
- What's she saying?
- Hey, it's okay.

752
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:32,347
Gideon, I'm right here.

753
00:40:32,371 --> 00:40:35,272
Just breathe and focus.

754
00:40:38,844 --> 00:40:40,688
Dr. Davies' machine in New York City.

755
00:40:40,712 --> 00:40:43,391
Time travel experiment
takes place November 7th.

756
00:40:43,415 --> 00:40:45,727
She's saying Dr. Davies'
time travel experiment

757
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:47,261
will take place in New York City,

758
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:48,963
on November 7, 1925.

759
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:52,388
- That's two weeks from today.
- Precisely, Captain.

760
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,905
She's back!

761
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:59,606
That's fantastic. The plan's gonna work.

762
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,675
Two weeks.

763
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:01,877
Maybe that explains
why they're not back yet.

764
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:03,835
But we have to get to Dr. Davies first,

765
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:06,102
or the Legends will die.

766
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:08,068
Or maybe that's why.

767
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:12,475
Pack up that ranch wear.

768
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,545
We've got some Legends to save.
