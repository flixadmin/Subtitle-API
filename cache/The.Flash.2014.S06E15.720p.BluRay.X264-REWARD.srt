1
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:07,549
How do you feel?

2
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:12,346
Wait! Wait, no!

3
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,727
A little dizzy, but otherwise,
I think I'm okay.

4
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:22,190
Welcome to the team, Kamilla.

5
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:26,444
Your creation was unplanned,

6
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,947
but I know you'll make
a useful addition.

7
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,075
- Where's my counterpart?
- She's no longer a problem.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,994
Now, I don't have much time
before Iris realizes I'm gone.

9
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:37,163
So, listen to me. This is important.

10
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:42,460
Six years ago, I created a device
capable of converting light into energy.

11
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:45,088
I called it a Prismatic Refractor.

12
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:47,590
It looked like this.

13
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:50,552
I need you to retrieve it for me.

14
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:02,957
- It's beautiful.
- That's a replica.

15
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:05,775
I made it here in the Mirrorverse,
but my R-CEM rejected it.

16
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,653
I... I believe it needs the original
in order to function.

17
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:09,988
What's the R-CEM?

18
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,824
A thing that will ensure the success
of my long-term plans.

19
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:14,909
Where do we start?

20
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,287
My husband, Joseph, he...

21
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,790
underestimated the value
of the Refractor

22
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,876
and sold it to Mercury Labs
a few months ago.

23
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,128
Find a way in.

24
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,381
Replace the replica out with
the original and you bring it to me.

25
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,427
- Do not let me down.
- Success is assured.

26
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:54,908
I've officially hacked every quantum
kinematic database on the planet.

27
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:58,119
You know what I found out
about artificial Speed Forces?

28
00:01:58,244 --> 00:01:59,579
Thawne built one.

29
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:02,207
And... that's it.

30
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,625
And I doubt he's gonna tell us,

31
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,794
seeing how he's Linda Blaired
our pal Nash,

32
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:09,172
and, you know, he, kind of,
wants to murder the hell out of us.

33
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:11,299
If Thawne can figure it out,
then so can we.

34
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:14,511
In the meantime, we need to make sure
the Flash doesn't lose his powers.

35
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:15,988
- Yeah.
- The Speed Force may be gone,

36
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:18,807
but there's still a residual amount
of speed left in your DNA.

37
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,976
Until we figure out how much,
we need to manage your speed output.

38
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,060
How do we do that?

39
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:25,897
I call it the Speed Gauge.

40
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,108
It will measure the intensity
of the velocity you're using by color.

41
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,569
So, right now, it's black.
That's neutral.

42
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:33,822
Means you're not using any speed at all.

43
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:35,633
If you're using a minimal amount,
that's green.

44
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:37,951
The yellow is next, then orange
and obviously,

45
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:40,537
red is the maximum amount.

46
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,540
At this point, I don't recommend
operating beyond green.

47
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:46,501
And we're not just talking
about running, okay?

48
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,169
- Speed thinking...
- Speed healing.

49
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:51,339
...Flashtime. All of these things
could deplete your meta-abilities.

50
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,175
- You have to be careful.
- Guys, it's not that simple.

51
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,820
I mean,
I'm supposed to keep the city safe.

52
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:57,345
<i>Team Flash!</i>

53
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,805
<i>It's your pal, Nash.</i>

54
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:03,142
<i>- Let me out!</i>
- Guys, are we sure that's Nash?

55
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,769
Or Thawne playing possum?

56
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:06,228
Let's find out.

57
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:11,943
I hear you got an update for me
on the Carver RICO investigation?

58
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:15,113
Just sifting through the paperwork,

59
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:18,199
I found evidence of multiple cover-ups.

60
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:21,369
Homicides being filed as accidents,

61
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:26,249
missing person cases
buried by falsified paperwork...

62
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:27,917
And every victim...

63
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:30,295
has one thing in common.

64
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,964
You think Carver has a mole
inside C.C.P.D.?

65
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:36,718
Somebody has been helping him
evade criminal charges.

66
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:37,802
The question is, why?

67
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:41,055
This is outstanding work, Joe.

68
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,932
But investigating a mole,

69
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,894
that's a job for Internal Affairs,
not for us.

70
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,356
We can't trust IA or anybody
until we find out who Carver's bought.

71
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:51,607
I mean...

72
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,276
Barry agrees.

73
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:55,820
- Hold on. Flash has seen these files?
- Yeah.

74
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:58,197
Joe, this is not meta-related business.

75
00:03:58,907 --> 00:04:01,451
Is there a chance
that this is becoming personal?

76
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,537
I mean, I would totally understand,
given what Carver's done to Iris.

77
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,348
This is still about bringing
a criminal to justice.

78
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,333
And we will.

79
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,210
But, Joe,
this is your first year as captain.

80
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:14,172
If your people think you suspect
one of them of being a mole

81
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,340
and you're wrong...

82
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,592
Have a look.

83
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,096
So, this Thawne...

84
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:25,141
Got the red eyes and vibrates, but...

85
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,936
he's also a Wells.

86
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,354
Yeah, that's him.

87
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:33,345
- How did you...
- I've been seeing a lot of Wells lately.

88
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:35,317
I mean...

89
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,405
Up here. A lot.
I don't know how many there are, but...

90
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:43,117
The Wizard Wells, annoying.
French Wells.

91
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:45,954
New York City Wells.
Actually, he's all right. And then...

92
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:48,737
- Harry Wells.
- Nash...

93
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:51,292
Harry's dead.

94
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:52,376
They're all dead.

95
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,671
Hey, guys. I think you should see this.

96
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:57,382
Let's go. Let... Come on!

97
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,801
- Let me out.
- So, at first glance,

98
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:04,263
Nash's brainwaves seem totally normal.
No anomalies or inconsistencies.

99
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,891
But when I take a look at them in 3D,

100
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:09,644
it appears that
there are multiple brainwaves

101
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,437
intricately tangled together.

102
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,108
When the multi-verse collapsed
in Crisis,

103
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:18,191
all of the Wellses must have channeled
into the only surviving doppelganger.

104
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:21,197
Multiple psyches camped out
in Nash's brain.

105
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,449
It's like Tyler Durden times a thousand.

106
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:24,677
Tyler Durden, great reference.

107
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:28,162
- First rule of <i>Fight Club</i> is...
- Hey, can we not talk about <i>Fight Club?</i>

108
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,641
Yeah, that's it. So how many Wells
are we talking about here?

109
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,667
How many universes were there
in the multi-verse?

110
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,043
What?

111
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:35,980
Yeah, wait... No.
This doesn't make any sense.

112
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:37,630
I mean, Thawne wasn't even a real Wells.

113
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:40,717
He killed Harrison Wells, took over
his body and fooled us for months.

114
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,528
This is the psychopath
we're talking about

115
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:43,988
that is trying to take over my body.

116
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:46,723
Let's get him out before he resurfaces.
Come on!

117
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:48,766
I mean, there is no medical procedure
or device

118
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,518
that could separate brainwaves.

119
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,895
Not on this stupid Earth,
there's not, but hello...

120
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,148
Multi-versal traveler, anyone, right?

121
00:05:55,231 --> 00:06:00,153
I have a neuro-splicer here, in my bag.
Can you... can you get it, please?

122
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:01,279
Will work just fine.

123
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,031
Actually helped me out to stop
an invasion

124
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:05,742
of psychic starfish on Earth-26.

125
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,160
In the little... Yeah, that's it.

126
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:09,120
That was not pretty, although...

127
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:12,707
To be honest,
I don't know if the splicer can

128
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:15,126
separate thousands of brainwaves
all at once.

129
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:18,588
It will be, if we supercharge it
with the EMP from your gauntlet.

130
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:22,049
Yes.

131
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,260
Yes, the gauntlet, yes.

132
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,721
Just make sure
that when you charge the EMP,

133
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:29,265
that it's 1,500 volts per meter.
Otherwise, you risk...

134
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,868
I know. I know. Otherwise,

135
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:32,119
- I'll fry the circuitry.
- You'll fry the circuitry.

136
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,936
- I got it.
- Cisco, wait.

137
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:45,531
That was Thawne the whole time?

138
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:46,717
He couldn't have gotten far.

139
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,781
He doesn't have his powers,
so he can't time travel.

140
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:50,202
Yes, he can.

141
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,883
Look at us, Flash.

142
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:09,472
Two peas in a pod, just two speedsters
frustrated by the limits of their speed.

143
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:10,890
I'm nothing like you.

144
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,892
No, I'm the one
who's gonna get his speed back,

145
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,185
and when I do...

146
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:20,733
When I gain control of this body,
when I reconnect to my Speed Force,

147
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:21,817
you...

148
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,613
You're gonna be too weak
to stop me, aren't you?

149
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,990
Just like you were powerless

150
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,450
to save...

151
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,701
your daughter.

152
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:34,205
I miss my Little Runner.

153
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,832
Nora was never yours!

154
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,042
Do it. Do it.

155
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:42,463
I wonder, how much speed will you
have left after I'm gone?

156
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,340
Barry, no!

157
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,113
He tricked us.

158
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,489
Again.

159
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:12,326
Should've known supercharging the EMP
would cause a recoil loop.

160
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,744
Thawne always has a backup plan.

161
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:16,390
I checked the footage.
Thawne only went to the Starchives,

162
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:17,790
nowhere else.

163
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:18,916
How's Nash?

164
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,752
Better, now that
you're not trying to kill him.

165
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:24,797
Were you really going to do it?

166
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:31,262
- I don't know.
- Nash needs help,

167
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,345
not maiming.

168
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:34,765
You can't be here, Barry.

169
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:37,977
Why not?

170
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,439
Because your Speed Gauge registered
a massive loss of speed,

171
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,150
which means, not only does
using your powers affect it,

172
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,735
but so does your anger.

173
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,278
Caitlin, I'll be fine, all right?

174
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,323
And if I need more speed,
I'll use a booster like Velocity-X.

175
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:53,659
Oh, great. So, you're just gonna start
taking speed steroids now?

176
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:56,495
Barry, every test we've run
says that physiologically,

177
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:57,788
you have changed drastically.

178
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:01,000
So, we have no idea
what Velocity-X would do to you.

179
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,002
It could hurt you,
it could hurt others...

180
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,295
Other people are already hurt.

181
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,881
I mean, we have no idea
what Thawne is doing to Nash right now.

182
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,967
And he could do even more damage to you,
if he gets under your skin again.

183
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:15,681
Look, I know this is hard for you.

184
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:18,684
But you need to leave.

185
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:21,854
You can't trust yourself around him.

186
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,815
What you mean is,
you can't trust me around him.

187
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,534
Okay. Got your message about Thawne,
so I brought holy water,

188
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:39,664
uh, garlic, wooden stake,

189
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,166
salt, obviously,

190
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,585
and Ouija board.

191
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:46,587
- Cecile!
- What?

192
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,339
It's an exorcism.

193
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,675
It's not like we can be too prepared.

194
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,344
This isn't some kind
of vampire demon.

195
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,427
This is...

196
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:58,182
- This is something else.
- Oh, my God.

197
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,768
Everything that Nash is feeling inside
is still just...

198
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,145
raw hatred.

199
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:04,647
What we think of as Thawne

200
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,442
is actually just a series
of negative tachyons inside Nash's body.

201
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,319
So we gotta hit him
with positive tachyons

202
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:11,445
to force Thawne out.

203
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:16,325
That's why we need the PTD,
or the "Positive Tachyon Device,"

204
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:18,786
and not a Ouija board, no offense.

205
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:19,996
Okay, so...

206
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:23,346
- what do you need me for?
- You're gonna be my "Thawne Detector."

207
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,918
I need you to psychically monitor Nash

208
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:29,046
and tell me when he's free
from Thawne's influence.

209
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,400
You think you can handle that?

210
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:34,260
After what Thawne did
to the people that we love?

211
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:38,222
- Hell, yeah.
- Then it's time for an exorcism.

212
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,150
Worshipping a plant.
People are idiots.

213
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:51,986
Hey. Hey! Kid.

214
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,071
How did you get in here?
How did you get past my...

215
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:56,865
security drone?

216
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,619
All right. Who are you?

217
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:01,985
- What's your name?
- It's Maya.

218
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,331
You actually got it.

219
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:06,500
No one's ever pulled the Blood Bloom
out of the Wollip's mouth before.

220
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,546
Yeah, right. Well, the "Wollip," kid,

221
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,507
is just a statue rigged by the locals,
that's all.

222
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,008
I know.

223
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:16,259
You do?

224
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,054
You gonna get the treasure
out of the Bloom?

225
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:19,637
Yeah, I'm gonna...

226
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,641
get the treasure out of the Bloom.
What...

227
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:26,270
- You mean the crystals?
- No, I mean the treasure...

228
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:27,938
- What treasure?
- ...inside.

229
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:30,074
I don't know if they're...
Hey, hey, hey! Oh!

230
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:33,777
This?

231
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,822
It's worth three times more
than those dumb crystals.

232
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,165
I'm impressed, kid.

233
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,875
But...

234
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:50,582
you broke one of the rules.

235
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:53,297
You see, you never give anybody anything

236
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:54,924
unless you get something in return.

237
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:57,467
Nice hat.

238
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,307
Now, scram.

239
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:06,352
And when you tell your parents
where you got the hat from,

240
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,479
make sure you tell 'em you earned it.

241
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,481
I don't have parents.

242
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,650
Not anymore.

243
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:17,488
Maya.

244
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:23,358
How'd you like to do what I do?

245
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:24,661
What's that?

246
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:25,912
Mythbusting.

247
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,833
Archeological mythbusting.

248
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,103
That's what all this is for.
You like the sound of that?

249
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:32,753
- Yes.
- Yeah.

250
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,339
Yeah, I think you'll be good at it.

251
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:36,632
Now, rule number one...

252
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,968
The prize is everything.

253
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,178
Are you gonna remember that?

254
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,557
The prize is everything. Easy-peasy.

255
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:55,484
<i>Cisco, Nash is hurting.</i>

256
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:56,819
<i>What's happening?</i>

257
00:12:56,944 --> 00:13:00,114
<i>I'm not sure.
It's my first exorcism.</i>

258
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:04,285
<i>Welcome to Hell.</i>

259
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,370
I can't be here.

260
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,831
Too late.

261
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,962
All the pain that's being brought up
in Nash, it's overwhelming him. It's...

262
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,048
That's how Thawne gains his strength.
He feeds on that pain.

263
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:19,925
Then he's feasting on Nash.

264
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,240
From what we've heard
at <i>The Citizen,</i>

265
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:28,392
Mercury Labs is making
massive developments in clean energy.

266
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:31,479
We are and Dr. McGee is thrilled
to speak to you about it.

267
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,522
If you'll wait right here,
I'll go grab her.

268
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:34,606
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

269
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,195
Is this the place?

270
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:43,240
According to my readings,
the Prismatic Refractor is...

271
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,329
here.

272
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:49,538
Nice.

273
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:02,259
- Another light-based meta?
- Must be one of Carver's.

274
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,595
Which means he's after
the Refractor, too.

275
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:05,678
We gotta get out of here.

276
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,267
But the Refractor... Eva said...

277
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:13,521
No, don't worry.
We'll let the Flash handle this one.

278
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,836
It's a meta robbery at Mercury Labs.

279
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,880
- Okay, I'll meet you there.
- No, Frost and I can handle this.

280
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,632
You need to stay here
and conserve your speed.

281
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:24,572
Doctor's orders.

282
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,825
- But, Caitlin, I...
- Doctor's orders.

283
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:39,421
- Put that down.
- Not happening.

284
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:43,801
Fine. Have it your way.

285
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,181
So,
you're the ice queen, huh?

286
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:50,766
What do they call you?

287
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,728
Call me...

288
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:57,772
Sunshine.

289
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:02,611
<i>Ice versus sun. Guess who melts?</i>

290
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,008
Flash? I said I had this handled.

291
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,451
Don't worry. This won't take long.

292
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,303
Flash, no!

293
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,392
Dr. Light sends her regards.

294
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,189
- Frost!
- Word around Black Hole is,

295
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,067
you're quite the badass.
You could've been one of us.

296
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,069
Freeze!

297
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,690
Frost.

298
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:54,204
You okay? Come on.

299
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:08,135
So, we're looking at not one or two,
but three Black Hole light assassins.

300
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,137
All of them are under Carver's payroll.

301
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,139
Each one more powerful than the last.

302
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:16,477
Sunshine reopened Frost's wound
from Dr. Light's photon bullet.

303
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,103
Her ice healing's working overtime.

304
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:22,316
This is my fault. If I had just listened
to Caitlin and stayed behind...

305
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,399
Hey.

306
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,320
You had a glitch in
your speed back there, didn't you?

307
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:29,990
I used Velocity-X to boost my powers,
but my body rejected it.

308
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:31,176
Caitlin warned me it could happen.

309
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,035
Look, I know
you don't like taking a backseat,

310
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,204
but until you can manage
your powers, Barry...

311
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:36,747
I know, I have to be more careful.

312
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,375
Do we know anything about Sunshine?

313
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,711
Only that she can disappear in sunlight
and melt steel.

314
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,380
Her name is Millie Rawlins.

315
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,840
Kamilla took a photo
before we got out of Mercury Labs.

316
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,593
We ran it through S.T.A.R. Labs
facial recognition and got a hit

317
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:51,387
at the Department of Defense's database.

318
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,055
Ex-military, special ops.

319
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,349
She, uh, was transferred
to the covert division

320
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:57,059
after the particle accelerator explosion

321
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,022
left her with the meta-ability
to bend sunlight.

322
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,938
Her call sign was "Sunshine."

323
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,068
- Do we know what she was after?
- Yup.

324
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:11,740
Mercury Labs says it's a one-of-a-kind,
advanced energy converter.

325
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:14,660
It used to be owned
by McCulloch Technologies.

326
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,204
They're calling it
a Prismatic Refractor.

327
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,375
Carver was stealing
his own technology? Why?

328
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,627
We don't know why yet, but...

329
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,839
I'm glad you two are okay.

330
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:29,549
Iris...

331
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:32,177
Oh, um...

332
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,931
Sorry, babe, my reporter brain...

333
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,224
- I'm glad you're okay.
- Yeah.

334
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,811
Shouldn't that thing be at C.C.P.D.
in evidence lockup?

335
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:45,649
Well, if Carver's trying to get this,
we can't risk his mole gaining access.

336
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,276
I put in a call to A.R.G.U.S.

337
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,088
Until they have it in their custody,
I'm not letting it out of my sight.

338
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:53,157
Well, we... we could keep it here
at S.T.A.R. Labs for the time being.

339
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,326
If Sunshine is as ruthless
as Dr. Light and Ultraviolet,

340
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,245
then she's coming
after that Refractor again.

341
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,913
And if she shows up at S.T.A.R. Labs,

342
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,393
the Flash isn't going
to be able to do anything to stop her.

343
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,418
Let A.R.G.U.S. take it.

344
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,340
Barry is right
about Sunshine.

345
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:12,569
What if she strikes
during the transfer to A.R.G.U.S.?

346
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,012
Let me worry about that.
Go see after your husband.

347
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,266
Yeah, yeah.
Of course, I was just about to.

348
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,275
You wanna get away?

349
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,360
I just needed a place to think.

350
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,197
Look, I know losing your speed is...

351
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,239
scary,

352
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,910
especially with Thawne showing up.

353
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,788
But, Barry, the man that I love
would not let limits

354
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,706
keep him from doing what he does best...

355
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,835
Taking down metas and protecting people.

356
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,922
The Flash isn't supposed
to have limits, Iris.

357
00:18:55,886 --> 00:19:00,098
Look, if Thawne gets his powers back,
I won't be able to stop him.

358
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,725
Just like I can't stop Sunshine.

359
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,311
Well, maybe the Flash
can't stop them, but...

360
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:06,771
Barry Allen can.

361
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,400
I mean, so what the Flash can't run
as fast as he used to?

362
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,737
Barry Allen was taking down villains
long before the Flash came along.

363
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,575
Barry, you are just as much of a hero
as the Flash.

364
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,456
That's why the city gave you
the Medal of Honor.

365
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:26,333
I mean, are you really gonna let
C.C.P.D. handle Sunshine by themselves?

366
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,586
I don't see how I can help them
without my speed.

367
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:32,214
Barry, it's like,
you're stuck on this idea

368
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,590
that the Flash is supposed to be

369
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,384
limitless, but...

370
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,970
metas are the ones that have limits.

371
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:41,974
I mean, think about it. Where would
the Ringmaster be without his rings?

372
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,309
Or Cicada without that dagger?

373
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,187
Even Reverse-Flash and Sunshine,
they have their limits.

374
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,775
You just have to figure out
what they are.

375
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:56,737
You're right.

376
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,825
Sunshine does have limits.

377
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:02,451
I have to find Joe.

378
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,380
Hey, Kamilla.

379
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,757
I know where the Refractor's going.

380
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,593
Get ready to move fast.

381
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:22,413
<i>Why are you keeping me here?</i>

382
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,559
I went through your memories, Nash.

383
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,895
I plumbed your depths.

384
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,146
Came up with this little gem.

385
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:31,731
It's awful.

386
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:34,568
Isn't it? It's dark.

387
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,154
It's negative.

388
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,238
<i>Nash!</i>

389
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,533
<i>- Nash!</i>
- Maya.

390
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,244
Quite the overachiever. Right?

391
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:49,124
Perfect employee. A real go-getter.

392
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,502
When she went to go get
the sonic emitter

393
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,881
on the top of the highest peak
of Corto Maltese. Remember that?

394
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,842
And plucked that,
so determined to get the emitter.

395
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,261
Because, after all...

396
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,349
the prize is everything.

397
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:08,602
- Isn't it?
- Let me go!

398
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,854
Want out of this memory?

399
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,899
Be my guest.

400
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,570
You don't wanna leave this memory?
Why? Did...

401
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,115
- Did something happen in that cave?
- It was not my fault.

402
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,534
- It was not my fault. It was her fault.
- That's right.

403
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:25,661
It was not my fault.

404
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,082
- She died.
- It's not my fault.

405
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,209
It was all your fault.

406
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,504
It was her fault. It was not my fault.

407
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,298
It was not my fault.

408
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,426
I don't understand.
I've got the PTDs on full blast.

409
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,762
Thawne's negative tachyon
should be destabilizing,

410
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,056
but the neuron data isn't showing
any resistance.

411
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,739
If anything, his energy is intensifying.

412
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,394
What the hell's
he doing to you in there?

413
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,521
I can barely even feel Nash anymore.
I just...

414
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:56,942
All I... All I feel is fear and shame

415
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,319
all around him. I can't... I can't...

416
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,603
- I don't think I can take it any...
- Cecile, you okay?

417
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,116
Almost there.

418
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:15,627
These won't hold me.

419
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,178
What the hell just happened?

420
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,055
Thawne just connected
to his Speed Force.

421
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,058
If that happens again,
we lose Nash forever.

422
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,646
And the Reverse-Flash lives again.

423
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,075
A.R.G.U.S. secure transport
should be here any minute, Captain.

424
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,660
Good job, Korber.

425
00:22:48,744 --> 00:22:50,912
Let me know as soon as they land.
Thanks.

426
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,751
- Hey!
- Captain.

427
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:59,358
I understand you're moving that thing
out of C.C.P.D. custody.

428
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,882
- I'm here to oversee the transfer.
- Really? Why?

429
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,179
Well, I did a little lunchtime reading
as you suggested.

430
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,306
And I agree with you.

431
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,602
I think Carver has someone
on the inside.

432
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,896
And we need
to investigate this ourselves.

433
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:17,396
Thank you, David.

434
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,045
I knew I picked the right man
to lead this precinct.

435
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:25,530
They're here. East loading dock.

436
00:23:25,614 --> 00:23:26,614
- Let's roll.
- All right.

437
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,802
Thank you for coming, gentlemen.
We're all set?

438
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:48,845
- We're all set, Chief.
- Here it is.

439
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,431
Look out!

440
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,605
- Watch yourselves.
- Where'd she go? Where'd she go?

441
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,548
No one else
has to burn, gents.

442
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:09,032
Back, back, back, back, back, back!

443
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,867
Just turn over the Refractor.

444
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,536
We're not giving you a damn thing!

445
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,214
- Joe.
- Here.

446
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,373
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

447
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,134
Oh.

448
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:16,016
No!

449
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:21,604
Yup.

450
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,774
You're helio-kinetic.
So, without access to sunlight,

451
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,693
you're just an ordinary thief.

452
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,156
Limits suck, don't they?

453
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,204
So our house is clear.

454
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,087
The Refractor's safe and sound
with A.R.G.U.S.

455
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:40,749
You sure you're okay, Chief?

456
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:43,251
Yeah, I got a hard head.
Just ask my husband.

457
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,839
Hey, Joe, what if Sunshine was our mole?

458
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,842
No one would've seen her
doctor those files.

459
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:55,555
She is the perfect invisible agent.

460
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:58,767
Look, if we pin her down here,

461
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,187
she can be the brick
for building Carver's RICO case.

462
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,065
- You coming?
- No, you go ahead.

463
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,983
I have something else
I have to take care of.

464
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,655
<i>Why isn't this working?</i>

465
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:13,949
Thawne's tachyons
are proliferating at a rate

466
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,076
that exceeds the PTD's capabilities.

467
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,329
So, it's just a matter of time
before Thawne takes over Nash's body.

468
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:20,914
What happens to Nash,

469
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,416
and to the other Wellses?

470
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,001
They'll be in a living hell.

471
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,296
Trapped inside Thawne's psyche forever.

472
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:32,050
He'll be able to siphon their knowledge.

473
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:35,512
If he gets loose, we can't risk
him having Nash's mind and his gadgets.

474
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,222
We have to destroy these.

475
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,435
- Is that Allegra?
- No, it's a doppelganger.

476
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,272
Maybe that's why Nash
hung around so much.

477
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,023
Allegra reminds him of someone he knew.

478
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,526
Reminds him...

479
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,403
Reminds him.

480
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:54,281
Everything that he's been feeling,

481
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:57,075
all of his emotions, they remind me

482
00:26:57,492 --> 00:27:01,037
of how I feel when I think
about Joanie or Jenna. It's...

483
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:04,082
It's almost parental.

484
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,626
But it's not just that. It's mixed

485
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:11,256
with the feeling that I had in '95
when my mom passed away.

486
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:16,177
Grief. Oh, my God, Cisco.

487
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:20,432
I think that Nash is caught up in a loop

488
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:24,978
and it's made out of
remorse and sadness.

489
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,022
- Negativity.
- I think that

490
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,773
Allegra's doppelganger died.

491
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:31,318
What could be more painful
than the loss of a child?

492
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,154
Cecile, if you're right,

493
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,282
then Thawne is holding Nash
in the memory of her death.

494
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,327
That's why Nash has to be the one
to expel Thawne.

495
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,036
We're gonna help him.

496
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,789
The M.A.D. 2.0...

497
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,676
We used it to get inside
The Thinker's mind.

498
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,169
This time, we're going inside Nash's.

499
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,837
And together, we'll force Thawne out...

500
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:52,380
from the inside.

501
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,725
You sure you wanna do this?

502
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:05,602
We can't risk you losing any more speed.

503
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,604
I won't. Trust me.

504
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,858
Hang on, boys.
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

505
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:18,114
<i>It was not my fault.
It was not my fault.</i>

506
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:21,743
Not my fault.

507
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,912
Not my fault, it's not my fault.

508
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,185
It's time for you to go, Thawne.

509
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,799
You're too late, Flash.

510
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,636
Nash is mine.

511
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:41,678
Nash.

512
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,432
- Not yet, he isn't.
- Hey. Hey.

513
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:46,016
Cisco.

514
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:48,353
You came for me.

515
00:28:48,354 --> 00:28:51,356
Yeah, but you're the only one
who can get yourself out of here, Nash.

516
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,125
You want Nash,
you're gonna have to go through me.

517
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:56,236
Aren't you a glutton for punishment.

518
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,447
Always there
to bear witness to the death

519
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:02,200
of someone you're trying
to desperately save.

520
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,827
No, you're not gonna win this time.

521
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,495
I think I am. Look at him.

522
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,664
Whatever is in there,
I think you need to go face it.

523
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,999
- No, no, I can't go in there.
- He's weak,

524
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:14,045
he's pathetic,
he's limited by his emotions,

525
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,256
just like you.

526
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,424
He wants you to stay here.

527
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,676
The more you suffer,
the stronger he gets!

528
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,678
- No, no.
<i>- The prize is everything.</i>

529
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:24,002
Allegra's doppelganger.

530
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,767
That's her, isn't it? She's in there.

531
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:28,851
Maya.

532
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:30,979
Her name was Maya.

533
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:32,647
In a few short moments, I'm gonna...

534
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:38,820
bust through Cisco's tachyon field
and then...

535
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,865
Then the fun's really gonna begin,

536
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:46,494
all fueled by poor Nash's grief
for his precious daughter.

537
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:50,498
You know a few things about grief

538
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:52,834
for a precious daughter, don't you?

539
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,464
No. Barry.

540
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,049
Barry, come on.

541
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,343
Don't let him get to you.
Don't let him get to you.

542
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:05,138
You didn't make the most of your time

543
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:07,098
with your daughter.

544
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:12,687
I taught her everything I know,
while you sat by and did nothing!

545
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:16,083
She made a bad choice, that's all.
She just made a bad choice.

546
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:17,501
- That's all...
- Nash, listen to me.

547
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,165
- She made a bad choice...
- Listen to me!

548
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:20,612
No, I cannot!

549
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,339
If you don't go into that cave,
you're gonna die.

550
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:23,698
I cannot go in that cave!

551
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:28,495
All you did was stifle her abilities.

552
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:31,998
You were an awful father to her.

553
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,297
I miss my daughter every day.

554
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:43,760
But I'm done letting that
give you power over me.

555
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,711
I watched Cynthia die...

556
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,770
and it hurt me in places
I didn't even know I could feel pain.

557
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:57,815
But I couldn't avoid it.

558
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,028
You can't heal if you avoid it.

559
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:07,158
You think that Nash and I
are limited by our emotions.

560
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,077
But you're wrong.

561
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,037
They give us our strength.

562
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:14,541
And we can use them
to overcome anything,

563
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:16,625
including you.

564
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,421
That's your greatest flaw, Thawne.

565
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:23,883
Metas are the ones with limits,

566
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:26,051
not people.

567
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,888
Not me,

568
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:31,349
and not Nash.

569
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,912
You have to face that memory.

570
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:37,355
And when you do,
I'll be here waiting for you.

571
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:40,774
I promise.

572
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,623
No, you're not getting past me.

573
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,638
You got this, Maya. Easy-peasy.

574
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,903
Nash, the last memory cell is here.

575
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,363
Grab it and I'll pull you back up.

576
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,239
Don't do it.

577
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:31,658
You got it?

578
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,082
I guess the cave doesn't wanna
let this thing go. It's stuck.

579
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:40,960
All right, well...
Okay, you're at... you're at the end.

580
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:43,087
- Don't do it.
- Remember your training.

581
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,384
The prize is everything.

582
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:49,718
Stop her.

583
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,184
The prize is everything.

584
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,559
No.

585
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,607
I got it!

586
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,733
Easy-peasy.

587
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,862
Easy-peasy.

588
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:11,406
Maya.

589
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:13,575
Nash!

590
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:15,745
Maya. Maya!

591
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:17,788
Maya. Maya!

592
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,125
Let it go.

593
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:23,585
Let it go.

594
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:25,879
Maya.

595
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:28,424
No!

596
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,929
No!

597
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,685
Oh, no.

598
00:34:09,674 --> 00:34:10,967
It was my fault.

599
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,304
She only did what I taught her to do.

600
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:20,643
It was my fault.

601
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,021
It was my fault.

602
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,482
Nash has taken control
of his pain.

603
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:29,610
- No.
- You can't feed off of him anymore.

604
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:30,902
No!

605
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,040
- It's over, Thawne.
- No!

606
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:49,129
Nash!

607
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:50,840
No.

608
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:53,259
No!

609
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,579
Hey, Nash, hey, I'm here.

610
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,665
- Are you okay?
- I will be.

611
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,417
I need a nap.

612
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:28,586
You're okay. You're okay.

613
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,296
Nash...

614
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,298
I'm here. I'm here.

615
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:36,636
It was my fault.

616
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,766
It was all my fault.

617
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:55,655
The satellite scans say
there are no traces

618
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,615
of Thawne's negative tachyons
to be found

619
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,700
in any organic matter on the planet.

620
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:03,120
As for Nash, Cecile confirmed
that she didn't feel any

621
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:04,404
of Thawne's energy inside him.

622
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:09,043
According to three-dimensional imaging,
Nash's brainwaves are Thawne-free.

623
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:13,339
I guess this means S.T.A.R. Labs
has successfully completed

624
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:15,550
its very first exorcism.

625
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,260
Thawne's gone, for now.

626
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:21,097
Right. Thawne's tachyons might have
dissipated, but they weren't destroyed.

627
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:22,598
Which means he's not dead.

628
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:24,599
Just formless.

629
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,228
He's probably out there looking
for another body right now.

630
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:30,314
Like a red-eyed, pissed off Voldemort.

631
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:32,024
When he comes back, we'll be ready.

632
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,737
I'm gonna go check on Nash.
Are you, uh...

633
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:39,614
Are you good?

634
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:41,242
Yeah.

635
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:43,369
I have someone I should check on, too.

636
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:49,583
What was it like?

637
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,878
Like being in fog.

638
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:53,170
You know what it was like?

639
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:55,214
It was like being underwater.

640
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:57,049
I... I could see, I could hear,

641
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:58,925
but it was...

642
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,470
It was hazy. I couldn't do anything.

643
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:04,223
Well, basically, it sucked.

644
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,640
You're free of it.

645
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,559
Free of Thawne.

646
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:10,396
As for the other Wellses,

647
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:14,442
their brainwaves are unfortunately
still entangled with yours.

648
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:18,738
So, they're as much a part of you now,
as yourself.

649
00:37:18,821 --> 00:37:19,821
Right.

650
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:21,741
Wait, what?

651
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:22,824
Mmm-hmm.

652
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,661
You mean, I'm gonna keep hearing them?

653
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:27,347
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna keep seeing them?

654
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:28,371
Yeah.

655
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,376
Crisis of Infinite Wells.

656
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,879
Well, I've had worse. Hey, look...

657
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:36,881
Credit where credit's due.

658
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,758
I know that without your help,

659
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:41,677
we don't get the psychopath
out of my body.

660
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:42,761
So, for that,

661
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:45,014
I'm grateful.

662
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:46,765
Thank you.

663
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:49,977
See you around Earth-Prime, kid.

664
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:52,021
Aren't you forgetting something?

665
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:53,521
I...

666
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,358
No, I don't think so.

667
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:04,367
I made a lot of discoveries

668
00:38:04,992 --> 00:38:06,035
in my career, but...

669
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,288
she was the best discovery.

670
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:14,752
You know, she treated... She was...

671
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:19,507
She was like a daughter...

672
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,513
to me, so...

673
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,101
- And Allegra?
- What about Allegra?

674
00:38:30,184 --> 00:38:32,395
Sure, she's not Maya, but...

675
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,481
you did help her with her powers.

676
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,167
But you know,
we got off to a rocky start.

677
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:39,193
There's no point in making it
a rocky ending.

678
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,653
- Nash.
- What?

679
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,823
- Pick a Wells. Any Wells.
- Do I have to?

680
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:46,993
No, it doesn't matter. I got off
to a rocky start with all of 'em.

681
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:48,494
- What's your point?
- My point is,

682
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:51,580
I get how difficult it is
to separate your feelings

683
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:54,125
about a person from their doppelgangers.

684
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,048
Did I ever tell you
about the time I met Harry?

685
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:58,546
You didn't. That's the Earth-2 Wells?

686
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,923
- The very one.
- All right, go ahead.

687
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:02,216
When I first saw him,

688
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,636
all I could see was Eobard Thawne.

689
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:10,016
But when I saw him, when I really saw...

690
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:12,852
Harry for who he was...

691
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:16,022
I became his friend.

692
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:19,066
He became mine.

693
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:23,946
Yeah, you got off to a bad start
with Allegra.

694
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,073
But it's not too late
to build something good.

695
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:31,161
You're a good egg.

696
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:33,473
You're not getting sappy on me, are you?

697
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:34,497
No.

698
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:37,834
Nope.

699
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:41,212
- Good.
- Good.

700
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:47,970
He's right. Ramon.

701
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:50,514
You have a second chance with Allegra.

702
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:52,365
It's what we've been trying to tell you.

703
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,852
You think you're so smart.

704
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:02,568
And he's gone.

705
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,237
That's gonna take some getting used to.

706
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:13,244
Caitlin, I...

707
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,500
I need to apologize.
I didn't follow your advice...

708
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,752
and you got hurt because of me.

709
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:23,756
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Barry.

710
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,217
I'm on the mend. Feeling better already.

711
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:28,844
So, we're okay?

712
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:30,053
Always.

713
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:35,768
Status report. Nash is physically fine,
but emotionally destroyed,

714
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,978
and Cisco is completely bushed.

715
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,899
You guys make up yet?

716
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,192
Mmm-hmm.

717
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:44,819
- Thank God.
- Guys, are we sure

718
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:47,154
creating an artificial Speed Force
is the way to go?

719
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:50,658
I mean, anyone who came in contact
with Thawne's Speed Force got hurt.

720
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:52,201
Ours will be different.

721
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,495
Yeah, but we still don't even know
where to start.

722
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:56,747
Actually, I do.

723
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:00,251
Every time Thawne tried to hurt me
using Nora's memory...

724
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,879
really what he did was reminded me

725
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:05,839
how much I loved her.

726
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,676
Made me realize that she's the answer.

727
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:13,472
Nora's journal?

728
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:16,058
Thawne taught Nora
how to build a Speed Force.

729
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:18,853
Now, she can teach us.

730
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:31,365
And no one saw you?

731
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,534
C.C.P.D. was busy fighting Sunshine.

732
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:35,286
In and out and no one noticed.

733
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:37,997
So, my husband stopped looking for me...

734
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:42,001
but apparently,
still goes out looking for my toys.

735
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:46,672
You did very well.

736
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:49,508
And as long as we stick to the plan...

737
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:51,236
- Success is assured.
- Success is assured.

738
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,721
And I'm one step closer to liberation.
