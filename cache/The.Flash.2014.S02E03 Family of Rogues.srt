It might be the breach's stability

or lack thereof. He's right.

92
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:51,721
We need to think of the breach as a door,

93
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:54,223
and on Earth Two, there's another door.

94
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:55,674
In between, we have a hallway,

95
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:57,843
but the hallway's constantly shifting,

96
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:00,563
twisting, collapsing upon itself.

97
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:02,231
And the doors keep moving with it.

98
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:04,350
So we stabilize the door,
we stabilize the hallway.

00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:49,565
I'll be back. Uh...

164
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:50,933
I don't see that call going well.

165
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:52,401
[as Stein] Young lady,

166
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:55,070
these repeated intrusions are interrupting

167
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:56,772
what should be a speedy recov...

168
00:06:56,774 --> 00:06:58,908
Oh, I'm so sorry.

169
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,643
Don't apologize.

170
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:04,363
You can bump into me any day, Cisco.

171
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:06,615
[exhales] Lisa Snart.

172
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:08,284
You here to double-cross us again,

173
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:10,920
or are you and your big bro
holding up coffee shops now?

174
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:12,621
I need your help.

175
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:15,591
In your dreams, Sister Cold.
You know I could call The Flash.

176
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:17,760
He'd be here in like two
seconds... Probably one.

177
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:19,211
Call him.

178
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:24,850
Oh, okay. I'm gonna call him. Mm-hmm.

179
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:26,635
You really want me to call The Flash?

180
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:28,804
I need his help too.

181
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,192
My brother's been kidnapped.

182
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:37,980
All right, so you really want us

183
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:42,351
to just believe that
Captain Cold was kidnapped?

184
00:07:42,353 --> 00:07:44,236
- I saw it happen.
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:07:44,238 --> 00:07:45,704
Last night, Lenny, me, and Mick

186
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,072
were knocking over the cashier's cage

187
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:48,407
at Central City Racetrack.

188
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,626
Does it physically pain your family

189
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:52,044
not to rob people?

190
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:54,129
I never finished the job.

191
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:55,998
After Mick torched
through the side entrance,

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,833
I looked back for Lenny
and saw him getting thrown

193
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,168
into the back of a van.

194
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,836
And why didn't you and Mick follow?

195
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:02,388
I would have.

196
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,807
Someone hit me from
behind and knocked me out.

197
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:06,425
When I came to, Lenny was gone,

198
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:08,143
and Mick already made off with the cash.

199
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:09,928
How do we know this isn't
some kind of a trap?

200
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,397
If Lenny wanted Flash dead,

201
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,048
he would have let Mardon,
Simmons, and Bivolo

202
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,733
take that honor, remember?

203
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:16,485
- Yeah, I remember.
- Good.

204
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:18,720
Then you'll also recall
that you owe Lenny a favor

205
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:20,189
for saving your life.

206
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:22,891
Time to make good on that debt, Flash.

207
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,726
I do not like her.

208
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:27,997
Yeah, but she makes a point.

209
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,949
What? We should at least hear her out.

210
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,701
Right?

211
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:34,569
Even if I wanted to help,
how are we supposed to find him?

212
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:35,754
Not a problem.

213
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:37,406
See, when I rebuilt the cold gun,

214
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:38,740
I didn't have time to place a tracker on it,

215
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:40,125
so I devised a method of locating it

216
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:42,511
by borrowing some military technology.

217
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:44,096
See, the gun works the
same as thermal imaging,

218
00:08:44,098 --> 00:08:45,798
only instead of infrared heat signatures,

219
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,550
it's looking for
ultraviolet cold signatures.

220
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:50,185
Whoa, look at that.

221
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:52,638
The gun's UV thermal
reading was last picked up

222
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,823
at 5th and Hoyt eight minutes ago.

223
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,393
All right. Let's see if you're a liar.

224
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:09,371
Snart.

225
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:11,040
Barry.

226
00:09:11,042 --> 00:09:13,075
Are you okay?

227
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:14,710
Peachy.

228
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:16,211
Okay.

229
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:19,331
Uh, I'm supposed to be here to rescue you.

230
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,916
That's not necessary.

231
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,618
You can speed along now.

232
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,888
Look, Snart, if these guys
are making you do this...

233
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,622
No one makes me do anything.

234
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:29,842
Then why does your sister
think you've been kidnapped?

235
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:31,760
[thud]

236
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:35,481
[yelps]

237
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:37,066
What's taking so long?

238
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:38,350
I got held up.

239
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:41,636
Always the excuse with you.

240
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:44,606
Look at that.

241
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:46,408
I didn't think you had it in you, son.

242
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,243
Thanks, Dad.

243
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,529
[Flash groans]

244
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:52,748
Come on.

245
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,199
We're behind schedule.

246
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:58,820
You know what they say.
“Live fast, die young.”

247
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:01,757
<i>Talk to me.</i> <i>What's going on?</i>

248
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,376
Cisco! Snart hit me with his cold gun.

249
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:05,711
His vitals are bottoming out!

250
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:09,598
I'm bringing the heat right now.

251
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:14,686
What? [sighs]

252
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:16,972
The suit. What's happening?

253
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:18,507
Therma-threading, baby.

254
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:19,725
It's a little something I added

255
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:22,027
for situations exactly like this one.

256
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:25,814
[grunts]

257
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:30,869
Please, please tell me it's working.

258
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:35,124
Yeah, it works, but Snart's gone,

259
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:38,127
and Lisa has a lot of explaining to do.

260
00:10:42,953 --> 00:10:45,037
So your brother was not kidnapped.

261
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,940
He was pulling a job with your father.

262
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:51,627
What? No, Lenny would never do that.

263
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:53,446
Oh, just like he would never

264
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:55,314
try and kill The Flash with his cold gun.

265
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:58,951
Are you sure it was my dad?

266
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:01,787
- That's him.
- Lewis Snart.

267
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:04,173
Convicted of larceny, armed robbery,

268
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:06,676
aggravated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon.

269
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,262
You have to believe me.
Lenny would never work with him.

270
00:11:09,264 --> 00:11:10,980
He's a bad guy.

271
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:14,150
You and your entire family are criminals.

272
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:16,903
Why should we trust anything you say?

273
00:11:23,694 --> 00:11:25,811
I didn't get this scar being a criminal.

274
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:27,997
I got it being a daughter.

275
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,840
Let me go. I got this.

276
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:45,431
I see you found my hiding spot.

277
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:47,433
This is usually where I come

278
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:51,304
to, you know, get away.

279
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:57,176
First time my father came after me,

280
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:59,478
I was seven.

281
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,349
Second time, I was eight.

282
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:05,818
That's when I learned
that a bottle hurts worse

283
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,120
than a fist.

284
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,859
He used to say he was
trying to teach us lessons.

285
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,580
I must have been a slow learner,

286
00:12:17,582 --> 00:12:21,334
because the lessons never stopped.

287
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:32,728
I'm sorry, Lisa.

288
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:35,982
Lenny practically raised me.

289
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:37,233
If it weren't for him,

290
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:40,236
I would have turned out a lot worse.

291
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:43,222
I know, how could I be any worse?

292
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:45,191
[chuckles] I didn't say that.

293
00:12:45,193 --> 00:12:48,394
You didn't have to.

294
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:51,414
But believe me, there is worse.

295
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,417
And, look, he may be a jerk brother,

296
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,836
but he's the only jerk brother I've got.

297
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,241
He protected me.

298
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:05,261
Now it's my turn.

299
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,129
If he's with my dad,

300
00:13:07,131 --> 00:13:10,883
he is in serious trouble.

301
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:13,219
Please.

302
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:15,587
You've gotta find out what's going on.

303
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:29,368
Hey, baby.

304
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,786
Dad! [laughs]

305
00:13:30,788 --> 00:13:31,954
What are you doing here?

306
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:33,155
Came to check in

307
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:34,940
on my favorite crime-fighting reporter.

308
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:35,958

[laughs]

310
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:40,496
Actually, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

311
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:41,964
Hey, Iris.

312
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:43,449
Editorial needs your photos and story ASAP.

313
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,000
Congratulations, Detective.

314
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:48,838
Your daughter's exposé
just made the front page.

315
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,057
What?

316
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:52,675
I am so happy for you.

317
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:54,844
A little bit jealous, but I'll get over it.

318
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:56,628
Thanks, Linda. I got lucky.

319
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,347
No, she's being modest.

320
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:00,266
Your daughter's a serious badass.

321
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:02,351
You don't have to tell me.

322
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:04,653
Well, better let you get back to work.

323
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:05,938
Wait, there was something that you wanted

324
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,189
to talk to me about, right?

325
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:09,442
Later, it can wait. Go be fabulous.

326
00:14:09,444 --> 00:14:11,410

Back from the dead so soon, Barry?

Don't spill. It's bad luck.

332

Why are you working with Lewis?

333
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:39,505
Lisa told us you hate him.

334
00:14:39,507 --> 00:14:43,342
Things are...

as you know with your own parents, hmm?

337
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,983
Tell me what's going on.

338

Let me help you.

339
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,903
Don't waste your time trying to save people

340
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:55,571
who don't want to be saved.

341
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:58,324
Yeah, well, maybe it's not
just about you, all right?

342
00:14:58,326 --> 00:15:00,126
I'm betting whatever you two are up to,

343
00:15:00,128 --> 00:15:01,577
innocent people are gonna get hurt.

344
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:03,129
Don't worry, I remember our deal.

345
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:07,133
You leave me alone, I make sure no one dies.

346
00:15:07,135 --> 00:15:08,884
All right.

347
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:11,703
You're a criminal, Snart,

348
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:13,172
but you live by a code.

349
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:14,706
It sounds to me like Lewis doesn't,

350
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,844
like he won't care if people die.

351
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:22,982
That's why I can't leave this alone.

352
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:26,718
Then everyone will know who
The Flash is under that mask.

353
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,054
I don't care.

354
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:32,358
I will take you down anyway. Both of you.

355
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:37,830
We'll see about that.

356
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,201

Iris' mom is alive.

361
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:59,751
I lied to Iris, you, everybody.

362
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:02,721
Why?

363
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:04,356
I felt like I didn't have a choice.

364
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:08,310
Francine did so many things wrong.

365
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:11,730
Just about everything.

366
00:16:11,732 --> 00:16:13,232
I don't know.

367
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:17,069
Now I feel like my one wrong might be worse.

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,774
Look, Joe.

369
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:26,278
I've known you for,
you know, most of my life,

370
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,415
and I know that you
always have a good reason

371
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,666
for the decisions you make.

372
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:33,118
And obviously, you were worried

373
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,803
that Iris would go down the wrong path

374
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:36,422
if Francine raised her.

375
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:37,923
Look at Snart.

376
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:40,292
He's a criminal because
he had Lewis for a father.

377
00:16:40,294 --> 00:16:41,260
That could have been me.

378
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:42,728
Oh, come on. Never.

379
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,397
Yeah, because I had you.

380
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,965
And so did Iris.

381
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:51,904
You just gotta trust in
that and tell her the truth.

382
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:53,939
Yeah, how do I do that without hurting her?

383
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:56,191
She's not a little girl anymore.

384
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:58,477
You should have seen her
in action the other day,

385
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,946
putting her neck on the line for a story.

386
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:02,781
She can handle anything that comes her way.

387
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:04,617
I just lied to her for so long,

388
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,586
I'm scared she's not gonna
understand or forgive me.

389
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:09,255
I could lose her.

390
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:12,791
No, she's gonna forgive you.

391
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:16,011
You just gotta give her a chance.

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

393
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:23,052
We make our move at 9:00.

394
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:24,937
That's when the cleaning crews go in

395
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,605
and the daytime shift leaves.

396
00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:28,840
Now we'll go up in the service elevator

397
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:30,676
to the 27th floor.

398
00:17:30,678 --> 00:17:32,311
They got a two-man team of armed guards

399
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:34,980
working the 27th through 29th floor,

400
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:36,848
but if we time it perfectly
with their shift change,

401
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,617
we should be able to get in and out.

402
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:40,235
And if the timing doesn't work out?

403
00:17:40,237 --> 00:17:41,787
Then those guards don't make it home.

404
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,289
But if we start on the top floor,

405

there's a service elevator that will...

It's a cold gun, and yes,

Don't worry, sir.
I waited for you this time.

429
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:53,435
Okay, I may have done a
quick preliminary assessment

430
00:18:53,437 --> 00:18:54,770
of my own.

431
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:56,438
Something is definitely weird.

432
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:01,226
- Oh.
- Decapitation.

433
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,978
- Yeah.
- Yikes.

434
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,613
We're still recovering parts
of the head, so the ID

435
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:06,014
is taking a little longer than normal.

436
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:07,482
Aah! Ugh.

437
00:19:07,484 --> 00:19:09,735
Sorry, I thought I stepped on an ear.

438
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:12,187
I didn't. If I did, I'd be hearing things.

- Oh, hell no.

with any weapon I'm familiar with,

442
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:19,161
and I'm familiar with most weapons.

443
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:20,662
Yeah, you're right.

444
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:22,831
Perforation around the
neck... it's too jagged.

445
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,583
It's almost like the head was blown off.

446
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:28,086
- Like a meta-human who can explode heads,
right?

447
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:30,005
Not necessarily.

- Bomb residue?
- Uh-huh.

451
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:39,314
But then why wasn't the rest
of the body blown apart?

452
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:42,060
- I don't know.
- The victim is David Rutenberg,

453
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,779
security systems expert,
and guess who's on his list

454
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:47,497
- of known associates.
- Hmm?

455
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,249
- Lewis Snart.
- Lewis Snart.

456
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:51,868
Isn't he related to Leonard
Snart, aka Captain Cold?

457
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,837
- Please don't call him that.
- Okay.

458
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,538
- Uh, one second.
- Sure.

459
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,907
Come here. I think this guy
is part of Snart's crew.

460
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:00,410
So Snart put a bomb in
him to keep him in line?

461
00:20:00,412 --> 00:20:04,580
No, Snart wouldn't do that,
but his father would.

462
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,082
So Lewis is killing people,

463
00:20:06,084 --> 00:20:07,300
and Snart's still working with him?

464
00:20:07,302 --> 00:20:08,635
What happened with the deal you had?

465
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:10,303
Maybe he doesn't have a choice.

466
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:13,223
So you think Lewis put a bomb in his own son

467
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:14,724
to force him to pull off a heist?

468
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:16,426
Snart still wouldn't do it.

469
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:18,061
He'd dig the bomb out of
his own head if he had to.

470
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:20,596
So it must be something
else that Snart cares about.

471
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:25,535
The only thing Snart
cares about is his sister.

472
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:32,208
- Hey.
- Hey.

473
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,710
Thought you might be hungry.

474
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:35,745
Ah, good to know whatever Earth you go to,

475
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:37,947

Thank you very much.

00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:41,050
Looks like you're making progress.

478
00:20:41,052 --> 00:20:44,587
Slowly.
Should be able to do this a lot faster.

479
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:46,222
You miss it, your speed?

480
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:49,225
Yeah. Surprising how much.

481
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:52,011
So what will you do when
you go back to your Earth?

482
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:53,596
I don't know.

483
00:20:53,598 --> 00:20:56,733
Guess I'll just have to get used to being...

484
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:59,068
Normal?

485
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,154
[chuckles] Yeah.

486
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:05,742
Two years ago, I was just a scientist

487
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,977
slowly trying to save the
world by purifying heavy water

488
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:09,746
without residual radiation.

489
00:21:09,748 --> 00:21:10,947
Important work.

490
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:13,366
Yeah, it was,

491
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:15,335
but after the Particle Accelerator exploded,

492
00:21:15,337 --> 00:21:17,504
I didn't need to wait years
for my research to save a life,

493
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:18,922
I could save one before breakfast.

494
00:21:18,924 --> 00:21:21,424
I could save 50 before going to sleep.

495
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:23,877
There's nothing like that rush.

496
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,846
You guys have been fighting so many battles,
one after another,

497
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:30,266
I'm not sure Barry's had time to take it in,

498
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:33,503
to appreciate how great it can feel.

499
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:37,774
Being a superhero isn't always
about how fast you can run.

500
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:40,310
It's about helping however you can,

501
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:43,229
wherever you're needed most.

502
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:47,150
I think that Jay Garrick,
physicist, has just as much

503
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:50,036
to contribute as Jay Garrick, superhero.

504
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:51,687
Maybe more.

505
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:57,961
You know what would help me
build the speed cannon faster?

506
00:21:57,963 --> 00:22:00,713
- Hmm?
- An extra set of hands.

507
00:22:00,715 --> 00:22:03,866
Specifically ones with
a surgeon's precision.

508
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:05,868
Me?

509
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,703
Sure, if you think I can really help.

510
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:09,038
<i>Hey, Caitlin?</i>

511
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,641
We need you up here, like, right now.

512
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:13,560
Sorry.

513
00:22:13,562 --> 00:22:16,513
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

514
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:22,185
Oh, boy.

515
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:24,187
What is it?

516
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:27,657
Lisa,
there are traces of thermite on your skin.

517
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,692
Thermite?

518
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:31,027
Like an explosive?

519
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:33,279
Not <i>like</i> an explosive.

520
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:36,749
It's a bomb.

521
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,751
When you were knocked out,

522
00:22:38,753 --> 00:22:42,005
your dad must have injected you with it.

523
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:52,048
Hey, Dad, what's up?

524
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,852
Your message was pretty
cryptic, even for you.

525
00:22:59,023 --> 00:23:02,758
Hey, baby, I need you to sit down.

526
00:23:04,862 --> 00:23:07,564
Dad, what's going on?

527
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,902
Okay.

528
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:17,156
When I was still a beat cop,

529
00:23:17,158 --> 00:23:19,709
me and my partner were on patrol,

530
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:22,962
and dispatch came on the radio.

531
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:25,331
A little girl had called in.

532
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:29,552
She said her mom had taken some pills

533
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:31,971
and she wouldn't wake up.

534
00:23:31,973 --> 00:23:35,558
And the little girl gave the address.

535
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,960
The address was mine.

536
00:23:37,962 --> 00:23:43,900
By the time I got here,
your mother was unresponsive.

537
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:46,135
Passed out on the couch.

538
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:50,023
And in the kitchen, the stove was on.

539
00:23:50,025 --> 00:23:51,908
There you were, standing in front

540
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,743
of an open flame.

541
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:55,244
If I hadn't gotten here when I did...

542
00:23:55,246 --> 00:23:59,415
- Wait, my mom...
- Your mom was a drug addict.

543
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,984
This wasn't the first time

544
00:24:01,986 --> 00:24:05,171
something like that had happened.

545
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:08,824
I got Francine into another rehab,

546
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:12,161
and a couple days later,

547
00:24:12,163 --> 00:24:14,764
she was gone.

548
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:19,218
I looked everywhere for her,
but wife of a cop,

549
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,437
she knew how to disappear.

550
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,389
I couldn't stand...

551
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:26,693
the thought of you growing up

552
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:28,177
thinking you were abandoned.

553
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:29,896
Going to sleep at night thinking

554
00:24:29,898 --> 00:24:32,398
your mother left because you weren't enough

555
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,150
to make her stay, that you weren't loved,

556
00:24:34,152 --> 00:24:36,869
because I loved you.

557
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:42,158
I loved you with everything I got.

558
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,711
Then we took Barry in,

559
00:24:44,713 --> 00:24:46,996
and I saw the trauma he
was going through and I...

560
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:48,631
I was sure.

561
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:51,167
I was sure...

562
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:53,336
that I did the right thing.

563
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:54,887
Not giving you that burden.

564
00:24:54,889 --> 00:24:57,306
What do you mean “mom left”?

565
00:24:57,308 --> 00:24:59,542
I...

566
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:00,977
I don't... I don't understand.

567
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:03,513
I don't understand. What are you telling me?

568
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:07,183
Your mother's alive.

569
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:09,885
She's here in Central City.

570
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:11,904
She wants to see you.

571
00:25:16,527 --> 00:25:18,578
All these years, I thought...

572
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:22,398
Daddy, you told me that my...

573
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,568
I know.

574
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,069
I should have told you sooner,

575
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:30,790
but I couldn't figure out the right way.

576
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:34,010
The mother you thought you remember...

577
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:36,412
the perfect mother and the
stories I made up for you...

578
00:25:36,414 --> 00:25:39,048
that is the mother you deserve,
and I knew Francine

579
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,267
couldn't be like that.

580
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:43,052
She would only break your heart.

581
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,608
I'm so sorry.

582
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,931
[sobs]

583
00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:00,236
Dad...

584
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:03,706
It's okay. I understand.

585
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,742
You were just trying to keep me safe.

586
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:14,310
<i>[electricity buzzing]</i>

587
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:16,981
The micro-bomb casing must be made

588
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:19,733
of some kind of a ferromagnetic material.

589
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:21,452
Once you hold it steady with the magnet,

590
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,153
I can surgically excise it.

591
00:26:23,155 --> 00:26:24,738
Put the magnet down!

592
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,440
This is a really concentrated bomb.

593
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:28,025
It's gonna combust if it's exposed

594
00:26:28,027 --> 00:26:30,578
to magnetic friction and an oxidant.

595
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:33,948
What's he talking about?

596
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,666
Air.

597
00:26:35,668 --> 00:26:38,936
Uh, the bomb will explode if
it comes in contact with air.

598
00:26:38,938 --> 00:26:40,337
Don't worry, Lisa.

599
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:41,805
We're gonna find another way to get it out.

600
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:44,258
Scientific minds. Can we confer, please.

601
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,710
What if Flash speed extracts it?

602
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:48,045
Nope, it's too risky.

603
00:26:48,047 --> 00:26:50,557
I'm gonna find a way to get it out.
I just need a little time.

604
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,676
Well, we need to keep track of Lewis

605
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,644
until you figure out how to disarm the bomb.

606
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:57,681
I wish we knew what he was
gonna steal next and when.

607
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,933
Maybe I can get them to tell me.

608
00:26:59,935 --> 00:27:02,185
Their tech guy is dead,
so I'm betting they're

609
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,404
gonna need a new one.

610
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:06,189
I'm saying I'm gonna infiltrate Lewis' crew.

611
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,909
You're gonna pretend to be a criminal?

612
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:10,310
How hard can it be?

613
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,418
These visits are getting old.

614
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:23,006
Third time's a charm.

615
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,010
I told you, I don't need saving.

616
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,829
But your sister does.

617
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:33,499
I know your dad put a bomb in Lisa.

618
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:34,935
Lewis told you he'd kill her

619
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:36,502
if you didn't help him, right?

620
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:38,171
Look don't worry.

621
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:40,273
My team's working on a
way to remove the bomb.

622
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:42,776
I hope you got that gun
of yours ready to blast

623
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:46,512
'cause...

624
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:48,231
Who the hell's this?

625
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,684
Um, Lenny said you needed new tech.

626
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:54,854
What's up, I'm Sam, so...

627
00:27:56,824 --> 00:27:59,376
Heh!

628
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:00,961
You tellin' me you think this kid

629
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:03,196
can crack a Draycon keypad?

630
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:06,333
Uh, I did help Snart steal
the Kahndaq Dynasty Diamond

631
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:08,084
from Central City Museum last year.

632
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,136
That was locked up behind
an AmerTek Industries

633
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:13,640
Phase Three Suppression Door
with a Draycon XL-1218 keypad.

634
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:15,475
So... [chuckles]

635
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:18,878
Couldn't have done it without him.

636
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,380
Draycon's my jam.

637
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:22,548
Ah.

638
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:31,324
Okay, Sam. Let's go.

639
00:28:31,326 --> 00:28:32,576
Right now?

640
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:34,411
You got a problem with that?

641
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:37,163
No, all good. Can't wait.

642
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:44,671
Oh, this should be fun.

643
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,293
Keep quiet and follow my lead.

644
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,295
Just like old times.

What floor are you going to?

649
00:29:00,588 --> 00:29:02,022
27th.

[scanner beeping]

651

Hey, what's the hold up, guys?

652
00:29:11,867 --> 00:29:13,533
I mean, you wanna call management

653
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:16,987
and explain why the toilets
are still overflowing?

00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:13,158
- Not even you.
- It's more than that.

820
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,127
You were there for me
when I was feeling weak.

821
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:18,112
I hate feeling weak.

822
00:38:18,114 --> 00:38:20,415
It's hard for me to trust people.

823
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:22,450
I trusted you.

824
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:27,639
You know, you might
actually be my first real friend.

825
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,559
Is any of that true?

<i>[playful music]</i>

827
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:49,411
Till next time, Cisco.

828
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:50,695
Later, Golden Glider.

Ta-da! The speed cannon.

00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:16,671
Wow! Look at that.

834
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:19,390
Dudes, you actually built the thing.

835
00:39:19,392 --> 00:39:22,227
Mr. Garrick, I am quite impressed

836
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,511
by what you've accomplished during

837
00:39:23,513 --> 00:39:25,029
my recent wellness hiatus.

838
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:26,981
- Have you tested it out yet?
- Not yet.

839
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:28,283
You wanna do the honors?

[Cisco claps]

841
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:31,569
No, no, no, no. Now that I, uh...

842
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:33,404
now that I am back to optimum health,

843
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:36,124
Please allow me.

Excelsior!

846
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:43,665
- How did you stabilize it?
- CFL Quark Matter.

847
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,917
Ah, negative energy density

848
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:48,136
with positive surface pressure.
It's genius.

849
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:50,805
You created CFL Quark Matter?

850
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,039
It's something we perfected on my Earth.

851
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,374
I'll show you sometime.

852
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:56,060
You mean, sometime in the next few minutes?

853
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,983
Oh, yeah I guess this is it, huh?

854
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:06,437
- Time for me to go back home.
- Right now?

855
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:08,890
I mean we still need your
help with the Breachers.

856
00:40:08,892 --> 00:40:11,192
My first priority is Zoom.

857
00:40:11,194 --> 00:40:12,894
I need to find out what he's up to.

858
00:40:12,896 --> 00:40:14,329
How he stole my speed.

859
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:16,781
But you can do that here and, you know,

860
00:40:16,783 --> 00:40:19,284
if you go back, then we can't get in touch

861
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:22,003
with you when we need your help or...

862
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:26,174
with Zoom or whatever else.

863
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,126
It would be nice to be
able to pick your brain

864
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:31,078
every once in a while,
get some more speedster tips.

[Jay chuckles]

866
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:39,103
Okay... Once we take care of Zoom,

867
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:42,223
- I'm going home.
- That's fair.

868
00:40:42,225 --> 00:40:45,259
Good, 'cause I could use a shower, a shave,

869
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:47,695
- and some sunlight.
- [all chuckle]

870
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:51,649
I'll, uh, see you later.

871
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:54,569
So, Professor Stein, how are you feeling?

872
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:56,437
Well, uh, it appears

873
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:59,207
that a little rest heals all maladies.

874
00:40:59,512 --> 00:41:00,874
I... I couldn't feel...

- [inhales]

876

- Professor?
- No, no, no, no get back.

877
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:06,214
Come here.

Professor Stein! Professor Stein!

881
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:19,844
Can you hear me, Professor Stein?

882
00:41:19,846 --> 00:41:21,512
What happened to him?
He went up like Firestorm,

883
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:22,514
but the flame, why was it blue?

884
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,091
I don't know. This isn't good.
We need to stabilize him fast.
