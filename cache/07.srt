1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
After defeating Zoom and
saving the multiverse,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I ran back in time and created
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I restored the timeline to how it was,

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
only to find things
weren't as I left them.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I brought new threats to our world,

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,497
I am The Flash.

24
00:00:00,507 --> 00:00:00,912
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,922 --> 00:00:02,312
Previously on "The Flash"...

26
00:00:02,322 --> 00:00:02,314
&nbsp

27
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:04,347
Caitlin, I'm sorry, honey.

28
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:04,349
&nbsp

29
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:07,240
These powers you have...
the more you use them,

30
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:07,271
&nbsp

31
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:09,752
the more difficult they're
going to be to reverse.

32
00:00:09,762 --> 00:00:09,754
&nbsp

33
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:10,920
I took your cuffs.

34
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:10,922
&nbsp

35
00:00:10,932 --> 00:00:12,355
Is this some sort of fashion choice?

36
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:12,357
&nbsp

37
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:13,890
'Cause you're not a meta-human.

38
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:13,915
&nbsp

39
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:15,201
- Am I her?
- Yeah.

40
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:15,226
&nbsp

41
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:16,559
I saw the both of us.

42
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:16,561
&nbsp

43
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:18,895
Like, full-on Vibe versus Killer Frost.

44
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:18,897
&nbsp

45
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:20,763
The time has come

46
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:20,765
&nbsp

47
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:22,966
to set you free.

48
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:22,968
&nbsp

49
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:23,967
Wally, don't!

50
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:34,271
&nbsp

51
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:37,280
You may serve the speed force, Flash,

52
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:37,282
&nbsp

53
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:39,148
but I rule it.

54
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:39,150
&nbsp

55
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,850
You are only a man,

56
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:40,852
&nbsp

57
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:43,206
but I am a god.

58
00:00:43,216 --> 00:00:43,231
&nbsp

59
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:44,698
Your god.

60
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:44,723
&nbsp

61
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:47,258
I am Savitar.

62
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:55,094
&nbsp

63
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:56,833
- Shoot him!
- I can't see it.

64
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:56,835
&nbsp

65
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:58,469
Just do it!

66
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:05,918
&nbsp

67
00:01:05,928 --> 00:01:07,618
Alchemy!

68
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:10,215
&nbsp

69
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:11,714
Let's go for a run.

70
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:18,690
&nbsp

71
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,023
Barry!

72
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:38,510
&nbsp

73
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,576
- What's happening?
- I don't understand.

74
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:40,578
&nbsp

75
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:42,011
The suit's tracker
must be malfunctioning.

76
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:42,013
&nbsp

77
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:43,579
It says he's appearing and reappearing

78
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:43,581
&nbsp

79
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,882
all over the city at once,
and that's impossible.

80
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:45,884
&nbsp

81
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:47,116
He can't be moving that fast.

82
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:47,118
&nbsp

83
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:48,461
Well, if he can't,

84
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:49,387
&nbsp

85
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:51,094
maybe something else can.

86
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:55,961
&nbsp

87
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:57,494
Had enough?

88
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,274
&nbsp

89
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,996
Not even close.

90
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:15,680
&nbsp

91
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,757
Look. It stopped.
He's at the waterfront.

92
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:17,782
&nbsp

93
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:20,383
Okay. We have to get to him.

94
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:20,385
&nbsp

95
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:23,335
And do what? He's fighting an invisible
force that's too fast to track.

96
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:23,360
&nbsp

97
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,969
- If I may, I have a plan.
- No. No.

98
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,086
&nbsp

99
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:27,757
- Pretty good plan.
- Put your hand down.

100
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:27,759
&nbsp

101
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:29,087
It's a question of numbers.

102
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:29,112
&nbsp

103
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:31,757
'Cause right now, it seems
to be one against one.

104
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:31,782
&nbsp

105
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,492
What if there were three against
one? Do you know what I'm saying?

106
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:34,517
&nbsp

107
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:36,699
Cisco, you can open a breach

108
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:36,701
&nbsp

109
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:38,134
and get you both to the waterfront.

110
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:38,136
&nbsp

111
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:40,369
Guys, I can't. It's too dangerous.

112
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:40,371
&nbsp

113
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:42,172
I'm begging you. Please.

114
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:45,210
&nbsp

115
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,532
Still alive down there?

116
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:47,617
&nbsp

117
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:51,314
You are only a shadow beneath my throne.

118
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:51,316
&nbsp

119
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:53,116
You are the past,

120
00:02:53,126 --> 00:02:53,118
&nbsp

121
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:55,017
whereas I...

122
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:55,899
&nbsp

123
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,521
I am the future, Flash.

124
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:01,914
&nbsp

125
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:03,742
I can't see it!

126
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:03,767
&nbsp

127
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:05,177
Just do it!

128
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:26,301
&nbsp

129
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:27,894
Whoo-ee!

130
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:27,934
&nbsp

131
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:30,586
Ahh. Oh, boy.

132
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:31,230
&nbsp

133
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,204
I'm gonna feel that tomorrow.

134
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:33,229
&nbsp

135
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,662
Ah.

136
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,418
&nbsp

137
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:38,215
That was a new and
painful use of my powers.

138
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:38,240
&nbsp

139
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,504
Ugh. You okay?

140
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:40,529
&nbsp

141
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:42,098
Yeah, I'm okay.

142
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:42,410
&nbsp

143
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,707
Just cold.

144
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:45,385
&nbsp

145
00:03:45,395 --> 00:03:47,185
Thanks for coming.

146
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:48,530

&nbsp

149
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:04,687
Barry, you're already healing.
You should be fine soon.

150
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:04,689
&nbsp

151
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:07,114
Um, Cisco, the MRI I did of your brain

152
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:07,139
&nbsp

153
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:09,025
shows changes in the
capillary morphology

154
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:09,027
&nbsp

155
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:11,294
similar to that of a mini-stroke.

156
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:11,569
&nbsp

157
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,606
I wouldn't try an intra-dimensional
breach like that anytime soon.

158
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:14,631
&nbsp

159
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:16,104
Okay, okay. Mini-stroke?

160
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:16,129
&nbsp

161
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,067
You can't just gloss
over that like that, okay?

162
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:18,092
&nbsp

163
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:19,223
What does that... what does that mean?

164
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:19,248
&nbsp

165
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:20,958
Am I gonna have this migraine
for the rest of my life?

166
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:20,983
&nbsp

167
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:23,739
It means you should take a
few aspirin and you'll be fine.

168
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,741
&nbsp

169
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:27,827
Oh. Well, just lead with that next time.

170
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:27,991
&nbsp

171
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:32,811
Cait, I know what a risk you
took using your powers. Thank you.

172
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:32,951
&nbsp

173
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:36,278
- I didn't do anything.
- Well, you saved my life.

00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:38,754
You've saved mine plenty of times.

176
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:38,889
&nbsp

177
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:41,475
I'm gonna go check on Wally.

178
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:41,500
&nbsp

179
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,999
Okay.

180
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:48,131
&nbsp

181
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:49,321
What was that?

182
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:49,346
&nbsp

183
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,513
That frozen thing at the waterfront?

184
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:51,978
&nbsp

185
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:53,537
I don't know.

186
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:55,022
&nbsp

187
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:56,906
But now we know Alchemy
is just the lackey.

188
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:56,908
&nbsp

189
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:59,395
Whatever that thing was, it's
what we're really up against.

190
00:04:59,405 --> 00:04:59,420
&nbsp

191
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,036
Question: you're the
only one who can see him?

192
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:02,061
&nbsp

193
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:04,505
Why? I mean... why?

194
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:04,530
&nbsp

195
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,881
You're both speedsters. Maybe
it has something to do with that.

196
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:06,906
&nbsp

197
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:10,317
Maybe. But I think he's
more than a speedster.

198
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:10,342
&nbsp

199
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,514
I mean, when he had me, it
wasn't like we were even moving;

200
00:05:12,524 --> 00:05:12,539
&nbsp

201
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:14,690
it was just like, "bam," we were
instantly somewhere different,

202
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:14,692
&nbsp

203
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:16,126
even from my perspective.

204
00:05:16,136 --> 00:05:16,151
&nbsp

205
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:17,881
Did he say anything else?

206
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:18,381
&nbsp

207
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:20,296
He said his name was Savitar.

208
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:20,298
&nbsp

209
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:22,708
Mm. Hindu god of motion.

210
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:22,733
&nbsp

211
00:05:22,743 --> 00:05:24,731
What? How do you know that?

212
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:24,756
&nbsp

213
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:27,262
Crossword puzzle wizard.
On two planets, I might add.

214
00:05:27,272 --> 00:05:27,287
&nbsp

215
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:30,039
12 across, 7 letters. Savitar. Bam.

216
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:30,280
&nbsp

217
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,100
Hindu god of motion.

218
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,577
&nbsp

219
00:05:32,587 --> 00:05:35,883
- He said he was God.
- That's... that's nice.

220
00:05:35,893 --> 00:05:35,908
&nbsp

221
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,975
That's not scary... at all.

222
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:47,655
&nbsp

223
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:49,458
- Hey.
- Hey.

224
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:49,460
&nbsp

225
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,936
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

226
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:54,084
&nbsp

227
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:55,545
How are you?

228
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,541
&nbsp

229
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:59,174
Can you tell anything?

230
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:00,412
&nbsp

231
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:01,559
Wally's alive in there,

232
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:01,584
&nbsp

233
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,739
but his vitals are really subdued.

234
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,741
&nbsp

235
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:05,408
His brain function is low.

236
00:06:05,418 --> 00:06:05,410
&nbsp

237
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,756
Something like you'd
see in a coma patient.

238
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:08,131
&nbsp

239
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:10,479
I was in a coma after I got my powers.

240
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:10,481
&nbsp

241
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:13,473
Maybe it's a similar process.

242
00:06:13,483 --> 00:06:13,498
&nbsp

243
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:14,567
Can we take him out?

244
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:14,592
&nbsp

245
00:06:14,602 --> 00:06:17,747
When a caterpillar is in its chrysalis,

246
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:17,772
&nbsp

247
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:20,598
it literally breaks its
body down into enzyme soup

248
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:20,623
&nbsp

249
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:22,512
before rebuilding as a butterfly.

250
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:22,537
&nbsp

251
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:25,262
If this cocoon is doing
the same thing to Wally,

252
00:06:25,272 --> 00:06:25,287
&nbsp

253
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:27,863
I just... I don't know.

254
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:27,865
&nbsp

255
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,389
You're right. You don't know.

256
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,741
&nbsp

257
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:33,552
None of us knows a damn thing
about what's going on in there.

258
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:33,577
&nbsp

259
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:35,938
And I feel like a fool just
standing here listening.

260
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:36,069
&nbsp

261
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,083
- Dad?
- Look, I've said it before...

262
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:38,108
&nbsp

263
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:40,255
I don't have the
education most of you had.

264
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:40,280
&nbsp

265
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,717
The science of what we do
here is mostly lost on me.

266
00:06:43,727 --> 00:06:43,959
&nbsp

267
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,239
But what I do have...

268
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:46,264
&nbsp

269
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:48,458
is my detective skills and my instinct,

270
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:48,483
&nbsp

271
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:51,301
and time and time
again, I don't use them

272
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:51,452
&nbsp

273
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:54,469
because you guys all tell me
that everything is gonna be okay.

274
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:54,494
&nbsp

275
00:06:54,504 --> 00:06:56,861
Everything is not okay.

276
00:06:56,871 --> 00:06:58,463
&nbsp

277
00:06:58,473 --> 00:07:01,127
- I'm sorry, Joe.
- I know you are.

278
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:01,152
&nbsp

279
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:03,735
But I can't just stand here.

280
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:03,760
&nbsp

281
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,094
My gut is telling me
I need to do something.

282
00:07:06,104 --> 00:07:14,090
&nbsp

283
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,045
This is not your fault.

284
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:17,830
&nbsp

285
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,434
Yeah, it is.

286
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:36,395
&nbsp

287
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:40,063
Not so tough without your
friends and your fancy robe.

288
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:40,065
&nbsp

289
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:42,332
I want to know about Alchemy.

290
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:43,068
&nbsp

291
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:45,735
What he does, how he does it...

292
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:45,737
&nbsp

293
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:48,838
His powers are beyond
human understanding.

294
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:55,313
&nbsp

295
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:57,862
- Try me.
- Oh, you will be tried.

296
00:07:57,872 --> 00:07:57,887
&nbsp

297
00:07:57,897 --> 00:07:59,668
All of you.

298
00:07:59,678 --> 00:07:59,885
&nbsp

299
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:03,720
When my master rises, the
human race will be judged.

300
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,168
&nbsp

301
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:08,858
From where I'm sitting,
you will not fare very well.

302
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:12,060
&nbsp

303
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,621
You think I'm playing with you?

304
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:13,623
&nbsp

305
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,418
My son is in one of those cocoons,

306
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:15,443
&nbsp

307
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,133
and you're gonna tell
me how to get him out.

308
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:17,135
&nbsp

309
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:18,301
Now talk!

310
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:20,138
&nbsp

311
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:21,457
Go away!

312
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:30,769
&nbsp

313
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,894
Caitlin, what is it?

314
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:32,919
&nbsp

315
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,168
It's Wally.

316
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:34,193
&nbsp

317
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:35,726
He's out of that thing. He's fine.

318
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:35,751
&nbsp

319
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:37,887
- And he's okay?
- Yeah. He's fine.

320
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:37,912
&nbsp

321
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:39,278
I promise.

322
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:39,324
&nbsp

323
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:42,043
Oh, thank God. Thank you, Caitlin.

324
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:42,068
&nbsp

325
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:43,730
You should probably go see him.

326
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,813
&nbsp

327
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:46,660
Uh, yeah.

328
00:08:46,670 --> 00:09:10,589
&nbsp

329
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:13,474
Where is Alchemy?

330
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:18,691
&nbsp

331
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,878
Tell me where Alchemy is.

332
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:22,362
&nbsp

333
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:24,295
I sense great fear in you.

334
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:24,620
&nbsp

335
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,163
You fear your power,

336
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:26,401
&nbsp

337
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:27,832
your own greatness.

338
00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:27,834
&nbsp

339
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:29,200
I don't fear anything anymore.

340
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:29,245
&nbsp

341
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:31,002
Where is Alchemy?

342
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:31,004
&nbsp

343
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:34,271
The only one I fear is
that whom Alchemy serves,

344
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:34,273
&nbsp

345
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,407
the dark lord Savitar.

346
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:36,557
&nbsp

347
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:39,043
Maybe it's time you started fearing me.

348
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:39,045
&nbsp

349
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:42,813
No, no, no... aah!

350
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:48,554
&nbsp

351
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:49,720
Who's in there?

352
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:58,076
&nbsp

353
00:09:58,086 --> 00:09:59,090
Frozen?

354
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,368
&nbsp

355
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:03,734
Hello?

356
00:10:03,744 --> 00:10:14,347
&nbsp

357
00:10:14,357 --> 00:10:16,047
Excuse me?

358
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:17,987
&nbsp

359
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:20,167
Anybody out there?

360
00:10:20,177 --> 00:10:20,379
&nbsp

361
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:23,034
Let us out of here!

362
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:26,487
&nbsp

363
00:10:26,497 --> 00:10:28,759
I need you to come with me.

364
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,797
&nbsp

365
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:32,863
Wait. What is going on?

366
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:34,458
&nbsp

367
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,509
Hey, Joe. What do you mean?

368
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:36,543
&nbsp

369
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,557
Caitlin came by the precinct. She said
that Wally was out and that he was okay.

370
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:39,582
&nbsp

371
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:41,870
What? I didn't even see her leave.

372
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,745
&nbsp

373
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:49,280
SWAT needs to establish a
cordon at 6th and Fairmont,

374
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:49,282
&nbsp

375
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:50,760
all the way down to Gleason. Move!

376
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:50,878
&nbsp

377
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:52,049
Move! Let's go!

378
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:52,051
&nbsp

379
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:54,151
Detective Patterson? Hey. What's...

380
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:54,153
&nbsp

381
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:55,362
Just the man I want to see.

382
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:55,387
&nbsp

383
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:57,421
Your little friend's
in big trouble, Allen.

384
00:10:57,431 --> 00:10:57,423
&nbsp

385
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:59,557
- My f...
- A female meta-human

386
00:10:59,567 --> 00:10:59,559
&nbsp

387
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:02,026
attacked the precinct,
took Julian Albert hostage.

388
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:02,028
&nbsp

389
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:05,129
Julian? Wait, do you
know who the meta is?

390
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:05,131
&nbsp

391
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:07,689
Uh, no. But she's smart.
I'll tell you that.

392
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:07,692
&nbsp

393
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:09,746
Took out our security
cameras so we couldn't ID her.

394
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:09,770
&nbsp

395
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,439
I thought maybe you'd recognize her.

396
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:11,464
&nbsp

397
00:11:11,474 --> 00:11:14,371
No. Why would she take Julian?

398
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:14,373
&nbsp

399
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,707
She's a meta. They're all crazy.

400
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:16,880
&nbsp

401
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,839
But don't worry. We'll get her.

402
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:22,668
&nbsp

403
00:11:22,678 --> 00:11:24,565
What are you doing?

404
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:26,023
&nbsp

405
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,689
What are you doing, Cait?

406
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:34,227
&nbsp

407
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:36,026
Bit chilly in here, isn't it?

408
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:36,028
&nbsp

409
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:38,229
Shut up. I need to think.

410
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,149
&nbsp

411
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,836
Look. I know who you are, okay?

412
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:42,861
&nbsp

413
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:44,668
You're... you're... you're
Allen's friend, right?

414
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:44,670
&nbsp

415
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,500
- Dr. Snow?
- I said be quiet.

416
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,313
&nbsp

417
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:49,707
Are you going to kill me?

418
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:49,709
&nbsp

419
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,837
- I need to find Alchemy.
- Alchemy? What?

420
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:55,515
&nbsp

421
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:56,747
What do you want me to do?

422
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:56,749
&nbsp

423
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,682
Alchemy has disciples, followers.

424
00:11:58,692 --> 00:11:58,684
&nbsp

425
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:00,125
I need you to create an algorithm

426
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:00,150
&nbsp

427
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,600
that will allow you to locate anyone

428
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:01,625
&nbsp

429
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:04,616
who has searched for a specific
keyword in the last six months.

430
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:04,641
&nbsp

431
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:07,758
If we find one of his followers,
they can take me to Alchemy.

432
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:07,914
&nbsp

433
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:11,028
Okay. But "alchemy" is a
relatively common phrase.

434
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:11,030
&nbsp

435
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,328
It'll have hundreds of hits.

436
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:12,353
&nbsp

437
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:13,841
Then search for an uncommon one.

438
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:13,866
&nbsp

439
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:16,167
- Such as?
- Savitar.

440
00:12:16,177 --> 00:12:17,628
&nbsp

441
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:19,128
Savitar?

442
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,798
&nbsp

443
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,297
Get searching.

444
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:30,211
&nbsp

445
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:32,349
So, they don't know why she took Julian?

446
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:32,351
&nbsp

447
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:34,151
No, they don't. But more importantly,

448
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:34,153
&nbsp

449
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:35,688
they don't even know
that it's Caitlin yet,

450
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:35,713
&nbsp

451
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:37,588
so we need to find her before they do.

452
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:37,590
&nbsp

453
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,457
Savitar. Now, what about this Savitar...

454
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:40,459
&nbsp

455
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,391
We find Caitlin. Then we
can worry about Savitar.

456
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:42,416
&nbsp

457
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:44,086
You know what, guys?
I'm... I agree with Barry.

458
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:44,125
&nbsp

459
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:45,235
Let's find Caitlin.

460
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:45,260
&nbsp

461
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,781
Okay. You're right. And when
we find Caitlin, then what?

462
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:47,805
&nbsp

463
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:49,945
I don't know. I mean, she's
not thinking straight. She's...

464
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:49,970
&nbsp

465
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,441
She's becoming Killer Frost.
It's just like in the Vibe.

466
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:52,443
&nbsp

467
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:54,116
- We don't know that yet.
- Her mother said

468
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:54,141
&nbsp

469
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:55,413
the more that she uses her powers,

470
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,438
&nbsp

471
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:56,479
the faster she's gonna go.

472
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:56,481
&nbsp

473
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:57,980
And saving you from Savitar...

474
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:57,982
&nbsp

475
00:12:57,992 --> 00:13:00,112
that must have put her over the edge.

476
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:00,221
&nbsp

477
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:01,517
How do we find her?

478
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:01,519
&nbsp

479
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:03,786
I don't know. I tried
pinging her cell and Julian's,

480
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:03,788
&nbsp

481
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:05,354
but she must have ditched them both.

482
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:05,356
&nbsp

483
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:08,791
Ahem! If I may proffer a notion...

484
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:08,793
&nbsp

485
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:11,794
Oh, great. More suggestions
from the genius over here.

486
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:11,796
&nbsp

487
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:14,151
You don't call the genius.
The genius calls you.

488
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:14,198
&nbsp

489
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,674
Question:

490
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:15,783
&nbsp

491
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,600
how did you catch your Captain Cold?

492
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:17,602
&nbsp

493
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:19,368
I've been reading
about him in your files.

494
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:19,393
&nbsp

495
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:21,524
Seems like a wily fellow. Slow talker.

496
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:21,549
&nbsp

497
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,840
But his MO... strikingly
similar to our dear Caitlin's.

498
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:24,842
&nbsp

499
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:27,309
What? No. We tracked
him using the satellite

500
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:27,311
&nbsp

501
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:29,445
to scan for ultraviolet cold signatures.

502
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:30,782
&nbsp

503
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:32,014
Got it.

504
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:34,152
&nbsp

505
00:13:34,162 --> 00:13:36,385
No. Nothing near the precinct.

506
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:36,387
&nbsp

507
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:38,354
Wait, what's that?

508
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:38,356
&nbsp

509
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:40,338
Frozen food warehouse.

510
00:13:40,348 --> 00:13:42,664
&nbsp

511
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:44,424
There she is.

512
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:44,448
&nbsp

513
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,948
Okay, I'm gonna isolate the feed
so that no one else can see it.

514
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,026
&nbsp

515
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,232
All right, figure out what she's
making Julian do. I'm going.

516
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:50,234
&nbsp

517
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:52,001
Okay.

518
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:52,361
&nbsp

519
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:55,362
That... is cool.

520
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:56,440
&nbsp

521
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,260
I found two individuals that have
searched for the name Savitar.

522
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,045
&nbsp

523
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:02,378
Here are both their addresses,

524
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:02,380
&nbsp

525
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,424
both of them in Central City.

526
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:05,249
&nbsp

527
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,526
What exactly are you gonna do to them?

528
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:09,584
&nbsp

529
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:11,217
I don't know.

530
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:16,851
&nbsp

531
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:18,487
What am I doing?

532
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:20,700
&nbsp

533
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,131
_

534
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:22,133
&nbsp

535
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:23,432
Son of a...

536
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:23,434
&nbsp

537
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:26,101
Sergeant, we got a location
on Albert. Let's move.

538
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:30,143
&nbsp

539
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:33,909
What part of "I'll freeze you
to death" did you not understand?

540
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,387
&nbsp

541
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:37,407
Stop.

542
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:37,432
&nbsp

543
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:39,783
- Get out of here.
- You know I can't.

544
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:40,260
&nbsp

545
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,518
What are you doing? Take
her out. Take her out.

546
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:42,520
&nbsp

547
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,920
You don't want to do this.
You don't want to hurt anybody.

548
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:44,922
&nbsp

549
00:14:44,932 --> 00:14:47,033
She's willing to hurt
someone. Knock her out.

550
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:49,460
&nbsp

551
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,527
- Caitlin...
- Leave me alone.

552
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:51,529
&nbsp

553
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:53,429
- What are you doing?
- I have to find Alchemy.

554
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,431
&nbsp

555
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:55,297
We will find him. All right? Together.

556
00:14:55,307 --> 00:14:55,299
&nbsp

557
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:57,166
No. You don't understand.
I don't want to lock him up.

558
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:57,168
&nbsp

559
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,143
- I need him to help me.
- Help you what?

560
00:14:59,153 --> 00:14:59,168
&nbsp

561
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:01,526
I need him to get rid of my powers.

562
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:02,116
&nbsp

563
00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:03,616
Oh, Caitlin.

564
00:15:03,626 --> 00:15:04,190
&nbsp

565
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,112
I don't know if it works that way.

566
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:06,137
&nbsp

567
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:07,902
You don't know that it doesn't.

568
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:08,064
&nbsp

569
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,791
I know that we love you.

570
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:09,908
&nbsp

571
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,916
And we will do everything
that we can to help you.

572
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:13,448
&nbsp

573
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,684
You and I... we've been
through too much together

574
00:15:15,694 --> 00:15:15,686
&nbsp

575
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:17,920
to let each other down now.

576
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:17,922
&nbsp

577
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:21,056
Please. Let me help you.

578
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,373
&nbsp

579
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:24,206
Like you helped your mother?

580
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,198
&nbsp

581
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,263
Caitlin.

582
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:26,288
&nbsp

583
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:28,589
Or Wally? Or me?

584
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:28,908
&nbsp

585
00:15:28,918 --> 00:15:31,267
You keep messing with everyone's lives,

586
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:31,269
&nbsp

587
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,302
wrecking everything,
and we're left behind

588
00:15:33,312 --> 00:15:33,304
&nbsp

589
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:35,532
to pick up the pieces
from your mistakes.

590
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:35,557
&nbsp

591
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,783
Some things you break
can't be put back together.

592
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:38,910
&nbsp

593
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,276
I can fix this.

594
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:40,278
&nbsp

595
00:15:40,288 --> 00:15:42,588
Oh, like you fixed Cisco's family?

596
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:42,783
&nbsp

597
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:46,080
You didn't tell Cisco that you
screwed him worst of all, did you?

598
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,213
&nbsp

599
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:48,050
You hear that, Cisco?

600
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,244
&nbsp

601
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:50,352
Dante was alive,

602
00:15:50,362 --> 00:15:50,354
&nbsp

603
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:51,930
healthy and happy,

604
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:51,955
&nbsp

605
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:54,416
until Barry created Flashpoint.

606
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:54,441
&nbsp

607
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:57,704
When he reset things,
that's what killed him.

608
00:15:57,714 --> 00:15:57,729
&nbsp

609
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,830
Barry is the reason
your brother is dead.

610
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,121
&nbsp

611
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,589
Albert's down. Shoot her!

612
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:18,649
&nbsp

613
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:20,182
That severed your triceps surae.

614
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:20,184
&nbsp

615
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:23,182
Even with your healing abilities,
it'll take four hours to regenerate.

616
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:23,207
&nbsp

617
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:25,220
Don't follow me.

618
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:25,222
&nbsp

619
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:27,189
Caitlin. Come on... gah!

620
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:37,690
&nbsp

621
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,658
- How much does it hurt?
- As much as I deserve.

622
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:41,315
&nbsp

623
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:42,948
Okay. Let me know.

624
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:43,243
&nbsp

625
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,276
They took Julian to County General.

626
00:16:45,286 --> 00:16:45,354
&nbsp

627
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:48,689
He's still out cold.
How hard did you hit him?

628
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:48,746
&nbsp

629
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:50,940
I don't know. I didn't
mean to knock him out.

630
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,382
&nbsp

631
00:16:51,392 --> 00:16:53,924
Or maybe I did.

632
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:56,687
&nbsp

633
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:58,187
Cisco.

634
00:16:58,197 --> 00:16:58,974
&nbsp

635
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,783
Hey, man, um,

636
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:01,480
&nbsp

637
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,260
what Caitlin said...

638
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,296
&nbsp

639
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:05,995
Was she lying?

640
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:07,704
&nbsp

641
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:09,690
No. Um...

642
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:09,715
&nbsp

643
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:11,339
You're sorry?

644
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:11,924
&nbsp

645
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:14,463
That you killed my brother?

646
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:15,526
&nbsp

647
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,205
'Cause he was here.

648
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:17,937
&nbsp

649
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:19,635
He was alive...

650
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:19,929
&nbsp

651
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,143
until you created Flashpoint,

652
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:22,168
&nbsp

653
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:24,331
- until you did this.
- I know, man.

654
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:27,536
&nbsp

655
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,690
I don't even know how to feel right now.

656
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,471
&nbsp

657
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:33,607
All I know is Caitlin is out there,

658
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,031
&nbsp

659
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,948
and we need to find her.

660
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,613
&nbsp

661
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,513
Can we do that?

662
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:39,515
&nbsp

663
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,148
Yeah.

664
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:43,652
&nbsp

665
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,674
I hacked Julian's computer.

666
00:17:45,684 --> 00:17:46,432
&nbsp

667
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:49,088
Caitlin had him look up two addresses:

668
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:49,625
&nbsp

669
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,587
16 Hawthorne Avenue
and 1104 Truman Place.

670
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:52,612
&nbsp

671
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:54,844
She's trying to find the
acolytes, I was trying to say.

672
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:54,869
&nbsp

673
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:57,331
What exactly would she want
with Alchemy's followers?

674
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:57,333
&nbsp

675
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,133
She must think that he
can take her to Alchemy.

676
00:17:59,143 --> 00:17:59,135
&nbsp

677
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,073
She wants him to take her powers away.

678
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:01,098
&nbsp

679
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:03,632
We know. We heard everything.

680
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:03,806
&nbsp

681
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,040
Well, two acolytes, two addresses.

682
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,065
&nbsp

683
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:07,580
Which one's she gonna hit first?

684
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,877
&nbsp

685
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,954
- We got to watch both.
- You're gonna stay here.

686
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:09,979
&nbsp

687
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,044
You can barely walk.

688
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:11,046
&nbsp

689
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,087
- I'll take Hawthorne.
- I'll take Truman.

690
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:13,112
&nbsp

691
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:15,227
I care about Caitlin, but
I don't want to leave Wally.

692
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:15,252
&nbsp

693
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:18,352
Dad, Barry and I will stay
with Wally. You go with H.R.

694
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:18,377
&nbsp

695
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:20,696
Oh, yeah, I would love that.

696
00:18:20,706 --> 00:18:20,721
&nbsp

697
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:23,166
Hey, you and me... all-star team, huh?

698
00:18:23,176 --> 00:18:23,191
&nbsp

699
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:25,636
All right, you know what? I'll make a
couple cappuccinos for the road, right,

700
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:25,661
&nbsp

701
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,495
so we're ready for tonight's
adventures. Hey, not to worry, Barry.

702
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:28,497
&nbsp

703
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,307
Right? We'll help her.

704
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,298
&nbsp

705
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:34,935
Cisco.

706
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:34,937
&nbsp

707
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,462
- If you find her...
- I won't call you.

708
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:37,873
&nbsp

709
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,406
You've done enough.

710
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:47,932
&nbsp

711
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:49,531
The acolyte's on the second floor.

712
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:49,556
&nbsp

713
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,233
- Cup of joe, Joe?
- No.

714
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:51,235
&nbsp

715
00:18:51,245 --> 00:18:53,719
No? All right. You're
a tea drinker, I bet.

716
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:53,744
&nbsp

717
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:56,220
If you want to talk nonsense, I'm
gonna need you to stop talking to me.

718
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,222
&nbsp

719
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:57,869
You're worried about your son.

720
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:58,158
&nbsp

721
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:00,072
Do you have kids?

722
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:00,097
&nbsp

723
00:19:00,107 --> 00:19:01,320
No.

724
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:01,345
&nbsp

725
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:04,572
Then I don't think we could
possibly have a conversation about...

726
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:04,939
&nbsp

727
00:19:04,949 --> 00:19:06,587
how I'm feeling right now.

728
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:07,641
&nbsp

729
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:09,892
Okay, but...

730
00:19:09,902 --> 00:19:11,389
&nbsp

731
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:13,586
as an interested
observer, I can tell you

732
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:13,611
&nbsp

733
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:16,095
Barry admires you.

734
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:16,460
&nbsp

735
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,693
Yeah.

736
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:17,947
&nbsp

737
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,962
Well, he needs to listen to me.

738
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:20,158
&nbsp

739
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:22,455
Yeah, well, the reason he doesn't...

740
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:23,409
&nbsp

741
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,666
is Barry's real superpower isn't speed.

742
00:19:27,676 --> 00:19:29,073
&nbsp

743
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,291
- It's hope.
- Mm.

744
00:19:31,301 --> 00:19:31,575
&nbsp

745
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:34,555
Kid's got an endless reservoir.

746
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:34,580
&nbsp

747
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,134
Believes everything's gonna work out.

748
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:36,159
&nbsp

749
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:38,797
Well, he's wrong about this one.

750
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:38,822
&nbsp

751
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:40,158
They all are.

752
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:40,183
&nbsp

753
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:43,033
I said it before: when my
gut tells me something is off,

754
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:43,058
&nbsp

755
00:19:43,068 --> 00:19:44,259
I trust it.

756
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:44,947
&nbsp

757
00:19:44,957 --> 00:19:47,089
And I need them to trust me.

758
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:47,091
&nbsp

759
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:50,166
The next time your gut tells our
team what to do, I'll trust it.

760
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:50,439
&nbsp

761
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:52,548
How do I know you're not just
telling me what I want to hear?

762
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,031
&nbsp

763
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,166
Well, what does your gut tell you?

764
00:19:57,176 --> 00:20:05,286
&nbsp

765
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:07,753
- What is that?
- The satellite.

766
00:20:07,763 --> 00:20:07,778
&nbsp

767
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:09,499
It's programmed to detect

768
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:09,524
&nbsp

769
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,290
rapid temperature decelerations.

770
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,816
&nbsp

771
00:20:12,826 --> 00:20:14,400
That's the house Cisco's watching.

772
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:14,425
&nbsp

773
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:15,757
Oh, God.

774
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:19,548
&nbsp

775
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:21,111
Honey?

776
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:21,229
&nbsp

777
00:20:21,239 --> 00:20:22,785
Craig?

778
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:22,827
&nbsp

779
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:25,103
It's freezing in here.
Go check the thermostat.

780
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:25,294
&nbsp

781
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:27,509
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

782
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:41,400
&nbsp

783
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,579
Both of my parents are doctors.

784
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:43,581
&nbsp

785
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:46,148
It's all I ever wanted to be.

786
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:46,150
&nbsp

787
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,452
Growing up, I used to
practice the Hippocratic Oath.

788
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:50,564
&nbsp

789
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:52,421
I was obsessed with it.

790
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:52,423
&nbsp

791
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:55,057
If anyone was even gonna step on a bug,

792
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:55,059
&nbsp

793
00:20:55,069 --> 00:20:57,860
I would say, "Do no harm."

794
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:57,862
&nbsp

795
00:20:57,872 --> 00:20:59,978
It's built into my DNA.

796
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:00,142
&nbsp

797
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:04,700
Unfortunately, my DNA
isn't what it used to be.

798
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,702
&nbsp

799
00:21:04,712 --> 00:21:06,869
So, believe me when I say

800
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:06,871
&nbsp

801
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:08,837
answer every one of my questions,

802
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:08,839
&nbsp

803
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:12,119
or I will harm you and your family.

804
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:14,993
&nbsp

805
00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:17,394
- Who is Alchemy?
- I don't know.

806
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:17,419
&nbsp

807
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:18,947
I've never seen him without the mask.

808
00:21:18,957 --> 00:21:18,972
&nbsp

809
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:21,006
I know he can give people powers.

810
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:21,031
&nbsp

811
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,518
Can he take them away?

812
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:23,166
&nbsp

813
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:24,525
Yes.

814
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:24,658
&nbsp

815
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,798
But you can't make Alchemy do anything.

816
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:26,823
&nbsp

817
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,978
He's just an acolyte, like me.

818
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:30,548
&nbsp

819
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,119
We both serve the speed god, Savitar.

820
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:34,144
&nbsp

821
00:21:34,154 --> 00:21:35,798
He's shown us the future.

822
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:35,868
&nbsp

823
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,167
I saw you there.

824
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:37,334
&nbsp

825
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:40,836
You were glorious and powerful.

826
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:40,838
&nbsp

827
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:43,275
My lord has special plans for you,

828
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:43,438
&nbsp

829
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:44,920
Caitlin Snow.

830
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:44,945
&nbsp

831
00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:46,931
Or should I say...

832
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:49,429
&nbsp

833
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,181
Killer Frost?

834
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,292
&nbsp

835
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:54,917
Caitlin!

836
00:21:54,927 --> 00:22:08,011
&nbsp

837
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:09,485
Really?

838
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,512
&nbsp

839
00:22:10,522 --> 00:22:12,650
You brought your toys?

840
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,783
&nbsp

841
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,616
I'm hoping it won't come to that.

842
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:18,260
&nbsp

843
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,666
It won't.

844
00:22:19,676 --> 00:22:19,691
&nbsp

845
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:21,416
Look, I'm not leaving you out here.

846
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:21,713
&nbsp

847
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,312
I want to help you.

848
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:23,314
&nbsp

849
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:25,480
There's only one person who can help me.

850
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:25,482
&nbsp

851
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:26,635
Really?

852
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:26,851
&nbsp

853
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:28,884
You really think seeking medical advice

854
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:28,886
&nbsp

855
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:31,653
from someone named Dr.
Alchemy is the way to go?

856
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:31,655
&nbsp

857
00:22:31,665 --> 00:22:33,346
Why not?

858
00:22:33,356 --> 00:22:33,958
&nbsp

859
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:36,325
My name is Killer Frost.

860
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:36,327
&nbsp

861
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:37,713
Your name...

862
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,557
&nbsp

863
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,252
is Caitlin Snow.

864
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:40,557
&nbsp

865
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:43,596
Can Caitlin Snow do this?

866
00:22:43,606 --> 00:22:51,952
&nbsp

867
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:53,485
Caitlin, please!

868
00:22:53,495 --> 00:23:06,769
&nbsp

869
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:08,035
Aah!

870
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:11,095
&nbsp

871
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:12,427
How's the leg?

872
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:19,413
&nbsp

873
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:20,969
I'm sorry, Caitlin.

874
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:20,971
&nbsp

875
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:23,218
That was cold, Flash.

876
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:23,243
&nbsp

877
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:25,210
But this is colder.

878
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:44,680
&nbsp

879
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,656
Start vibrating. It'll warm you up.

880
00:23:47,666 --> 00:24:08,745
&nbsp

881
00:24:08,755 --> 00:24:10,430
Whew.

882
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,579
&nbsp

883
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:14,247
Guess I just needed a little sleep.

884
00:24:14,257 --> 00:24:16,448
&nbsp

885
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,523
Thanks, guys.

886
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:17,524
&nbsp

887
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:19,469
I'm feeling much better now.

888
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:19,555
&nbsp

889
00:24:19,565 --> 00:24:21,126
It's okay. You can let me out.

890
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:21,128
&nbsp

891
00:24:21,138 --> 00:24:23,399
I promise I'm not gonna hurt anybody.

892
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:25,632
&nbsp

893
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:27,332
Hmm.

894
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:27,461
&nbsp

895
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:29,719
Guess you're all smarter than I thought.

896
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:30,008
&nbsp

897
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:33,638
You know, that was some
blast there, Vibe boy.

898
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:33,663
&nbsp

899
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:34,795
It kind of hurt.

900
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:34,820
&nbsp

901
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,328
I didn't want to hurt you.

902
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:36,539
&nbsp

903
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:38,492
You're pathetic.

904
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:38,680
&nbsp

905
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,713
Alchemy can't help you.

906
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:40,747
&nbsp

907
00:24:40,757 --> 00:24:42,447
But we can. I promise.

908
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:42,449
&nbsp

909
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:44,182
Oh, like you promised Eddie?

910
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:44,184
&nbsp

911
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:46,695
And like you promised Ronnie?

912
00:24:46,705 --> 00:24:46,758
&nbsp

913
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:49,022
You know, for a hero, Flash,

914
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:49,047
&nbsp

915
00:24:49,057 --> 00:24:52,390
you sure let a lot of
people around you die.

916
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,610
&nbsp

917
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,389
This isn't you talking. It's the powers.

918
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:54,414
&nbsp

919
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:57,170
They're messing with
your mind. You're sick.

920
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:57,195
&nbsp

921
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,829
I'm broken, Barry.

922
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,635
&nbsp

923
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:03,656
But what do you care?

924
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:03,904
&nbsp

925
00:25:03,914 --> 00:25:05,741
'Cause you've got Iris.

926
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:05,766
&nbsp

927
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:08,069
You got your happy ending.

928
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:08,094
&nbsp

929
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:10,485
Everyone else be damned.

930
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:10,777
&nbsp

931
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:13,078
So, I'll tell you what:

932
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:13,375
&nbsp

933
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:16,217
you guys let me go,

934
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:16,242
&nbsp

935
00:25:16,252 --> 00:25:21,052
and I will leave you to
your sad and miserable lives.

936
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:21,054
&nbsp

937
00:25:21,064 --> 00:25:22,487
No. We're not abandoning you.

938
00:25:22,497 --> 00:25:22,489
&nbsp

939
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:24,489
You did this to me!

940
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:33,016
&nbsp

941
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:35,283
Do you have any idea
how we can reverse this?

942
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:35,285
&nbsp

943
00:25:35,295 --> 00:25:37,117
How we can get her back?

944
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:38,189
&nbsp

945
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:40,039
It's like Caitlin said:

946
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:41,024
&nbsp

947
00:25:41,034 --> 00:25:43,414
sometimes when things get broken,

948
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,770
&nbsp

949
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,570
they can't be fixed.

950
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:51,813
&nbsp

951
00:25:51,823 --> 00:25:53,553
My son's not gonna end up like Caitlin.

952
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:53,578
&nbsp

953
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:56,032
- Help me get him out of this thing.
- Oh, no, no. Joe, no.

954
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:56,057
&nbsp

955
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:57,524
We don't... we don't want
to touch that thing...

956
00:25:57,534 --> 00:25:57,549
&nbsp

957
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,344
First off, we don't know what
that's gonna do to Wally, right?

958
00:25:59,354 --> 00:25:59,369
&nbsp

959
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:00,674
Maybe this is the kind of situation

960
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:00,699
&nbsp

961
00:26:00,709 --> 00:26:02,766
best left to the
people with the science.

962
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:02,791
&nbsp

963
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:04,633
You mean Caitlin?

964
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:04,658
&nbsp

965
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:06,658
Please help me.

966
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:18,173
&nbsp

967
00:26:18,183 --> 00:26:20,006
What are you doing down here?

968
00:26:20,016 --> 00:26:22,474
&nbsp

969
00:26:22,484 --> 00:26:25,313
We should all be working

970
00:26:25,323 --> 00:26:25,338
&nbsp

971
00:26:25,348 --> 00:26:28,188
to find Alchemy and Savitar
and figure out how to stop them.

972
00:26:28,198 --> 00:26:28,213
&nbsp

973
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:31,214
Instead, we're fighting each other.

974
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:32,546
&nbsp

975
00:26:32,556 --> 00:26:35,938
Yeah. Team Flash is not at its finest.

976
00:26:35,948 --> 00:26:37,438
&nbsp

977
00:26:37,448 --> 00:26:40,448
Why didn't I just follow
you inside the house?

978
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:42,117
&nbsp

979
00:26:42,127 --> 00:26:44,078
Because you were hurting.

980
00:26:44,088 --> 00:26:45,758
&nbsp

981
00:26:45,768 --> 00:26:47,758
You would do anything
to make the pain go away.

982
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:47,783
&nbsp

983
00:26:47,793 --> 00:26:50,992
That's why Caitlin
is so lost. And Cisco.

984
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:51,257
&nbsp

985
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:53,554
We will do anything
to make the pain stop.

986
00:26:53,564 --> 00:26:53,579
&nbsp

987
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:54,912
That doesn't make you a bad person.

988
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:54,914
&nbsp

989
00:26:54,924 --> 00:26:56,313
That makes you human.

990
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:56,461
&nbsp

991
00:26:56,471 --> 00:26:58,415
Tell that to my friends.

992
00:26:58,425 --> 00:26:58,656
&nbsp

993
00:26:58,666 --> 00:26:59,616
My best friends,

994
00:26:59,626 --> 00:26:59,618
&nbsp

995
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:01,133
one of them is locked up like a villain;

996
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:01,158
&nbsp

997
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:02,625
the other one hates me.

998
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:03,281
&nbsp

999
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:06,219
- You can not take this all on yourself.
- Why not?

1000
00:27:06,229 --> 00:27:06,244
&nbsp

1001
00:27:06,254 --> 00:27:08,659
How do you know that Caitlin
wasn't already affected

1002
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:08,661
&nbsp

1003
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:10,781
by the accelerator explosion,

1004
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:11,008
&nbsp

1005
00:27:11,018 --> 00:27:14,610
or that Dante wouldn't have
died in a car accident anyway?

1006
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,105
&nbsp

1007
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:17,305
You are not God, Barry.

1008
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:20,105
&nbsp

1009
00:27:20,115 --> 00:27:21,631
That's what Jay said.

1010
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:21,656
&nbsp

1011
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:23,373
Jay's a smart man.

1012
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:24,008
&nbsp

1013
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:26,563
You can not keep doing this to yourself,

1014
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:26,844
&nbsp

1015
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,779
constantly going over the what-ifs.

1016
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,781
&nbsp

1017
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,352
You'll go nuts.

1018
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:31,584
&nbsp

1019
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:34,651
Everyone in this building
needs The Flash right now:

1020
00:27:34,661 --> 00:27:34,653
&nbsp

1021
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:38,133
my dad, Wally... even Cisco and Caitlin.

1022
00:27:38,143 --> 00:27:39,390
&nbsp

1023
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,391
So, be strong like I know you are.

1024
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:45,422
&nbsp

1025
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:47,961
I know you don't want to
be the leader right now,

1026
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:48,239
&nbsp

1027
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,820
but you have to be.

1028
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,539
&nbsp

1029
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:56,343
I told you I couldn't
do this without you.

1030
00:27:56,353 --> 00:27:57,273
&nbsp

1031
00:27:57,283 --> 00:27:58,703
And you'll never have to.

1032
00:27:58,713 --> 00:28:00,813
&nbsp

1033
00:28:00,823 --> 00:28:03,180
- Wally.
- Yeah. Come on.

1034
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,351
&nbsp

1035
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:07,251
There's an energy surge
coming from the Cortex.

1036
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:07,253
&nbsp

1037
00:28:07,263 --> 00:28:08,671
What?

1038
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:09,088
&nbsp

1039
00:28:09,098 --> 00:28:11,021
Joe! Hey! What are you doing?

1040
00:28:11,031 --> 00:28:11,023
&nbsp

1041
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:13,423
- Hey, Barr.
- Hey, stop! You can't cut him out!

1042
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:13,425
&nbsp

1043
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:15,826
I have to.

1044
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:15,828
&nbsp

1045
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:16,827
Joe, don't!

1046
00:28:16,837 --> 00:28:41,887
&nbsp

1047
00:28:41,897 --> 00:28:43,209
Wally.

1048
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:45,891
&nbsp

1049
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:47,190
Wally?

1050
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:56,576
&nbsp

1051
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:59,107
- Joe.
- What did I do?

1052
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:00,420
&nbsp

1053
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,853
Was this your idea?

1054
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:02,396
&nbsp

1055
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:04,607
No. Joe... I was helping Joe.

1056
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:04,632
&nbsp

1057
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:05,858
No sign of Wally.

1058
00:29:05,868 --> 00:29:05,883
&nbsp

1059
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:08,535
I've got the satellite scanning
the entire city for rapid movement.

1060
00:29:08,545 --> 00:29:08,537
&nbsp

1061
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,287
If he's a speedster, he could be
halfway across the country by now.

1062
00:29:11,297 --> 00:29:11,312
&nbsp

1063
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:12,584
Barry, we have to find him.

1064
00:29:12,594 --> 00:29:12,609
&nbsp

1065
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,875
I'm more worried about what
happens when we do find him.

1066
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:14,877
&nbsp

1067
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:17,121
He didn't seem like
he was all there, Iris.

1068
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:17,123
&nbsp

1069
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:18,607
I shouldn't have cut
him out of that thing.

1070
00:29:18,617 --> 00:29:18,632
&nbsp

1071
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:22,076
Joe, I... what we need
right now is a biochemist.

1072
00:29:22,086 --> 00:29:22,101
&nbsp

1073
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:23,982
You've got to go talk to her, Barr.

1074
00:29:23,992 --> 00:29:25,851
&nbsp

1075
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:26,998
All right.

1076
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:40,296
&nbsp

1077
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:42,469
We need your help, Caitlin.

1078
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:42,710
&nbsp

1079
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,241
Wally... he's...

1080
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:44,680
&nbsp

1081
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,757
he's out of the cocoon,

1082
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:45,782
&nbsp

1083
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,733
but his biochemistry
is all out of whack.

1084
00:29:47,743 --> 00:29:47,758
&nbsp

1085
00:29:47,768 --> 00:29:49,194
He went AWOL.

1086
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:49,339
&nbsp

1087
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:50,843
So?

1088
00:29:50,853 --> 00:29:51,491
&nbsp

1089
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:54,214
So, when we find him,
he's gonna need your help.

1090
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:54,216
&nbsp

1091
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,772
He's gonna need your medical expertise,

1092
00:29:55,782 --> 00:29:55,797
&nbsp

1093
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:57,851
your experience with metas.

1094
00:29:57,861 --> 00:29:57,853
&nbsp

1095
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:00,858
What he needs is Caitlin Snow, MD.

1096
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:00,999
&nbsp

1097
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:04,791
So, you came to try and
talk some sense into me.

1098
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:04,793
&nbsp

1099
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,452
No.

1100
00:30:06,462 --> 00:30:07,896
&nbsp

1101
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,896
I came to let you go.

1102
00:30:09,906 --> 00:30:22,970
&nbsp

1103
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,080
For a smart guy, that
was an awfully dumb move.

1104
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:27,082
&nbsp

1105
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,416
Like I said, you're free to go.

1106
00:30:29,426 --> 00:30:29,418
&nbsp

1107
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,431
What's the catch?

1108
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:31,494
&nbsp

1109
00:30:31,504 --> 00:30:32,885
You have to kill me.

1110
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:32,910
&nbsp

1111
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,314
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

1112
00:30:34,324 --> 00:30:34,339
&nbsp

1113
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:35,455
It's gonna be all right.

1114
00:30:35,465 --> 00:30:35,457
&nbsp

1115
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,624
You want to fight, Flash?

1116
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:37,626
&nbsp

1117
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,759
No. I'm not gonna fight you.

1118
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:39,761
&nbsp

1119
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,028
But if you want to leave this room,

1120
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:42,030
&nbsp

1121
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,663
you're gonna have to kill me.

1122
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:43,665
&nbsp

1123
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,963
- Don't think I won't.
- Then do it.

1124
00:30:45,973 --> 00:30:55,416
&nbsp

1125
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:57,177
What are you waiting for?

1126
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:58,666
&nbsp

1127
00:30:58,676 --> 00:31:00,205
What's the big deal?

1128
00:31:00,215 --> 00:31:00,230
&nbsp

1129
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,382
Come on. Live up to
your name, Killer Frost.

1130
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:02,384
&nbsp

1131
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:03,836
I want to see some killing.

1132
00:31:03,846 --> 00:31:03,861
&nbsp

1133
00:31:03,871 --> 00:31:04,916
You want to be the villain?

1134
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:04,941
&nbsp

1135
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:06,361
This is what they do.
They kill their friends,

1136
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:06,386
&nbsp

1137
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:08,978
because nothing matters
to them anymore, right?

1138
00:31:08,988 --> 00:31:09,161
&nbsp

1139
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:10,572
Right?

1140
00:31:10,582 --> 00:31:12,137
&nbsp

1141
00:31:12,147 --> 00:31:13,799
Come on.

1142
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:13,835
&nbsp

1143
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:15,635
Kill me, Caitlin.

1144
00:31:15,645 --> 00:31:18,634
&nbsp

1145
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,499
You can't do it.

1146
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:20,890
&nbsp

1147
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,523
You can't,

1148
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:22,686
&nbsp

1149
00:31:22,696 --> 00:31:25,655
because underneath all
that cold, you're still you.

1150
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:32,614
&nbsp

1151
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,080
Barry!

1152
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:34,082
&nbsp

1153
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,639
It's okay.

1154
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:37,289
&nbsp

1155
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,811
I got you.

1156
00:31:38,821 --> 00:31:40,722
&nbsp

1157
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,455
It's okay.

1158
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:46,995
&nbsp

1159
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,248
I think extracting Wally
early from that cocoon

1160
00:31:49,258 --> 00:31:49,273
&nbsp

1161
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,879
left him in a fugue state.

1162
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:51,904
&nbsp

1163
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:54,668
His synapses aren't used to
functioning at super-speed,

1164
00:31:54,678 --> 00:31:54,670
&nbsp

1165
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,904
so his mind and muscles are misfiring.

1166
00:31:57,914 --> 00:31:57,929
&nbsp

1167
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,451
I mean, will this stuff help?

1168
00:31:59,461 --> 00:31:59,476
&nbsp

1169
00:31:59,486 --> 00:32:01,232
I've synthesized a neural compound

1170
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:01,257
&nbsp

1171
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:05,209
that I think will get his mind
and body running at the same speed.

1172
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:05,311
&nbsp

1173
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:07,291
We just have to find him first.

1174
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:07,316
&nbsp

1175
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:08,795
Where'd he go, Joe?

1176
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:11,420
&nbsp

1177
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,019
What's your gut tell you?

1178
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:15,958
&nbsp

1179
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:17,857
The house that he grew up in.

1180
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:17,859
&nbsp

1181
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,482
He used to go there when
he missed his mother.

1182
00:32:19,492 --> 00:32:19,507
&nbsp

1183
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:21,073
In Keystone.

1184
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,093
&nbsp

1185
00:32:23,103 --> 00:32:24,559
Thank you.

1186
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:36,568
&nbsp

1187
00:32:36,578 --> 00:32:38,061
Wally!

1188
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:38,357
&nbsp

1189
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:39,795
Wally!

1190
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:39,820
&nbsp

1191
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,448
It's your dad, son.

1192
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:42,829
&nbsp

1193
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,395
You're gonna be all right.

1194
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:45,764
&nbsp

1195
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:47,420
We're gonna take care of you, okay?

1196
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:52,913
&nbsp

1197
00:32:52,923 --> 00:32:54,498
Dad.

1198
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:55,184
&nbsp

1199
00:32:55,194 --> 00:32:56,583
Ooh!

1200
00:32:56,593 --> 00:33:12,995
&nbsp

1201
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:15,941
Damn. How fast is he going?

1202
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:15,966
&nbsp

1203
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:18,583
Faster than Barry
could at the beginning.

1204
00:33:18,593 --> 00:33:19,368
&nbsp

1205
00:33:19,378 --> 00:33:21,230
I, uh...

1206
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,224
&nbsp

1207
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,558
I just wanted to...

1208
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:27,686
&nbsp

1209
00:33:27,696 --> 00:33:29,118
It's okay.

1210
00:33:29,128 --> 00:33:29,355
&nbsp

1211
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:32,588
You scared me for a second, getting all
Mother of Dragons on me with that hair.

1212
00:33:32,598 --> 00:33:33,749
&nbsp

1213
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,315
Thank you.

1214
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:37,574
&nbsp

1215
00:33:37,584 --> 00:33:40,526
That is the greatest
feeling I've ever felt.

1216
00:33:40,536 --> 00:33:40,551
&nbsp

1217
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:42,489
- Barry, it's unreal.
- Yeah, it is.

1218
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:42,491
&nbsp

1219
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:45,192
- How fast was I going?
- Too fast.

1220
00:33:45,202 --> 00:33:45,194
&nbsp

1221
00:33:45,204 --> 00:33:47,791
Dad, don't look so worried.
I'm fine. I feel fine.

1222
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:47,816
&nbsp

1223
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:49,763
In fact, I feel kind of awesome,

1224
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:49,765
&nbsp

1225
00:33:49,775 --> 00:33:52,199
like everything is buzzing, electric,

1226
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:52,224
&nbsp

1227
00:33:52,234 --> 00:33:54,082
like I could do anything.

1228
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:54,160
&nbsp

1229
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,612
That is what it feels like.

1230
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:55,637
&nbsp

1231
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:58,472
Got the Speed Force coursing
through you... giving you power.

1232
00:33:58,482 --> 00:33:58,699
&nbsp

1233
00:33:58,709 --> 00:33:59,770
You're a speedster now.

1234
00:33:59,780 --> 00:33:59,795
&nbsp

1235
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,308
Cool.

1236
00:34:01,318 --> 00:34:01,739
&nbsp

1237
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,215
Um, so, what next?

1238
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:03,240
&nbsp

1239
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,381
Um, Caitlin is gonna run every
test she can think of on you.

1240
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:07,383
&nbsp

1241
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:09,318
I mean, if you're up for it.

1242
00:34:09,328 --> 00:34:09,532
&nbsp

1243
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:12,700
Being a doctor? That, I'm always up for.

1244
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,455
&nbsp

1245
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:17,537
Yeah, um, but when do I get
to go out, Barry, with you?

1246
00:34:17,547 --> 00:34:17,935
&nbsp

1247
00:34:17,945 --> 00:34:19,137
Uh...

1248
00:34:19,147 --> 00:34:19,162
&nbsp

1249
00:34:19,172 --> 00:34:20,537
Okay, let's just take it

1250
00:34:20,547 --> 00:34:20,562
&nbsp

1251
00:34:20,572 --> 00:34:23,263
one normal-speed step at a time.

1252
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:23,265
&nbsp

1253
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:24,664
Slow down, Wallace.

1254
00:34:24,674 --> 00:34:24,666
&nbsp

1255
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:26,380
Barr, it's the hospital.

1256
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:26,405
&nbsp

1257
00:34:26,415 --> 00:34:27,921
Julian's awake.

1258
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:28,270
&nbsp

1259
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,974
He knows it was me. He knows what I did.

1260
00:34:30,984 --> 00:34:31,171
&nbsp

1261
00:34:31,181 --> 00:34:32,529
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.

1262
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:32,554
&nbsp

1263
00:34:32,564 --> 00:34:34,366
You'll be fine. I promise.

1264
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:41,150
&nbsp

1265
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,360
Hey, man.

1266
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:43,749
&nbsp

1267
00:34:43,759 --> 00:34:47,254
I just wanted to see if
you wanted to talk about...

1268
00:34:47,264 --> 00:34:47,256
&nbsp

1269
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:49,089
I don't.

1270
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:49,280
&nbsp

1271
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:52,359
All right. Um...

1272
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:56,171
&nbsp

1273
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:58,147
Look, Cisco...

1274
00:34:58,157 --> 00:34:58,866
&nbsp

1275
00:34:58,876 --> 00:35:00,892
you're my best friend, man.

1276
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:01,366
&nbsp

1277
00:35:01,376 --> 00:35:02,989
Are we gonna be okay?

1278
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:03,014
&nbsp

1279
00:35:03,024 --> 00:35:04,714
You and me?

1280
00:35:04,724 --> 00:35:11,773
&nbsp

1281
00:35:11,783 --> 00:35:14,011
You want me to be honest with you?

1282
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:16,685
&nbsp

1283
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:18,715
Yeah. Yeah.

1284
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:22,374
&nbsp

1285
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:23,606
I don't know.

1286
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:27,609
&nbsp

1287
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:29,342
Okay.

1288
00:35:29,352 --> 00:35:45,363
&nbsp

1289
00:35:45,373 --> 00:35:46,713
Hey, Patterson.

1290
00:35:46,723 --> 00:35:46,715
&nbsp

1291
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:48,895
Barry Allen, don't you ever work?

1292
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:48,920
&nbsp

1293
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,330
I just wanted to make sure
that Julian was doing okay.

1294
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:52,355
&nbsp

1295
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:53,816
Well, I'm about to take
his statement, yeah.

1296
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:53,841
&nbsp

1297
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,745
Uh, would it be okay if I
talked to him before you went in?

1298
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:56,770
&nbsp

1299
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,493
I just... we're pretty close, him and I.

1300
00:35:59,503 --> 00:35:59,518
&nbsp

1301
00:35:59,528 --> 00:36:01,716
Yeah. Go ahead. Just make it quick.

1302
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:01,741
&nbsp

1303
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:03,608
Always. Thank you.

1304
00:36:03,618 --> 00:36:05,979
&nbsp

1305
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:07,846
- Oh.
- Hey.

1306
00:36:07,856 --> 00:36:07,886
&nbsp

1307
00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:11,043
A hospital visit. I didn't
think you missed me that much.

1308
00:36:11,053 --> 00:36:11,207
&nbsp

1309
00:36:11,217 --> 00:36:13,379
What did the doctors say?

1310
00:36:13,389 --> 00:36:14,027
&nbsp

1311
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:17,073
Concussion and frostbite,

1312
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:17,098
&nbsp

1313
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,678
but I'll be dandy in a few days.

1314
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:18,680
&nbsp

1315
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,379
That's good news. I'm glad
you're gonna be all right.

1316
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:21,426
&nbsp

1317
00:36:21,436 --> 00:36:24,217
Yes, and as much as I appreciate
your outburst of emotion,

1318
00:36:24,227 --> 00:36:24,219
&nbsp

1319
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:26,652
I think we both know the
real reason you're here.

1320
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:26,809
&nbsp

1321
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:29,518
Your friend Caitlin Snow.

1322
00:36:29,528 --> 00:36:29,543
&nbsp

1323
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:30,909
She's a meta,

1324
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:30,911
&nbsp

1325
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:33,254
and not one of the friendly ones.

1326
00:36:33,264 --> 00:36:33,279
&nbsp

1327
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:34,647
Did you know?

1328
00:36:34,657 --> 00:36:34,649
&nbsp

1329
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,254
She's sick, Julian.

1330
00:36:36,264 --> 00:36:36,279
&nbsp

1331
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:38,713
She is a bloody menace.

1332
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:38,954
&nbsp

1333
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,520
Julian...

1334
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,923
&nbsp

1335
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:46,223
man, I know that you think that
getting powers is this binary game,

1336
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:46,248
&nbsp

1337
00:36:46,258 --> 00:36:48,127
that you're either good or evil,

1338
00:36:48,137 --> 00:36:48,129
&nbsp

1339
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,338
but life isn't like
that, even for metas.

1340
00:36:50,348 --> 00:36:50,363
&nbsp

1341
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:54,601
Look. Caitlin... she's a good person.

1342
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:56,336
&nbsp

1343
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:58,262
I'm begging you: don't turn her in.

1344
00:36:58,272 --> 00:36:58,287
&nbsp

1345
00:36:58,297 --> 00:37:00,832
I will do anything you want, but..

1346
00:37:00,842 --> 00:37:02,792
&nbsp

1347
00:37:02,802 --> 00:37:04,730
please don't do this to her.

1348
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,465
&nbsp

1349
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:12,543
I got hit pretty hard,

1350
00:37:12,553 --> 00:37:14,333
&nbsp

1351
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:17,801
and I don't have the foggiest
who even kidnapped me at all.

1352
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:20,574
&nbsp

1353
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:22,903
Thank you, man.

1354
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:23,738
&nbsp

1355
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:25,238
Thank you.

1356
00:37:25,248 --> 00:37:27,520
&nbsp

1357
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,691
There is one thing you
can do for me, mate.

1358
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:29,926
&nbsp

1359
00:37:29,936 --> 00:37:32,371
- Anything.
- Quit.

1360
00:37:32,381 --> 00:37:32,874
&nbsp

1361
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,073
What?

1362
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:34,075
&nbsp

1363
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,375
Tender your resignation

1364
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:35,377
&nbsp

1365
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:36,876
from the Central City Police Department,

1366
00:37:36,886 --> 00:37:36,878
&nbsp

1367
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,745
effective immediately.

1368
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:40,515
&nbsp

1369
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,135
I can overlook the unexplained absences,

1370
00:37:43,145 --> 00:37:43,160
&nbsp

1371
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,753
the constant disregard for
the rules and regulations,

1372
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:46,755
&nbsp

1373
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,348
but your moral compass
is broken, my friend.

1374
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:51,027
&nbsp

1375
00:37:51,037 --> 00:37:53,537
I point-blank refuse

1376
00:37:53,547 --> 00:37:53,562
&nbsp

1377
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:56,062
to work with someone whose
sense of right or wrong is

1378
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:56,064
&nbsp

1379
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:58,012
as flippant as the weather,

1380
00:37:58,022 --> 00:37:58,099
&nbsp

1381
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:02,215
someone who thinks friendship
is more important than justice.

1382
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:02,723
&nbsp

1383
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:05,905
You are unfit to be CSI.

1384
00:38:05,915 --> 00:38:05,907
&nbsp

1385
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:10,082
Barry Allen has no
place in law enforcement.

1386
00:38:10,092 --> 00:38:14,095
&nbsp

1387
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:16,512
Now, do we have an agreement,

1388
00:38:16,522 --> 00:38:17,504
&nbsp

1389
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:20,160
or would you like the
detective to meet that girl?

1390
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,035
&nbsp

1391
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:25,332
All right.

1392
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:35,142
&nbsp

1393
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:36,709
He's all yours.

1394
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,809
&nbsp

1395
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:42,017
- Hey, Albert.
- Hey.

1396
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:42,042
&nbsp

1397
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:45,321
So, what can you tell me
about our... our meta friend?

1398
00:38:45,331 --> 00:38:45,836
&nbsp

1399
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:48,314
I don't really remember anything.

1400
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:48,316
&nbsp

1401
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,618
To be honest with you, it's
all a bit of a blur, so...

1402
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:57,926
&nbsp

1403
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,524
Hey.

1404
00:38:59,534 --> 00:38:59,549
&nbsp

1405
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:01,227
Hey.

1406
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:02,133
&nbsp

1407
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:03,719
We just heard from Singh.

1408
00:39:03,729 --> 00:39:03,797
&nbsp

1409
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:05,832
You quit? What... what is going on?

1410
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:05,834
&nbsp

1411
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,508
I, um...

1412
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:08,703
&nbsp

1413
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,703
didn't really have a choice.

1414
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:10,961
&nbsp

1415
00:39:10,971 --> 00:39:13,072
What do you mean, you
didn't have a choice?

1416
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:13,074
&nbsp

1417
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,607
Julian.

1418
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:14,891
&nbsp

1419
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:18,116
You quit, he keeps his
mouth shut about Caitlin.

1420
00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:18,141
&nbsp

1421
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:19,438
That son of a bitch.

1422
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:19,463
&nbsp

1423
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:22,782
I don't know. I mean, he said I couldn't
do something like protect Caitlin

1424
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:22,784
&nbsp

1425
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,243
and still be a good CSI,
and maybe he's right.

1426
00:39:26,253 --> 00:39:26,268
&nbsp

1427
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:27,813
No, he's not.

1428
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,219
&nbsp

1429
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:30,189
Barry, you are an incredible CSI,

1430
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:30,191
&nbsp

1431
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,624
and no one in this building cares more

1432
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:31,626
&nbsp

1433
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,459
about helping people
find justice than you.

1434
00:39:33,469 --> 00:39:33,461
&nbsp

1435
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,421
And that was long before
you were The Flash.

1436
00:39:35,431 --> 00:39:35,446
&nbsp

1437
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,227
This lab... it's your life.

1438
00:39:37,237 --> 00:39:37,252
&nbsp

1439
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:38,672
You're my life.

1440
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:39,863
&nbsp

1441
00:39:39,873 --> 00:39:41,596
Both of you.

1442
00:39:41,606 --> 00:39:41,621
&nbsp

1443
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:44,344
And Wally and Caitlin, and...

1444
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:45,373
&nbsp

1445
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,639
Cisco.

1446
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:48,043
&nbsp

1447
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,860
If these past few months have
taught me anything, it's that...

1448
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,071
&nbsp

1449
00:39:51,081 --> 00:39:54,094
I would give up everything
I have to keep you all safe.

1450
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:54,119
&nbsp

1451
00:39:54,129 --> 00:39:55,252
No regrets.

1452
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:55,485
&nbsp

1453
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:58,618
Every time I think you've
run out of ways to be a hero,

1454
00:39:58,628 --> 00:39:59,149
&nbsp

1455
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,987
you show me another one.

1456
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:04,602
&nbsp

1457
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:06,188
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1458
00:40:06,198 --> 00:40:06,213
&nbsp

1459
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:07,912
Yeah, let's get out of here.

1460
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:34,729
&nbsp

1461
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:36,610
Julian.

1462
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,860
&nbsp

1463
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,560
Julian!

1464
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,243
&nbsp

1465
00:40:44,253 --> 00:40:45,930
No. Stay away.

1466
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,168
&nbsp

1467
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,422
No, Julian. You can't get away.

1468
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:50,447
&nbsp

1469
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:52,578
There's nowhere I won't find you.

1470
00:40:52,588 --> 00:40:58,586
&nbsp

1471
00:40:58,596 --> 00:41:04,438
Only together can we
bring about my return.

1472
00:41:04,448 --> 00:41:13,765
&nbsp

1473
00:41:13,775 --> 00:41:17,367
Become my servant once more.

1474
00:41:17,377 --> 00:41:23,049
&nbsp

1475
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:25,705
Become Alchemy.

1476
