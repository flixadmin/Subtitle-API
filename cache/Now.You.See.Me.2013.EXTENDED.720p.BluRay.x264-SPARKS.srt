No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

227

- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

No one could fit through there. No one.

No. I'm the main attraction.

234
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,529
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,641
Mommy?

613
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,720
Daddy.

614
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,280
Ah! You have big daddy issues.

615
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,170
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.

616
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,483
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

617
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,443
Me? I'll take a tenner.

618
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,807
Okay, later, if you're
feeling magnanimous...

619
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,090
I'll still take a tenner.

620
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,842
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

621
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,008
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

622
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,520
And you know who put them there?

623
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,489
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

624
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,606
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

625
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,531
than you can maintain that phony arrogance.

626
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,527
And the instant that you even show
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

627
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,841
I'll be there.

628
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,604
I will be all over you like...

629
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,841
Like white on rice?

630
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,685
Sorry. That's unfair.

631
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,002
Let me warn you. I want you to follow.

632
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,611
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

633
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,365
we will always be one step, three steps,
seven steps ahead of you.

634
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,566
And just when you think you're catching up,

635
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,160
that's when we'll be right behind you.

636
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,611
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

637
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,761
exactly where I want you to be.

638
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,969
So come close. Get all over me
because the closer you think you are,

639
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,371
the less you'll actually see.

640
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,010
- I'm gonna nail you...

they're gonna do it again.

649

About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

Hey. Guys.

Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

653
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,246
Most of it was just filler.

654
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,004
People that Tressier
dragged in to pack the room.

655
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,129
But guess who was sitting there in the
back, filming the whole damn thing?

656
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,241
I don't know.

657
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,805
Thaddeus Bradley.

658
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,442
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

659
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,527
No.

660
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,762
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

661
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,843
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

662
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,046
Get him on the phone.

663
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,010
- I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.
- Good.

in a glass of wine?

Is that how Jesus did it?
That's incredible.

675
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,651
I'm sorry. Can I just take a minute here?

676
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,041
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

677
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,325
Do you know how many people
went to see magic performed live

678
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,004
in the last half decade?

679
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,320
About 1.6 million.

680
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,768
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

681
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,126
Five million.

682
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,247
Right, so it's about the money.

683
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,845
Well, the money is only there

684
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,203
because the need to know
is greater than the desire to be fooled.

685
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,604
Like you, I detest those who prey
upon the gullibility of the masses.

686
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,366
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

687
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,927
Cost?

688
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,331
I don't know. Careers.

689
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,526
Lives.

690
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,809
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

691
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,123
I'm sorry, who?

692
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,690
Lionel Shrike.

693
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,084
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

694
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,966
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

695
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,522
The next year,
Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

696
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,968
He was shackled inside a safe,
and dropped into the river.

697
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,166
But he never resurfaced.

698
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,481
You mean he died?

699
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,364
I didn't kill him.

700
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,729
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

701
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,007
You do realize this is a game?

702
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,889
Believe me, it's not a game.

703
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,121
It is a game.

704
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,964
You're the game. You're being played.

705
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,442
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

706
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,324
I mean, come on.

707
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,401
You got me.

708
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,720
If you really want to know

709
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,600
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

710
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,648
my special comes out next month.

711
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,846
Or I could just bring you in

712
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,406
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

713
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,050
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

714
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,203
you actually don't know how they did it.

715
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,322
Showmanship and theatrics.

716
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,682
When a magician waves his hand and says,

717
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,609
"This is where the magic is happening."

718
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,047
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

719
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,530
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

720
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,007
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

721
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,685
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

722
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,571
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

723
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,040
But don't take my word for it.

724
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,244
How about a trip to Paris?

They saw the tree in half.

Inside the tree, encased in glass,

is the card with the signature.

Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

1071

Nice watch.

1072
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,681
It's a family heirloom.

1073
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,525
Oh. By the way, I know
how he did that trick.

1074
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,443
- Who?
- Shrike.

1075
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,483
So, when he was 14,

1076
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,921
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1077
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,283
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

1078
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,211
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

1079
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,441
And?

1080
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,645
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

1081
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,840
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,
and presto!

1082
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,286
The card is in the tree.

1083
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,369
It was in the tree for 18 years.

1084
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,045
The card was in the tree.

1085
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:03,125
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1086
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,130
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

1087
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:10,928
It was to look so far
that you see 20 years into the past.

1088
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,004
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

1089
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,324

we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

1099
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,966
A man and a woman to whom we'd like
to dedicate tonight's performance.

1100
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,769
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1107

So I want you to look.

1108

Look as closely as possible.

Because the tricks you are about to see
may not seem connected.

But we assure you, they are.

1111
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,050
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

1115
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,968
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1116
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,168
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1117
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,485
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1118
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,848
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

1119
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,725
and put her inside this mystery box.

1120
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,204
There are two pencils out there.
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

before your very eyes.

you're about to.

And now we are gonna debunk
a few magic myths this evening.

1131
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,444
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1132
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,401
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1133
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,011
As has the mirror

1134
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,521
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,091
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

1366
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,004
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

1367
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,606
Didn't you?

1368
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,210
A pretty French girl shows up out of
the blue, acts like she's my partner

1369
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,009
- and then she lets the bad guy go?
- Let go of my arm.

1370

01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,605
What's the Eye of Horus?

1376
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,883
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1377
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,531
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1378

Find your way back yourself.

1379

Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tressier would like you
to join him for a drink.

1380
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,647

<font color="#808080">TRESSLER:</font> Thank you.

1382
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,687
What is your role with them?

01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,841

1384
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:58,769
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1385
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,763
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1386
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,049
If it makes you feel any better,
this wasn't about you.

1387
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,607
Please tell me why this was not about me.

1388
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,731
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressier.

1389
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,321
Played out on a global scale.

1390
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:17,651
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1391
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,010
The distraction,
while they set up the real trick.

1392
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:25,364
I was a $140-million distraction?

1393
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,361
Yes.

1394
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,204
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

1395
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,205
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1396
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,681
- You know...
- "I can destroy you."

1397
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,404
Yes, I do know.

1398
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,886
Well, you won't.

1399
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,602
And you won't destroy them.

1400
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:46,841
Whatever this grand trick is,
it was designed a long time ago.

1401
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,602
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

1402
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:57,002
So I suggest you sit back
and enjoy your front row seat.

1403
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,125
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

1404
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,368
Whatever you stand to make...

1405
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,041
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1406
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,605
And destroy them.

1407
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,042
I stand to make five million.

1408
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,000
Am I flinching?

1409
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,724
No, you're not.

1410
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,766
Hey.

1411
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,282
I'm sorry for your arm.

1412
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,970
No. I'm sorry.

1413
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,327
I was an asshole. I was drunk.

1414
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,891
I'm at a loss.

1415
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:59,250
You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent
any time away from the desk, he was right.

1416
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,608
I'm a researcher. That's what I do best.

1417
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,605
So what's this all about?

1418
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:10,971
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

1419
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,725
The Eye are the keepers of real magic

1420
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,690
and the protectors of
those who practice it.

1421
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,728
"Candidates for initiations

1422
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,929
must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience."

1423
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,169
- This isn't real.
- But there are some who think it is.

1424
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,170
May I?

1425
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:34,010
According to this,
they only take new people twice a century.

1426
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:37,762
So what? The Horsemen are doing these
shows in order to get into this thing?

1427
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,080
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1428
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:44,166
I mean, I guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks.

1429
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,561
They don't have to put on a show for that.

1430
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,165
It's probably just a myth.

1431
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:52,245
But it doesn't make any sense, and I don't
think logic will solve this for us.

1432
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,926
- You don't say?
- No.

1433
01:12:56,280 --> 01:13:00,922
I believe that some things
are only discovered

1434
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,403
if you take certain leaps.

1435
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,890
Well, I gotta get to...

1436
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,530
Yeah. Yeah.

1437

- Thanks. Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

1438
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,649
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1439
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,481

they were watching us, right?
