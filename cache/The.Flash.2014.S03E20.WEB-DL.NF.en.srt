00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,782

off his suit,

834
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,660
it's unlike any other metallic

What do you think it is?

837
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,624
- In Fermi liquid theory,
any sort of non-Fermi liquid

838
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,710
is called "strange metal."
- Mm-hmm.

839
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,962
- It's a theoretical compound
capable of dispersing heat

840
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:52,674
at high temperatures.
I think Savitar travels so fast

841
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:55,010
that he needs that suit
to neutralize the charge

842
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:56,302
he builds up around him.

843
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,763
- Huh.
Interesting.

844
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,973
So without the suit,
he's just a dude

of static cling.

846

So if we could build a device

capable of harnessing
that power,

848
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:12,151
