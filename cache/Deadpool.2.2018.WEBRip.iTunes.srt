I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.

209

But here's the thing,
isn't that how it always works?

210

to become their father...

Baby, that's Empire.

216
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,837
The point is, kids...

217
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,966
they give us a chance
to be better than we are.

218

they understand pain.

What's the most pain
you've ever felt?

1064

CABLE: I've got a list.

1066
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:23,735
We're gonna work down it.

1067
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:25,445
Together.

1068
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:28,740
Number one,
I'm gonna bend something.

1069
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,035
Something that was not
meant to bend.

1070
00:57:32,077 --> 00:57:33,161
I'm gonna stop you right there

1071

because I'm not gonna
make it to two.

1072

I won't even make it to one.

I don't do well with pain,
you know.

If I stub my toe,
I'm done for the day.

1076

I get nervous erections.

It'll only make it worse.

and I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

1081
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:53,307
Except for where they are.

1086

Intercept the convoy,

1087
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:03,358
grab the boy.
But not inappropriately!

1088

WEASEL: You know what,

1089
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:05,527
I wouldn't fuck with
Deadpool either.

1090
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:08,405
Because he's built a team.
He's unstoppable.

1091
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:10,991
He has an ass pen.
He'll stab you with it.

1092

Watch out for this guy, Cable!

1093

He's very short, 5'11".
Not like in the comics.

1094
00:58:16,997 --> 00:58:20,083
And if we succeed,
we all go home early.

them, Cable, I warn you...

I don't know much
about this Cable fella...

1100

but I guarantee
he hasn't killed

as melanoma has.

-Thank you, Bedlam.

in the group's name.

1107

1108
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:05,504

will be forward thinking.

1112
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:14,638
Isn't that
a little derivative?

1113
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,099
I don't recall asking
your opinion, Peter!

1114

01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:39,831
I ain't letting Cable
get to him,

1443
01:15:39,873 --> 01:15:41,291
even if I have to
teabag him to death.

1444
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:43,293
It's really just a sip of tea
at this point.

The first order
of business is

1447
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:47,381
to get me in front of Cable...

1448
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:49,174
so I can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body...

1449
01:15:49,216 --> 01:15:51,510
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

1450
01:15:51,552 --> 01:15:53,345
Then,
I'm gonna take his skin...

1451
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:56,473
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum.

1452

Is this apartment listed
on Tinder? Grindr?

You picked the wrong shithole
to fuck, future boy.

No. It's his "Basic Instinct."

He's really teeing it up,
isn't he?

1463
01:16:31,717 --> 01:16:33,760
Who gets to make
the first joke?

1464
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:35,137
I think we should all do it
at the same time.

1465

Trust me, I'm even less happy
about this than you are...

but you unleashed the
Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

1475

I can't bring him down alone.

1476
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:56,742
So here we are.

1477
01:16:58,076 --> 01:16:59,870
We're no longer
accepting applications

1478

there's a wind advisory
in effect until at least...

We don't have a lot of time.

Your friend's about
to make his first kill.

1483
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:09,171
No offense,
but if you know so much...

1484
01:17:09,213 --> 01:17:11,548
why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?

1485
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:13,175
Or better yet, head back
a little further,

1486

I use a device
to slide through time.

1488
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:19,014
The longer I travel,
the harder it is to control.

1489
01:17:19,056 --> 01:17:21,683
I got two charges:
one to get me here,

1490

one to get me home.

After that,
he gets a real taste for it.

Like 10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

1497
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:35,989
So he keeps killing...

1498
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:37,533
and killing, and killing,

1499

and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor.

never master.
