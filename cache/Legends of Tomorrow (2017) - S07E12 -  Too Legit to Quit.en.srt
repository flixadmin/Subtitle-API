00:36:56,181 --> 00:36:58,845
- Alun is a robot.
- What?

808
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,114
I went back to 1916, harvested his DNA,

809
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,482
and printed a robot Alun.

810
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,518
Then I used Gwyn's diaries
from the historical records

811
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,270
- to recreate his personality.
- Why would you do that?

812
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:08,972
Look, I intended to save Alun,

813
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,708
but then I discovered that
Alun's death is a fixed point.

814
00:37:11,713 --> 00:37:13,710
Ava and Zari were trying
to go back to save him.

They would've been killed.

816
