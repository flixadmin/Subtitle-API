1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,083
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,924
After five years in hell...

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,403
To save my city.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,443
Now others have joined my crusade.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,886
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,050
To the rest of Starling City...

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,765
...I am someone else.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,605
I am something else.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,086
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,441
I killed Sara.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,921
Malcolm gave me something
that made me...

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,043
...susceptible to suggestion.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,289
What happened wasn't your fault, Thea.
It wasn't your decision.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,807
Malcolm, he's going to face justice.

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,646
He's gone.
Malcolm Merlyn will never be seen again.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,931
Welcome to Nanda Parbat.

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,647
When I told you that Malcolm killed Sara,
he wanted her dead...

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,049
...but I am the one
who fired those arrows into her chest.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,242
I promised you your vengeance.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,449
So take it.

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,642
Kill me, but spare John Diggle's life.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,731
Let him go.

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,328
I will beg for it.

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,482
You've shown tremendous strength...

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,165
...fortitude...

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,169
...and power.

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,485
No, Mr. Queen.

28
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,603
I don't want to kill you.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,684
I want you to take my place.

30
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,971
I want you to become
the next Ra's al Ghul.

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,644
Ra's is a title greater than any one man.

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,288
Am I supposed to understand
what that means?

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,530
No. It's from a dialect no longer spoken.

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,491
Said to me by a man whose place I took.

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,046
Contemplating the same offer.

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,806
And what it means is:

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,721
"The tale to be told begins thus."

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,924
Don't let your footing betray you.

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,926
Let your power come
not from the strength of your attack...

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,048
...but from the ground
that holds your feet.

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,251
All men seek guidance...

42
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,443
...a purpose...

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,080
...a means to live without pain.

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,083
Those who journey here are given
such an exchange for their fealty.

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,682
You mean, they have to kill for you.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,846
No, Mr. Queen, they have to die for me.

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,371
Is all of this supposed to impress me?

48
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,771
No.

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,248
To inform you.

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,562
Surely, men have branded you a murderer...

51
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,285
...a torturer.

52
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,090
You see, I would never shame you
with such bluntness.

53
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,929
Because I see it in your eyes.

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,529
The struggle you have
with your dual identity.

55
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,082
Oliver Queen and the Arrow.

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,167
Neither giving you what you crave.

57
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,800
But becoming Ra's al Ghul will?

58
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,840
Oliver Queen is a man destined to be alone.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,322
- He loves a woman he knows he cannot have.
- You don't know me.

60
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,851
But I know the Arrow.

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,048
Al Sah-Him...

62
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,921
...will never be anything more than a
vigilante for those whose lives you save...

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,565
...at the risk of your own.

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,366
Your city will turn on you.

65
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,964
And your closest allies within the police
department will call you a criminal.

66
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,842
You will be scorned...

67
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,530
...and hunted...

68
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,966
...and then killed...

69
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,609
...dying as you began your crusade.

70
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,805
Alone.

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,325
Your brother attempted to have me believe
that he killed Sara.

72
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,324
Your confession is even less convincing.

73
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,404
- I don't have a reason to lie.
- Except to protect your father.

74
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,570
Why would I protect Malcolm,
when I turned him over to you?

75
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,689
He gave me a drug called Votura.

76
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,568
I put three arrows into her chest,
and I had no idea what I was doing.

77
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,484
He used me.

78
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,041
Someone she would trust.

79
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,602
So I don't deserve to be living any more
than Malcolm does.

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,008
There would be no justice in killing you.

81
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,409
I killed Sara.

82
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,364
Kill me.

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,886
Do it!

84
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,606
Do it.

85
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,530
The blood debt ends with Malcolm's death.

86
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,405
Which I can assure you
my father has taken care of already.

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,728
- Thea!
- Get away from her!

88
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,890
Nyssa, no!

89
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,600
Are you okay?

90
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,566
How the hell did she get out?

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,962
It's League training. Probably.

92
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,804
What were you doing down here?

93
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,644
I just wanted to pay my respects.

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,609
It was Herodotus
who first wrote of these waters.

95
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,690
And Ponce de León traveled the earth
in search of them.

96
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,569
And their discovery by Al-Khidr
is chronicled in the Qur'an.

97
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,169
And they have permitted me
to live way beyond my time.

98
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,644
You don't seem too fazed
by what I've told you.

99
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,004
I've seen things
that have helped me to believe...

100
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,325
...that this world is a much bigger place
than people realize.

101
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,165
As I told you on the mountain, boy...

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,287
...man can only evade death for so long.

103
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,370
And these water's powers
are losing their effect on me.

104
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,604
My time is almost over.

105
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,246
But my legacy won't be just ash and bone.

106
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,965
It will be history.

107
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,727
And you think
that I'll help you secure that legacy.

108
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,241
You survived my sword.

109
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,047
Your resurrection wasn't a gift
from these waters...

110
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,443
...but rather by force of your own will.

111
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,202
What better heir to immortality than someone
who has already claimed victory over death?

112
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,206
I didn't defy death
just to become an instrument of it.

113
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,324
We are justice.

114
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,530
Isn't that what
you've dedicated your life to?

115
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,248
Why confine your crusade
to a single city...

116
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,566
...when I can give you
a whole world to save?

117
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,843
By executing anyone
who stands in my way?

118
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,881
You would command resources
that you cannot even fathom.

119
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,640
Numbers greater than any army.

120
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,649
And more loyal.

121
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,730
Now...

122
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,049
...if you wish for them
to renounce killing as you did...

123
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,048
...thy will be done.

124
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,083
I doubt that.

125
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,204
It's called the League of Assassins
for a reason.

126
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,560
The League's reason would be your own.

127
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,525
You would be Ra's al Ghul.

128
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,444
And what if I say no?

129
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,360
Then you are free to leave...

130
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,928
...with your compatriots...

131
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,521
...as a gesture of goodwill.

132
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,883
All debts forgiven.

133
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,249
And all blood oaths waived.

134
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,850
Let's go home.

135
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,648
We really need to stop having these
"Thank God you're not dead" reunions.

136
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,291
- I agree.
- Heh.

137
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,970
I'm working on it.

138
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,243
- You look okay. Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Not even a scratch.

139
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,726
How is that possible?

140
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,091
- How did you get him back?
- Doesn't matter.

141
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,248
What matters is, you didn't kill him.

142
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,484
No, I wanted Ra's to kill him.

143
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,887
- And I still do.
- Thea.

144
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,366
He's not staying here.

145
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,722
You know there's nowhere else
I can take him.

146
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,082
If you think I feel bad
for him, you're wrong.

147
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,727
I'm not asking you to feel bad for him.
I'm not asking you to forgive him.

148
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,530
Just let him heal.

149
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,089
I have to go.

150
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,128
How did Thea react to her new houseguest?

151
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,482
- Fine.
- That bad, huh?

152
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,129
She ask how we made it back alive?

153
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,368
- I didn't get into it with her.
- How about me?

154
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,807
Like I said, Ra's had a change of heart.

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,445
Ra's doesn't have a heart.

156
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,450
He kicked you off a mountain,
put a sword through you.

157
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,688
Now he's giving you Malcolm back
gift-wrapped?

158
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,123
Diggle, we're back. We're alive.

159
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,288
Let's just be grateful for that.

160
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,725
What's the Chinese word for "okay"?

161
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,810
Or how do you say "okay" in Mandarin?

162
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,846
Everything is gonna be hao ba.

163
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,088
- I wanna go home.
- Yeah, I know, buddy.

164
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,851
But home's not really safe right now.

165
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,724
Because those men tried to hurt us?

166
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,844
Yeah, because of those men.

167
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,690
In fact, Akio, we shouldn't be
out in the open right now.

168
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,525
Akio!

169
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,206
- Oliver?
- Hey. Hey.

170
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,368
Hey, look, you cannot disappear like that.

171
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,689
I thought I saw my father,
but it wasn't him.

172
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,049
All right. Look, I get it, I get it.
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,611
- We can't get separated.
- The botanical gardens.

174
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,968
- The what?
- Mother and father always told me...

175
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,288
...to go there if we ever got separated.

176
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,926
- Okay.
- Come on!

177
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,245
Well, thank God.

178
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,889
Just because I'm furious with you,
that doesn't mean I want you dead.

179
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,721
What about Malcolm? I mean, I know
Laurel wants him dead. I mean, is he?

180
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,605
No. We got him back.

181
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,930
Well, I suppose, "Congrats," and, "Why,
oh, why did you do that?" are in order.

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,445
Oliver?

183
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,089
- Oliver, what are you doing?
- You're free to go.

184
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,605
My father would never trade
my life for yours.

185
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,969
- He certainly wouldn't for Malcolm Merlyn's.
- He didn't.

186
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,891
If no bargain was struck,
then how are you still alive?

187
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,969
Go home, Nyssa.

188
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,440
Okay...

189
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,325
...well, I don't understand
anything anymore.

190
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,602
- Why did Ra's...?
- It doesn't matter.

191
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,404
Let's focus on what does.

192
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,001
Somewhere, there is someone
that needs a reminder...

193
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,322
...that we are still
watching over this city.

194
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,646
There is a robbery in progress
at the Kingston Property Depot on 3rd.

195
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,123
A new shipment just arrived.
Whatever it is, it's worth a lot of money.

196
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,049
Okay, suit up.

197
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,806
- Oliver...?
- Suit up.

198
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,889
- I want this shipment done.
- Excuse me.

199
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,129
We're looking for the Catoca shipment.
Maybe you could help.

200
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,686
The Catoca shipment.

201
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,611
- Where is it?
- Uh... I don't know.

202
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,045
Sorry.

203
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,647
Boss said check the crates
for a Catoca manifest.

204
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,205
Drop it!

205
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,405
Look out!

206
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,483
You still need training.

207
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,800
- When are you gonna stop telling me that?
- When you no longer need training.

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,206
Arsenal?

209
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,165
The head guy got away. With these.

210
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,883
Ran into a new player tonight
who dropped some bodies.

211
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,645
I need a name.

212
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,923
- One of these four will give him up.
- Yeah.

213
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,886
But when he does,
you can read about it in the papers.

214
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,005
- Detective?
- It's captain now!

215
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,726
When were you gonna tell me?
Or were you gonna tell me?

216
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,002
You're really gonna stand there
still pretending...

217
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,969
...you didn't know
my daughter was dead?

218
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,641
- Captain Lance...
- My whole career...

219
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,367
...my whole life, even when I knew nothing,
I, at least, knew right from wrong.

220
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,164
And I knew vigilantism was wrong.

221
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,724
The day we take the law
into our own hands is the day...

222
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,570
...that we become outlaws.

223
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,809
And that idea...
That idea was precious to me.

224
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,211
Almost as precious as my own daughters.

225
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,284
I threw that all away the day
I threw in with you.

226
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,050
You know why?

227
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,726
Because I trusted you.

228
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,043
But I see the man under the hood now.

229
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,809
He lies, and he keeps secrets.

230
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,961
All so he doesn't have to carry around
the weight of his decisions.

231
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,529
And I'm done with him.

232
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,050
What would you say...

233
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,450
...if I told you I just connected
the virtual TCP to the open-source sensor?

234
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,449
I would say that you only think you did.

235
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,166
I've been trying to figure that out
for over two weeks.

236
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,127
If it makes you feel any better, I have
been trying for at least two full minutes.

237
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,846
Ah. Let me see.

238
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,042
Oh? You don't believe me?

239
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,289
Well, no, I just wanna make sure
you did it right.

240
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,681
Oh, and if I'm right?

241
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,850
Then I will take you to the best
steak dinner you've ever had.

242
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,684
Mm.

243
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,486
Which I'd probably do anyway.

244
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,762
I hope it's better than
that fusion place...

245
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,804
...where I needed this microscope
to find the food.

246
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,846
Oliver, hey. What are you doing here?

247
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,401
I mean, it's nice to see you here.

248
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,285
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Palmer.
- Likewise.

249
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,130
And, please, call me Ray.

250
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,405
Okay. Ray. May I speak with Felicity
for a few minutes please?

251
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,761
- Uh, absolutely.
- Thank you.

252
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,402
- I should have called.
- No.

253
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,961
I should have told you earlier,
when you got back.

254
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,128
- You don't owe me a thing.
- That's not true.

255
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,482
You're one of my closest friends.

256
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,646
We went up against a new crew last night.
One of them had his lips sewn shut.

257
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,525
- Is that a real thing?
- Apparently.

258
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,766
If only I had known I had that option.

259
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,291
Okay.

260
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,486
- Michael Amar?
- Yeah.

261
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,524
Street name's Murmur
because of the whole lip-stitch thing.

262
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,206
Practitioners say it focuses the mind,
like meditation.

263
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,406
You Okay?

264
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,803
I handed some of Amar's men
over to Lance.

265
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,571
He knows the Arrow knew about Sara
and didn't tell him.

266
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,125
What did Lance say?

267
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,482
Some variation on "go to hell."

268
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,967
- Oliver, he just needs time.
- No, he's right.

269
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,010
I lied to him. For months.

270
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,007
I kept something from him,
and he had every right to know.

271
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,765
Are you okay?

272
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,202
I mean, besides Lance and the whole,
well, me-and-Ray thing...

273
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,680
It just seems like there's
something else going on...

274
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,160
...underneath all of that.

275
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,250
I'm fine. Thanks for help with Amar's name.

276
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,329
- Oliver's not here.
- Actually, I came to see how you were doing.

277
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,441
He told you that Malcolm was here?

278
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,084
Go ahead.

279
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,124
I'd be the last person to stop you
from killing him.

280
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,082
My last attempt to do so
didn't exactly work out.

281
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,129
That's kind of why I'm here.
I'm worried about you.

282
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,688
Everyone's so interested
in saving my soul these days.

283
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,527
Look, no one wants to see Merlyn dead
more than me...

284
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,844
...but Oliver was right.

285
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,288
You wanted your own father killed.

286
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,084
Yeah, and how messed up is that?

287
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,130
I wish that I never learned
Malcolm was my father.

288
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,204
Everything since then has just...

289
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,410
You know, you're lucky, Laurel.

290
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,768
You have a normal father.

291
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,883
Someone who really loves you.

292
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,043
I can't say we're on the best of terms.

293
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,490
- Yeah.
- Ugh, ahem.

294
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,685
You should probably go.

295
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,888
How much of that did you hear?

296
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,648
Enough to know that I am the last person
you wish to see alive.

297
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,286
I'm not gonna apologize for what I did.

298
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,729
And I'd do it again.

299
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,160
I know.

300
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,240
You asked me to teach you to be strong.

301
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,010
To make sure you can't be hurt again.

302
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,924
You learned your lessons well.

303
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,767
I have learned nothing from you.

304
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,402
Do you realize that I'm so messed up
I was willing to die last night?

305
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,807
For what you made me do.

306
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,242
You know, I didn't actually think it was
possible for me to hurt any worse...

307
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,249
...than I did when I came to you.

308
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,920
You proved to me I was wrong.

309
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,650
So, what was it again that you taught me?

310
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,490
Show me the knife.

311
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,245
How did you know?

312
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,522
You are my daughter.

313
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,722
Do it, like I taught you. One strike
to the neck, it'll be over quickly.

314
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,604
You're sick.

315
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,770
I love you. And I want to do
what is best for you.

316
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,401
If that were even close to being true...

317
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,285
...you would have stayed out of my life.

318
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,005
Father.

319
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,601
Your safe return pleases me, my child.

320
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,247
Extend me the courtesy of explaining
why Malcolm Merlyn is still alive.

321
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,681
If you're not going to watch your tongue...

322
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,042
...then at least mind your tone.

323
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,044
Why did you release
al-Sahfer's murderer?

324
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,248
As a gift to Oliver Queen.

325
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,169
In advance for him becoming my heir.

326
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,571
You selected an outsider
over your own daughter?

327
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,888
He survived my sword.

328
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,565
Sara.

329
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,201
You're punishing my love for her.

330
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,529
At least do me the courtesy of
admitting it, you never approved.

331
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,291
I never approved of you allowing
weakness into your life.

332
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,491
And even in death, your devotion to her
pollutes your judgment.

333
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,771
- Target's name is Michael Amar.
- Yeah. Got him here.

334
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,247
Got out of Iron Heights two months ago.

335
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,005
- He escaped?
- No, released.

336
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,329
Turns out he was serving his sentence
based on a coerced confession.

337
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,045
Cops beat it out of him.

338
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,565
He confessed to a crime he didn't commit?
I might sew my mouth shut too.

339
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,570
He's not innocent anymore.
What was he after tonight?

340
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,650
His crew made off with a couple crates,
all containing these.

341
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,205
Industrial-grade diamonds.

342
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,244
The shipment was loaded
with high-end jewels they didn't take.

343
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,090
Why steal worthless diamonds?

344
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,250
- Million-dollar question.
- Street value's only a couple thousand.

345
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,204
We could use Felicity on this, Oliver.

346
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,164
She's preoccupied.

347
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,971
I know a couple of fences
from my less socially-responsible days.

348
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,721
I could talk to them, find out where
Amar's trying to move these diamonds.

349
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,285
That's a good idea.

350
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,281
You wanna tell me what's going on now?

351
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,764
Ra's predicted this.

352
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,320
He said that the city would turn
against me, and I would die alone.

353
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,165
Then we come back and the first thing that
happens is, Lance is shutting me out...

354
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,250
...and I see Felicity with Palmer.

355
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,568
It's like he looked into my future.

356
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,047
Sounds to me like Ra's is playing
with your head.

357
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,924
Question is, why are you letting him?

358
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,044
He wants me to take his place
in the League of Assassins.

359
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,802
It's why he let us go.

360
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,890
As a sign of good faith.

361
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,488
Is there even a world
where he can imagine you saying yes?

362
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,684
He said that I can do more as the new Ra's
than I could ever do...

363
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,963
...as Oliver Queen or the Arrow.

364
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,480
That I would have unlimited resources.

365
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,161
That I could make a difference,
not just a dent.

366
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,362
You're not really considering this?

367
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,562
Just because Captain Lance is angry,
and Felicity is momentarily unavailable.

368
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,524
It's more than that.

369
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,210
I just...

370
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,402
John, tell me honestly.

371
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,888
What have we accomplished?

372
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,446
Oliver.

373
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,723
All the people that we put away, John,
they got out.

374
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,523
The city's no better
off, the Arrow is not...

375
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,483
He's not making a difference.

376
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,686
And if I just can't be me...

377
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,167
...and the Arrow isn't enough...
Oliver.

378
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,970
...then maybe I should be Ra's al Ghul.

379
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,089
Is Malcolm still alive?

380
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,728
In my head I've already slit his throat
seven times.

381
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,408
- Broke his neck twice.
- Sorry that I had to bring him here.

382
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,681
Been trying to remember who I was
before Mom died.

383
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,969
Before Malcolm.

384
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,128
And I don't recognize her.

385
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,887
I couldn't even fathom...

386
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,287
...killing someone.

387
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,727
And in the last month...

388
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,206
...I've held a gun to
Slade Wilson's head...

389
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,330
...and nearly took my father's life twice.

390
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,807
But you didn't kill either of them.

391
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,321
You know why I didn't kill Malcolm?

392
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,365
Mom.

393
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,963
About what she'd think about her daughter
becoming a murderer just like him.

394
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,323
Thea, you're nothing like him.

395
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,362
There's something broken inside of me...

396
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,848
...just like there's something broken
inside of him.

397
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,608
Nothing can change that.

398
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,643
- Where are you going?
- To go buy my evil dad some soup.

399
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,685
- One big happy family.
- What did you do to her?

400
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,882
I encouraged her to kill me.

401
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,124
My version of being a supportive father.

402
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,687
- You really are insane.
- Perhaps.

403
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,570
But I'm not the only one.

404
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,843
Or do you doubt
that Ra's would release us both...

405
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,771
...without conditions?

406
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,765
No conditions.

407
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,405
An offer.

408
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,130
To take his place.

409
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,329
You don't seem surprised.

410
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,006
I don't put much stock in augury.

411
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,804
But there is a prophecy.

412
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,731
The man that doesn't perish
at the blade of Ra's al Ghul...

413
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,764
...will become Ra's al Ghul.

414
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,364
Ra's al Ghul doesn't offer, he orders.
Oliver.

415
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,891
Don't delude yourself into thinking
you have a choice.

416
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,366
Hey, what are those bamboo things called?

417
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,401
Hey, Akio, come on, all right? It's okay.

418
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,723
You need to remember that you're strong,
right? Just like my sister.

419
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,490
- You have a sister?
- I do.

420
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,729
And I miss her just as much
as you miss your parents.

421
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,126
Why aren't you with her?

422
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,489
Well, I told her that I had to hang out
with my good buddy, Akio.

423
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,045
- Really?
- Yeah.

424
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,602
We used to go to botanical gardens
just like these in Starling City.

425
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,771
Except she didn't know the plants
as well as you do.

426
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,647
Oliver, what's wrong?

427
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,130
Run.

428
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,485
Hi.

429
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,560
- Where's Diggle?
- He's out with Roy.

430
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,290
They're on their way back.

431
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,246
Thanks for coming.

432
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,763
Where else would I be?

433
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,201
It's not rhetorical.
Ray and I may be something...

434
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,920
...but that doesn't change
my commitment here.

435
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,488
- Good.
- What about your commitment?

436
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,527
John might have told me about your
employment offer from Evil Incorporated.

437
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,451
He also might have told me
that you may be considering it...

438
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,325
...which is, by the way, insane.

439
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,444
They're the League of Assassins.

440
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,768
That is not the name of a nice group.

441
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,604
I've been an assassin.

442
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,765
There is more than one path to justice.

443
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,205
There are a lot of different ways
I can answer that.

444
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,882
All varying on the theme
of, "You're crazy."

445
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,320
But I'm gonna go with:

446
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,484
What makes you think
that you're not already on the right path?

447
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,762
Okay. Okay.

448
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,203
Because it's been over two years.
You tell me.

449
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,081
What have I really accomplished?

450
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,409
My mother's dead.

451
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,568
Tommy, Sara.

452
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,641
Crime's not down, and my sister
is in 10 different kinds of pain right now.

453
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,287
So, you leave. Then what?

454
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,845
All the people you've lost,
all the sacrifices you've made.

455
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,849
It would have been for nothing.

456
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,044
I don't know why I'm doing this anymore.

457
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,927
I can't answer that for you.

458
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,969
Yes, Captain Lance is shutting you out.

459
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,721
But I don't believe you're the Arrow
so that people can say thank you.

460
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,881
And, yes, you and I are not together,
but that was your choice.

461
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,922
When we thought you were dead...

462
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,804
...each one of us had to figure out
why we were doing all this.

463
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,126
Seems like it's your turn.

464
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,362
Are we interrupting something?

465
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,166
What do you have?

466
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,046
Talked to a friend who ran a munitions
depot back when I was in Afghanistan.

467
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,891
I know why our guy is so interested
in low-grade diamonds.

468
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,368
The type Amar was interested in
is used to make diamond-tipped bullets.

469
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,602
They go through body armor
like tissue paper.

470
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,724
- Okay, so who wears body armor?
- The police.

471
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,845
The guys who beat that false confession
out of him, put him in prison.

472
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,771
- He's going to get payback.
- Okay, Roy, suit up.

473
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,611
Dig, secure the perimeter
of the station. Felicity...

474
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,723
Call Captain Lance. I'm already on it.

475
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,130
Hi.

476
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,490
Peace offering.

477
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,246
- I already ate.
- Right.

478
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,484
You know, it's funny.

479
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,331
A friend of mine is having trouble
with her father.

480
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,563
A son of a bitch who's barely human,
butyouuu

481
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,931
You know, history's taught me that you'll
give me the cold shoulder for a while.

482
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,529
And then you'll move on
to blowing up at me.

483
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,960
And then finally...

484
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,801
...you'll let it all out at a dinner
I've dragged you to after days of pleading.

485
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,287
But my point is, is just let me have it.

486
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,085
I deserve every minute of it,
and I am ready to take it.

487
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,729
But don't you think for one second
that I am giving up on us.

488
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,122
When you were a little girl...

489
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,687
...you used to wait up for me
when I was on nights.

490
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,486
You couldn't fall asleep
until I walked in that door.

491
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,886
- I remember.
- Yeah.

492
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,129
You were always the protector
of this family, of everyone.

493
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,684
Laurel Lance...

494
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,927
...always trying to save the world.

495
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,570
You can't save this.

496
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,922
- Dad...
- You don't know how hard I've tried...

497
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,600
...to forgive you for lying to me
the way you did.

498
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,608
I'm not proud of it.

499
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,084
You're my daughter, I'll always love you,
but I don't know if I'll ever forgive you.

500
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,689
Kill them all!

501
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,051
Duck!

502
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,044
Police band is filled with reports
of gunfire at the precinct.

503
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,811
- Any luck getting to Lance?
- Still trying.

504
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,207
Get down.

505
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,563
- I'll lay down cover fire, haul ass for the exit.
- I'm not leaving you.

506
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,570
Regardless of what you think,
I'm gonna protect my daughter.

507
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,489
Now, on my move, you run!

508
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,808
Go, go, go!

509
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,885
My father's back there.

510
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,764
Go, go, go!

511
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,925
Hey!

512
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,289
What, are you waiting for a "thank you"?

513
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,164
That's not why I do this.

514
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,604
Nice work.

515
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,607
Not without a few casualties,
but Amar is in custody.

516
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,161
So it's a "no"
on the whole victory-dance thing, then?

517
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,765
You know me, I don't dance.

518
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,728
But I do occasionally say, "Thank you."

519
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,001
You're welcome.

520
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,689
And you were right.

521
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,488
A "thank you" and a "you were right."
I should really be recording this.

522
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,569
I started all of this
because of my father...

523
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,371
...to right his wrongs.

524
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,609
It became something more.

525
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,724
But I never stopped to think about it...

526
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,810
...or about why...

527
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,290
...until you asked me to.

528
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,885
Well, what was the answer?

529
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,287
Tonight, at the precinct...

530
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,966
...the only thing that I could think about
was those police officers.

531
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,241
And how their families
were counting on me...

532
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,087
...and Roy and Diggle...

533
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,162
...to get them home safe.

534
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,970
That's why I'm doing this.

535
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,491
So...

536
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,402
...that means a pass...

537
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,286
...on becoming the most handsome
Demon's Head ever?

538
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,848
It means I'm not ready to give up
on what we're doing here.

539
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,250
You know, you're always saying
how you just want me to be happy.

540
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,169
The thing is...

541
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,525
...as long as you're in my life, I am.

542
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,045
I should probably take this.

543
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,531
- Who are those men?
- I don't know.

544
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,882
Then why are we running away from them?

545
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,730
Shado?

546
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,169
Are you all right?

547
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,170
What are you doing here?

548
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,722
Looking for you, actually.

549
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,651
I missed your sister.

550
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,607
I suppose I wanted something
to remind me of her.

551
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,529
Now's really not the best time.

552
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,530
Are you having problems with your father?

553
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,561
I have some experience in that area.

554
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,326
- Do you want to talk about it?
- With you?

555
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,650
You know what?

556
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,007
I could use a reminder of Sara too.

557
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,885
Dinner's on me.

558
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,689
During the fighting,
your technique was competent.

559
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,761
Why do I feel like that's your idea
of a compliment?

560
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,161
It could certainly be improved.

561
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,608
Is that an offer to teach me?

562
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,521
I have nowhere else to go.

563
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,804
It is not customary for
one to wait so long...

564
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,282
...before accepting a great honor.
I'm not accepting it.

565
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,361
- "The tale to be told begins thus."
- Maseo, this story...

566
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,045
...it's over before it begins.

567
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,651
You misunderstand.

568
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,406
It does not mean the tale is yet to unfold.

569
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,809
It means Ra's has already written it.

570
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,687
- The choice has been made.
- No.

571
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,728
I will always be grateful
for what you've done for my family.

572
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,161
For what you meant to Akio.

573
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,006
But if you insist on pursuing this path
of resistance...

574
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,446
...there will be consequences.
Is that a threat?

575
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,007
It is the will of Ra's al Ghul.

576
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,970
Yeah, who is it?

577
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,006
Hello?

578
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,051
Thea, are you okay? What's going on?

579
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,968
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

580
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,681
I don't know who I am.

581
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,004
Can I just stay here with you?

582
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,440
Yeah.

583
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,164
Cops believe they've won.

584
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,407
But we still got what?

585
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,891
How many rounds
of those armor-piercing diamond bullets?

586
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,686
You tell everyone who'll listen
what you've seen.

587
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,086
Go.
