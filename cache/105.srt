1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,260
Hello.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,700
He's on a bus with William.
-Who's William?

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,460
He's the most handsome and coolest
guy in all of third year.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,860
Invite me to have
dinner with your mom.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,120
Friday.
-Yeah.. Friday.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,140
Guess who's invited 
to the Penetrator party on Friday?

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,340
Are you for real, Eva?!

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,340
William asked me if I wanted to
go outside with him. I think we'll hook up.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,360
Hi! Is Jonas home?
-Yeah, he's in the living room.

10
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,700
Hello.
-Hi.

11
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,340
What are you guys playing?
-FIFA.

12
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,260
What's up?

13
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,980
What?

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,560
Where's your Russ crew today?

15
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,680
Don't you have a shit load to do?

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,100
It's only two years and seven 
months until Russ time. You better start working.

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,200
I know. I'm really jealous of you guys, who
spend their time on more constructive things..

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,980
Like playing games all day long.

19
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,980
What are you mad about now?

20
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,380
I'm not mad. I'm just 
kidding. Have a little humor.

21
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,840
I have to talk to you.

22
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,700
Drama!

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,800
What's wrong?

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,320
What's wrong with you?
-There's nothing wrong with me.

25
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,760
Okay..

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,060
So why haven't
you replied to my messages?

27
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,880
I was busy.

28
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,020
So you're not mad I forgot our thing yesterday?
-No, no.

29
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,640
I don't care.

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,260
You don't care?

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,160
Don't stress about it.

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,800
Okay, good.
-Good.

33
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,720
Fine.

34
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,280
Yeah, so I'll go.
-You're welcome to stay.

35
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,340
No, I have a lot of stuff to do.

36
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,940
Yeah, I'll call you.

37
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,520
He claims he's not pissed, but I think 
there's something when he doesn't want to talk about it.

38
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,960
But isn't he just pissed because he thought
that you didn't want him to meet your mom?

39
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,280
He thinks you're embarrassed of him.

40
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,520
You think so?

41
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,820
Just let him meet
your mom. What's the problem?

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,560
Chris has to tell Sana
that she can't be on our bus any longer.

43
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,860
Why?

44
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,840
Hello?! She nearly ruined our
entire social status, and I had to fix it.

45
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,900
I had to explain to the Penetrator
guys that we don't usually create a lot of drama.

46
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,800
It's really important what they think of us.

47
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:18,160
But maybe it wasn't Sana's fault?
-Have you met Sana? She's incredibly rude.

48
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,600
Sara and Ingrid aren't
the nicest people in the world.

49
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,700
I know Sara and Ingrid really well 
and they're not girls who start drama.

50
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,820
Really..

51
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,640
William..

52
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,280
What's up with you two?
-I think we'll sleep together.

53
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,540
Okay?

54
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,420
Don't you think you should
get to know him a little better first?

55
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,360
Why? He's totally perfect.

56
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:55,420
I want my first time to be with the most handsome,
 coolest '97 guy rather than someone basic.

57
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,120
You'll remember the first time for the rest of your life.
-His first time?

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,560
I've also heard that
William is really, really good in bed.

59
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,120
And that usually you don't get 
an orgasm the first time. But with William, you do.

60
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,660
I've heard about
five girls who got an orgasm.

61
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,580
Okay..

62
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,440
Hello?! I'm doing this for you guys too! 
This will guarantee we'll get to party on their bus.

63
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,580
Vilde?!

64
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,920
There's something I was wondering.

65
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,980
Can I borrow the pill from you guys?
You can't borrow the pill.

66
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,740
Not one pill. I thought for
a week or something. You have it?

67
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I don't have it.

68
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,600
Me neither.

69
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,400
Don't you sleep with your boyfriend?

70
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,180
I have a NuvaRing. And you 
don't want to borrow that one.

71
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,100
Where did you get it?

72
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,760
The doctor.

73
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,480
So much stress. Can't
you order it online or something?

74
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't know.
-Just go to the school doctor.

75
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,460
Can you come with me?
-Why?

76
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:06,060
Because it's really weird to go there alone.
-It's so much less weird with us..

77
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,140
Of course we can come, Vilde.

78
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,360
William!

79
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,040
Hey, are you awake?
-Yeah, I can't sleep.

80
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,720
What are you doing?
-It's just boring work.

81
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,100
No wonder your grades
are going down if you don't sleep at night.

82
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,800
I definitely won't sleep
if we're going to talk about grades.

83
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,820
How are Ingrid and Sara doing?
-Why are you asking and interrogating like that?

84
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,680
It was just a normal question.

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,700
Yeah. Yeah, they're doing well.

86
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,860
I have a boyfriend.

87
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,400
Oh?

88
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,220
Hm-hm.

89
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,100
Who is it?

90
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,960
Who?
-Hm-hm.

91
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,780
I thought you could meet him.

92
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,220
Yes!

93
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,360
Before you leave again?
-Hm-hm.

94
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,100
Maybe we can invite
him over for dinner?

95
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,460
Yes.

96
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,780
When are you leaving again?
-Saturday morning.

97
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,860
Maybe Friday night?

98
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,300
So nice.

99
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,340
Hi.

100
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,640
Have you become friends again, or?

101
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,200
This is Noora. I've told you about Noora.

102
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,980
Noora.
-Hello. Jonas.

103
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,840
We have an appointment at the school doctor.
-Yeah, what about Vilde?

104
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,480
Vilde will meet us there.

105
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,820
What's going on at the doctor?

106
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,140
We're helping a friend to get laid.

107
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,180
Okay.. Good luck with that.
-Thanks!

108
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,320
You guys are so slow!

109
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,440
Sorry!
-But, are you doing anything on Friday?

110
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,600
What is she doing here?

111
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,980
How did you know we were here?

112
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,520
Eva's boyfriend told me.

113
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,560
Did you tell your boyfriend?!
-I have the best news in the world!

114
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,680
Sana sold all the toilet paper!
-Vilde Lien?

115
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,060
I'm serious!
-How did she manage that?

116
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,440
I don't know! She said you
just had to send your account number and address.

117
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,360
Are you kidding?
-No!

118
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,060
Can she please join our bus?
-It's not something illegal?

119
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,980
No, no! She's Muslim.

120
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:53,040
No, but as a Muslim you go to hell if you do
 something illegal. She doesn't really want to go to hell.

121
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,380
Welcome!

122
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,740
Everyone.

123
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,280
What can I help you with?
-She's gonna sleep with a guy.

124
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,460
You're so lucky!

125
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,880
For the first time.

126
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,340
That's not just anything.

127
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,040
What do you mean?

128
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,000
My cousin bled so
much that she got anemia.

129
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,300
That's bullshit.
-No, bleeding can happen during your first intercourse.

130
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:26,000
Large bleedings should be taken
 seriously because they can in fact kill you.

131
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,760
She just got a little weak.
-Then she was lucky.

132
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:37,480
I had a patient once who bled so extremely
that we feared she would pass out.

133
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,040
Because she had sex for the first time?

134
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:49,260
No, she cut herself. She bled so much
 that we had to give her a blood transfusion.

135
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,260
But she just wants to have the pill.

136
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,940
Yeah. When will the intercourse take place?

137
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,640
On Friday.
-On Friday?!

138
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,900
That's when William's available.
I thought that we could drink in Eva's basement.

139
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,020
We should drink? You're the
one who will be having sex with him.

140
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,820
I can't drink by myself.
You have to support me.

141
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,700
Why do you have to drink at all?

142
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,780
It can't be at my place.
Mom's home and Jonas is coming.

143
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,800
Please-
-Have you seen one like this before?

144
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,720
Do any of you perhaps want
to see how to put on a condom?

145
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,820
It's difficult to open.

146
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,180
It tends to be..

147
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,560
There we go.

148
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,840
Be honest, how painful is it?

149
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,720
I don't remember anything from my first time.

150
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,780
Just drink, you won't feel anything.

151
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,320
Do you want to be
so drunk that you don't remember anything?

152
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,980
Were you drunk your first time?
-No.

153
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,080
Pinch my arm.
How much does it hurt?

154
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,900
Seriously?
-It doesn't resemble pinching.

155
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,320
Just relax,
so it doesn't hurt.

156
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,020
What do you know?
You haven't even had sex.

157
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,620
Okay, seriously.
William has to call soon.

158
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,300
What did he write last?

159
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,160
Pick you up around 7. 
We'll find something.

160
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Can't you just call him?

161
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,880
I can't seem too desperate for his dick.

162
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,760
But what if he doesn't send a message?

163
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,700
Then I would be a little bit relieved.
-Vilde, you don't have to have sex with him if you don't want to.

164
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,840
I want to! But I just don't want it to hurt.

165
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,700
No, but that's why 
you have to relax.

166
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,500
What turns you on about him?

167
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,720
Turns me on?

168
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,860
What gets you horny?
-Horny..

169
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,060
Nothing makes me horny.
-You're never horny?

170
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,800
Are you?
-Yes!

171
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,620
Why don't you have sex then?

172
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,060
I know what can make you horny.

173
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,420
I won't be
involved in lesbian stuff.

174
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,540
Vilde, it's not lesbian stuff.
Just lie on your back and close your eyes.

175
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,420
Imagine you and William
 standing in the bedroom. Are you imagining it?

176
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,260
Yes.
-What's happening?

177
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,600
What's happening?
-Yeah, describe it.

178
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,120
We're standing in the bedroom.

179
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,420
I'm wearing a white dress.
-Yeah, good. Continue.

180
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,480
Okay!

181
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,280
The dress is almost similar to 
a Stella McCartney dress with lace at the bottom.

182
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,600
But it doesn't have lace at the bottom.

183
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,200
I have my hair down.
No! I'm wearing it up.

184
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,480
But my up-do lets loose
so my hair falls down.

185
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,820
I'm wearing light pink lipstick.

186
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,380
Not the lightest from Mac,
but the one that's kind of medium.

187
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
This actually works!

188
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,800
Seriously?

189
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,780
I think so!

190
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,980
You get horny when
talking about clothes and make-up?

191
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,360
Yes!

192
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,800
People get horny from different things.

193
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,080
I was watching a documentary
about the countryside and got horny from donkeys.

194
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,780
Eva?

195
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,540
I'm coming!

196
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,400
Okay, you guys have to leave now.

197
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,920
We can't go. 
He hasn't sent a message yet.

198
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,560
Go to your house, then.
-I can't go home, I've been drinking.

199
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,120
Can't we just
sit here? We can be quiet.

200
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,040
Eva?

201
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,120
Yeah, I'm coming!

202
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay, okay!
But you have to be really quiet.

203
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,660
Leave through the window, okay?

204
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,220
Hi!
Hi. Shouldn't your boyfriend be coming now?

205
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,300
Eh, yes! But he sent
a message that he's a bit delayed.

206
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,180
Okay.

207
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,340
<i>[Where the hell are you?]</i>

208
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,180
Do you need help?
<i>[Where the hell are you?]</i>

209
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,980
Do you need help?

210
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,540
No, it's going well.

211
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,420
What was that?

212
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,540
I forgot to turn off a movie.
I'll fix it.

213
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,200
What are you doing here?

214
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,200
Is Vilde here?
-No! Eh, yes. But you can't come here.

215
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,600
Hi! Nice to meet you.
-Hi. William.

216
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,500
No, no, no. This isn't
my boyfiriend. This is Vilde's boyfriend.

217
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,580
Oh, really?
Who's Vilde?

218
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,480
A friend. William thought Vilde
was here, but she isn't. So he's leaving now.

219
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,200
Chris, Noora, Vilde!
What are you doing here?

220
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,200
Remember when I borrowed your jacket?

221
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,760
Well we thought we'd bring it.

222
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:41,040
But you weren't in your basement, so we
left it in a bag outside.. your window.

223
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,400
Yeah, thanks. 
But now you surely have to go again.

224
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,320
Yeah, yeah. We have so
many jackets to deliver. So we'll just..

225
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,420
See you!
Come.

226
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,780
Bye!

227
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,220
What's going on here, Eva?

228
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,740
Nothing's going on.
-Were those girls drunk?

229
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,740
No.

230
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,280
Where are you?
-I can't come anymore.

231
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,860
Why not?

232
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,680
Because I forgot I'd help my mom with something.
-Can't you help her later?

233
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,800
No it's really important.
I have to do it now.

234
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,240
Who was that?
-That was my sister.

235
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,240
Jonas!
-I'm sorry, but I have to go now.
