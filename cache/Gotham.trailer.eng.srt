1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,900
I love this city.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,100
And I see it going to hell.

3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,669
Sometimes,
I think this place is cursed.

4
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:14,580
I won't let it fall apart
without a fight.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,470
THIS FALL

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,885
Citizens of Gotham,

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,050
we will not,

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,306
we cannot let these killers

9
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:24,730
and these robbers and these rapers
and these thugs win.

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,183
Not on my watch.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,060
WITNESS
THE ORIGINS

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,789
There's a war coming.

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,762
A terrible war.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,590
OF THE
INFAMOUS CITY

15
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,900
There will be chaos, rivers of blood
in the streets, I know it.

16
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,230
ONE
DETECTIVE

17
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:43,400
That's my new partner, Jim Gordon.

18
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:45,752
You have a little danger
in your eye.

19
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:47,950
I wonder
what you plan to do with that.

20
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,750
ONE MISSION

21
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:51,523
You've killed people before?

22
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:55,450
- That was war!
- This is war! We're at war!

23
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,100
ONE CRIME

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,632
What's your name?

25
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,393
My name is Bruce Wayne.

26
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,090
THAT WILL CHANGE
EVERYTHING

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,495
I promise you,

28
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:13,664
I will find the man who did this.

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,665
IN ONE CITY

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,080
I'm learning to conquer fear.

31
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,110
Fear doesn't need conquering.
Fear tells you where the edge is.

32
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:24,150
If somebody has to take over,
it might as well be me.

33
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,850
Gotham is on a knife edge.

34
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,750
THE SAGA BEGINS

35
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,055
This is not a city for nice guys.

36
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:30,681
Stop or I'll shoot!

37
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:38,800
However dark and scary
the world might be right now,

38
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,300
there will be light.

39
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,700
There will be light for us.

40
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,900
BEFORE
PENGUIN

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,900
BEFORE
CATWOMAN

42
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,000
BEFORE
RIDDLER

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,980
BEFORE
POISON IVY

44
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,750
BEFORE
BATMAN

45
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:53,815
THERE

46
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:54,450
WAS

47
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,600
GOTHAM

48
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,500
THIS FALL
FOX
