1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,686
Previously on Arrow:

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,842
I'm sorry. I should go.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,844
The night of the siege,
you were at the train station.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,328
I got attacked by one
of those crazy, masked things.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,767
But he got shot by a cop, I think.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,962
- It was Malcolm Merlyn.
- He's dead.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,766
- Thank you, Dad.
- I promised you, Thea.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,809
I will never let anyone hurt you.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,246
- Sara Lance is dead.
- Yes.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,528
- At Merlyn's hand?
- It appears.

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,411
Al Sa-Her will face the League's justice.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,800
What of Queen?

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,889
He has sworn to protect Merlyn.

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,206
If that is true,
then Oliver Queen courts war with us.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,881
Hey. Very nice.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,608
Merry Christmas, captain.

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,844
Merry Christmas.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,368
- Well, I feel bad. I didn't get you anything.
- You keep the city safe.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,363
So do you.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,886
You know, these days, you're the
closest thing to a partner I got.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,251
Happy Holidays.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,244
Here you go, buddy.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,447
Merlyn.

24
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,810
Nyssa.

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,690
What is this? We agreed...

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,609
To nothing.

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,883
My father decided to give you the time to bring
Sara's killer to justice, and you have failed.

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,890
We're doing everything that we can.

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,168
You've been distracted protecting the city.

30
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,324
And you've exhausted my father's patience.

31
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,883
In civilizations past,
when someone in the village was murdered...

32
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,647
...the League would kill 50 people
a day until the criminal was rooted out.

33
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,128
Find and deliver the one
who killed Ta-er al-Sahfer.

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,482
You have 48 hours
or the citizens of Starling...

35
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,160
...will see what the League of Assassins
is capable of.

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,688
You're gonna slaughter innocent people?

37
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,844
The cleansing of Starling City
will fall to Sarab.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,924
- Maseo.
- Maseo is no longer.

39
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,805
As she said, I am Sarab.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,522
Deliver Sara's killer
or blood will flow in your streets.

41
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,927
This isn't what Sara would want.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,447
Sara is dead.

43
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,200
It's time you remember that.

44
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,762
Dad's okay.

45
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,367
Working too much.

46
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,046
I'm sorry. I never really know
what to say when I come here. I just...

47
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,724
I wanted to wish you Merry Christmas.

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,204
And tell you how much I miss you.

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,084
Laurel?

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,562
Thea. What are you doing here?

51
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,883
I was just leaving flowers for my mom.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,050
Who were you talking to?

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,881
Nobody. I just come here sometimes.

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,570
Even though Sara's still alive?

55
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,082
Laurel, what's wrong?
Everything's fine. Sara's okay.

56
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,525
No, Thea.

57
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,411
Sara's dead.

58
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,124
What? What are you talking about?

59
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,323
While you were gone...

60
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,445
...she was murdered.

61
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,723
- By who?
- I don't know. I buried her here.

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,891
Why didn't you tell anybody?
Like, at least your father? The police?

63
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,444
- No. No. Thea, no one can ever know.
- Why?

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,329
Just...

65
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,448
Sara, she was, uh...

66
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,606
She was complicated.

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,688
And if my father found
out, it would kill him.

68
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,047
You have to promise me
that you won't tell Oliver.

69
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,686
Of course. I promise.

70
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,085
I'm so sorry.

71
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,526
Hey, did you know there's
a cafeteria in the building?

72
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,331
There's a cold-pressed juice bar,
organic salad station.

73
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,168
I know. I eat there every day
along with 800 of your other employees.

74
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,802
- Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
- Wait, Felicity.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,490
Are we okay?

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,490
If by "we" you mean you and me
as individual entities...

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,325
...then yes, we are fantastic.

78
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,527
- This is about the kiss.
- This is not about the kiss.

79
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,690
You sure? Because it really feels
like it's about the kiss.

80
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,168
Unless it's about how I
left after the kiss.

81
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,800
- I can explain.
- No. I can explain.

82
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,167
It was a moment, and you regret it.
It's over.

83
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,086
Now, can we pretend like it never happened
and go back to being professionals?

84
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,403
I have to go. Work.

85
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,689
But you're at work.

86
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,891
- What happened?
- Nyssa paid me a visit.

87
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,164
The League wants Sara's killer
handed over in the next 48 hours.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,682
Why do I sense there's an
"or else" at the end of that sentence?

89
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,890
- Or else they'll start killing civilians.
- My God. Two days.

90
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,884
Caitlin has DNA we pulled off
of the arrows that killed Sara.

91
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,249
But the STR markers are degraded,
so it's taking a little bit longer.

92
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,164
Felicity.

93
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,722
It can't take any longer.

94
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,842
If we can't find Sara's killer,
we're gonna need a contingency plan.

95
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,929
I know.

96
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,929
I don't have one.

97
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,245
Here.

98
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,922
I'm not hungry.

99
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,565
The first time I interrogated someone,
I lost my appetite for two days.

100
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,882
You need your strength.

101
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,607
I didn't interrogate anyone.

102
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,445
I tortured him.

103
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,731
The question is, did you learn anything
about Chien Na Wei's plans?

104
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,608
There's a biotech company in Hong Kong.
They were working on a super antibiotic.

105
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,451
They got a super virus instead.

106
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,887
They're calling it Omega.

107
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,404
- Which is the Chinese translation for...
- Omega.

108
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,245
They said one vial could wipe out
an entire city.

109
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,962
So it's a bioweapon Chien Na Wei's after.

110
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,448
Did he tell you where it is now?

111
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,281
Yeah. He didn't want to, but I made him.

112
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,250
You did what was necessary.

113
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,521
One man's agony is not worth
the lives of an entire city.

114
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,803
They all right? Okay.
Yes, it is coming through now.

115
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,601
No, I'm fine. Things are just tense here.

116
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,122
Thank you, Caitlin.
Happy Holidays to you too.

117
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,806
Are those the DNA results?

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,004
It's the genome S.T.A.R. Labs
was able to get off of the arrow.

119
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,164
- I need to run it against suspects.
- What database are you using?

120
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,448
S.C.P.D. maintains
a genetic markers database.

121
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,126
Anyone who's committed a felony
in the past three years.

122
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,684
- No, that... That can't be right.
- Who is it?

123
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,162
- It must be a mistake.
- Felicity, who killed Sara?

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,570
You did.

125
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,009
This must be a mistake.

126
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,885
I took perspiration off the arrows
that killed Sara.

127
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,244
Two years ago when the police arrested Oliver
because they thought he was the vigilante...

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,724
...they took a DNA sample. That sample
is a match for 12 out of the 13 STRs.

129
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,406
The odds of that, they're impossible.

130
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,922
- So somehow my DNA is on the arrows.
- Someone's setting you up, Oliver.

131
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,721
Somebody with a vested interest in pitting
me against the League of Assassins.

132
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,086
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

133
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,084
Merlyn was in Corto Maltese
with Thea when this was going down.

134
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,769
Unless he wasn't. Merlyn hid successfully for
two years from the police and the League.

135
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,605
- He's good at covering his tracks.
- So we uncover them.

136
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,569
But it might take some time.

137
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,809
In less than 48 hours,
the League is gonna murder 5O people.

138
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,530
We don't have time.

139
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,249
Move to the lab.
I'll deal with the rest of security.

140
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,129
Stay on comms.

141
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,486
- Maseo, you set?
- Just about.

142
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,967
- I found Omega.
- Be careful with it.

143
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,003
- We might have a problem.
- What's wrong?

144
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,008
Somebody already took it.
How did she get in here before us?

145
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,687
She didn't need to get in, Oliver.

146
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,966
She already had someone inside.

147
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,004
Yeah, I know. But it's a holiday.

148
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,845
So I guess I'm feeling charitable.
Is that okay?

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,526
Jake, I gotta call you right back.

150
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,764
- Hey.
- Hi.

151
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,929
Look who it is.

152
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,401
- How was your ride down?
- Oh, uneventful. Chance to grade some papers.

153
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,401
Dad, maybe you can tell me why half your
officers are allergic to search warrants.

154
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,049
- Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

155
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,443
- I didn't know that you were coming to town.
- I guess that's my fault.

156
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,648
I thought you could do
a Christmas surprise.

157
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,367
Of course I wanna spend Christmas
with my family. So where's Sara?

158
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,727
She's not returning my phone calls.

159
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,843
Yeah, that's because she's traveling.

160
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,047
Backpacking through the Andes.

161
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,842
- I think.
- Yeah.

162
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,369
I found something. A.R.G.U.S. monitors air
traffic in and out of countries of interest.

163
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,491
- Corto Maltese is on that list.
- This is a list of every commercial airliner...

164
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,089
...private jet, sea plane, hot air balloon that
took off from Corto Maltese this past year.

165
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,245
Look at this flight path. Private
charter from Corto Maltese to Caracas.

166
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,569
Then to Cartagena only to fly back
to Caracas and then to Tijuana.

167
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,088
Whoever was on that plane was working hard
to hide where he was going.

168
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,562
The route ends at a private landing strip
just outside Starling City.

169
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,841
When did it land?

170
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,250
The night before Sara was murdered.

171
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,606
- Please. All I do is fly the plane.
- Quiet.

172
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,527
The man in this photo, did you fly him
from Corto Maltese to Starling City?

173
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,091
No.

174
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,005
This time look at the photo.

175
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,890
- He'll kill me.
- He's not here.

176
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,488
- We are.
- All right. Okay. Yes, I flew him here.

177
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,406
I've got security footage. You wanna see?

178
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,607
Hanukkah present?

179
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,604
Security footage from the airfield
where Merlyn landed.

180
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,684
Check for October 7th.

181
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,281
Right there. Stop.

182
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,566
You said Merlyn was keeping his distance
from Thea. That he hadn't had any contact.

183
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,245
He lied.

184
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,245
And so did she.

185
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,244
There's something we should consider.
Maybe it wasn't your DNA.

186
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,004
- Maybe it was Thea's.
- What?

187
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,289
You two are siblings.
There would be overlap. Maybe enough to...

188
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,682
Diggle, are you listening to yourself?

189
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,927
You're suggesting that Thea killed Sara.
Even if she would... Even if she could...

190
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,081
...why?

191
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,924
Malcolm Merlyn is her father.

192
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,371
- I hate to even say this.
- Then don't.

193
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,090
Oliver.

194
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,961
I know how much you love your sister,
but we have to look at the facts.

195
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,330
The autopsy I did on Sara,
I thought Roy might have stabbed her.

196
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,007
Because the trajectory wasn't consistent
with an archer of average height.

197
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,330
- You weren't considering a killer Thea's size.
- Enough. Both of you.

198
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,451
My sister did not kill Sara.
The DNA on the arrows is mine...

199
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,291
...because Malcolm Merlyn put it there.

200
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,487
- Hi.
- Hey, we need to talk, so I came here.

201
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,490
- Here where?
- Where you are.

202
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,883
I might have pinged your phone again.

203
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,091
I thought I was pretty clear
when I said I didn't wanna talk about this.

204
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,642
You were. But you were also pretty wrong...

205
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,523
...when you said I regretted kissing you.

206
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,123
I can't imagine there's a man on the planet
who would ever regret kissing you.

207
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,521
- I can think of one.
- But I am sorry about the way I reacted.

208
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,689
- When I kissed you, I felt guilty.
- Oh, my God. You're cheating on someone.

209
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,251
No.

210
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,682
Her name is Anna.

211
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,321
And we were engaged.

212
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,768
Last spring, the night those men
took over the city, we ran into a few.

213
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,684
We tried to escape, but we couldn't.

214
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,684
I tried to fight them, but I couldn't.
I wasn't strong enough.

215
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,170
They broke my leg and went after her,
but I couldn't save her.

216
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,362
And I watched them...

217
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,202
...as they broke her neck.

218
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,291
Ray, I am so sorry.

219
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,046
Anna was supposed to be
the last woman I ever kissed.

220
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,884
And she was.
Until suddenly, I was kissing you.

221
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,404
Hey. What are you doing home?

222
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,801
I wanted the Christmas
tree to be a surprise.

223
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,684
It's a surprise.

224
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,241
Thought since it's just
the two of us now...

225
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,404
...the smaller the family, bigger the tree.

226
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,806
What about Malcolm?

227
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,928
Thea, I know you saw him in Corto Maltese.

228
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,209
Ollie, we've lost everyone.

229
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,121
Malcolm's the only family
I have left besides you.

230
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,370
Thea, I deserve to know
what you were doing with Malcolm Merlyn.

231
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,364
I've just been getting to know him.

232
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,285
Did you fly back to Starling City with him?

233
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,771
No.

234
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,367
Ollie, if I was back in Starling,
don't you think I would have called you?

235
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,126
I was in Corto Maltese since May.

236
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,447
Now, will you please just come upstairs
and help me find some more Christmas stuff?

237
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,844
- What's he saying?
- He's trying to bribe us.

238
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,363
We want the vial of Omega you stole.

239
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,484
I don't know
what you're talking about. I didn't steal.

240
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,685
Don't waste your energy on lies.
We will get the truth from you.

241
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,801
One way or the other.

242
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,203
My friend can be very persuasive.

243
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,484
So how are you?

244
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm great. Work's great.
I've just been really busy.

245
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,685
- Something's happened.
- What? No. No. Nothing's happened.

246
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,684
It's Sara, isn't it?

247
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,730
When I mentioned her earlier,
you seemed so broken.

248
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,003
Mom, Sara's fine.

249
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,440
She's just being Sara.

250
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,847
There are few things as powerful
as a mother's intuition.

251
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,801
You're hiding something. I know it.

252
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,090
Just like I was the only one who knew
that Sara didn't die on that boat.

253
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,529
I had this feeling that
I would see her again.

254
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,200
And right now...

255
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,845
...that feeling is gone.

256
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,362
She's dead, isn't she?

257
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,449
Mom, listen to me.

258
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,883
Sara, she was involved
with some very, very dangerous people.

259
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,090
This has to remain a secret. At least until
we figure out exactly what happened.

260
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,005
I don't understand.
Doesn't your father know?

261
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,447
If he knew about Sara...

262
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,448
...he couldn't take it.

263
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,009
And I can't lose anyone else.

264
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,050
Father.

265
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,202
- It's nearly time.
- Mr. Queen has not yet presented the guilty?

266
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,689
Perhaps he believes our threats are empty.

267
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,850
We must correct that belief.

268
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,851
Return to Starling City. Be merciless.

269
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,162
Teach Oliver Queen we only ask but once.

270
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,324
Where you been?

271
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,084
I went to see Thea.

272
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,961
She lied to me again,
but she didn't kill Sara.

273
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,162
- Oliver.
- I looked her in the eyes, Felicity.

274
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,846
These are eyes
that I have known my entire life.

275
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,368
She could lie to me about Merlyn
and spending time with him.

276
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,522
But she could never do this.

277
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,411
Oliver, you are one
of the smartest men I've known.

278
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,206
But you have a blind spot
when it comes to your family.

279
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,203
- Not this time.
- Your mother and father.

280
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,362
- That's enough.
- Now Thea. She lied to you.

281
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,488
Both of you, stop.

282
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,291
Oliver, I can't imagine how difficult
this must be for you, but John is right.

283
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,371
- Thea lied.
- She lied about Merlyn, but Sara...

284
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,886
I don't wanna believe
she could do something like this.

285
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,887
Which is why you shouldn't
be the one asking the questions.

286
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,926
Thea Queen, where is Malcolm Merlyn?

287
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,924
I don't know. Please. Please don't hurt me.

288
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,287
Stay away from me and my father.

289
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,647
It's the strangest thing.

290
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,842
Thea just called
and said she was attacked by the Arrow.

291
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,602
You wouldn't happen to know anything
about that, now, would you, Oliver?

292
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,887
This was you.

293
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,443
You know, I figured when I spared the man
who murdered my mother...

294
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,609
...I would never kill again.

295
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,721
I was wrong.

296
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,889
- You might wanna reconsider.
- Why?

297
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,161
For Thea.

298
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,490
Check your phone. I can wait.

299
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,162
I don't think you'd want the League
to see that.

300
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,005
And if you kill me, they will.

301
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,689
- This isn't her.
- You've heard of a plant called Votura?

302
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,882
It grows in South America.
In fact, it thrives in Corto Maltese.

303
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,442
Making its subject extremely susceptible
to suggestion...

304
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,445
...while retaining no memory
of their actions.

305
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,730
I will tell Ra's this was you.
That Thea was under your control.

306
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,526
And he will still kill her.
She fired the arrows.

307
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,570
- You've given her a death sentence.
- No.

308
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,649
- What I've done is given you incentive.
- To do what?

309
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,208
To tell Ra's that you killed Sara Lance.

310
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,689
By rite, you will be given a trial
by combat with Ra's.

311
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,721
His death will erase any blood debt
from his reign...

312
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,043
...including Thea's.
And yours.

313
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,087
I have to be honest.

314
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,961
I was a mite concerned that the killing
would have been a deal breaker for you.

315
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,924
But I'm gratified to see that Thea
is still sufficient motivation.

316
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,487
Don't take too long making up your mind.
Ra's isn't known for his patience.

317
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,088
Thea was always so kind.
The kindest person I've ever known.

318
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,603
My sister wasn't born a killer.

319
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,560
Malcolm Merlyn made her one,
and I let it happen.

320
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,410
No, you didn't.

321
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,811
When it comes to family,
you always place blame on yourself.

322
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,770
- This is not your fault.
- She's right, Oliver.

323
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,764
Throw Malcolm in front of Ra's.
Let the League sort this out.

324
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,490
Merlyn has a video.

325
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,923
- He made contingencies.
- Oliver, if you fight Ra's al Ghul, he'll kill you.

326
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,844
No, he won't.

327
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,969
During the undertaking,
Merlyn told me that I couldn't win...

328
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,005
...because I didn't know
what I was fighting for.

329
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,169
Now I do.

330
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,967
I'm fighting for Thea.

331
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,888
He should've confessed by now.

332
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,250
- We have video of him taking the vial.
- He says he doesn't remember.

333
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,649
He's lying. You don't do something
like that and not remember it.

334
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,122
There is a way.
I didn't think it a possibility until now.

335
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,851
There's a drug. It's called Votura.

336
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,886
I've heard it makes people
extremely susceptible to suggestion.

337
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,282
Like mind control?

338
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,849
Really? That's a thing?

339
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,761
Those that get dosed have no memory
of what they do while under the influence.

340
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,486
Oh, great. All this was for nothing.

341
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,804
Chien Na Wei has the vial
and we have no way of finding her.

342
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,407
We've taken her inside man.

343
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,564
Finding her may not be
the problem at hand.

344
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,888
The problem could be her finding us.

345
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,202
Good evening, Mrs. Yamashiro.
ls your husband home?

346
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,370
Don't you dare talk to my son.

347
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,888
Quaint house for a spy.

348
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,331
Except for these.
They belong to you, don't they?

349
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,124
Tatsu, isn't it?

350
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,841
Beautiful blade.

351
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,361
Where is he?

352
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,683
You really think my father,
the Demon's Head...

353
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,208
...would travel all the way from Nanda
Parbat simply because you wish it?

354
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,767
Yes.

355
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,649
This way.

356
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,969
Kneel before the Demon's Head.

357
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,487
You're just a boy.

358
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,404
Mr. Queen.

359
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,291
You failed to protect the city you love.
Now you'll watch it bleed.

360
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,768
Nobody in my city will die tonight.

361
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:30,482
Well, there was only one way
to prevent that.

362
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,770
You were to produce for me
the one who killed Ta-er al-Sahfer.

363
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,321
And yet you've come alone.

364
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,525
Because it was me.

365
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,002
- I killed Sara.
- Why would you kill a woman...

366
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,323
...you once professed to love?
Because she begged me to.

367
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,164
You lie.

368
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,410
It wasn't the first time Sara chose death
over a life in the League.

369
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,201
And meeting you now, I can see why.

370
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,530
I should have Sarab cleave your head
from your shoulders.

371
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,970
Not for killing my daughter's beloved...

372
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,969
...but for thinking me a fool.

373
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,529
By League law, I have a right to
challenge you to a trial by combat.

374
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,089
It's been 67 years
since someone challenged me.

375
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,051
You covet death that much?

376
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,571
Do you accept?

377
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,889
Oh, yes.

378
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,644
I see the years have done little
to dull your stubbornness.

379
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,922
- Maseo.
- My name is Sarab.

380
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,841
- You told me a man cannot live by two names.
- And I don't.

381
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,242
Maseo is dead.

382
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,604
I am all that's left. Sarab. A phantom.

383
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,083
After...

384
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,685
...it happened, you went to Nanda Parbat.

385
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,571
I arrived the same year as Ta-er al-Sahfer.
She was a great warrior.

386
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,920
You did not kill her.

387
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,121
When you face the Demon,
it will be my duty to bear witness.

388
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,322
I have no desire to watch you die.

389
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,966
Under our code,
you have 12 hours to settle your affairs.

390
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,845
The 13th hour, be at this place.

391
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,167
This is consecrated ground for the League.

392
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,882
A place for the settlement of blood debts
if one survives the climb.

393
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,887
If you do.

394
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,723
See you on the mountain.

395
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,123
Do you remember how when the two of you
were little you played dress up?

396
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,248
One day I overheard you and Sara.

397
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,482
You were pretending
to be grown up versions of yourselves.

398
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,171
That day, you and your sister,
you had your own families.

399
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,210
Careers.

400
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,682
I was a cop, just like Dad. And Sara...

401
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,002
Was a doctor.

402
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,051
She wanted to heal people.

403
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,726
She deserves more than this.

404
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,411
Mom, can I tell you something?

405
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,131
Whoever did this to Sara, I'm gonna
find them, no matter what it takes.

406
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,010
And I am gonna make them pay.

407
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,244
Then you make them pay.

408
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,169
And you make them suffer.

409
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,283
Looks good.

410
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,450
- Thank you.
- Good night.

411
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,126
- What happened to the window?
- Oh. You should have seen it.

412
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,647
This bird went completely Hitchcock
on the thing.

413
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,883
I vacuumed up most of the glass,
but I'd still watch your step.

414
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,769
I'll be extra careful.

415
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,403
Are you okay?

416
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,488
Last time you had that look on your face,
you told me Dad committed suicide.

417
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,604
You haven't called him dad
since you found out about Malcolm.

418
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,410
What's going on with you, Ollie?

419
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,001
You think you know
who Malcolm Merlyn is...

420
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,929
...but there are things that I've
discovered years ago, recently...

421
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,571
...that he doesn't love you, Thea.

422
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,283
Because he's not capable of it.

423
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,642
Ollie, please.

424
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,604
Don't.

425
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,609
Don't make me choose
between my father and my brother.

426
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,923
I would never make you choose.

427
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,922
You are my family.

428
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,285
There's nothing that I won't do
to protect you.

429
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,761
What does that mean?

430
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,971
It means I love you, no matter what.

431
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,886
Tatsu!

432
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,647
- Akio.
- What happened here?

433
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,521
Oh, God, no. No. No. No.

434
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,366
- Akio, no.
- Daddy.

435
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,281
Akio. Akio. Where is your mother?

436
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,051
The white-haired woman, she took her.

437
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,089
Guess who just
designed a microprocessor...

438
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,369
...with a SPECint score just north of 9000?
Ray.

439
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,167
What are you doing with Queen Consolidated?
Why did you buy it?

440
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,924
Because it was for sale.

441
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,927
My life is a little more complicated
than I led on.

442
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,924
Suffice it to say, I have gotten
very good at keeping secrets.

443
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,004
Particularly, the kind of secret
someone like you keeps.

444
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,164
Someone in pain.

445
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,244
- It wasn't easy to tell you about Anna.
- You told me about Anna.

446
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,324
But you didn't tell me the truth
about what it is you're doing.

447
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,205
- So tell me or I walk.
- I can't tell you.

448
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,162
I have to show you.

449
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,531
The dawn of the computer age.

450
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,889
Developers thought the only way
a machine could process information...

451
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,368
...as fast as a human brain
was to build a mainframe the size of Texas.

452
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,241
But one developer realized the only way
to reduce heat and power consumption...

453
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,051
...was to bring the components
closer together.

454
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,123
Which meant making them smaller.

455
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,527
But why stop at computers?

456
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,245
What if I could take other things?

457
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,928
Like, say, all of the military grade technology
in Applied Sciences and make it smaller too.

458
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,411
So small that it could fit
in the palm of my hand.

459
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,724
- I could help a lot of people that way.
- I don't understand.

460
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,564
This will help.

461
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,845
Whoa.

462
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,728
- What is it?
- O.M.A.C.

463
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,723
Was the Queen Consolidated designation.

464
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,646
But I'm kind of partial to A-T-O-M.

465
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,729
Advanced Technology
Operating Mechanism.

466
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,006
- ATOM.
- What are you gonna use it for?

467
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,928
To protect the people of this city.
And I want you to help.

468
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,890
Why does this keep happening to me?

469
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,604
- Oliver.
- John, I have to do this.

470
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,684
I know. I'd just rather die
than let you go it alone.

471
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,244
Not this time.

472
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,201
- Take care of Thea.
- Absolutely.

473
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,123
I'm sorry. Something came up.

474
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,331
Oh.

475
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,770
Let's give them a minute.

476
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,247
- So you're going.
- Mm-hm.

477
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,441
- To Nanda Parbat?
- No, it's a neutral site. It'll be fine.

478
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,486
I'll come back. Thea will be okay.

479
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,961
I wish that sounded more convincing.

480
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,727
I wish you wouldn't go, but I know you
so I'm not gonna ask you to stay.

481
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,803
I appreciate that.

482
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,850
But there is one thing
I need to ask you to do.

483
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,204
And you're not going to want to.

484
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,330
Well, if it's you asking, I'll do it.

485
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,247
Kill him.

486
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,004
You have to kill Ra's al Ghul.

487
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,003
This is a duel...

488
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,364
...with one of the most dangerous men
that has walked the Earth.

489
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,887
Wouldn't be doing it
if I didn't think I could win.

490
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,691
I don't doubt that.
I don't doubt you can beat him.

491
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,049
I am terrified that you won't kill him.

492
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,683
Because that's not who you are anymore.

493
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,687
And I am so afraid that Ra's al Ghul
is gonna use your humanity against you.

494
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,770
Felicity, I honestly don't know
if I'm a killer anymore.

495
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,843
But I do know two things.

496
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,047
The first is that whoever I am...

497
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,888
...I'm someone that will do whatever...

498
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,081
Whatever it takes to save my sister.

499
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,085
And the second thing?

500
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,524
I love you.

501
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,688
Remove your shirts.

502
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,763
This is custom.

503
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,048
Ra's al Ghul is not known to be merciful.

504
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,928
But if there was a chance,
this would be your final moment for it.

505
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,083
Choose your weapon.

506
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,966
I was 11 years old
when I killed my first man.

507
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:10,127
And I remember the look on his face
when the light went out behind his eyes.

508
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,007
Such a sudden change.

509
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,130
Almost imperceptible...

510
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,166
...between life and death.

511
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,805
And I'd felt ashamed.

512
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,000
I'd stolen from that man
the most precious gift of all. Life.

513
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,682
But I also felt something else.

514
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,369
Pride.

515
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,844
Because I had taken up arms against someone
who sought to do ill against my family.

516
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,726
And I realized what
I had done was necessary.

517
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,650
You see.

518
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,005
I had replaced evil with death.

519
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,760
And that is what the League exists to do.

520
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,764
And I have killed several
thousand more men since then.

521
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,925
- And the world is better off for it.
- You've taken your last life.

522
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,929
No.

523
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,645
You have lived your last day.

524
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,563
We are ready.

525
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,570
I am envious of you.
You'll see her before I do.

526
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,048
Fight me, boy.

527
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,041
You're unarmed.

528
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,044
I'll take your blades from you
once you are through with them.

529
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,445
You should take pride.

530
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,602
You survived longer than most.

531
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,369
Don't be afraid, my son.

532
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,045
Death comes for us all.
We can only evade it so long.

533
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,889
Consider this an honorable exit.
