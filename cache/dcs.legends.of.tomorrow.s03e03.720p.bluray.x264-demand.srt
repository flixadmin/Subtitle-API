1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:03,872
<i>How will we be remembered?</i>

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:06,128
<i>Will it be for saving
the world twice?</i>

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,837
<i>Nope! We're the team who broke time.</i>

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:13,052
<i>That's right...
History has been torn to shreds.</i>

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,009
<i>Which means it's up to us</i>

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,011
<i>to put it back together again,
piece by piece,</i>

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,933
<i>fixing these so called anachronisms</i>

8
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,053
<i>before we get torn to shreds.</i>

9
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:26,642
<i>So please, don't call us heroes.
We're legends.</i>

10
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,401
<i>Previously on</i> Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,132
<i>I told you I was leaving to create</i>

12
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,897
an organization to replace
the Time Masters.

13
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,823
- Fifteen minutes ago!
- For you.

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,276
Forming the Time Bureau's been

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,532
the work of the last five
years of my life.

16
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,240
They're undependable,
unpredictable. Dangerous.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,669
My decision to leave
had nothing to do with you.

18
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,247
<i>I could feel myself losing control.</i>

19
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,375
The animal was in charge, not me.

20
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,709
Tel me what we're facing here.

21
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,510
That information is a need-to-know.

22
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,675
<i>Welcome back, Kuasa.</i>

23
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:11,316
<i>This is A.R.G.U.S.
Anti-meta-human curfew is in effect.</i>

24
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,985
<i>Citizens, please stay in your homes.</i>

25
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,196
HQ, this is transport
X-one-seven.

26
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,823
En route to facility.

27
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,432
<i>Copy,
X-one-seven.</i>

28
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,992
<i>Standing by to receive prisoner.</i>

29
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,850
What the hell?

30
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,272
Code 99.

31
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,447
We have a Code 99!

32
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,044
So there's this theory

33
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,047
that the phrase,
"bring home the bacon,"

34
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,549
started in a town in Old England.

35
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,296
Bacon was awarded to any man
who can truthfully say

36
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,923
he and his wife had
not argued that past year.

37
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,135
Same cannot be said
of you and Ms. Jiwe, however.

38
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,053
No, because I'm eating bacon.

39
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,743
- But since you asked...
- I didn't.

40
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,193
It is a little awkward.
I mean, I am a little resentful...

41
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:19,443
Please. If you need to discuss
this with someone, I would suggest...

42
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,027
- Amaya.
- Yeah, I know.

43
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,438
We should talk things out, but...

44
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,912
Amaya.

45
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:29,867
Acute arachnoid somnambulism...
This really is fascinating!

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,996
Oh, my God.

47
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,835
She's having a dream she's a spider.

48
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,542
We got to wake her up
before she crawls into the engine.

49
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,632
Amaya!

50
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,111
You're not supposed to wake
a sleepwalker,

51
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,529
especially when they're
stuck to the ceiling!

52
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,634
Why not? Amaya!

53
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,342
That's why.

54
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,142
Are you okay?

55
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,135
I... I was having a nightmare.

56
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,477
And in the process, summoned the
ashe of a spider. Astonishing.

57
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,183
No, Martin, it isn't.

58
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,695
What if I summoned a rhino and I
crashed through the hull of the ship?

59
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,529
Or a lion and I mauled someone?

60
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,857
Well, if the victim was Mr. Rory,
I imagine...

61
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,951
It's gonna be okay.

62
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,805
We're going to figure out what's
going on with you and your totem.

63
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,099
What do you think I've been trying
to do for the past six months?

64
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,659
In my experience, there is no problem

65
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,663
that cannot be solved by the rigorous
application of science.

66
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,581
It's a mystical totem, Martin.

67
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,913
I believe
we should start in the Med Bay.

68
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,628
Please, please, come with me.
Come with me.

69
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,509
<i>Code 99.
This is Agent Gary Green.</i>

70
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,722
<i>Seattle, Washington, 2042.</i>

71
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,725
<i>I just witnessed a female meta
of unknown origin.</i>

72
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,687
<i>- She killed everyone.
- Hey.</i>

73
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,979
What's going on?

74
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,775
We intercepted a distress call from
one of Rip's Time Bureau agents.

75
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,652
Why? Actually, forget it.

76
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,697
- I don't care.
- It's the dweeby one, Gary.

77
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,787
Still don't care.

78
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,533
Yeah. I got to go with Mick
on this one.

79
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,457
Why should we help those ass clowns?
I mean, that's not our job.

80
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,159
Hopefully that little time dweeb
learns his lesson.

81
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,287
Agreed. But the last time I checked,

82
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,629
we help people who are in trouble.

83
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:01,926
I don't.

84
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,640
Something feels off
about this place.

85
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,434
Yeah. Like, where is everybody?

86
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,850
Martial law. It's a police state.

87
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,394
- How do you know?
- I can smell pigs.

88
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:25,065
He's right. All the cars on the
street are military.

89
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,074
<i>More pigs. Get down! Get down!</i>

90
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,501
It's A.R.G.U.S. A covert paramilitary
organization.

91
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,129
Yeah, but, it seems
they've forgotten how to be covert.

92
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,249
The signal we intercepted
came from over there.

93
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,845
Right. Should be here somewhere.

94
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,715
Gary? Gary!

95
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,429
- Gary!
- Oh, no, she's going to kill me.

96
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,852
- The chick from your distress call?
- Agent Sharpe.

97
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,101
She hates you guys.

98
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,106
Well, feeling's mutual.

99
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,258
Look, you said there was a female
meta killing everyone.

100
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,318
What's going on?

101
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,365
Well, this is classified
Time Bureau business.

102
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,780
Open your mouth and say some words.

103
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,225
<i>I guess you're gonna have
to decide who you're more afraid of,</i>

104
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,457
Agent Sharpe or Mick here?

105
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,294
<i>Uh...</i>

106
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,503
The Bureau got a ping
on some unregulated time travel.

107
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,776
But when I got here, the person
I was supposed to arrest...

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,338
Was a meta-human
who had no problem murdering people?

109
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,717
Her powers let her control water.

110
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,052
A human squirt-gun? Big deal.

111
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,967
No, you guys really have no idea
how dangerous this woman is.

112
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,684
<i>Dweeb's right.
That chick's dangerous.</i>

113
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,981
She just blew through those pigs
like it was nothing.

114
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,027
I actually fought someone with water
powers like this a few years ago.

115
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,194
It was not very pleasant.

116
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,943
But why would
a time-traveling meta-human

117
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,525
come to 2042 to kill a bunch of
A.R.G.U.S. agents?

118
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,744
She didn't.

119
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,612
She came here to kill their prisoner.

120
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,392
<i>Well, looks like she struck out.</i>

121
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,580
Something tells me our assassin
doesn't give up so easily.

122
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,744
- You got a plan, Captain?
- Why?

123
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,330
We saved Four-Eyes,
mission accomplished.

124
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,668
And "Four-Eyes'" mission was to
prevent the anachronism.

125
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,261
You mean, stop the water witch

126
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,681
before she kills whoever
was in the back of that truck.

127
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,766
Gideon, scan A.R.G.U.S.'s logs,

128
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,518
see if you can ID the prisoner.

129
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,248
<i>I can do
better than that, Captain.</i>

130
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,810
<i>I can project the prisoner's
most likely destination.</i>

131
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,231
Even better.

132
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,775
UNITE - A.R.G.U.S. MAINTENANCE
LAW IS ORDER - ENLIST

133
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,328
<i>Zari Tomaz?</i>

134
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,041
Come with us if you want to live.

135
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,010
Yeah. Used that one once.

136
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,803
Come on. Let's get out of here.

137
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,284
Yeah. I don't know who you are
or what you're doing,

138
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,049
but you're gonna lead
A.R.G.U.S. right here.

139
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,634
Don't worry. We can protect you.

140
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,056
Who's going to protect you?

141
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,269
<i>This is A.R.G.U.S.</i>

142
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,813
<i>Sara Lance, Nathaniel Heywood,
Raymond Palmer, and Mick Rory...</i>

143
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,656
<i>You are listed in the Meta-human
Registry as missing.</i>

144
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,860
<i>You are hereby under arrest for
violating the Anti Meta-human Act.</i>

145
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,115
Anti-Meta-human?

146
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,071
Yeah, meta-humans have been illegal
since 2021.

147
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,872
- Didn't you guys get the memo?
- No.

148
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,811
ARREST MODE
ANTI-METAHUMAN ACT VIOLATION

149
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,710
Well, nice to meet you. I'm out.

150
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,405
Wait, your life is still in danger.

151
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,548
<i>- Remain where you are.</i>
- Ditto. Bye.

152
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,626
<i>Detainment units have been notified.</i>

153
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,632
Hate to destroy futuristic
technology, but...

154
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:36,932
Stand down!

155
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,264
Don't move.

156
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,933
You are surrounded.

157
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,420
Come to the right. Move.

158
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,813
Under the Meta-human Act
of 2021, you are under arrest.

159
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:50,062
On the ground. Hands behind your
head. Final warning.

160
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,614
Do as they say.

161
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,399
- You gotta be kidding me.
- That's an order.

162
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,580
I don't suppose I
get to call my lawyer.

163
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,947
- What?
- I wanted to shoot someone.

164
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,620
All right,
let's get back to the <i>Waverider,</i>

165
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,117
see if we can get a line on Tomaz.

166
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,285
Why?

167
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,270
I'm pretty sure she just told us
to screw off.

168
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,481
That doesn't change the fact that
there's a rogue time traveler

169
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,542
- trying to kill her.
- I can see why.

170
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,757
Let's go.

171
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,990
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

172
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,472
Gideon can't find anything
medically wrong with you.

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,640
I told you, Martin. My problem is
mystical, it's not scientific.

174
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,478
Believe me, mysticism
is merely science

175
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,055
that hasn't been understood yet.

176
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,141
Hey. Did you figure out what's wrong
with her?

177
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,023
- I'm sitting right here, Nathaniel.
- I suggest we consider

178
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,229
a new battery of tests.

179
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,322
I don't think that's...

180
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,842
To check on an
overactive hippocampus.

181
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,075
Latent chromosomal imbalance,
not to mention temporal dysplasia.

182
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,199
I asked Jax to adjust
Gideon's diagnostic algorithms...

183
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,326
There's no "algorithm" for what's
wrong with me.

184
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,375
It's my totem.

185
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,458
It's the legacy of my ancestors.

186
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,252
Great.
So let's go talk to your ancestors.

187
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,424
We're on a time ship.

188
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,387
This totem means
I protect my village,

189
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,051
not mess with its history.

190
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,891
What's her problem?

191
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,017
Side effect of temporal dysplasia,
I suspect.

192
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,770
Hey. How you feeling?

193
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,149
Like I just understood what you
meant by the term "mansplaining."

194
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,198
I take it
from Nathaniel's premature return,

195
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,245
you didn't have
much luck with Ms. Tomaz?

196
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:06,993
That was interesting.

197
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,705
Turns out, Zari's a bit of a...
Not very nice person.

198
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,043
Apparently it's illegal
to be a meta-human in 2042.

199
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,964
You know what I don't get? A.R.G.U.S.

200
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,046
<i>- In 2016 they weren't...</i>
- Idiots.

201
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,593
Well, I was gonna say
"They weren't

202
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,887
"trying to control the city
with killer drones," but...

203
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:25,717
Any authoritarian organization
always goes bad. Always.

204
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,391
Which means it's only a matter of
time before Rip and his Time Bureau

205
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,263
turn into the Time Gestapo.

206
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,815
In case you've forgotten,
the Time Bureau only exists

207
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,525
to clean up your time mess!

208
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,154
Which now includes an at-large
time-assassin and a fugitive hacker.

209
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,907
Is that your way of thanking us
for rescuing you?

210
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,611
Gideon, do we have a location
on Zari yet?

211
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:46,995
<i>Negative, Captain.</i>

212
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,746
<i>I'm afraid Ms. Tomaz has stepped up
her efforts to remain undetected.</i>

213
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,377
Damn, I can see why.
Look at this rap sheet.

214
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,752
<i>Burglary, larceny, grand larceny,
identity theft,</i>

215
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:02,382
trespassing, digital trespassing,
meta-human smuggling, conspiracy...

216
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,508
Impressive.

217
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,965
Multiple religious infractions...

218
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,343
- What do you mean?
<i>- Zari is Muslim.</i>

219
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,516
And apparently religion is illegal
in 2042.

220
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,227
Rory, if you had this much heat
on you, where would you go?

221
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,531
My bar.

222
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,784
What have they done to my bar?

223
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,623
Too much, Ray. Too much.

224
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,955
What? I look like
I just robbed a bank.

225
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,411
Or a costume store.

226
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,759
There she is.

227
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,722
You run, scream or sic one of those
drones on us, I'll light you up.

228
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:54,982
You got that, missy?

229
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,062
- Are you guys stalking me?
- Not me.

230
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,356
But for some reason
my boss has a bee in her bonnet

231
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,190
about protecting you
from that, uh, water bitch.

232
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,615
Not you, sweetheart.

233
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,361
Yeah, I can take care of myself.

234
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,576
Is that right?

235
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,826
That why your're in this bar
looking to hire muscle?

236
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,630
Look, you can trust us, okay?
We're the good guys.

237
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,008
Uh...

238
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,503
Don't be fooled by our disguises.

239
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,054
- Good guy
- It's her.

240
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,849
Let's get out of here.

241
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,058
Come on.

242
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,908
Ah. A pool party.

243
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:51,908
<i>Cute tricks.</i>

244
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:02,716
Get her to the ship.

245
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,881
You guys have a ship?

246
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,385
Is it a big ship?

247
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,442
How about a diversion, Rory?

248
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:30,613
Who wants to fight?

249
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,202
Go!

250
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,756
Okay, this is almost amazing.

251
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,006
What do you mean "almost"?

252
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,880
Don't worry, you'll be safe here.

253
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,092
- Who's the woman that's after you?
- No idea.

254
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,018
Any idea why someone would want to
kill you?

255
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,785
Yeah. I can think of quite a few,
actually.

256
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,135
Look. If we're going to help you,

257
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,978
you need to start
being more straightforward.

258
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,769
What is she doing here?

259
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:08,155
Uh, water woman was trying
to kill her, so we're protecting her.

260
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,284
This is technology you are not
allowed to see.

261
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,532
Civilians are not
allowed to know about time travel!

262
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,662
You guys are time travelers?

263
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,003
- Nice one, Gary.
- Okay. That's on me.

264
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,749
Uh, but still, our job
is to prevent the anachronism,

265
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,960
which means capturing the assassin,
not the target!

266
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,053
I can't believe it...

267
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,932
You guys are
time-traveling superheroes?

268
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,343
<i>Yeah. We've actually
saved the world. Twice.</i>

269
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:38,812
Not that we're counting.

270
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,853
Really? You saved the world?

271
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,144
- Twice?
- Then why does it still suck?

272
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:47,437
Uh, just for the record, dealing with
that messed-up police state of yours,

273
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,195
that's on our to-do list, so...

274
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,982
But after we capture the
person trying to kill you.

275
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,026
And we need your help to do it.

276
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,325
Oh. I get it.

277
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,956
Since you have no way
of tracking this water psycho,

278
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,625
you plan to use me as bait, right?

279
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,541
- Right.
- Okay, I'll help you.

280
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,293
<i>On one condition.</i>

281
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,195
You help me break my brother
out of the A.R.G.U.S. facility

282
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,259
where they're holding him.

283
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:13,889
Prison break?

284
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,175
- I'm in.
- No, no, no.

285
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,372
They're not helping you
because they're still helping me.

286
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,514
Guys, this mission has
gone way off the rails as it is.

287
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,474
Zari's brother is not the priority.

288
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,814
If you really want my help,
then that's my price.

289
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,615
Guess we're breaking into
an A.R.G.U.S. prison.

290
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,039
Okay. So I've been doing
some research.

291
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,870
Turns out there is a root

292
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,168
from your region of Zambesi

293
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,462
that's known for its
spiritual healing properties.

294
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,039
- The Layoga root.
- That's the one.

295
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,958
It's a powerful hallucinogen.

296
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,009
Yes, and people use it to go on
vision quests.

297
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,551
Oh. So you admit that my problem
might be mystical in nature?

298
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,011
Well, if you say it's
mystical, then it's mystical.

299
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,593
Anyways, I was having a chat
with Gideon

300
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,895
and it turns out our favorite
talking super computer...

301
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:08,608
Uh, is really great at synthesizing
pretty much anything.

302
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:09,778
No.

303
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,819
Please tell me you didn't.

304
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,490
We recreated the Lyoga root
extract right here on the ship.

305
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,194
I mean, Gideon did most of the work.
I pushed some buttons.

306
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,075
Nate, this is a really bad idea.

307
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,448
A single miscalculation
could be lethal.

308
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,202
Which is why I did a quality
control test on myself first.

309
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,288
What? You already took it?

310
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,795
Yeah. I had to make sure it was safe.

311
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,467
So far, pretty good.
Um, the tongue, getting a little numb.

312
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,846
But, um, you should drink it now
so we peak at the same time and place.

313
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,022
Okay.

314
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,152
Well...

315
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,273
Ah...

316
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,067
Right. We should be sitting down
for this.

317
00:17:58,703 --> 00:17:59,989
And the room should be dark.

318
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,366
Gideon?

319
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:08,869
Okay... So what do we do now?

320
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,789
Believe it or not,
this is my first vision quest.

321
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,046
- Do we chant?
- No.

322
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,752
- No.
- We stop talking.

323
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:22,057
Close your eyes. And just breathe.

324
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,135
Breathing in.

325
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,345
Breathing out. Breathing in again.

326
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,475
Nate...

327
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,191
Sorry.

328
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,299
<i>- Rory, don't.</i>
- Just a little?

329
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,923
Maybe later. Which way?

330
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,616
My brother is in the East Wing Annex.

331
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,618
The blueprints Gideon downloaded
said the control panel

332
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,642
is this way.

333
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,309
You guys open the cell.
Let's go talk to your brother.

334
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,065
Oh, no.

335
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,438
Hey. How's it going?

336
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,028
There's no maintenance scheduled
here till tomorrow.

337
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,699
Really? We got a call that,
uh, something was broken...

338
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,239
Yeah? What?

339
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,579
Your nose.

340
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:35,085
It says here my brother's being
held in cell 4587.

341
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,795
You guys got a location
on the other security console?

342
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,094
Yup. All clear.

343
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,010
All right.
Which cell do we need to open?

344
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,761
It's room 4587.

345
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,510
Okay. I'm on it.

346
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,390
Wait a minute...

347
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,773
<i>You mean everybody
locked up in here is a meta?</i>

348
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,599
<i>Looks like A.R.G.U.S. is conducting
experiments on them.</i>

349
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,618
Guys, open the cell now.

350
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,370
I can do a lot better than that.

351
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,876
<i>What are you doing?</i>

352
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,420
CELL LOCK STATUS

353
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,620
What does it look like?

354
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,127
UNLOCKED

355
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,852
Let's go.

356
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,179
I thought you were just going to
open her brother's cell.

357
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,913
You didn't see
what we saw on the monitors.

358
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,901
A.R.G.U.S. is experimenting
on these prisoners.

359
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,239
Hey, where's Zari?

360
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,043
What the hell's going on?

361
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,256
I thought this was
just about grabbing your brother.

362
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,128
Yeah, about that... Sorry.

363
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,304
- Sorry for what?
- There is no brother.

364
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,550
There is no prison break.
It's a heist.

365
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:10,968
<i>You used us.</i>

366
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,478
We bent over
backwards to help you.

367
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,639
As lies go, this was a
pretty white one.

368
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,893
This used to be my brother's.
And now it's mine.

369
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,289
Oh, my God.

370
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,834
- Nate.
- You're not supposed to talk.

371
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,956
Nate, look.

372
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,903
Not supposed to open my eyes either.

373
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,123
Oh!

374
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,837
I think I'm starting to peak.

375
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,146
Amaya?

376
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,403
You okay?

377
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,654
Oh, boy.

378
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,530
Where's Zari?

379
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,074
Go, go!

380
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,332
Hold it.

381
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,417
Knock yourself out.

382
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,170
Showtime.

383
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,776
<i>Uh, Nate, buddy,</i>

384
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,133
<i>we need you to bring
the</i> Waverider <i>to us. Now.</i>

385
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,801
Um...

386
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,300
Stay.

387
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,506
Uh...

388
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,137
Okay. Um...

389
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,680
Yeah, I can do that.

390
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,064
<i>My face. My face.</i>

391
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:53,078
This room is huge.

392
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,373
Okay.

393
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,498
Pulling up the
anchor, raising the sails!

394
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,663
Full speed ahead!

395
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,542
That's enough, Zari.

396
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,010
You're not going anywhere without us.

397
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:11,467
Is that right?

398
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,688
- That's a cool getaway.
- Don't worry. I'll follow her.

399
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,479
Where's Pretty?

400
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,185
Nate, how are we doing with
that rescue?

401
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,521
I'm giving her all she's got,
Captain!

402
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,982
The ship can't take
much more of this!

403
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,489
<i>Actually, Dr. Heywood,
the engines are still idling.</i>

404
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,367
Then why does it feel like my face
is peeling off?

405
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,188
<i>Yo, are you high or something, man?</i>

406
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,212
You have no idea.

407
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,291
Gideon, take command of the ship.
I'll arrange a rendezvous point.

408
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:48,834
Let's get out of here.

409
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,424
Where's Stein anyway?

410
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,120
<i>I believe he's checking
on Ms. Jiwe.</i>

411
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,557
<i>She seems to be experiencing a, well,</i>

412
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,560
<i>unusual side effect,
and as for Mr. Heywood, he's...</i>

413
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,814
We've got bigger fish to fry.
Ray, do you have eyes on Zari?

414
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:08,520
<i>Yep. I'm on her tail.
Not literally on it...</i>

415
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,197
<i>I'm following her posterior
from a respectable distance.</i>

416
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,923
I can't believe
she played us like that...

417
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,575
That whole sob story
about her brother?

418
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,029
Just an excuse to get her hands
on some magical necklace.

419
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,622
When we find that chick
I am going to kill her.

420
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,080
- I like her.
- Uh, when you say "kill her,"

421
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,792
- what you really mean is...
- Kill her, and slowly.

422
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,374
No, no, no.
We have to restore the timeline.

423
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,988
Which means getting Ms. Tomaz
back to the A.R.G.U.S. black site,

424
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,296
where she belongs,
and tracking down your time-assassin.

425
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,181
Oh. And cleaning up the prison debacle.

426
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,967
Don't worry, Gary. We got this.

427
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:44,480
Geeze Louise. This disaster keeps
getting bigger and bigger, and bigger.

428
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,150
<i>What are you doing?</i>

429
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,320
Well, I hate to say it,
but Gary's right.

430
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,948
We've got to put Zari
back in the bottle.

431
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,076
Look, she's not exactly my favorite
person either right now.

432
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,577
But you didn't see
how it was back there,

433
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,708
the way A.R.G.U.S. was treating
those people.

434
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,082
She played us, Jax.

435
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,051
We're lucky that it's not us
in that prison instead.

436
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,346
She had a water witch travel
through time to hunt her down.

437
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,257
I mean, did Zari really act
any differently

438
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,831
than you would have
in that situation?

439
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,104
I'm just saying.

440
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,558
Do we really want to be the people
who put her back in a meta prison?

441
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,358
Is that who we are?

442
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,156
I can see through my hand.

443
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,445
Are you on drugs?

444
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,577
Your face! I want your face.

445
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,625
Okay, buddy, not a good idea.

446
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,174
Gideon?

447
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,569
<i>As I was trying to tell you,</i>

448
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,757
<i>Mr. Heywood is under the influence
of a hallucinogenic compound.</i>

449
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,215
To help Amaya with her totem
problem. Okay?

450
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,552
It's totally safe. People in her
village do it all the...

451
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,773
It's safe, I think.

452
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,312
<i>As for Miss Jiwe,</i>

453
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,439
<i>professor Stein
helped her to the medical bay.</i>

454
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,570
Get him to his quarters now.

455
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,569
Give him some water
and maybe his fidget spinner.

456
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,575
Ah.

457
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,779
I told you, bro. Let's go.

458
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,580
- Come on.
- Cobra.

459
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,244
All right. All right.

460
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:29,873
Amaya.

461
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,204
<i>Amaya.</i>

462
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,370
What is this place?

463
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:16,257
You are in the world between worlds.

464
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,171
Who are you?

465
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,503
<i>I am your blood.</i>

466
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,005
I am all who have
come before you.

467
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,892
I can feel the fear inside you.

468
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,433
It is a burden
that weighs heavy on your heart.

469
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,779
My totem, I can feel it
growing stronger.

470
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,566
I fear that I'm losing
control over it.

471
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,453
You can't stop the forces of nature.

472
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,248
No more than you can
stop a charging stallion.

473
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,081
You must learn to run beside it.

474
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,292
Why is it getting stronger?

475
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,670
The totem's strength grows

476
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,677
when the threats that you must face
become more powerful.

477
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,427
But you cannot face
this new threat alone.

478
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,976
You must find the girl.

479
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:16,189
She needs your protection.
Do not fail this new totem-bearer.

480
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,988
Do not resist your power.

481
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,280
Trust in it.

482
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,539
Zari...

483
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,086
Look, I don't want to fight,

484
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,793
but we got to go,
we can't stay here, it's not safe.

485
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,378
I don't understand.

486
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,675
They're not here.

487
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:48,598
Nobody's here.

488
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,689
They were supposed to meet me here.
This was supposed to be our <i>Jannah.</i>

489
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,481
"Jannah"?

490
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,319
It means "sanctuary" in Arabic.

491
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,664
My brother had powers because he
wielded this.

492
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,663
He fought against
A.R.G.U.S.'s injustices.

493
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,745
So he was hunted. We all were.

494
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,586
<i>The night we were leaving,
A.R.G.U.S. raided our house,</i>

495
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,967
killed my brother.

496
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,217
And took the only part that's
left of him.

497
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,716
<i>That's how you got caught.</i>

498
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,503
Trying to steal it the first time.

499
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,787
Yeah. I couldn't let A.R.G.U.S. keep it.

500
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,559
With my brother gone,

501
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,896
I needed its power to help me protect
my parents, but...

502
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,193
- Maybe they got away.
- Where?

503
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:45,357
Can't you see there's nowhere left
to go? This was our last hope.

504
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,448
Zari, I'm sorry about everything
that's happened to your family.

505
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,029
But we really have to...

506
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,661
Sara, the water woman just showed up
and she looks pretty grumpy.

507
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,167
Like, kill-anyone-
that-gets-in-her-way grumpy.

508
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,193
<i>Send us your coordinates.
We're on our way.</i>

509
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,177
What's going on now?

510
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:07,254
<i>Unidentified ship approaching,
Captain.</i>

511
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,592
- A.R.G.U.S.?
<i>- No, Captain.</i>

512
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,223
<i>It's the Time Bureau.</i>

513
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,360
<i>I don't understand.</i>

514
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,528
How does the Time Bureau
know where we were?

515
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,528
Gary!

516
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,369
I'm sorry.

517
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,294
I know you said you could handle it,
but you guys can't handle anything.

518
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,499
I should go.

519
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,628
<i>Sara Lance.</i>

520
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,422
<i>I see
that you and your team</i>

521
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,546
<i>have managed to get yourselves
in over your heads... Again.</i>

522
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,920
- Chill, lady.
- We're just trying to help.

523
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,743
<i>By starting a prison riot
at the A.R.G.U.S. facility?</i>

524
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:53,099
<i>When are you going to learn</i>

525
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,705
<i>that the Legends should not be
interfering with Bureau affairs?</i>

526
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,142
Maybe when you stop
screwing things up.

527
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:02,814
Perhaps it's best not to antagonize
someone on such a large timeship.

528
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,572
I don't care what Gary says.
We don't need backup.

529
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,217
<i>Sara! I need backup!</i>

530
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,577
Sara!

531
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,871
Where are you guys?

532
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,268
<i>Interesting.
It sounds like one of your team members</i>

533
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,172
<i>has stumbled sideways
into finding our assassin.</i>

534
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,952
Yes, that's rather our style.

535
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,372
Just give us his coordinates, we'll
be happy to save him for you.

536
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,404
You know these guys are going to hand
Zari back to those A.R.G.U.S. bastards

537
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,948
who are gonna do
god knows what to her.

538
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,675
<i>And if you don't comply,
we would also</i>

539
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,506
<i>be happy to scatter
you all into space.</i>

540
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,811
Did you just shoot at us?

541
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,559
<i>I am not screwing around.</i>

542
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,730
<i>Give us those coordinates!</i>

543
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,544
<i>The next one will not be a warning,
Miss Lance.</i>

544
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,935
I knew we shouldn't have trusted
that Time Dweeb.

545
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,691
Just give her what she wants!

546
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,156
Fine.

547
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,076
<i>I'll uplink their
coordinates to you now.</i>

548
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,705
You got to be kidding me.

549
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,292
- Ready?
<i>- Ready to receive.</i>

550
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,626
Whoa. They're gone.

551
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,178
I can see that, Gary! Track their
signature and follow them!

552
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,746
That was easier than I thought it'd be.

553
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,897
Is this what you're looking for?

554
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:46,667
So you do have it.
But are you capable of using it?

555
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,960
What are you offering for the totem?

556
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,167
I can give you
what you really want, Zari.

557
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,545
<i>What you want more
than that little trinket.</i>

558
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,264
I can give you revenge.

559
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,517
<i>Revenge on A.R.G.U.S.</i>

560
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,719
They targeted you and your family.

561
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,396
<i>Turned you all
into fugitives and criminals.</i>

562
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,816
They should die.

563
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,103
And in exchange for your help,
I give you this?

564
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,067
You can't control this power.

565
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,909
It wasn't meant for you.
I can free you from this burden

566
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,571
<i>and help you getjustice
for your family.</i>

567
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,672
Maybe picking a fight with the Time
Bureau wasn't the best stratagem.

568
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,875
Yeah. Well, they fired on us first.

569
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,613
<i>And if they continue to do so,</i>

570
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:36,471
<i>we will sustain critical damage
in less than five minutes.</i>

571
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,594
<i>Four minutes.</i>

572
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,641
- Well?
- I guess I have to say...

573
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,317
Sorry.

574
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,240
Come on, Ray! She's too much for us.
We got to move.

575
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,568
And she tastes terrible. Whoa.

576
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,785
- What's happening?
- Time Pukes

577
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,875
are shooting at us.

578
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,122
At least you seem to be feeling
better, Ms. Jiwe?

579
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,204
Yeah. Nathaniel's plan

580
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,414
while ill-advised, was beneficial.

581
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,499
Quiet.
The marshmallow's are talking.

582
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:14,884
Get to the Jumpship.

583
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,336
Get a fix on Ray's position

584
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,137
while Stein and I
keep our Time Bureau friends busy.

585
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,637
Not you, Space Ranger. Sit.

586
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,724
I really love this show.

587
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,402
Gideon, status.

588
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,924
<i>The Jumpship has been deployed.</i>

589
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,860
<i>I don't believe our pursuers noticed.</i>

590
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,824
<i>Oh, dear. I'm afraid our rear deflectors
have been completely lost, Captain.</i>

591
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,620
Sara, please.
You still have enough time

592
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,824
to arrange a détente
with the Time Bureau,

593
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,408
a compromise, if you will.

594
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,368
Sorry, Martin. I don't compromise.

595
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,399
Would you please help me talk some
sense into her?

596
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,584
I don't like broccoli.

597
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,674
<i>Gideon, divert everything
to our forward shields.</i>

598
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,085
You guys might want to hold on.

599
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,264
Gideon, hail the Time Bureau.

600
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,184
<i>- What are you doing?
- Being true to who we are.</i>

601
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,478
My team doesn't roll over
on their own.

602
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,855
Zari Tomaz is not one of your own.

603
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,151
<i>Either way,
we're not gonna let you, A.R.G.U.S.,</i>

604
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,108
<i>or anyone else put her behind bars
for who she is.</i>

605
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,736
So you'd rather kill your team
and mine?

606
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,411
<i>Collision in ten seconds, Captain.</i>

607
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,068
<i>Last chance, Ms. Lance.</i>

608
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,584
Sara, this is madness.

609
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,960
Change your course!

610
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,138
I'm good.

611
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,730
<i>Impact in three... Two... One...</i>

612
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,572
<i>Are we dead?</i>

613
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:00,113
Did we die?

614
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,907
<i>The Time Bureau vessel
jumped away.</i>

615
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,840
Gideon, make sure
they're not following us.

616
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,491
Professor, you all right?

617
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,615
Nothing that a cup of tea won't fix.

618
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,247
One cup of Lyoga root tea
for the professor coming up

619
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,669
'cause you're my best friend.

620
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,656
What made you change your mind?

621
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,640
Thought about what my brother
would want me to do.

622
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,578
Weren't your friends
supposed to be coming to rescue us?

623
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,764
- Good point.
- You had your chance.

624
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,263
<i>I was willing to offer you
a compromise,</i>

625
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,977
but now I have to kill you.

626
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,792
I'm afraid we can't
let you do that.

627
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,900
If anyone's going to kill Haircut,
it's me, lady.

628
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,948
Thanks, Mick.

629
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,075
- Pleasure.
- You think you can stop me?

630
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,995
<i>Trust in it.</i>

631
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,916
What are you doing?

632
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,132
Trusting it.

633
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,178
How?

634
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,686
Stay down. I can do this all day.

635
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,941
I would kill you...

636
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,363
But I'd just be killing myself.

637
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,191
<i>All right, Gideon,
how are we doing?</i>

638
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,633
<i>Our time-jump from</i> Jannah
<i>remained undetected, Captain.</i>

639
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:49,056
<i>I think we can safely say
our Time Bureau problem</i>

640
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,929
<i>is... Oh, bollocks.</i>

641
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,801
<i>- Perhaps I spoke too soon.</i>
- What is it?

642
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,429
<i>Incoming transmission
from Agent Sharpe.</i>

643
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,689
Put her on.

644
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,311
Oh.

645
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,358
Hey, Ava.

646
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,731
How was your day?

647
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,828
<i>You do realize that that little stunt of
yours could've destroyed us both.</i>

648
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,610
You tried to kill us first.

649
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,872
<i>No. I tried to warn you first. But
you don't take warnings, do you?</i>

650
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,615
Now you're starting to get it.

651
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,389
<i>Well, this isn't a warning.
It's a promise.</i>

652
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,418
<i>If I ever track you down again,</i>

653
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:21,339
<i>you and your band of idiots
will be exiled to the dawn of time.</i>

654
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,375
<i>Whatever leniency
Hunter gave you is over.</i>

655
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,301
<i>What a bitch.</i>

656
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,514
You took the words
right out of my mouth, Gideon.

657
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,848
Plot a course to 2042.

658
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,523
Hey. How're you feeling?

659
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,100
Yeah. Much better.

660
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,227
And you?

661
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,689
I thought the hangover I got
drinking with P.T. Barnum was bad.

662
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,735
Hey. I wanted to thank you.

663
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:54,326
I've gotten a handle on
my totem again.

664
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,117
That's great.

665
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,623
You can at least try
not to sound so disappointed.

666
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,340
It's cool.

667
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,625
I just thought you were
staying on the ship

668
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,254
because your
totem was out of whack,

669
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,928
and now
that it's back in whack...

670
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,016
I can't go.

671
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,477
This whole experience
has made me realize

672
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,142
that my fate is entwined
with someone else's.

673
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,151
Zari's.

674
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,235
Well... Sara said we're

675
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,696
dropping her back off in 2042.

676
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,005
We could've dropped you off anywhere.

677
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:46,541
Why this dump?

678
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,626
With <i>Jannah</i> gone...

679
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,505
- This is home.
- Oh. Well...

680
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:53,885
You got a lot of heat on you.

681
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,641
I can handle heat.

682
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,389
Thanks.

683
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,771
<i>Wait.</i>

684
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,014
It's not safe for you here.

685
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,442
There's no reason to suggest that
sorceress won't return for you.

686
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,778
Well, it's not like
I have any other options.

687
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,940
That amulet...

688
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,945
It's not an amulet.

689
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,411
It's a totem.

690
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,662
Like mine.

691
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,871
We're bound together, somehow.

692
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,286
In a way that I have
yet to understand.

693
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,331
Come with us.

694
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,208
That's all nice and weird, but...

695
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,510
Totems, they guide us
in strange ways.

696
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,591
What if yours guided you to us?

697
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,385
What would you rather do?

698
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,911
Hide from A.R.G.U.S. your whole life

699
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,473
or do something really stupid,
like time travel?

700
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,185
- I'm not a superhero.
- Neither am I.

701
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,657
Good.

702
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,132
You can't pedal forever,
you little nerd!

703
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:22,686
<i>Where are you, nerd?</i>

704
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,184
I think he went down this way.

705
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,483
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

706
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,104
Wait, he went down here.
Down here.

707
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:37,995
Hello?

708
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,205
Hi.

709
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,658
What's your name?

710
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,127
Mine's Ray Palmer.
