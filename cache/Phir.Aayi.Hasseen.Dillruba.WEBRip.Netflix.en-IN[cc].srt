He knows what we did.

I thought we could be friends.
He told me his name was Rahul.

I’ll be asking all the questions.

Why are you roaming
around Agra all by yourself?

Isn't it so strange, Raniji?

465

It’s been such a long time
since Rishu’s gone.

You broke all ties
and are not talking to your family either.

You didn’t even get married again.

So you mean to say,
it’s a crime for a widow to not remarry?

Otherwise, you living here

since the time he was just in his nappies.

478
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:31,041
He’s like an iceberg.
What you see is harmless.

479
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,666
But we’ll never know
the secret it hides underneath.

480
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,125
I…I’m a modern independent woman
and I…I can manage on my own.

is The Woodpecker.

The Woodpecker.

487
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:01,875
Do you know why?

488
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:07,000
It's because a woodpecker keeps pecking
the trunk of a tree continuously

489
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,708
and relentlessly
till he bores a hole in it.

490
00:32:10,541 --> 00:32:11,791
He just doesn’t give up.

491
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:15,625
The thing is that…

492
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:21,625
the law doesn’t dare to intervene
between me and all my cases.

No, sir, nothing yet.

take her lovely self in the city?

Uh, sir, home, beauty parlor,
she's usually in a 2-kilometer radius.

Then deploy your force
in the same 2-kilometre radius right away.

If we both run away,
he’ll have even more fun.

We’ll run to every nook and cranny,
but he’ll follow us and kill us.

-We are left with no other option.

I’ll surrender myself.

I’ll tell the police
you had nothing to do with Neel’s death.

Have you gone crazy? Hmm?

Have you really lost your mind?

596
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:20,375
We ran away from Jwalapur
and came here, why?

597
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,458
To surrender ourselves?

598
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:23,416
Rishu, you had to cut your hand.

I’ll just go to another city.

609
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:12,166
In a couple of days, the police will
track me and arrest me then and there.

-You will be--
-Ssh! Shut up!

You’re afraid because Montu chacha thinks
we’re here together, right?

612
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:22,000
I think I have a better idea.

613
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,708
But you have to trust me.

[thunder rumbling]

615

I thought I’d have
to wait for you tonight as well.

616
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,250
I'll have to come home again
for an appointment.

617
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,750
I guess all good things
come to those who wait.

So will you marry me?

What?

620
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:08,291
I asked, will you marry me?

621
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,375
Are you serious?

622
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,791
What about love?

623
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,500
I don’t have the heart
to fall in love again.

624
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:28,458
I wait for you for hours at a stretch,
but you never seem to notice me.

625
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,083
Why me?

626
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,625
If he can wait hours for me,

627
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:38,125
I think he could hold my hand
and walk a few miles too.

628
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,083
And who knows?

629
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:44,125
Maybe love finds me after we get married.

630
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:47,083
Or maybe it won't.

634

It took you just a moment
to make me the happiest man in the world

635
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:06,208
and the loneliest too.

636
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:10,000
Love has the same effect, Abhimanyuji.

637
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:13,833

00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:16,166
I got a little carried away.

797
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:22,875
The thing is that seeing the police
my heart goes dhak dhak

798
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:24,250
dhak dhak.

799

[heartbeats pounding]

800
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:27,166

[grunts]

805
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:48,375
Why do you play so hard to get, Raviji?

806
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:52,208
You don’t have a hand
and I practically don't have a leg.

807
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:56,125
But together we could walk
miles on end. Perfect.

808
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:03,250
Do you know what happened to my leg?

809
00:56:03,333 --> 00:56:04,875
[suspenseful music playing]

810
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,458
For my ex-boyfriend, I was
on the second floor, and I jumped off.

811
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:15,833
[eerie music playing]

814
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,208
[Rani] "I gave him my heart
thinking he's my own,

815
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:35,208
but he butchered it
leaving me broken and torn."

816
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:42,791
From the day we got married until now,
we’re just playing snakes and ladders.

817
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,500
The actual board game.

818
00:56:44,583 --> 00:56:46,833
But your tongue is stuck
way down Poonam’s throat.

819
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:49,375
She keeps blackmailing me,
harassing me, what do I do?

820
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:52,125
And I pushed her away.
You saw that too, right?

821
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:55,708
I told you to stay away,
stay away from that… that wicked bitch.

822
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,000
-Who knows? Maybe you led her on.
-Seriously?

823
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,541
That’s how much you trust me and my love?

824
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:04,458
Didn’t I trust you when you told me
you were going to marry Abhimanyu?

825
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:08,000
Correct. It’s all my fault.

826
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:12,875
I made a plan, so I was wrong.
Abhimanyu is trapped and that’s my fault.

827
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:16,041
And Montu chacha?
That also must be my fault.

828
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:19,500
I told you, I was ready to surrender,
but you didn't listen to me.

829
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,416
-He’s not going to leave us alone.
-Go to hell!

830
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,333
And take your Montu chacha with you.

831
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:27,041
At first, we didn’t love each other.

832
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,791
Then we fell in love
but the timing was off.

833
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:31,791
When the timing was right, we couldn’t
be together 'cause there were issues.

834
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:34,250
Finally, when we sorted everything,
we were about to leave,

835
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,583
your Montu chacha comes out of nowhere.

836
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:41,833
The timing of our love story is bad.
I don’t think this is going to work out.

837
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:43,750
[gasps]

838
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:47,083
Last time you thought our relationship
won’t work out, I cut off my hand.

839
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,833
But I didn’t let go of your hand.

840
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:54,791
This time if I have to cut off my head,
I’ll happily do that as well.

841
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:57,541
My love for you
has made me a criminal anyway.

842
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,750

[indistinct traffic sounds]

844

Oh! That’s not fair, Raniji.

845
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:22,416
You’ve already started
drinking without me?

846
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:27,791
You are crying? Is everything all right?

847
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:28,708
L…

848

-L…

L… S… D.

850

LSD!

851
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:38,041
Are you high on drugs?

852
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:39,000
[sucks teeth]

853
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:44,791
Love. Sex. Deceit. LSD.

854
00:58:45,875 --> 00:58:47,625
You’ll find it all over Agra.

855
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:51,458
There is LSD everywhere around us.

856
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,583
Look, all I need is love.

857
00:58:57,541 --> 00:58:58,875
Poonam just wants sex.

858
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,208
And Abhimanyu is a victim of deceit.

[diabolic music playing]

860
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:04,375
He’s trapped for no reason.

861
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,708
He shouldn’t have got married.

[diabolic music playing]

863

It’s all my fault.

864
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,833
It’s Montu chacha’s fault.

865
00:59:12,333 --> 00:59:17,750
Montu… whatever he’s doing, [sniffles]
he shouldn’t be doing it.

866
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,250
I don’t want to be here.

867
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:23,208
[sniffles] Please take me away
from here, Rishu.

But you need to leave the city soon.
I can help you make arrangements.

-I’ll take care of everything.
-But how?

891
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,833
I’m a compounder.

892

Be it the judge or the DIG,
I know all their dirty secrets.

Everyone gets sick.

894
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:51,166
I’ve given shots to the biggest of shots,
I’ll manage everything.

895
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:00,083
But, Abhimanyuji…

896
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,083
why are you trying to help us?

897
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:09,166
Mom, Dad, childhood, teenage years…
Couldn’t save any of it.

898
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,208
But the least I can do is save my love.

899
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:15,166
So what if
I can’t spend my life with Raniji?

900
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:17,791
It's her happiness that matters.

901
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:21,375
If I live in some corner of her heart
because of the things I say and do,

902
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:24,458
then maybe some day
she'll grow tired of Rishuji

903
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:26,333
and think about me instead. So…

904

[tense music playing]

905
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:33,375
She’ll need a couple of lifetimes
to get tired of me.

906
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:38,083
But I’ve heard
that you are an expert at waiting.

907
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:40,500
Don’t be so egoistic, Rishuji.

908
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,083
Today, the love of your life is with you
and I am the victim of love.

909
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:49,500
Fate can be really evil sometimes.

910

If it’s not meant to be,
even eternal lovers would never meet.

01:06:26,541 --> 01:06:27,500
Poonamji, um…

956
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,875
-[eerie music continues]
-[latch clicks]

957
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,083
How did you find out I am here?

958
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,583
I followed you here.

959
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:48,375
You thought a resignation is enough?
You will need much more--

960
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:50,458
[music intensifies]

961
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:53,250
[music fades]

962
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:03,083
Give me a month to sort everything.
I’ll come back to you soon.

963
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:20,000
And if you don’t come back…

964
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,291
then…

965
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:23,625
[diabolic music playing]

966
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,041
[music fades]

967
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:41,458
[slide latch closes]

968
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:48,041
[knocking on door]

969
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,416
[Rishu] I told you, Poonamji…

970
01:07:52,125 --> 01:07:54,125
[tense music playing]

971
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,000
[door squeaks]

972
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:12,583
[in Hindi] Matar pulao.

973
01:08:14,166 --> 01:08:16,291
[in English] Raniji told me
it's your favorite, so…

974
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:19,041
[breathlessly ] Yeah,
keep it on the table.

975
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:26,750
[latch squeaks shut]

976
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
[Abhimanyu sniffing]

977
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:36,708
[sniffs exaggeratedly, exhales]

978
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:39,958
Jasmine… Wow!

979
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:43,916
Was a lady in this room?

980
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,916
[steel box clanks]

981
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,416
Yes, uh, Poonam was here.

982
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:48,458
Who Poonam?

983
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,875
-She was my landlady, actually.
-How did she come here?

984
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:56,208
[sighs] Now what do I say, Abhimanyuji.

985
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,916
[sighs]

986
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,583
She keeps following me.

987
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:03,375
Blackmailing me as well.

988
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:06,083
-Blackmail?
-Yes.

989
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:07,666
Why? What does she want? Money?

990
01:09:09,958 --> 01:09:13,000
-She must be after something.
-[scoffs] Me.

991
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:15,833
-You?
-[Rishu] Yes.

992
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,875
[both laughing heartily]

993
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,208
[boxes clinking]

994
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:26,791
[scoffs] [in Hindi] Arey, baap re!

995
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,666
[in English] What's her full name?

996
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:37,833
Why do you want to know?

997
01:09:39,416 --> 01:09:41,166
I was thinking
I’ll send her a friend request.

998
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:45,041
[sighs] Don’t worry,
she won't tell anyone about all this.

999
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,166
She loves me. That’s what she says.

1000
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:51,583
Hmm.

1001
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:56,250
Love?

1002
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:59,375
[eerie music playing]

1003
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:03,250
So, the thing is, Poonam likes you,
and you like Raniji,

1004
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:06,208
but then even I like Raniji,
but Raniji likes you.

1005
01:10:06,291 --> 01:10:07,500
[music intensifies]

1006
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:11,416
We’re all wasting our lives chasing
something way beyond our reach. [chuckles]

1007
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,166
Just simplify it, professor.

1008
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:16,875
Take a U-turn and go back to Poonam.

1009
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:19,166
Raniji stays with me. End of story.

1010
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:21,416
[music fades]

1011
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,083
[silence]

1012
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,916
Arey, I was just kidding around.

1013
01:10:26,416 --> 01:10:28,666
Why did you get so serious? [laughs]

1014
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:31,666
-Enjoy your food, I’ll get going.
-Thank you. Okay.

1015
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:38,875
Something wrong?

1016
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:41,875
[suspenseful music playing]

1017
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:44,250
Did someone else come, too?

1018
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:46,083
[diabolic music playing]

1019
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:47,166
Uh…

1020
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,250
[breath catches] No one.

1021
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:52,333
[music intensifies]

1022
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:00,541
[music gets louder]

1023
01:11:12,916 --> 01:11:15,166
Does Raniji know
you’re such a big fat liar?

1024
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:17,958
[Rani] I would’ve preferred
the movie plan.

1025
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:23,291
There are crocodiles in this area.
[nervous chuckle]

1026
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:26,375
But I guess, they’re mostly
near the railway bridge, right?

1027
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:32,166
And anyway, the police have cordoned off
the area with tapes and stuff.

1028
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:35,791
So the… [chuckles nervously]
the plan must be safe.

1029
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,250
[softly] No?

1030
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:43,250
You think the police and their flimsy tape
can stop the crocodiles?

1031
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,875
-[mumbles] No.
-[Abhimanyu] This river is their home.

1032
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:50,666
If someone tries to invade your home,
your life, that too on the basis of a lie…

1033
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,291
nobody will tolerate it.

1034
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:57,708
[Abhimanyu] I’ve told Lallan
so many times,

1035
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:00,208
"Take off your slippers before coming in."

1036
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:03,208
[metal clinks]

1037
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:05,291
This soil is from the jungles of Rajgir.

1038
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:09,375
The same place
from where I sourced that snake long ago.

1039
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:12,500
The one that bit my whole family
and killed everyone.

1040
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,583
Lallan must’ve told you about it, right?

1041
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,958
[Abhimanyu whistling]

1042
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,000
Did you know, Raniji?

1043
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:26,250
My chacha betrayed my father
when they were business partners.

1044
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,875
He stole his entire business.

1045
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:32,875
So you know what?
I finished off his entire family.

1046
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:35,500
[chuckles eerily]

1047
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,041
I cannot stand betrayals,
I’m a bit fragile.

1048
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:43,083
I loved you with devotion
and all the right intentions

1049
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,125
with all my heart.

1050
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,791
[chuckles eerily] And how did you
treat me?

1051
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:55,916
I did not feed the snake
for four whole days.

1052
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:59,791
So, hungry and angry,
when the snake eventually bites,

1053
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,875
the fangs go that much deeper.

1054
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:05,500
Chances of survival next to zero.

1055
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:07,166
[tense music playing]

1056
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:12,416
If we are able to control a human
or a beast by their nature,

1057
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:15,958
they end up turning into a puppet.

1058
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:22,041
[Rishu grunts] Ah!

1059
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:27,083
[strains, grunts]

1060
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:29,166
[fast-paced, tense music playing]

1061
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:32,583
Abhimanyu!

1062
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:34,666
[padlock clatters]

1063
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:38,458
Abhimanyu!

1064
01:13:40,125 --> 01:13:40,958
Abhimanyu!

1065
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,291
Don’t you dare touch Rani!

1066
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:46,291
[tense music playing]

1067
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:50,625
[water sloshes, gurgles dangerously]

1068
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
[gurgles again]

1069
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:55,041
[dramatic music intensifies]

1070
01:13:56,291 --> 01:13:58,041
[music fades]

1071
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:00,375
Okay, come on,
tell me one last thing, Raniji.

1072
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:07,250
Did you ever, for even a single moment,
think that we could be together?

1073
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:09,875
[water rippling]

1074
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:14,541
Yes.

1075
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:17,791
I did.

1076
01:14:20,541 --> 01:14:21,875
Maybe some other time…

1077
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:24,666
Maybe some other place…

1078
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:29,291
If Rishu wasn’t a part of my life, then…

1079
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:32,750
maybe it could've been us.

1080
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,208
[slow music playing]

1081
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,750
Okay then.

1082
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:49,625
You, me
and my rosy pink Taj Mahal, that’s enough.

1083
01:14:51,291 --> 01:14:54,916
Life is great,
but the love of my life has another date.

1084
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,125
[chuckles]

1085
01:14:57,666 --> 01:15:00,750
But that’s okay, Raniji.
This color also suits you very well.

1086
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:05,083
I mean, if a couple of your lovers
aren’t six feet under,

1087
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:07,791
can you even really call this place
the City of Love?

1088
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:13,041
[Abhimanyu whistling a lively tune]

1089
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:15,083
[door clattering loudly]

1090
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:21,458
[wedding band playing outside]

1091
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:54,333
[Abhimanyu] Do you know, Raniji?
There is one more thing that connects us.

1092
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:02,125
Panditji’s words.

1093
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:06,833
Your life is an adaptation
of Wrath of Kasauli,

1094
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:10,791
while mine is inspired
by The Revenge of the Cobra.

1095
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:15,541
Both of us used Panditji's pen
to write our destinies, Raniji.

1096
01:16:15,625 --> 01:16:17,958
[soft, diabolic music playing]

1097
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:20,000
You really seem to have met your match.

1098
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:25,166
All that remains to be seen
is who is the bigger fan of Panditji.

1099
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,958
[music continues]

1100
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:31,958
The day I saw you at the clinic,

1101
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:35,250
the first thing that caught my eye was,

1102
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:39,375
in these soft, silky hands,
was Panditji’s book.

1103
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:42,958
Then came the sky-blue dupatta,

1104
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:44,916
the rose-pink kameez,

1105
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:46,958
then these eyes,

1106
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:52,541
and by the time I reached your lips,
I was already in love.

1107
01:16:58,708 --> 01:16:59,958
[music intensifies]

1108
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:03,041
[Rani grunts]

1109
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:04,833
[song fades]

1110
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:07,000
[dogs barking]

1111
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,791
[dogs barking menacingly]

1112
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,083
Help! Help! Help! [breathlessly]

1113

And Abhimanyu, right?

1453

What do you mean?

1454
01:39:28,541 --> 01:39:30,875
Because the thing is, sir,
if they were alive,

1455
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:33,250
they would have been
behind bars right now.

1456

Rani was in there all along.

1457
01:39:36,583 --> 01:39:38,916
Rishu would be sentenced
for the murder of Neel.

1458
01:39:39,916 --> 01:39:41,166
And Abhimanyu?

1459
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:43,958
For the murder of his family.

SNAKE KILLS FAMILY

1461
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:50,125
So Abhimanyu was actually
being blackmailed by a man named Lallan.

1462
01:39:52,083 --> 01:39:55,333
Lallan is the same snake catcher
who helped Abhimanyu kill

1464

When the double murder happened,

1465
01:40:01,458 --> 01:40:04,833
the same morning, Lallan went
to the clinic to meet Abhimanyu.

1466
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:08,083

The second dead body was Poonam’s.

1470
01:40:21,041 --> 01:40:23,791
Poonam went to the clinic
that day to meet Rishu.

1471
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:27,916
She knew what he had been hiding.

1472
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,625
She too was killed.

01:40:45,291 --> 01:40:49,458
So he knew how to burn those bodies,
how to fake their identities,

Thanks to an unnoticed camera
at Bobby's garage,

1483
01:41:16,708 --> 01:41:18,166
we found some more footage.

1484
01:41:18,958 --> 01:41:22,250
According to the footage,
Rani and Abhimanyu came back home

1485
01:41:22,333 --> 01:41:24,041
at around 7 in the evening.

1486
01:41:24,708 --> 01:41:26,875
And then, exactly 15 minutes later,

1487
01:41:27,375 --> 01:41:30,291
someone was seen entering
Abhimanyu’s house that day.

Rishu.

1489
01:41:35,041 --> 01:41:37,458
And maybe that evening
among the three of them,

1490
01:41:38,541 --> 01:41:39,625
a plan was discussed.

1491

1498
01:41:58,041 --> 01:42:01,333
And the interesting thing is that, sir,
after Rani left the house,

1499
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:04,166
two more people were seen leaving
from Abhimanyu’s house.

1500
01:42:05,416 --> 01:42:07,958

on that night…

1503
01:42:21,416 --> 01:42:23,000
a conspiracy was surely hatched.

1504
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:29,333

to jump from the bridge

One question still haunts me today,

1511
01:42:49,208 --> 01:42:53,083
why did Rishu
specifically choose the railway bridge?

1582
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:45,583
So that they remain a little hungry
and force the crocodiles to think

1583
01:47:45,666 --> 01:47:48,166
the farther away they go… [grunts]

1584
01:47:49,416 --> 01:47:51,250
[grunts] the more meat they can eat.

1585
01:47:51,333 --> 01:47:53,500
We need to distract them
from the railway bridge.

1586
01:47:54,083 --> 01:47:56,958
That is why we will drop the meat
two kilometers away from here.

1595
01:48:50,208 --> 01:48:52,416
[meat sploshes]

[crocodile sploshing]

1598
01:48:57,958 --> 01:49:01,500
A 12-kilometre area
all around the bridge is clear.

1599
01:49:01,583 --> 01:49:05,250
And the place where we decide to get out
of the water is completely up to us.

1600
01:49:08,041 --> 01:49:10,750
Tomorrow, when you tell Raniji
to jump, will she agree?

1601
01:49:10,833 --> 01:49:11,791
[Rishu] Definitely.

1602
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,375
Is your trust in your love that deep?

1603
01:49:16,625 --> 01:49:18,125
I’m trusting you as well.

1604
01:49:20,041 --> 01:49:21,583
I know you love my Rani so much

1605
01:49:21,666 --> 01:49:24,125
that you wouldn’t hesitate
for a second to get rid of me.

1606
01:49:25,583 --> 01:49:28,000
But the real question is,
why haven’t you done it yet?

1607
01:49:29,375 --> 01:49:32,791
It's because I'd rather have Raniji
come willingly into my arms someday.

1608

[diabolic music playing]

1625
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,750
[in English] That’s a long way down,
right?

1626
01:50:53,833 --> 01:50:55,208
Just be careful. [echoes]

[wind whooshing ominously]

1628

Panditji says,
“Red signifies jealousy and anger,

1629
01:51:09,833 --> 01:51:10,791
blood too is red.

1630
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,750
Perhaps it's apt that red signifies love.“

1631
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,333
Panditji.

1632
01:51:18,208 --> 01:51:21,625
Isn't it a bloody unfaithful color?

1633
01:51:23,583 --> 01:51:25,666
But just one thing
brings red into my life now.

1634
01:51:26,541 --> 01:51:28,125
The rose adorning your hair.

1635
01:51:29,625 --> 01:51:32,791
-The thing is, it’s turned black now.
-What?

1636
01:51:33,833 --> 01:51:36,875
Your red rose, it’s turned black now.

[suspenseful music playing]

1638
01:51:43,625 --> 01:51:45,625
Raniji, come here first
and then we’ll talk.

1639
01:51:46,791 --> 01:51:48,125
One more step…

1640
01:51:49,875 --> 01:51:51,458
and I’ll jump off the cliff.

1641
01:51:52,625 --> 01:51:53,583
Raniji…

1642
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:57,875
Rishu was right all along,
I didn’t believe him.

1643
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:01,875
Killing someone
has become a game for you, isn't it?

1644
01:52:03,125 --> 01:52:07,458
Lallan, Poonam, huh?
They were never a part of our plan, right?

1645
01:52:08,041 --> 01:52:10,041
Raniji, Lallan and Poonam
were risky for us.

1646
01:52:10,125 --> 01:52:13,416
Life gave me a golden opportunity
to forget the mistakes of the past

1647
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:16,208
and start a new life with you
and I grabbed it with both hands.

1648
01:52:18,708 --> 01:52:19,666
Just for you.

1649
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:23,833
Tell me one thing honestly.
We are… Were you ever happy with me?

1650
01:52:24,583 --> 01:52:27,083
I was. I was really happy.

1651
01:52:27,166 --> 01:52:31,791
Then, Raniji, because of a few mistakes,
ple… please don’t do this.

1652
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:35,875
I’ll pay the price for all my sins,
but, Raniji, please…

1653
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:38,416
Please don’t jump off,
what are you doing?

1654
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,541
-Come back here.
-[man] Arey, just stop this drama.

[suspenseful music playing]

1656
01:52:47,541 --> 01:52:50,958
If she was really going to jump off,
she wouldn’t have sent me an invite.

1657
01:52:52,541 --> 01:52:55,125
Tell me, Raniji,
why have you called me here?

1658
01:52:55,708 --> 01:52:59,041
So that both of us
end this chase once and for all.

1659

[suspenseful music playing]

1660
01:53:08,916 --> 01:53:10,708
Both of us have used Panditji’s pen

1661
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:12,750
to write the pages of our destiny, Raniji.

[Rishu] Rani…

1674
01:53:49,125 --> 01:53:52,708
[in English] That's impossible.
We are not going to repeat this madness.

1675
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:54,916
Rani, please try to understand
what I’m saying.

1676
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,750
I’ve known Montu chacha
since I was a kid.

1677
01:53:57,333 --> 01:54:01,083
If he finds out we're alive, he'll drag us
from the depths of hell and lock us up.

1678
01:54:01,166 --> 01:54:03,416
And your plan is
to take a shortcut straight to hell

1679
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:06,583
by following a ridiculous plan
from this book. No way, Rishu. No.

1680
01:54:06,666 --> 01:54:08,291
And the things we’ve already done?

1681
01:54:09,166 --> 01:54:11,416
The Revenge of the Cobra,
Wrath of Kasauli.

1682
01:54:12,416 --> 01:54:16,416
The three of us lost our senses long ago
when we became Panditji’s disciples.

1683
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:18,208
[Rishu] There is a difference, sir.

1684
01:54:20,625 --> 01:54:22,416
Panditji’s books taught us how to live,

1685
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:24,416
but you ended up learning
how to take lives.

1686
01:54:25,083 --> 01:54:26,250
That’s the difference.

You killed someone as well
for the sake of love.

What did I do that is so wrong?

1725
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:29,416
I did the same thing
you and Rishu once did.

1726
01:57:31,083 --> 01:57:33,041
Is it fair to say
the murder you committed was love

1727
01:57:33,125 --> 01:57:34,625
and the one I committed was wrong?

1728

You don’t even know the meaning of love.

You never really loved me, you know that?

-No, please--
-All you did

1731

was play a game
of snakes and ladders with our lives.

You…

1733

[sniffles] I made a huge mistake.

1734

[breathes heavily] Okay.

1735

Let me tell you one more truth, Abhimanyu.

1736
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:58,333
I never thought I could be happy living
my life with anyone else other than Rishu.

01:58:00,208 --> 01:58:01,583
But after that incident…

1738

I thought you are the one.

1739
01:58:07,208 --> 01:58:09,833
I could feel there was
something special between us.

[breath trembling]

1743

even I won’t be able to live with.

[wind howling]

1747
01:58:31,375 --> 01:58:32,916
So, now your punishment is…

1748
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,208
that you can never have me.

1749
01:58:37,541 --> 01:58:39,375
You might have won me over…

1750
