STICK: Guns are a coward's weapon.
What are you without your sidearm?

478
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,020
A guy with a spare.

479
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,067
You think because you are the beloved...

...you will be granted your freedom?

481
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,737
There's only one freedom.

482
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,281
Let me grant you yours.

483
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:01,915
-You don't have to do this. It's over!
-Not yet.

484

-Sara, baby, don't.
-Tell Ra's al Ghul that my family is off-limits.

I'm sorry you saw that.

I can't imagine what you must think of me.

488

I think you're a survivor.

489

I think you're one of the bravest people
I've ever known.

490
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,278
You're my daughter.

491
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,698
It's time for you to come back home.

492
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,034
SARA: I can't.
-Why not?

493
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,996
They are never gonna stop looking for me.

I'll protect you. We'll protect you.
Tell her it's safe to stay.

495
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:49,713
Dad, if they hurt you or Laurel or Mom,
then I really would die.

496
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:52,674
-But they need to know.
-They can't. They can't, Daddy.

-Why not?
-You know why.

498
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:58,221
I came back to make sure
that my family was safe, and you are.

499
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,516
But if they knew I was alive,
Laurel and Mom...

500
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:06,104
...they would never stop looking for me,
and that could get them both killed.

She's right.

509

You have to keep her secret.

510
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,067
It's already the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

511

How do you live like this?

512
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:06,247
I never mind getting a visit from my children,
but I know why you're here.

513
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,792
-Just one thing to say.
MOIRA: We've been through this.

514
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:13,046
-I am not going to change my mind.
-This is about me changing mine.

Because I thought that you didn't wanna
go to trial over a secret.

Then I caught up with an old friend
and watched as she struggled...

517
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,767
...to tell her family hers
because she was afraid...

518
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,854
...that they wouldn't love her
if they knew the truth.

519

Whatever you are worried about,
it will not make us love you any less.

-But you don't know.
-Who do you think you raised?

521
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,908
You've taught us to be strong.

522
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,662
That we could overcome
any obstacle that we faced.

523
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,455
To fight.

524
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,626
Do you really think
that we are gonna scare that easily?

Can we do this another time?

533
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,343
I just had to see you.

Did something happen? Are you okay?

I've had a really long week, and I'm tired.

I wish that there was something.

00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,878
A sign that it gets better.

543
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,713
It does, honey.

544
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,965
It gets better.

00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,534
She left.

00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,915
-You cool with that?
-I didn't have much of a choice.

551
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,544
An old friend gave this to me.

552
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,673
He said I would know
when it was the right time to drink it.

00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,262
-And now is the right time?
-I'm not sure.
