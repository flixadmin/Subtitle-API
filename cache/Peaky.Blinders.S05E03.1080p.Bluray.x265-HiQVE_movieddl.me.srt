I've been talking to the Friends.

- What friends?
- Quakers.

They say I've been led astray.

If you've come to talk about redemption,
you're talking to the wrong person.

I also went to a solicitor.

They heard my name was Shelby,
and suddenly they were too busy.

To divorce a Shelby man,
you have to go to a solicitor in London.

He said he'd represent me.

Also, Lizzie, one of the Friends is a man.

He listens to me when I talk.

223
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,360
His wife died of the Spanish flu.

224
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,080
He has a daughter.

225
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,320
And you're considering making
this daughter an orphan?

Nor will it.

00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,720
He would die without his eyes.

229
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,400
And out of kindness,
Tommy would offer his daughter

230
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,160
a place in one of his institutions
for orphaned girls.

231

Or even take her into the family.

329
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,320
Any business I have with you, Mr Shelby,
is meant to be strictly confidential.

330
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,960
Ah, Michael.
You still have shit on your shoes.

331
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,040
My associate here can evidently smell it.

332
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,280
I don't mean any of fence.

333
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,880
Here, Michael, go and find Karl

334
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,440
and buy him an ice cream, eh?

335
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,880
The man doesn't trust you.

336
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,920
Fuck you, Tom.

337
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,080
You know Gina phoned.

338
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,000
The baby's heart's beating strong.

339
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,960
And I swear to God, Tom,

340
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,960
by the time
that baby draws its first breath,

341
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,120
you and I will be done.

342
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,760
And you will be king.

343
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,120
Is that it, Michael?

344
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,800
You know, Tom,

345
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,760
there are doctors in London now

346
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,080
who can talk their way into your head,
dig out all the shit.

347
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,440
Perhaps, you should see one.

348
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,240
(COUGHS)

349
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,000
You're still not alone.

350
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,560
Me brother and I are the same person.

351
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
Here.

352
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,440
Here's a letter from Mosley.

353
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,600
You should read it.

354

(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

355
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,720
What investigation is he talking about?

356
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,920
Two weeks ago,
a journalist was killed in Maida Vale.

357
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,080
The night before,
he'd come to me about some story

358
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
he was going to write about me.

359
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,920
We had nothing to do with that killing.

360
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,000
Mosley wants you as his deputy?

361
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
His constituency is Smethwick.

362
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
It borders my own.

363
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,160
He wants Birmingham as his stronghold.

364
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,640
He knows I've...strong support
among working people.

365
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,600
We help him out at rallies,
show up at some town hall meetings.

366
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,840
Right, and why are you showing
this letter to me?

367
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,360
A Minister of State

368
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,080
who may have seditious intentions.

369
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
There's no proof of sedition
in this letter.

370
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,880
You work in intelligence, Younger.

371
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,200
You don't need proof.
Give it to your superiors.

372
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,480
Mr Shelby, I have a very specific brief.

373
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,720
My brief is specifically
to gather information

374
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,760
on the activities of communists.

375
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,560
Your immediate superior
in the intelligence unit

376
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,400
is a Colonel Patrick Wyatt, yeah?

377
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,360
I understand he regularly plays polo
with Oswald Mosley.

378
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,680
They share membership of various clubs
in London and Birmingham.

379
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,040
I have specific orders.

380
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,480
I am a soldier.

381
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,400
You think you can join this family?

382
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,560
I have no intention of joining a family.

383
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,280
Well, thank fuck for that,
cos, er, you'd hate our weddings.

384
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,080
Thought you said this was about business.

385
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,000
Yes - family business
and government business,

386
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,480
all in one envelope.

387
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,480
Younger, listen to me.

388
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,240
Forget about Ada.

389
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,960
Forget about weddings.

390
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,800
You know what Mosley represents.

391
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,960
You know his philosophy.

392
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,400
I am planning to reply to him
and tell him that I'm making up my mind.

393
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,880
But in the meantime,
you need to give me instruction.

394
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,840
I could fight him on my own, if I have to,

395
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,160
or I could join his organisation

396
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,160
and undermine him on behalf of the King.

397
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,720
But you need to make a decision.

398
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,920
I suppose there are a few things
I can do on my own initiative.

Is it Maisie, or is it Clara?

Don't worry, Sandra.

The only way to get fired
from this household

is through burnt toast...

While you was gone, I got a message, Tom.

424
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,240
<i>A</i> cousin of Aberama Gold
galloped from Meriden.

He said Aberama wants you to know
that he's gone to Scotland

426

to deal with his business himself,

from the hospital in Polly's Bentley.

I have a job for you.

Tom, I'm in a lot of pain here.

Tom, I am in fucking pain here.

00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,360
- Yeah, you appear to be managing.
- I said I was <i>just</i> managing.

444
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,920
Well, you can just manage
to sit in a car with Arthur

00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,480
and follow the patrin
to find the Fury family.

Arthur will take care of everything
that requires bones and muscles.

00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,720
...you heard the baby's heartbeat today.

00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,080
Beats so fast.

454
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,560
Would have been a birthday gift enough.

455
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,400
A new life.

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,440
Liberty.

00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,960
Freedom.

458
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,280
Feels like a weapon.

459
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,960
I only came because Michael's
driving back from London

460
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,200
and he said he didn't want you
to be on your own.

461
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
So...

462
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,000
Whose idea was the gift of freedom?

463
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,280
Mine.

464
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,600
You want to take Michael
and the baby to New York?

465
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,960
Yes.

466
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,720
The baby will have two grandmothers.

467
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,880
The other one lives...

468
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,440
The other one lives amongst human beings.

469
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,360
The other one <i>is</i> a human being.

470
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,400
It's all right, I'm not drunk.

471
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,480
I'm just free.

472
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,080
So, what do you want?

473
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,720
My approval?

474
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,040
Your help.

475
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,360
Michael wants you to come with us.

476
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,240
We can all live in Long Island,
right on the beach.

477
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Isn't Long Island in Australia?

478
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Or is it in California,
amongst the Indians?

479
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,840
It's in New York, Polly.

480
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160
You see, we all try and get away.

481
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,880
But we never do.

482
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,200
I wish I felt that heartbeat today.

483
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,960
You're starting to sound
a little sorry for yourself.

484
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,160
I'm an American.

485
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,720
We don't just go round
and round and round.

486
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,960
We go in a straight line.

487
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,560
And my baby...will be born in New York.

488
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,360
I'm not happy about moving this meeting

and you hate London anyway.

We're looking for popular speakers
for our upcoming rally.

You're making quite a name for yourself
in the Commons.

Betty!

493
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,240
What are you drinking?

494
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,520
Water.

495
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,560
Bottle of Champagne, Betty.

496
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,720
You'll drink it on your own.

497
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,960
That's the idea.

498
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,880
Shall we sit down, Miss Eden?

00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,680
Revolution.

501
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,520
So, how is life as a socialist?

502
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,560
This glass.

503
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,120
The bubbles.

504
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,840
They rise to the top.

505
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,320
Each bubble has the same chance to rise.

506
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,320
That is a very peculiar form of socialism.

507
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,480
And this bottle.

508
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,400
Once the cork comes out...

509
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,640
...you can't get it back in.

510
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,640
You need to finish what you started.

511
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,560
It's cleverness, that's all.

512
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,240
So you're playing at this.

513
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,520
People can be turned around.

514

00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,800
- My people?
- Yeah.

516
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,960
For them, it's just the same.

517
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,920
Communism. Fascism.

518
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,040
For most people,
it's an apple and an apple.

519
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,200
Fascism is the subject of the rally.

520
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,040
I want you to speak against it.

521
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,920
In answer to your question...

522
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,040
...I cannot address your rally...

523
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,800
...because it's not part
of the current strategy.

524
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,960
Are you OK, Thomas?

525
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,960
Do you want a man to carry you home?

I didn't expect you home.

533
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,320
Frances said Linda was here today.

534
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,920
Frances has a very specific loyalty,
doesn't she?

535
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,000
Well, people are loyal
to those who pay their wages.

536
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,040
Also, Maggie at the exchange
said you made some calls.

537
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,200
Then you'll know I called a solicitor.

538
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,400
Did Maggie listen in to the conversation?

539
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,880
He said he'd represent me.

540
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,880
But I put the phone down.

541
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,640
There and then, I made a decision.

542
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,760
And when I heard your car pull up,
I got changed.

543
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,080
You said, in your head,
you still pay for it.

544
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,040
So I've decided to continue
to take the payment

545
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,880
and balance my heart against my head,

546
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,240
as though it were a book of accounts.

547
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,120
- I value my head a shilling more.
- Huh!

548
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,720
When was the last time
you had to worry about shillings, eh?

549
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,560
People are loyal to those
who pay their wages.

550
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,520
That's why I'll be loyal to you.

551
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,400
But this is the deal.

552
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,720
You don't fuck anybody else in my house,

553
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,880
nor within a day
of holding our child by the hand.

554
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,560
A day on either side.

555
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,680
And you let me in sometimes.

556
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,920
Into your head.

557
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,040
To clear it out.

558
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,400
That what needs clearing out.

559
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,000
Agreed.

560
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,440

00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,600
Always.

562
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,760
The deal is...

563
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,120
...you belong to me.

00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,680
My property.

565
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,240
No-one touches my property.

566
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,160
I touch myself, but it's still you anyway.

567
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,800

No, Tom.

I'll jump in my fucking car
