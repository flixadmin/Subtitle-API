1
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,416
- Good morning, Teacher.
- Good morning.

2
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,255
- Good morning, Teacher.
- Good morning.

3
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,923
Good morning.

4
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,759
Good morning.

5
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,230
Dicky Zhou.

6
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,943
Just look at you.
You're covered in dirt.

7
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,445
- I just...
- Stay where you are.

8
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,157
You're always giving excuses.

9
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:57,118
Why couldn't you just
keep yourself clean?

10
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,786
What's the matter, Mr Cao?

11
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,996
Explain yourself.

12
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,374
Let me talk to him.

13
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,088
How did you get so dirty, Dicky?

14
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,466
I fell down on my way to school.

15
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:14,511
Why couldn't your father or mother
send you to school?

16
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:17,765
My mum died a long time ago
and my dad's very busy.

17
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:20,434
What does your father do?

18
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:21,769
He's a labourer.

19
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:32,905
Can I make an appointment to see him?

20
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:35,575
I don't think he has the time.

21
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:40,121
All right then.
Let me know when he's available.

22
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:42,499
Take this and clean yourself up
before class starts.

23
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:44,667
Thank you, Miss Yuan.

24
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:52,175
I want to be a superstar.

25
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:55,012
- Who would you like to be?
- Nicole Kidman.

26
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:58,140
Nicole Kidman gets US$20 million
for filming a movie.

27
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:00,559
I wouldn't mind being her either.

28
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:03,103
I want to be an entrepreneur.

29
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:04,730
What kind of business
do you have in mind?

30
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:08,359
I'm fine with anything
as long as it's a big business.

31
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:10,695
The big boys can take over
the small players easily.

32
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:13,030
Why not?

33
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:23,249
I want to be a poor person.

34
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:28,004
<i>My Ambition</i>

35
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,090
Stop.

36
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:35,470
My dad says that
a humble, peace-loving

37
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:40,851
and studious person with integrity
will be respected even if he's poor.

38
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:57,952
Don't touch it.

39
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:02,665
Stay away from me.

40
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,586
Put it down.

41
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:11,174
Go back to your seat.

42
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:34,532
It's mealtime.

43
00:04:35,157 --> 00:04:36,951
It's mealtime.

44
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:41,998
- It's mealtime.
- Let's go for our meal.

45
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:40,642
This amazing robotic dog
is called CJ1.

46
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:48,776
It was developed jointly by
US, French and German scientists.

47
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:50,277
Do you want to play with it?

48
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:51,528
Yes.

49
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:53,739
Not a chance.

50
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:58,327
There are only two of such dogs
in the world.

51
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:02,707
The other one is owned by
the US President's daughter.

52
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,585
- What are you doing?
- I'm eating my noodles.

53
00:06:05,668 --> 00:06:08,379
Stand up.

54
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:13,593
No matter how much you eat,
you're doomed to be a dwarf.

55
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:15,637
Now, get lost.

56
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,517
Why is the calibre of our students
getting from bad to worse?

57
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,855
What do we have here? Another alien?

58
00:06:25,772 --> 00:06:27,816
- What are you doing?
- I'm eating my rice.

59
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,236
Why are you so beefy for your age?

60
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,614
You should go see a doctor.

61
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:37,368
Stop gorging yourself on food.
You look horrible.

62
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:42,039
Guys, call the police and
get them to shoot this monster.

63
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:45,209
- I hope you die binging, freak.
- You're finishing all our food.

64
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:46,335
What are you guys doing?

65
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:57,347
Heroes don't bully girls.

66
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,933
Why are you still following us?

67
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:01,393
Ignore him.

68
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:05,063
Go away, poor boy.
We don't want to hang out with you.

69
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:08,191
- Shoo.
- Get lost, wretched poor boy.

70
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:25,126
Hello.

71
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:26,878
Hello.

72
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:30,798
You've been sent off the field too?

73
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:33,176
Yes.

74
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:36,638
Did you forget your sneakers?

75
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:40,433
I brought them along,
but I chose not to wear them.

76
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:42,269
Why?

77
00:07:42,352 --> 00:07:43,937
I wanted to be punished
together with you.

78
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:55,407
Are all your shoes torn and tattered?

79
00:07:55,491 --> 00:08:00,412
Yes. My dad gets all my shoes
from the rubbish dump.

80
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:02,706
Your father is so nice to you.

81
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,333
Yes, he is.

82
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:08,671
But I really want
a new pair of sneakers

83
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,923
because I love
physical education lessons.

84
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:14,302
But I hope you can continue
wearing the old shoes.

85
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,428
Why?

86
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,057
We'll always be punished
together then.

87
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,410
Hurry.

88
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:42,206
Get that panel up there. Hurry.

89
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:45,251
You, step on it.

90
00:08:58,222 --> 00:08:59,432
Since you're so weak,
you'd better go home.

91
00:08:59,515 --> 00:09:01,309
You're no longer needed here.

92
00:09:01,851 --> 00:09:03,561
Boss?

93
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:06,022
I need to buy an electric fan
for my son

94
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:09,317
as he hasn't been able to sleep well
in this hot weather.

95
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:11,361
Can you continue to hire me?

96
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:13,071
Buy a fan?

97
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:14,865
How about your wife's medical
and funeral bills which I settled?

98
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:18,494
If you've got the money,
you should pay me back first

99
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:21,455
or you'll be debt-ridden for life
given the sorry state you're in.

100
00:09:21,538 --> 00:09:24,583
You're even starving yourself so that
your son can go to that fancy school.

101
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:28,170
If my son can attend public school,
why can't yours?

102
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:31,549
Well, I just want him to
have a better head start.

103
00:09:31,632 --> 00:09:33,426
I don't want him to end up like me.

104
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:35,761
But you have to be capable.

105
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:37,305
I think he's highly capable.

106
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:38,890
I was referring to you, not him.

107
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:44,229
You're just an odd-job labourer.
How are you going to cope?

108
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:46,898
- I can cope.
- You can't.

109
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:50,402
- I can.
- You can't.

110
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:53,029
I can.

111
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:57,284
Go and lay the cement foundation
at Block B.

112
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:58,911
Thank you, Boss.

113
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:00,537
You've cheapened yourself
for your son.

114
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:02,581
So you must keep going
even if you're on your last legs.

115
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:32,904
<i>Please</i>

116
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:57,847
You're back.

117
00:10:58,264 --> 00:10:59,765
Can we have dinner? I'm starving.

118
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:01,517
Just step back a little.

119
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:07,941
- What's going on?
- Turn around.

120
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:20,370
Come here.

121
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:22,789
What's the matter?

122
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:26,293
It's an electric fan.
Is this for real?

123
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:29,046
This is great.
We finally have a fan at home.

124
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:30,673
- Sit down and let me turn it on.
- Hurry, turn it on.

125
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,550
I want to feel the air from the fan.

126
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:41,100
Dad, did you find this
among the garbage?

127
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:43,394
No, I bought it.

128
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:45,188
This old fan cost me a bomb.

129
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,481
You must've been ripped off again.

130
00:11:46,564 --> 00:11:49,859
No, it was fine when I bought it.

131
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,195
Good grief. Why isn't it working now?

132
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,740
Dumbass, you've got to be
smarter next time.

133
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:57,784
Dumbass? Where did you
learn that word from?

134
00:11:57,868 --> 00:11:59,202
My classmate said that.

135
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,621
Really?

136
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:04,082
We might be poor,
but we don't use foul language.

137
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,211
We don't steal or rob

138
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:10,506
and we don't take things
that don't belong to us.

139
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:14,468
You must study hard and become
an asset to society in the future.

140
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:19,682
I didn't have an education
when I was young

141
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:21,017
and that's why
I'm lagging behind in society.

142
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:49,671
- We're having an apple today?
- Yes.

143
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:52,424
Wait.

144
00:12:53,717 --> 00:12:55,970
Finish your dinner first.

145
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:59,807
By the way, Dad,
my sneakers are worn out again.

146
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,017
Can you mend them for me?

147
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,395
Get me a better pair next time
or I'll be sent off the field again.

148
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:07,231
I got it. I'll try my best.

149
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,364
Good grief.
Must you hit that cockroach?

150
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:16,658
We're having our meal now.

151
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:19,494
Cockroaches can wait.

152
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:58,576
Good. You've improved.

153
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,542
Not bad.

154
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:44,040
<i>Lately, there have been
many sightings of UFOs.</i>

155
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,209
What happened to the cartoon?

156
00:14:46,293 --> 00:14:48,670
It'll be back soon.
Just wait a moment.

157
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,341
<i>Can you please tell us what happened?</i>

158
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:57,554
<i>I saw a flying saucer.
It flew over there with a whoosh.</i>

159
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,517
<i>Can you describe
the flying saucer in detail?</i>

160
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,438
<i>It was a flying object,
but it wobbled during its flight.</i>

161
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:07,023
<i>I suspect it was involved in a crash.</i>

162
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,692
<i>- A crash?
- Yes, like a car crash.</i>

163
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,196
<i>It might've become faulty.
I even took a picture of it.</i>

164
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:22,997
<i>Sir, what kind of camera did you use?</i>

165
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:27,335
<i>It was an expensive one,
but I can't tell you the brand.</i>

166
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:29,880
<i>Did the flying saucer make any sound?</i>

167
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,715
<i>It made a whooshing sound
like I said.</i>

168
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,967
<i>Have you heard such sounds before?</i>

169
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:37,054
They're unbelievable.

170
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:57,909
<i>CJ1</i>

171
00:15:57,992 --> 00:15:59,702
Why did you run off?

172
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:02,705
Dad, this toy is called CJ1.

173
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:05,417
Everyone at school has one.
It's a fun toy.

174
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,543
Really?

175
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:09,588
Let's go home. Put it back.

176
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:24,436
What's the matter?

177
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:26,355
Why don't we buy one?

178
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:28,649
We'll buy it
after I get paid next month.

179
00:16:28,732 --> 00:16:30,192
Now, put it down.

180
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:39,994
Let go.

181
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:47,711
Why are you so disobedient?
I can't afford this now.

182
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:53,967
If you buy me this toy, I'll never
ask for anything else again.

183
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,510
Please buy it for me.

184
00:16:57,054 --> 00:16:58,847
You like this?

185
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:00,807
What kind of features does it have?

186
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,144
Let go.

187
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,816
Let go.

188
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,780
Let go.

189
00:17:17,825 --> 00:17:19,952
Let go.

190
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:22,997
Stop right there.

191
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,668
Sir, are you going to buy this toy?

192
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:48,023
Come on, Dicky. Stop crying.
Be a good boy, stop crying.

193
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:49,692
Dicky.

194
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,652
Are you Mr Zhou?

195
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:54,321
I'm Dicky's teacher, Miss Yuan.
Nice to meet you.

196
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:56,991
Miss Yuan, it's nice to meet you too.

197
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,660
Is Dicky well-behaved at school?

198
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:01,871
Yes, he's quite well-behaved
at school.

199
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:04,040
But he threw
a temper tantrum just now.

200
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:07,001
I know. Kids just want
every toy they see.

201
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:12,173
Yes. I didn't bring
enough money with me today, so...

202
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,303
- Dicky, go to your father.
- Come here.

203
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,265
- I'm sorry, Mr Zhou.
- That's the way he is.

204
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,435
Actually, I've always wanted to
pay you a visit at home.

205
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:26,522
He did tell me,
but I'm very busy at work.

206
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,858
I believe it takes more than teachers
to give children a good education.

207
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,403
That's why I'd like to
get you involved.

208
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,113
It'll be good for him too.

209
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,282
Yes, that's right.

210
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,993
Dicky, I need to go now.

211
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,664
Don't throw a tantrum again.
Listen to your father, okay?

212
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,042
Okay?

213
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,004
- I'm leaving then.
- Okay.

214
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,132
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

215
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,922
Dicky, turn around.

216
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:36,761
I have a toy which is
way better than CJ1.

217
00:21:36,844 --> 00:21:38,680
Do you want to take a look?

218
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:48,648
Are you sure?

219
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,404
In that case, I'll throw it away
and get back to work.

220
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:41,370
- Goodbye, Teacher.
- Goodbye.

221
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,665
Fanny.

222
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:48,586
What's this amazing toy
which you mentioned, Dicky?

223
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:50,254
Check it out.

224
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:57,261
What's so fun about this?

225
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:59,764
It's super fun. Check it out.

226
00:23:00,932 --> 00:23:05,353
It doesn't look that fun to me.
What do you think?

227
00:23:05,937 --> 00:23:08,690
Actually, I agree.
It's not a fun toy.

228
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:13,028
It's okay. See you tomorrow.

229
00:23:16,615 --> 00:23:18,909
What's that thing you're holding?

230
00:23:18,992 --> 00:23:20,410
It's nothing.

231
00:23:20,494 --> 00:23:21,870
It must be some kind of garbage.

232
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:28,878
That's not true.
This is way better than CJ1.

233
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:31,380
What is it called?

234
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:36,344
It's called CJ7.

235
00:23:36,677 --> 00:23:38,596
Drop the act, poor loser.

236
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:42,558
Your father must've found it
among the rubbish.

237
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:45,353
Don't talk about my dad like that
or I'll beat you up.

238
00:23:45,812 --> 00:23:47,939
Bring it on.

239
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:04,456
Hello.

240
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,414
How many times have I told you?

241
00:24:44,498 --> 00:24:47,584
We might be poor,
but we don't get into fights.

242
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,670
You're such a disappointment.

243
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:53,215
Look at you.
Your uniform is all torn.

244
00:24:53,632 --> 00:24:55,092
Why did you even get into a fight?

245
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,220
My classmates were laughing at me.

246
00:24:58,679 --> 00:24:59,889
Why did they laugh at you?

247
00:25:06,062 --> 00:25:07,981
Out with it!

248
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:18,909
Fine.

249
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,536
So you aren't going to tell me?

250
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,044
You're forcing my hand.

251
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,184
Come clean with me!

252
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:50,483
It's moving.

253
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:22,892
- There's a ghost.
- What ghost?

254
00:26:23,726 --> 00:26:25,478
There's a ghost in the ball.

255
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:28,106
Don't change the subject. Sit down.

256
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:30,733
Do you think you can
run rings round me?

257
00:26:30,817 --> 00:26:33,570
Don't mess with me
or I'll beat you to a pulp.

258
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:35,572
Look, your uniform is all torn.

259
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:37,782
What are you going to
wear to school tomorrow?

260
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:42,454
How am I supposed to
scavenge for another one?

261
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:44,915
I'll deal with you later.

262
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:03,934
There's a ghost hanging over there!

263
00:27:04,226 --> 00:27:06,854
Help! There's a ghost!
It's so frightening.

264
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:10,024
There's a ghost in red
hanging over there.

265
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:13,695
This is so scary and frightening.
The ghost is hanging over there.

266
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:15,613
Stop screaming.

267
00:27:15,697 --> 00:27:17,740
It's just a broken lamp.
There's no ghost.

268
00:27:27,501 --> 00:27:28,919
What is it this time?

269
00:27:29,002 --> 00:27:30,587
You look like a ghost too.

270
00:27:30,671 --> 00:27:35,384
Zip it or I'll throw you out.
Do you hear me?

271
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:17,594
Are you on drugs?

272
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:23,601
Dad, what are you doing?

273
00:28:23,684 --> 00:28:25,519
Please don't lock me inside here.

274
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:28,105
There's a ghost inside.
You've to believe me.

275
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:31,067
Dad, let me out.

276
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,694
Help!

277
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:40,743
Let me out.

278
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:57,761
Amitabha.

279
00:28:57,844 --> 00:29:05,811
Amitabha.

280
00:30:40,827 --> 00:30:43,454
- Have you learnt your lesson?
- Yes.

281
00:30:43,538 --> 00:30:46,666
- Will you behave yourself in future?
- I will. I really will.

282
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:49,544
I've to get back to work.
Be a good boy at home.

283
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:52,464
Hurry, get going then. Goodbye.

284
00:31:31,171 --> 00:31:33,006
Are you from outer space?

285
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,845
Are you here to invade Earth?

286
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:22,474
I think you could be
an alien toy dog.

287
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,086
My name is Dicky. Can I call you CJ7?

288
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:54,090
Since you're wagging your tail,
that means you like the name.

289
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:55,967
CJ7.

290
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:58,303
CJ7.

291
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:53,235
The apples in our house
are always rotten.

292
00:33:53,318 --> 00:33:55,279
Why is this one so fresh?

293
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:56,780
You know magic?

294
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:05,081
It tastes so sweet.
You really do know magic.

295
00:34:05,414 --> 00:34:08,459
I'm going to be rich!

296
00:34:24,643 --> 00:34:29,106
If you can defeat
the most vicious dog on Earth

297
00:34:29,189 --> 00:34:33,443
then you really are a superdog
from outer space.

298
00:34:33,527 --> 00:34:34,861
Go.

299
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:03,016
You're awesome!

300
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,373
There's a test today,
but I didn't prepare for it

301
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,708
because I was
playing with you yesterday.

302
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,087
Can you help me
score full marks nonetheless?

303
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,192
What are you making?

304
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,535
Dicky Zhou.

305
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,538
Why are you wearing those glasses?

306
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,707
I've got an eye injury.
Do you want to take a look?

307
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,211
Don't come near me. Sit down.

308
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:16,384
The test begins now.

309
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:39,366
<i>Mark a tick if it's correct.
Mark a cross if it's wrong.</i>

310
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,659
<i>The start of the syllable,
the end of the syllable, the syllable</i>

311
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:42,870
<i>The end of the syllable</i>

312
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:35,883
Sorry, Mr Cao. There was a fly.

313
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:38,136
A fly?

314
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:43,975
Sorry, Mr Cao. There was a fly.

315
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:54,862
<i>Chinese Language Test</i>

316
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:58,323
I have the results for the test
which you took today.

317
00:37:58,407 --> 00:38:01,201
For the first time,
Dicky Zhou scored full marks.

318
00:38:08,376 --> 00:38:09,877
- Thank you, Mr Cao.
- Wait a minute.

319
00:38:11,504 --> 00:38:13,923
I want to check your glasses.

320
00:38:32,776 --> 00:38:35,738
Those super-glasses were fantastic.

321
00:38:35,821 --> 00:38:39,325
It's physical education next,
so I'll need super-sneakers.

322
00:38:49,418 --> 00:38:51,003
This is so exciting.

323
00:38:56,718 --> 00:39:00,096
What does it take to
excel at high jump?

324
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,434
It boils down to talent, hard work,
lots of training, sufficient sleep

325
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:06,478
and respect for your coach.

326
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:11,692
So far, no one has been able to break
this personal record which I've set.

327
00:39:19,158 --> 00:39:22,078
Coach, I'm wearing
new sneakers today.

328
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:27,416
Coach, he just broke your record.

329
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:40,096
Dicky, it would be unreasonable of me
to expect a kid to reach that height.

330
00:39:40,889 --> 00:39:42,849
Be a good boy and do it again.

331
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,563
Dicky Zhou, what are those shoes
which you're wearing?

332
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:09,148
It's none of your business.

333
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:10,691
You've gone overboard.

334
00:41:10,774 --> 00:41:12,818
That's because all of you
drove me into a corner.

335
00:41:12,902 --> 00:41:14,195
Come down.

336
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:37,719
Dicky, are you out of your mind?

337
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:39,304
I...

338
00:41:39,388 --> 00:41:42,015
He's over there. Catch him.

339
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,685
Come to your senses, Dicky.

340
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:49,732
Miss Yuan, the feeling of bitterness
can be as boundless as the sea.

341
00:41:52,735 --> 00:41:53,819
Dicky.

342
00:41:53,903 --> 00:41:56,948
Dicky Zhou, why did you jump
so high up into the air? Come down.

343
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:59,116
Mr Cao, you should calm down.

344
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:36,280
How on earth could you sleep
like that?

345
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,325
Wake up. It's time for school.

346
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,498
Didn't I tell you to be a good boy?
Why do you keep oversleeping?

347
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:48,084
Was it all a dream?

348
00:42:53,715 --> 00:42:55,258
You're real.

349
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:56,885
I'm going to get ready for school.

350
00:43:00,889 --> 00:43:03,851
Dad, I'm going to score full marks
for my exam today.

351
00:43:05,185 --> 00:43:06,729
I'm going to score full marks.

352
00:43:06,812 --> 00:43:07,897
Do you have what it takes?

353
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,193
Yes, I've got what it takes
to score full marks.

354
00:43:13,486 --> 00:43:15,321
That's great.

355
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:32,631
If you can defeat
the most vicious dog on Earth

356
00:43:32,714 --> 00:43:37,094
then you really are
a superdog from outer space.

357
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:38,595
Go.

358
00:44:02,328 --> 00:44:03,538
Run!

359
00:44:26,645 --> 00:44:28,606
What happened back there?

360
00:44:32,443 --> 00:44:35,154
You're supposed to be
the superdog from outer space.

361
00:44:35,238 --> 00:44:37,991
Are you playing dumb?

362
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:40,577
I'm being serious.

363
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,455
I have to score full marks
for the exam today.

364
00:44:43,538 --> 00:44:47,083
I need you to work your magic for me.

365
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:51,964
Cut it out. Stop clowning around.
I'm not joking.

366
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:56,552
You have to give me a magic weapon.

367
00:46:03,914 --> 00:46:04,956
Time's up.

368
00:46:06,291 --> 00:46:07,876
But I haven't even started yet.

369
00:46:10,546 --> 00:46:12,256
What's with the turd?

370
00:46:13,382 --> 00:46:15,342
Turd? It's not turd.

371
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:17,511
Taste it if you don't believe me.

372
00:46:27,939 --> 00:46:30,358
How dare you make a fool of me!

373
00:46:33,945 --> 00:46:36,531
I'm going to kill you.

374
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:43,205
This is your last chance.
Give me the magic weapon now.

375
00:46:53,632 --> 00:46:56,093
Why did you...

376
00:47:00,932 --> 00:47:02,433
You...

377
00:47:21,328 --> 00:47:23,288
Coach, I can explain.

378
00:47:23,372 --> 00:47:24,790
Don't bother.

379
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:33,424
You're shallow, crass, wicked and
the most uncouth student I've seen.

380
00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:35,634
Whatever you say
will be just full of crap.

381
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,928
Now, clean him up.

382
00:47:49,065 --> 00:47:53,069
CJ7? Please come out.

383
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:56,656
Why would I be mad at you?

384
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,950
We're good friends.

385
00:47:59,284 --> 00:48:02,871
The turd wasn't a big deal.

386
00:48:02,955 --> 00:48:05,457
I've been through worse.

387
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:09,712
Let's just forget about this fiasco.
It's all water under the bridge now.

388
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:14,467
In fact, I love you very much.
Do you know that?

389
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,847
CJ7? Come here.

390
00:48:21,182 --> 00:48:23,434
Good doggy.

391
00:48:33,987 --> 00:48:36,156
I'm going to stab you to death.

392
00:48:42,621 --> 00:48:46,500
You're a crappy dog from outer space.
You're low-tech and boring.

393
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:49,295
I got ridiculed by my classmates and
blamed by my teachers because of you.

394
00:48:49,378 --> 00:48:50,838
So this is your karma.

395
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:52,673
You should've told me honestly
that you're lousy

396
00:48:52,757 --> 00:48:55,009
and not as invincible as I thought.

397
00:48:56,677 --> 00:48:59,472
But it never said it was invincible.

398
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:02,642
Perhaps I had
unrealistic expectations.

399
00:49:07,021 --> 00:49:08,398
Have I made a mistake?

400
00:49:08,481 --> 00:49:10,817
I know I've made a mistake.

401
00:49:25,124 --> 00:49:30,296
Wait.

402
00:49:30,379 --> 00:49:32,840
Wait.

403
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,053
Wait.

404
00:49:37,804 --> 00:49:40,765
Wait.

405
00:49:45,395 --> 00:49:46,563
What happened?

406
00:49:46,646 --> 00:49:48,857
CJ7 has disappeared.

407
00:49:54,363 --> 00:49:55,906
Look.

408
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:02,287
CJ7?

409
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:09,378
I'm sorry. I missed you so much.
I thought I'd never see you again.

410
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:16,094
I'm glad you're not angry with me.

411
00:50:19,305 --> 00:50:21,558
Both of you already met?

412
00:50:24,811 --> 00:50:26,229
It's a toy?

413
00:50:26,313 --> 00:50:27,814
Yes, it is.

414
00:50:29,983 --> 00:50:33,403
It can walk, jump and blink?
Where did you get it?

415
00:50:33,487 --> 00:50:35,572
My classmate lent it to me.

416
00:50:38,117 --> 00:50:40,035
Where's the cover?

417
00:50:40,536 --> 00:50:42,204
Where should we insert the batteries?

418
00:50:42,288 --> 00:50:45,082
It doesn't need batteries.
It's very high-tech.

419
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:49,003
I've never seen
a high-tech toy like this.

420
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,636
- Did you see that?
- Yes, I did.

421
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:58,972
It's really bouncy.

422
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:01,599
Stop doing that.
I have to return it to my classmate.

423
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,059
Don't worry about it.

424
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,687
- What are you doing, Dad?
- It'll be fine.

425
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,954
Look, I told you it'd be fine.
It's restored now.

426
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,622
This is fun.

427
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:27,126
Stop squeezing it. That's enough.

428
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:30,129
Everything is so high-tech nowadays.

429
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:34,759
Uneducated people like me
won't be able to catch up.

430
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:38,680
Dad, I don't want to lie to you.

431
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:43,518
In fact, CJ7 came out of the ball
which you gave me.

432
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:45,896
It's an alien from outer space.

433
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:49,733
How many times have I told you?

434
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:53,779
We might be poor, but we don't lie.

435
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:55,614
We don't get into fights

436
00:51:55,698 --> 00:51:59,034
and we don't take things
that don't belong to us.

437
00:51:59,118 --> 00:52:03,372
You must study hard and become
an asset to society in the future.

438
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:17,762
It's so hot.

439
00:54:13,299 --> 00:54:15,635
The fan started working again
when the weather is hottest.

440
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,429
- It seems every dog has its day.
- I'm off to school.

441
00:54:17,512 --> 00:54:19,890
- Have you brought your lunch box?
- Yes, I have.

442
00:54:20,682 --> 00:54:22,726
How did your exam go?

443
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:30,484
Why has your forehead gone red?

444
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:35,656
You look listless today.
Didn't you sleep well last night?

445
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:41,996
Get inside and go to sleep.

446
00:54:43,206 --> 00:54:44,457
Stop.

447
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,334
What's that thing inside your bag?

448
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:48,127
Nothing.

449
00:54:48,628 --> 00:54:50,422
Check his bag.

450
00:54:51,715 --> 00:54:53,133
Why are you checking my bag?

451
00:54:53,216 --> 00:54:55,635
I don't have to tell you the reason.

452
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:05,104
- Let go.
- Let go.

453
00:55:10,192 --> 00:55:11,318
What's that?

454
00:55:11,735 --> 00:55:13,320
Let me take a look.

455
00:55:13,404 --> 00:55:18,951
- Give it to me. Let me see it first.
- Give it to me. Don't pull it.

456
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:24,749
- Catch it!
- Go after it!

457
00:55:29,879 --> 00:55:32,173
- Come and help me.
- Here.

458
00:55:32,465 --> 00:55:35,051
You're so useless. Stop running.

459
00:55:36,344 --> 00:55:37,929
Catch it.

460
00:55:38,013 --> 00:55:40,557
This is so frustrating.
Go over there now.

461
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:44,186
What's this weird thing?

462
00:55:44,269 --> 00:55:46,313
Don't touch it. Give it back to me.

463
00:55:46,397 --> 00:55:47,898
Get the toolbox.

464
00:55:51,569 --> 00:55:53,946
- Let's open it up and take a look.
- Here you go.

465
00:55:55,031 --> 00:55:58,493
Let it go.

466
00:55:58,576 --> 00:56:00,036
It's not working.

467
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:01,829
Try this.

468
00:56:03,915 --> 00:56:06,626
Please don't do that.

469
00:56:07,293 --> 00:56:09,838
- It's not working either.
- How is that possible?

470
00:56:24,103 --> 00:56:25,521
Why did you snatch my toy?

471
00:56:25,604 --> 00:56:27,231
So what if I did?
Are you going to hit me?

472
00:56:27,314 --> 00:56:29,734
Yes, I'm going to hit you.

473
00:56:38,284 --> 00:56:41,329
Let him go!

474
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,924
- Let him go.
- You must let me go first.

475
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:40,015
I don't want to get into a fight.

476
00:58:01,246 --> 00:58:02,998
Don't force me to do this.

477
00:58:28,566 --> 00:58:29,609
Are you okay?

478
00:58:29,901 --> 00:58:32,236
I'm fine. Thank you.

479
00:58:32,779 --> 00:58:33,821
You're welcome.

480
00:58:33,905 --> 00:58:35,490
What's going on here?

481
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:40,328
Why were all of you fighting?
Out with it.

482
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:43,331
You're going to stand here
until you tell me.

483
00:58:49,546 --> 00:58:50,839
CJ7.

484
00:58:54,426 --> 00:58:56,470
I knew you'd be okay.

485
00:58:56,553 --> 00:58:59,390
Stop it. Be a good boy.

486
00:58:59,765 --> 00:59:01,434
What's this thing?

487
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:03,436
Check it out. CJ7, sit.

488
00:59:05,688 --> 00:59:09,067
It's so smart. What else can it do?

489
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:10,568
CJ7, show us a happy face.

490
00:59:11,402 --> 00:59:13,071
Show us an angry face.

491
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:14,864
Show us a sad face.

492
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:18,702
You just saw a pretty lady.

493
00:59:20,328 --> 00:59:21,371
Your apartment is on fire.

494
00:59:23,582 --> 00:59:24,624
You won the lottery.

495
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,377
Your whole family is dead.

496
00:59:30,047 --> 00:59:31,131
You've scored full marks
for the exam.

497
00:59:34,718 --> 00:59:36,262
It's so smart.

498
00:59:36,345 --> 00:59:37,429
Look.

499
00:59:44,687 --> 00:59:46,272
It even displayed fireworks.

500
00:59:47,899 --> 00:59:49,567
Where did you buy this toy?

501
00:59:49,651 --> 00:59:51,569
Yes, I want one too.

502
00:59:51,653 --> 00:59:52,904
I can't tell you that.

503
00:59:52,987 --> 00:59:56,324
But I wish to thank you
for not telling Mr Cao about this.

504
00:59:56,408 --> 01:00:00,328
Of course. We don't discuss
our business with adults.

505
01:00:00,412 --> 01:00:01,663
- Is that a deal?
- It's a deal.

506
01:00:04,082 --> 01:00:05,876
You're amazing.

507
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:07,836
Would you like to join our judo team?

508
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,922
No. They'll all make fun of me.

509
01:00:10,005 --> 01:00:13,759
They wouldn't dare.
Will you guys still make fun of her?

510
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:36,741
Look at this. My son scored
full marks for his exam.

511
01:00:36,825 --> 01:00:39,369
- Your son is so smart.
- Yes.

512
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,123
- Look.
- Go away.

513
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,083
He scored full marks.

514
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:46,627
Shift this over there.

515
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:51,048
Boss, my son really scored
full marks for his exam.

516
01:00:51,131 --> 01:00:53,259
He must've cheated.

517
01:00:56,846 --> 01:00:58,431
Why did you say that?

518
01:00:58,514 --> 01:00:59,974
Even a smart boy like my son
only managed to score 60 marks

519
01:01:00,057 --> 01:01:01,267
after he cheated.

520
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:04,479
Who would believe your son could
score full marks without cheating?

521
01:01:04,562 --> 01:01:06,648
That's nonsense.

522
01:01:08,816 --> 01:01:10,110
The ink is different.

523
01:01:10,193 --> 01:01:13,530
That little liar must've changed
the number zero to a hundred.

524
01:01:14,864 --> 01:01:18,326
But that's not the person he is.
I know him better.

525
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:19,703
Your son cheated.

526
01:01:19,786 --> 01:01:21,788
- You can't say that.
- Your son cheated.

527
01:01:21,872 --> 01:01:24,041
I'll hit you if you say that again.

528
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:27,795
Your son cheated.
So? You want to hit me?

529
01:01:40,183 --> 01:01:42,643
How could you hit me
when it was your son who cheated?

530
01:01:42,727 --> 01:01:44,812
You're fired.

531
01:01:44,896 --> 01:01:46,606
Your son cheated.

532
01:02:10,464 --> 01:02:12,174
Get inside now.

533
01:02:12,258 --> 01:02:13,884
Get inside.

534
01:02:17,471 --> 01:02:20,600
Tell me the truth.
Did you cheat in your exam?

535
01:02:21,184 --> 01:02:23,811
- No, I didn't.
- You scored zero.

536
01:02:23,895 --> 01:02:26,356
But you changed it to 100 marks.
Am I right?

537
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:32,404
Yes. But that's not
the same as cheating.

538
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:34,281
I just didn't want you
to be disappointed.

539
01:02:34,364 --> 01:02:36,158
What's wrong with you?

540
01:02:36,241 --> 01:02:39,077
I slogged my guts out
to send you to that school.

541
01:02:40,454 --> 01:02:41,830
I'm sorry, Dad.

542
01:02:42,122 --> 01:02:43,791
How many times have I told you?

543
01:02:43,874 --> 01:02:46,460
- We might be poor...
- Sheesh, I know.

544
01:02:46,543 --> 01:02:49,672
You're sounding like a broken record.
It's getting on my nerves.

545
01:02:51,716 --> 01:02:54,719
What's done can't be undone.
What can you do about it?

546
01:03:13,113 --> 01:03:15,991
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

547
01:03:20,412 --> 01:03:24,667
What are you doing?
What are you trying to do?

548
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,795
If you don't study hard,
you don't get to play.

549
01:03:27,878 --> 01:03:29,672
- Give it back to me.
- No.

550
01:03:29,755 --> 01:03:31,674
You've no right to take my stuff.

551
01:03:31,757 --> 01:03:35,094
No, I've every right to do that
because I'm your dad, okay?

552
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:38,139
You're just taking advantage of me.
I don't have a father like you.

553
01:03:38,222 --> 01:03:40,767
And I don't have a son like you
who always does miserably in exams.

554
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,769
Get off my case.

555
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,104
I dare you to say it again.

556
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,731
Get off my case forever.

557
01:03:46,815 --> 01:03:48,441
Fine.

558
01:03:48,942 --> 01:03:52,779
If you can score 60 marks
with your own ability

559
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:54,448
I'll never bother you again.

560
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:56,325
- It's a deal.
- It's a deal.

561
01:03:56,408 --> 01:03:59,203
I'm going to achieve that.
Don't go back on your word.

562
01:03:59,286 --> 01:04:02,831
Stop bragging and
walk the talk, F student.

563
01:04:02,915 --> 01:04:04,291
You should stop being so cocky.

564
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:08,713
I'll show you what I've got
so you'll get off my case for good.

565
01:04:13,342 --> 01:04:15,386
What are you looking at?

566
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:28,442
- Mr Zhou.
- Miss Yuan.

567
01:04:28,525 --> 01:04:29,818
What's the matter? Let's talk inside.

568
01:04:29,901 --> 01:04:33,238
It's okay. Please pass this to Dicky.
He forgot to bring his lunch box.

569
01:04:33,614 --> 01:04:36,325
Sure. Would you like to come in?
I'll get someone to open the gate.

570
01:04:36,408 --> 01:04:40,412
Don't bother. He'll get ridiculed
if his classmates see me.

571
01:04:40,496 --> 01:04:41,539
That won't happen.

572
01:04:41,622 --> 01:04:43,207
- I have to go.
- Wait.

573
01:04:45,126 --> 01:04:48,754
Dicky told me everything.
He was just being temperamental.

574
01:04:49,463 --> 01:04:52,884
If you don't mind, you can let him
go home with me after school today.

575
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:54,677
I'll have a good talk with him.

576
01:04:55,178 --> 01:04:57,972
I can also help him prepare for
another exam tomorrow.

577
01:04:58,056 --> 01:04:59,808
What do you think?

578
01:04:59,891 --> 01:05:02,727
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome. Don't mention it.

579
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:06,022
- No, I really appreciate it.
- It's just a small gesture.

580
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:07,399
No, it's not.

581
01:05:07,482 --> 01:05:12,571
I've always felt bad that
I wasn't able to give him the best.

582
01:05:12,654 --> 01:05:16,659
So I can't thank you enough
for lending him a helping hand.

583
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:19,995
You really don't have to.
It's my duty.

584
01:05:20,913 --> 01:05:22,540
I'll leave Dicky to you then.

585
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:24,792
Sure, I'll take good care of him.

586
01:05:25,376 --> 01:05:27,795
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

587
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:04,876
How is the boss feeling today?

588
01:06:04,959 --> 01:06:06,377
I can't believe you've got
the cheek to come back.

589
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,504
I have to. I need to make a living.

590
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,487
I know I shouldn't have
shot my mouth off

591
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:34,198
but can we let that slide
since we're from the same village?

592
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,243
I shouldn't have said that
about your son in public.

593
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,412
I hope you can accept this red packet
as a peace offering.

594
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:42,957
But... But he really cheated.

595
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:47,045
Who doesn't? Your son is smart.
He'll be a successful man in future.

596
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,547
I certainly hope so.

597
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,591
All right, take the money
and buy him some food.

598
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,051
You don't have to give me
so much money.

599
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:55,470
Cut the crap. Just use it to
buy books or pay his school fees.

600
01:06:55,553 --> 01:06:56,680
Now, get back to work.

601
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:05,230
Every dog has its day.

602
01:08:34,699 --> 01:08:37,034
I'm surprised you passed the exam.

603
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:40,705
Good.

604
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:42,498
Thank you, Mr Cao.

605
01:08:42,582 --> 01:08:44,626
What's happening?

606
01:08:45,084 --> 01:08:46,544
Where's your safety harness?

607
01:08:57,222 --> 01:08:58,265
Hurry.

608
01:09:19,954 --> 01:09:20,997
What's going on here?

609
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:25,960
Help!

610
01:09:26,044 --> 01:09:28,171
Come on, give me your hand.

611
01:09:28,254 --> 01:09:30,590
- Stretch out. Give me your hand.
- Be careful.

612
01:09:30,674 --> 01:09:33,218
Hurry, give me your hand.
I've got you.

613
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:40,893
Why haven't these been shifted?
Step on it.

614
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:43,479
What was that? Be careful.

615
01:09:55,616 --> 01:09:56,701
Excuse me.

616
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:00,997
Dicky, you have to come with me.

617
01:10:21,143 --> 01:10:22,895
What?

618
01:10:24,021 --> 01:10:27,066
He's dead.
And it's all because of you.

619
01:10:27,149 --> 01:10:29,235
I tried to save him.

620
01:10:50,924 --> 01:10:56,763
<i>Chinese Language Mid-term Exam</i>

621
01:11:16,868 --> 01:11:19,829
Is this your house, Dicky?

622
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:26,628
Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat something?

623
01:11:39,141 --> 01:11:42,728
Dicky, I've got some news for you.

624
01:11:51,237 --> 01:11:55,116
Your father met with an accident
and passed away.

625
01:12:17,139 --> 01:12:21,477
Dicky, there are many things
beyond our control, okay?

626
01:12:22,228 --> 01:12:25,231
That's enough, Miss Yuan.
I'm going to bed now.

627
01:12:25,314 --> 01:12:29,068
- Please leave.
- Listen to me. Dicky.

628
01:12:29,527 --> 01:12:33,615
- Dicky.
- I'm sorry, Miss Yuan.

629
01:12:34,282 --> 01:12:37,786
I... I'm very tired.

630
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:43,125
I... I need to sleep.

631
01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:47,170
Dicky.

632
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:52,217
My dad won't leave me behind.

633
01:12:54,011 --> 01:12:59,016
He'll be home when I wake up.

634
01:12:59,558 --> 01:13:00,601
I need to sleep now.

635
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,400
Dicky.

636
01:13:21,081 --> 01:13:22,999
Dad.

637
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:19,308
Why aren't you in your pajamas?

638
01:16:33,073 --> 01:16:34,825
What's wrong?

639
01:16:35,575 --> 01:16:39,455
Dad, don't ever leave me.

640
01:16:44,001 --> 01:16:48,631
I'll listen to you. I'll study hard.

641
01:16:48,714 --> 01:16:51,634
I won't brag or get into fights

642
01:16:51,717 --> 01:16:55,346
and I'll become
an asset to society one day.

643
01:16:56,639 --> 01:16:58,474
That's my good boy.

644
01:17:17,786 --> 01:17:19,621
CJ7.

645
01:17:20,998 --> 01:17:22,708
How are you?

646
01:17:28,005 --> 01:17:29,882
What's that sound?

647
01:17:29,966 --> 01:17:31,843
Beats me.

648
01:17:33,261 --> 01:17:34,554
Why are you so tired, CJ7?

649
01:18:28,527 --> 01:18:30,696
What happened to him, Dad?

650
01:18:30,988 --> 01:18:32,614
Maybe the batteries have run out.

651
01:18:32,698 --> 01:18:34,825
It doesn't appear that way.

652
01:18:34,908 --> 01:18:36,660
Well, it's very high-tech.

653
01:20:11,718 --> 01:20:16,556
<i>It's a delightful day at the picnic
organised by the school</i>

654
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,142
<i>before the start of the new semester.</i>

655
01:20:19,226 --> 01:20:24,189
<i>Storm Dragon has fallen in love
and he no longer gets into fights.</i>

656
01:20:32,573 --> 01:20:35,159
<i>But Maggie still
carries a torch for me.</i>

657
01:20:43,417 --> 01:20:46,462
<i>However, Fanny is the one I love.</i>

658
01:20:47,922 --> 01:20:50,216
<i>And she loves me very much too.</i>

659
01:20:56,306 --> 01:20:58,391
<i>But Johnny always takes what's mine.</i>

660
01:20:58,475 --> 01:21:01,728
<i>I'll rat on him to the teacher
and foil his plan.</i>

661
01:21:04,022 --> 01:21:06,984
<i>Every student has a crush.</i>

662
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:09,194
<i>And so does my dad.</i>

663
01:21:22,959 --> 01:21:24,419
It's really a miracle.

664
01:21:24,502 --> 01:21:27,297
When I saw you in the hospital,
you were already...

665
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,507
I was already dead.
But now, I'm as right as rain.

666
01:21:29,591 --> 01:21:31,843
I couldn't figure out why.
Even the doctors were baffled.

667
01:21:31,926 --> 01:21:34,137
And how are you feeling now?

668
01:21:34,221 --> 01:21:36,056
I've been experiencing
a slight problem.

669
01:21:36,139 --> 01:21:37,808
What kind of problem?

670
01:21:37,891 --> 01:21:40,102
I think I'm far too handsome.

671
01:21:43,146 --> 01:21:44,940
That's funny.

672
01:21:46,734 --> 01:21:48,611
It wasn't a joke.

673
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:56,369
<i>It's not easy to win a girl's heart,
but my dad won't give up.</i>

674
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:57,787
<i>He's my hero.</i>

675
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:00,415
You don't think I'm handsome,
Miss Yuan?

676
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:02,667
Take a closer look.

677
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:10,592
<i>And not forgetting you, CJ7.</i>

678
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,344
<i>Ever since you fell
into a deep slumber</i>

679
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:15,263
<i>I've developed the daily habit of
closing my eyes and counting to three</i>

680
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:18,976
<i>hoping that you'll wake up
when I open my eyes again.</i>

681
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:23,105
<i>Why don't you make my wish come true
since I'm so sincere about it?</i>

682
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:30,112
One, two, three.
