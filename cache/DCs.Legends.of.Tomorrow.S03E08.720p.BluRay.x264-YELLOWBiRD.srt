1
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,014
Grey's hit!
We gotta get him out of there.

2
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,935
Where's Barry when you need him?

3
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,189
Just tying up some loose ends.

4
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,409
He's almost at the breach hangar.

5
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,892
If we don't stop him, he's going
to blow up our only ticket home.

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,326
Not to mention us.

7
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,511
Some help with that, please.

8
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,015
No, no, no... No!

9
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,728
Grey, stay down.

10
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,236
Grey! No!

11
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,255
Grey!

12
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,673
Fall back. Fall back!

13
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,729
He did it.

14
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,016
He opened the breach.

15
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,106
Let's go.

16
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,649
Hey.

17
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,733
Barry, the breach is open.
Where are you?

18
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,356
We got to take him out now.

19
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,197
I have an idea.

20
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,426
Throw another lightning bolt.

21
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,450
We already tried that.

22
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,534
Just do it.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now!

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,320
Barry, we need you to hurry up.
Stein's hurt.

25
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,972
All right, we're on the move.

26
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,311
He's alive,
but his condition is critical.

27
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,586
All right, Gideon will fix him.

28
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,021
No, it's too dangerous to move him.

29
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,897
Not if he's Firestorm.

30
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,739
Yeah.

31
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,735
Grey? Grey!

32
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,451
Grey!

33
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:41,786
Come on.

34
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,079
- Thanks for your help.
- We're not done helping yet.

35
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,042
Our enemies
are still on your Earth, Ollie.

36
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,456
Don't call me that.

37
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,754
Give it time, I'll get through
that crusty exterior.

38
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,631
No, you really won't.

39
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,717
I was talking to you.

40
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,231
- Oh, my God.
- Kara.

41
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,249
What are they doing?

42
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,590
This next sound,

43
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,551
metal through a bone,

44
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,347
is my favorite.

45
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,340
I think you should probably
close your eyes.

46
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,843
This will all be over in a minute.

47
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,316
What are you waiting for? Do it.

48
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,576
I'm trying.

49
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,405
I'm trying, but...

50
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,904
Mitts off, Mengele!

51
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,680
- Ray?
- Hi.

52
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,021
How are ya?

53
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,189
I got your SOS.

54
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,139
How was the wedding?

55
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,255
All right, don't worry.
The rest of the Legends are here.

56
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,339
We're busting everybody out.

57
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,123
Wait, we need
someone to lock the time vault.

58
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,114
I got it. You guys
get Kara out of here.

59
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,409
- Be careful.
- Okay.

60
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,889
Okay, I know I'm late to the party,
but why have Nazi doppelgangers

61
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,432
- taken over S.T.A.R. Labs?
- They are from Earth-X.

62
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,350
They hate everybody.
They want to steal Kara's heart.

63
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,865
And they have this giant robot.

64
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,262
Oh. I've actually
fought one of those before.

65
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,023
Little-known fact,
this suit doesn't just shrink...

66
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,047
Ray!

67
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,511
It embiggens.

68
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,712
<i>Attention, all prisoners.</i>

69
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,848
<i>Great news. The cavalry has arrived.</i>

70
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,519
About time.

71
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,043
I knew I could count on you, Pretty.

72
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,683
Did you bring beers?

73
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,065
Better yet, an army.

74
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,109
Who needs an army
when you've got Legends?

75
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,661
We have a problem.

76
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,668
I need you to wake up, Kara.

77
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:46,637
The general

78
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,218
is no longer safe, here.

79
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,343
I'm well aware.

80
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,890
Retreat to the troop carrier

81
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,138
and prepare for the invasion.

82
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,014
- Without you?
- I'm staying.

83
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,139
Supergirl is not leaving here alive.

84
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,734
Do not make it personal.
That is not a good idea...

85
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,233
Are you questioning
your Fuhrer's orders?

86
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:05,865
Of course not,

87
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,741
General.

88
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,245
Stay here. Stay safe.

89
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,744
And I'll be back for you
with her heart.

90
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,378
So, this is Earth-1? Cute.

91
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,716
We need to find Kara.

92
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,919
Then we need to split up.

93
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,382
<i>I've got Supergirl.</i>

94
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,472
I've got group B.

95
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,844
- You're late.
- Oh, don't mind him.

96
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,954
He's just pissy
because he came out of a steel box.

97
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,469
Actually, he's always like this.

98
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,309
What the hell?

99
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:44,945
How much further, Ray?

100
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,316
The <i>Waverider's</i> on the roof.

101
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,095
How do you two know each other again?

102
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,302
- We used to date.
- We used to date.

103
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,612
That's awkward.

104
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,782
Careful.

105
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:52,912
Oliver got the girl.

106
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,076
I got a life adventure
on a time-traveling spaceship.

107
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,795
Step away from her.

108
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,592
There's no way.

109
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,386
My grandparents
didn't survive the Holocaust

110
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,134
so the world could be ruled by Nazis.

111
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,339
So, if you want Kara,

112
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,675
you got to go through me.

113
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,913
Even if you do,
you're not going to win.

114
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,393
Because we will not back down.
We will keep fighting.

115
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,975
So, get the hell off our Earth
while you still can.

116
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,025
As final words go,

117
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,524
those weren't bad.

118
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,569
<i>Lower your weapon.</i>

119
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,666
Or I'll kill her.

120
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,828
This guy is like the Terminator.

121
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,295
Why are you laughing?

122
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:53,096
I just love a good pop culture
reference in a moment of crisis.

123
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,425
Also, that!

124
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,065
Let's kick some ass!

125
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,854
You know,
her neck doesn't seem invulnerable.

126
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:24,994
So, I will say again,

127
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,170
lower your weapon!

128
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,208
- Don't listen to him. Just shoot.
- No! No.

129
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,460
I can save your wife's life.

130
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,511
There's only one way to save me.

131
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,659
<i>We have friends at S. T.A.R. Labs.</i>

132
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,016
There are ways to do this
without hurting Kara.

133
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,102
He's lying.

134
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,678
Do it for the fatherland.
Just kill her!

135
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,436
I thought that jerk
was supposed to be dead.

136
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,532
Hey.

137
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,909
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. You're safe.

138
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,724
- You're safe...
- I shouldn't have said what I said.

139
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,267
What if it was the last thing
we ever said to each other?

140
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,534
It doesn't matter. Nothing matters
except that I love you.

141
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,583
We don't need anything else.
I don't need to get married.

142
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,503
I just want to be with you.

143
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,550
Okay?

144
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,349
Gideon! Fix him!

145
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,629
His pressure is dropping.
We have to stanch the bleeding.

146
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,939
<i>Right away, Dr. Snow.</i>

147
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,272
Jax, relax.

148
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,941
The Professor is going to be fine.
He's a tough bastard.

149
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,662
Jax is hit!

150
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,660
I can't find an entry wound.

151
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,187
Look at their vitals, it must be
because of their connection.

152
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,271
What the hell does that mean?

153
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,581
Even though Jax isn't injured

154
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,631
their life functions
must still be linked somehow.

155
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,817
Well, how do we un-link them?

156
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,841
We can't.

157
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,698
Their connection is the only thing
keeping the Professor alive.

158
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Are you okay?

159
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,638
I can't even begin
to answer that right now.

160
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,849
We should be on our honeymoon.

161
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,900
We should be on a beach
drinking mai tais out of coconuts.

162
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,779
Instead we're on this spaceship

163
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,822
looking for our friends'
evil doppelgangers.

164
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,192
We should have just eloped.

165
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,826
- Kara?
- Alex.

166
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,661
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

167
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,608
- I can't believe they almost...
- I know. I know.

168
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,912
- I thought I lost you.
- Me too.

169
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,794
So much for
getting away from it all, huh?

170
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,095
I should have known better

171
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,368
than to think that a wedding
on another Earth is going to solve

172
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,008
- all of our problems.
- Yeah, but...

173
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,637
You know, fighting the evil versions
of ourselves does kind of put

174
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,562
those problems in perspective,
doesn't it?

175
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,269
Way to see the silver lining.

176
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:00,993
Hey there, friend.

177
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,698
No need to numb
your feelings with alcohol.

178
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,242
Ghost is back.

179
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,919
No. I'm not a ghost.

180
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,043
I'm Leo, Leo Snart from Earth-X.

181
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,753
It's okay, buddy.

182
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,970
I know you're hurting over Firestorm.

183
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,799
Get your hand off me.

184
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,013
What is wrong, partner? Talk to me.

185
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,475
You're not my partner.

186
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,601
You're a gangbanger.

187
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,762
I think you mean "doppelganger."

188
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,851
There was one of you
on my Earth, too.

189
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,058
Rest his soul.

190
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,653
Wait, I'm dead on Planet Nazi?

191
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,155
Let me guess, in a fire?

192
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,109
You just kept going back
into that burning police station.

193
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,321
Till the last officer
had been rescued.

194
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,497
I died

195
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,115
trying to save pigs?

196
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,213
I'm going to be sick.

197
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,215
How are you feeling, Jax?

198
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,672
Don't worry about me.

199
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,842
How's Grey?

200
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,588
I have him sedated.

201
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,088
Don't worry, Gideon and I are doing
everything we can to fix him.

202
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,557
Okay, good.

203
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,363
Still no improvement?

204
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,775
He's getting worse.

205
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,280
Marty or Jax?

206
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,326
Both.

207
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,401
Just can't believe
there's nothing Gideon can do.

208
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,865
Medically speaking, Professor Stein
shouldn't even be alive right now.

209
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,686
The only thing that kept him
from dying is...

210
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,710
Jax,

211
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,835
- bonding with him.
- Yeah.

212
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,004
Jax is basically functioning
as a human life-support machine,

213
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,082
able to keep
the Professor alive, but...

214
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:41,969
Only for so long.

215
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:44,388
Does Jax know?

216
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,635
That he's going to die, too?

217
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,720
I didn't know how to tell him.

218
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,146
It will be okay.

219
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,646
We've got a whole mess
of smart people on this ship.

220
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,415
Somebody is going
to figure out something.

221
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,236
Okay.

222
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,949
Oh, man.

223
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,867
I have just died
and went to geek heaven.

224
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,478
I told you we picked the right guy.

225
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,860
Picked the right guy to do what?

226
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:11,957
Hunt Nazis.

227
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,748
Meet our resident Earth-X expert,

228
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,210
The Ray.

229
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,288
But, you can use my real name,
Ray Terrill.

230
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,193
Your secret identity
is your first name

231
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,753
with a word "The" in front of it?

232
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,927
Yeah.

233
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,415
Why, what's your secret identity?

234
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,722
Mr. Terrific.

235
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,636
Really? It's a little boast-y,
don't you think?

236
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,327
That's just one of
my favorite wrestlers.

237
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,515
Still... You should change your name.

238
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,805
Can we talk about these Nazis?

239
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,104
They vanished, owing to the fact
that they have their own <i>Waverider.</i>

240
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,111
A Nazi <i>Waverider?</i>

241
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,775
Yeah. We had been tracking them
using the radiation signature

242
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,527
given off by Overgirl,
because of her...

243
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,573
Extreme exposure
to the solar radiation.

244
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,867
Are these readings right?

245
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,429
<i>Yeah, of course they're right, why?</i>

246
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,539
Because the trace radiation readings
on here are slowly approaching

247
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,625
the Chandrasekhar limit.

248
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,622
- Which means?
- Overgirl isn't just dying.

249
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,606
Yeah, if she doesn't
get Supergirl's heart,

250
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,123
she will create a supernova
that will destroy the entire Midwest.

251
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,389
Jefferson?

252
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Jefferson.

253
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,593
I need to tell you something.

254
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,443
What? Talk fast.

255
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,776
Because unless you're sedated,
Gideon can't do her thing

256
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,241
to patch you back up.

257
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,534
Can't you see that

258
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,620
I'm dying?

259
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,445
What are you talking about, man?

260
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,364
I'm old, Jefferson.

261
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,700
And, even if I hadn't been shot,

262
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,040
no one lives forever.

263
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,275
Grey, I don't even want to hear
you talking like that, man.

264
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,835
As long as we're connected

265
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,428
I'm nothing more than an anchor
around your neck.

266
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,722
Which is why you must help me.

267
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,184
I don't understand.

268
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,397
Not Cisco's drug.

269
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,685
Gideon resynthesized the liquid.

270
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:04,564
She assures me it will free you
from my body's biology.

271
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,486
And it will free you of mine.

272
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,076
I'm the only thing
that's keeping you alive, man.

273
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,276
You're asking me to kill you, Grey!

274
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,705
I'm asking you to let me die
so that you may live.

275
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,625
Please, hand me the vial.

276
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,254
No.

277
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,168
I know you think

278
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,532
you're strong enough for both of us.

279
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,087
But, unless I do this,
we'll both die.

280
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,546
Then we'll both die. I don't...

281
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:33,807
No.

282
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,386
You have your whole life
ahead of you.

283
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:44,399
And now, it's time
for you to let me go.

284
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,019
But I'm not ready for you to go.

285
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,196
I'm not either.

286
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,567
But, when you think about it,

287
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,067
compared to the cosmos,

288
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,403
one's life is but a blink of an eye.

289
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,870
Really? You're going to lecture me
about astrophysics right now?

290
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,373
Grey, please, don't do this to me.

291
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,670
I can't do this.

292
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,548
You once told me

293
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,717
that I was like your father,
and I said

294
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,804
you were my son.

295
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,427
How could a father do anything less?

296
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,687
- Grey.
- Please.

297
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,939
Please.

298
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,958
Thank you, Jefferson.

299
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,705
Grey, no, don't.

300
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:55,216
Stay with me, please.

301
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,680
I'd prefer not to be alone.

302
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,476
Yeah.

303
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,853
Please,

304
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,813
tell Clarissa and Lily
that I love them.

305
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,651
I promise.

306
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,196
And thank you, Jefferson,

307
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,284
for the adventure of a lifetime.

308
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,833
I hope your life

309
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,793
is long and full of love.

310
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,541
Just as mine has been.

311
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:33,802
Grey.

312
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,054
Grey.

313
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,761
No, no.

314
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,630
Jax?

315
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,265
He did it for me.

316
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,658
Where's Jax?

317
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,800
<i>I'll get it, honey.</i>

318
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,806
Jefferson!

319
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:53,942
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,239
Oh, my...

321
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,690
Oh, no!

322
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,347
How are you holding up?

323
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:25,807
I'll cry at the funeral.

324
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,351
Sara?

325
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,437
I'm fine.

326
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,976
We need to gather everyone.

327
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,376
Overgirl is going to go nuclear
and the Earth-Xers are going to use

328
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,187
their <i>Waverider</i>
to threaten Central City

329
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,643
and leverage us
into surrendering Kara.

330
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,738
How do you know that?

331
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,567
It's exactly what I would do.

332
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,330
I am sorry.

333
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:50,707
For what?

334
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,708
For being so weak.

335
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,044
<i>I've managed to stabilize
her deterioration,</i>

336
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,463
<i>but without a transplant
she'll be dead within an hour.</i>

337
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,716
Quiet!

338
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,301
Now, don't you listen to her.

339
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,012
There is more strength in you

340
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,426
than in this entire planet
of lesser humans combined.

341
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,691
Nice outfit.

342
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,608
Yeah, I didn't want to feel left out.

343
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,369
Where are we
with locating the other <i>Waverider?</i>

344
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,508
We've got a pretty good idea.

345
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,024
We've all heard
of the Chandrasekhar limit, I assume?

346
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,656
The data indicates it's still
in the vicinity of Central City.

347
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,284
Which also indicates that Overgirl
isn't long for this world.

348
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,827
Which means that this world
isn't long for this world.

349
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,126
Failure is not an option.

350
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,877
Losing is not an option.
We are going to win.

351
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,581
And we are going to show these people
that this Earth belongs to us.

352
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:42,962
Great speech.

353
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,532
<i>Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Queen.</i>

354
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,590
<i>But we're being hailed
by a fellow Timeship.</i>

355
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,097
Put it on.

356
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,809
What do you want?

357
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,976
<i>To offer a truce.</i>

358
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,478
In exchange for what?

359
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,555
<i>We will return to our Earth,
peacefully,</i>

360
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,099
<i>if you meet my one demand.</i>

361
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,359
<i>Supergirl comes with us.</i>

362
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,251
Here's another difference
between you and me.

363
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,484
I don't abandon my friends.

364
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,415
All right. Everybody ready to go?

365
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:16,793
Never been more.

366
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,126
We can't bring Marty back,

367
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,234
but we can protect the city he loved,

368
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,917
and the family he left behind.

369
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,425
For the Professor.

370
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:36,807
Now, let's go kick some ass.

371
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,901
<i>Let them run.</i>

372
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,780
We'll turn this city
into a mausoleum.

373
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,781
Kill them all!

374
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,110
Yes, sir!

375
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,200
Excuse me, you can't just
go around roasting people.

376
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,494
- Why not?
- You ever heard of due process?

377
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
Rule of law?

378
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:18,915
No.

379
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,506
I could use a little help here.

380
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,559
I got you covered.

381
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,019
This is just like <i>Star Raiders</i>
on Atari, except it's real!

382
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,729
Cut the chatter, Red 2.
Fly the ship.

383
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,823
Launching torpedo one.

384
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,351
You don't have to say it out loud.

385
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,726
Okay guys, is it just me
or is this not working?

386
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,186
- It's not working.
- It's not working.

387
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,650
You need to take down their shields.

388
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,818
Guys, this isn't working.
I think we need a bigger gun.

389
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,654
Way ahead of you.

390
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,073
General, we've got inbound.

391
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,408
Then fire countermeasures.

392
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:20,912
We can't.

393
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,953
It's hovering directly off our bow.

394
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,455
General, you care to step outside?

395
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,124
Waiting for some good news here.

396
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,908
I don't have any for you, man. The
only way to take out their shields

397
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,594
is to get someone
onboard that ship.

398
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:44,644
We're on our way.

399
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,619
We're on the bridge, Felicity.

400
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,459
But we don't know
what we're looking for.

401
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,989
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm working on it.

402
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,363
Felicity's got it.
I'm sending you the source code

403
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,489
for their deflector shields.

404
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,596
Yeah, got it.
Manual override protocol.

405
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,800
If I am reading this correctly
all you need to do now is...

406
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,934
Hit the big blinking red button.

407
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,572
Got it. Shields are down.

408
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,856
- Think you can handle this bad boy?
- Walk in the park.

409
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,319
- Thanks.
- Where are you going?

410
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,770
Getting our friends off that ship.

411
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,278
On the count of ten,
hit them with everything we've got.

412
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,497
You got it.

413
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,001
Come on, Ramon.

414
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,519
Nailed it!

415
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,983
Go on. End it.

416
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,820
End it!

417
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:03,616
What's stopping you?

418
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,905
Oh, I forgot.

419
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,370
Barry Allen is above killing.

420
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,865
Isn't that right?

421
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:16,504
Get out of here.

422
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,340
I wonder what face I'll be wearing
next time we meet,

423
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,180
Flash.

424
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:27,682
Can't wait.

425
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,897
<i>I'm detecting dangerously high
radiation levels.</i>

426
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,544
Disembodied computer voice lady
is right.

427
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,150
Supergirl X is about to go supernova.

428
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,688
Supergirl? Your doppelganger
is about to have a meltdown.

429
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,788
What do I do?

430
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:52,205
You need to fly her up.

431
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,290
Up and away.

432
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,584
Now.

433
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,977
No!

434
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:23,982
I'm going to kill you!

435
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,940
How did you...

436
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,000
Figured it would take the Man
of Steel to catch the Girl of Steel.

437
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,895
That and, you know,
a tremendous amount of help.

438
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,291
Thank you, both.
This world owes you a lot.

439
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,963
Well, it's my world, too, so...

440
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,712
Punching out Nazis
is kind of our thing.

441
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,419
Well, if you ever need us
to do any punching over on Earth-X

442
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,254
- just let us know.
- Will do.

443
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,260
- Take care, Barry.
- Take care, Ray.

444
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,467
Barry, I need a hug.

445
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Okay.

446
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,563
- Be good, Leo.
- Always.

447
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,353
I'm going to get ready. You got this?

448
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,443
Yeah.

449
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,237
All right, fellas.

450
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,820
- You ready to go home?
- Sure.

451
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,193
So, how does this thing work?

452
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,318
Oh. It's a very complex
two-part process.

453
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,996
One, I open a breach.
Two, you walk through it.

454
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,123
Cool.

455
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,130
Leo?

456
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,497
I think I'm going to stick around
here for a little while.

457
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,760
I...

458
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,340
I won't stay here forever.

459
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,970
I will come home to you.

460
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:16,559
Promise.

461
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:18,936
Okay.

462
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,475
- I love you.
- I love you.

463
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,044
Clarissa asked me to say

464
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,802
a few words.

465
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:56,222
But, as you all know,
it was Grey, Martin,

466
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,307
who was the wordy one.

467
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,595
But I got used to hearing his voice

468
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,436
inside my head.
And, even now, I can still hear him.

469
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,902
Because, even though he's gone,
he's still a part of me.

470
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,648
<i>He's still a part of all of us.</i>

471
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:17,489
He was the best man
right until the end.

472
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,696
The best teacher,

473
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:23,918
friend,

474
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:26,962
husband,

475
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,714
<i>father.</i>

476
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Clarissa,

477
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,097
I'm so, so sorry.

478
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,719
I couldn't save him.

479
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,970
All he wanted was to come home

480
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,065
to you,

481
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,773
<i>and you and Ronnie.</i>

482
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,652
To his family.

483
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:51,904
Oh, Jefferson,

484
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,605
you were his family, too.

485
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,408
I just... I don't know how to do
any of this without him.

486
00:33:58,662 --> 00:33:59,662
Well, then don't.

487
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,079
You said it yourself,

488
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,789
he's still part of you.

489
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,330
That's it, big guy, let it out.

490
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,175
Allergies.

491
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,554
Goodbye, my love.

492
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,760
Thank you for believing in me.

493
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,227
Tell Ronnie I miss him.

494
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,306
Thank you for bringing me
home to her.

495
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:50,583
So, you're going to another Earth
and I'm going to another time.

496
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,400
Yeah, that's kind of
how we roll, huh?

497
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,006
Totally normal.

498
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,424
- Should we...
- Should we...

499
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,929
It's a hug thing, okay.

500
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,016
Okay.

501
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,222
Thank you for putting things
in perspective for me.

502
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,313
Does that mean you are going
to take my advice on Maggie?

503
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,982
Yes, I'm going to trust my instincts.

504
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,479
I mean, there has got to be
somebody else out there for me.

505
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,146
- Right?
- For sure.

506
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,200
Just like there's somebody else
out there for you.

507
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,738
And for more than just a night.

508
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,366
It's funny. That was my takeaway too.

509
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:25,623
<i>Boss.</i>

510
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,249
The ship's ready.

511
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,747
Catch you on the other side.

512
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,339
You hit that?

513
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,174
Shut up.

514
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,063
Are you ready?

515
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,434
So, so ready.

516
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,727
Yeah.

517
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,890
Thank you, guys, for everything.

518
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,194
And thanks for inviting us
to your wedding.

519
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,527
And I'm sorry it didn't turn out
the way you wanted it to.

520
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,742
Well, at least it was memorable.

521
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,072
Yes.

522
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,903
We'll be back out for the do-over.

523
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,989
Iris and I talked about it...

524
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,747
And, yeah. We're just going to
get ourselves a justice of the peace,

525
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,793
and get it done. Quick and simple.

526
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,580
Fewer Nazis that way.

527
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,294
Well, take care, guys.

528
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,637
- Oh...
- Oh, that's good.

529
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,093
Yeah, bring it in.

530
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,603
All right.

531
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,274
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

532
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,881
You guys are really not going to
have a wedding now,

533
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,905
after all that?

534
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,189
- Now she's pro-wedding.
- Hey!

535
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,344
Well, I mean,
we've already had the ceremony,

536
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,702
so all we need to do now
is exchange vows and rings.

537
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,654
Hey, can a mayor marry people?

538
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,185
I'm very flattered. But, I think,
that we would have to be within

539
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,326
the limits of Star City
for it to be official.

540
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,870
And we definitely
want it to be official.

541
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,207
Well, if you want it to be personal
I think we know a guy who's ordained.

542
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,371
It's a good thing
I didn't vomit, right?

543
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,431
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

544
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,356
Are you okay?

545
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,605
A little warning next time?

546
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,695
Sorry.

547
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,945
What's up?

548
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,218
You got ordained to marry
your brother and Carly, right?

549
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,242
Yeah?

550
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:29,116
We were hoping that you
could give us the same treatment.

551
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,372
Wow, really?

552
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,451
- I'm honored.
- Yeah?

553
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,625
I am.

554
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,418
All right. Well, let's do it.

555
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,121
Okay, that's great.

556
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,837
I guess, that makes you
the best man, you the maid of honor?

557
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,577
- "Honored" is correct.
- All right. Let's get into position.

558
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,753
- All right.
- You're here.

559
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,429
- Here?
- Over there. Yeah.

560
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,755
- I see.
- That's great.

561
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:50,828
Did you guys write vows
or you just want the boilerplate?

562
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,138
Oh. Uh...

563
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,637
Yes, I...

564
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,274
Wrote mine.

565
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:58,933
I tried to write mine.

566
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,769
But then I realized
that I didn't need to.

567
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,527
My entire life has been marked
by two things.

568
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,486
First one is change.

569
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,576
From when I was a kid
to when I was an adult

570
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,786
things were always changing.

571
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,328
But, no matter
how different things became

572
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,209
or what new challenges I had to face,

573
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,589
I always had the other thing
that my life was marked by.

574
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,347
<i>And that's you.</i>

575
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,346
<i>You've always been there</i>

576
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,766
as a friend,

577
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,478
as a partner,

578
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,812
as the love of my life.

579
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,433
You're my home, Iris.

580
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:45,154
And that's one thing
that will never change.

581
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:49,868
That was really nice.

582
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,080
When I was nine years old
I wanted to be a ballerina,

583
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,333
remember?

584
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,309
Even though I was not
a very good dancer.

585
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,504
And, the day of the recital, I froze.

586
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,216
I couldn't move.

587
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,381
And I wanted to die.

588
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,761
And then I looked in the audience
and I saw you.

589
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,467
And you got up
and climbed on the stage

590
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,050
and you did
that whole routine with me.

591
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:15,936
We killed it.

592
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,851
I mean, we brought the house down.

593
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,147
And from that moment, I knew that

594
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,906
with you by my side
anything was possible.

595
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,698
The Flash may be the city's hero

596
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,904
but you, Barry Allen,

597
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,324
you are my hero.

598
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,836
And I am happy,

599
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,009
excited,

600
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,387
and honored

601
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,053
to be your wife.

602
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,476
Wonderful.

603
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,270
- Well, then I pronounce you both...
<i>- Wait!</i>

604
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,768
Wait. Wait, just one second.

605
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,151
<i>If you guys don't mind...</i>

606
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,692
I mean, if you don't mind.

607
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,065
Really, if you don't mind.
But, would you marry us, too?

608
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,156
Will you marry me?

609
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,818
I thought...

610
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,679
I mean, I thought
you didn't believe in marriage.

611
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,910
No, but I believe in you.

612
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:18,114
And, I believe that no matter
what life throws at us

613
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:22,451
our love can conquer it.
Married, unmarried, I love you.

614
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,254
And my greatest fear...

615
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,714
My greatest fear
in life is losing you.

616
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
- I...
- Yes.

617
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,427
Okay.

618
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,304
Yeah.

619
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,805
I do.

620
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,177
I do.

621
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,095
John, what do you say?

622
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:42,811
Are you kidding me, Oliver?

623
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,710
I'm the guy
for the past six years

624
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,414
who's been trying
to keep you two together.

625
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,969
It's only fitting that I marry you.

626
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:50,906
Okay.

627
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:52,741
Vows?

628
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,825
- No.
- No.

629
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,742
We can't do better than them.

630
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,681
Definitely not. We kind of
did those fake vows when we had

631
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,413
that fake wedding with that
psychopath serial killer archer lady.

632
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,712
I remember saying something
along the lines of...

633
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,628
You're the very best part of me.

634
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,675
Felicity, I'm a better human being

635
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,508
just because I've loved you.

636
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,305
Since we don't have any rings,

637
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,603
just yet,

638
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,574
I'll skip right to the part
where I say this.

639
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,561
Oliver Jonas Queen,

640
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,267
<i>Felicity Megan Smoak,</i>

641
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,856
Bartholomew Henry Allen...

642
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,188
Mmm-hmm.

643
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,277
<i>...and Iris Ann West,</i>

644
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,953
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

645
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,121
Please, kiss your brides.
