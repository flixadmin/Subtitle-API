Hey!

4
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:01,434
It should have been me!

5
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:07,815
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

6
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:11,152
You'll miss the train.

00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:05,081

12
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:47,665
<i><font color="#80ffff">Pleased to meet you. I am Okju.</i></font>

13
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:49,542
<i><font color="#80ffff">This property has three buildings.</i></font>

14
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,836
<i><font color="#80ffff">A Western-style wing designed
by an English architect</i></font>

15
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,338
<i><font color="#80ffff">and a Japanese wing form the main house.</i></font>

16
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:58,342
Not even in Japan is there
a building combining the two styles.

17
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:05,308
It reflects Master's admiration
for Japan and England.

18
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:08,477
Next is the annex

19
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:11,022
which Master had furnished as a library.

20
00:04:11,397 --> 00:04:13,149
Last, the servants' quarters.

21
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:15,568
As the Lady's handmaiden,
you won't sleep there.

22
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:18,613
You may eat her leftover food,

23
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:21,073
but tea leaves go to the kitchen girls.

24
00:04:21,157 --> 00:04:23,367
Used soap and oil are for the steward.

25
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:26,370
Anyone caught stealing
is expelled that day.

26
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:28,748
I'm sure you wouldn't dare, Tamako.

27
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:34,920
"Tamako" is you, by the way.
It's your name Okju in Japanese.

28
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,964
Everything in this household
is Japanese style.

29
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,302
Use only Japanese to Master and the Lady.

30
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:44,972
- Call me Sasaki.
- Yes, ma'am.

31
00:04:48,643 --> 00:04:52,063
I don't trust new handmaidens.

32
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:54,065
Even though they greet you politely,

33
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:57,318
they are always the first to take scrolls
and run away when there's a fire.

34
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:08,537
<i><font color="#80ffff">The Lady's routine is simple.
She takes walks or reads for Master.</i></font>

35
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:13,709
Among the richest men,
Master is the greatest book lover.

36
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:16,962
And among book lovers, he is the richest.

37
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:20,007
<i><font color="#80ffff">His ties to the colonial government

38
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:21,676
In such a home,

39
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,597
you should know what's expected
of a maid like you.

40
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,186
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts.

41
00:05:57,712 --> 00:05:59,004
I sleep in here?

42
00:06:00,715 --> 00:06:03,551
Miss Hideko wakes easily
on account of her nerves.

43
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,095
- She's behind this door?
- Sh!

44
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:07,198
<i><font color="#80ffff">Mother!</i></font>

45
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:13,871

Miss!

48
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,253
Miss, are you alright?

49
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,506
<i><font color="#80ffff">Junko! Is that you?</i></font>

50
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:27,843
Junko was kicked out, Miss.
I'm the new girl.

51
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:30,346
You must have had a bad dream.

52
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:34,016
You see that big cherry tree?

53
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:38,312
My aunt went mad and hanged herself there.

54

<i><font color="#80ffff">Sometimes on moonless nights,</i></font>

<i><font color="#80ffff">dangles from that branch.</i></font>

57
00:08:00,042 --> 00:08:01,669
Here, drink up.

58
00:08:05,548 --> 00:08:10,719
<i><font color="#80ffff">When babies cry,
my auntie feeds them a spoonful of sake.</i></font>

59
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:19,353
<i><font color="#80ffff">Sweet bird, sweet bird</i></font>

60
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:23,399
<i><font color="#80ffff">My sweet bluebird</i></font>

61
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:33,367
<i><font color="#80ffff">What scent is this, that fills my nose?</i></font>

62
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:04,565
Those fuckers.

63
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:08,068
<i><font color="#80ffff">This is Tamako.</i></font>

64
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:11,030
I am at your service, Miss.

65
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,421
A reference letter from Lady Minami,
my last mistress.

66
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,219
So is this place to your liking?

67
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,475
The sun scarcely ever shines here.

68
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:41,393
Uncle won't permit it.

69
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:44,980
<i><font color="#80ffff">Sunlight causes books to fade.</i></font>

70
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:48,609
One could never grow fond
of such a dreary place.

71
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:56,325
Not a good liar, are you?

72
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:01,288
We look alike.

73
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:03,874
Don't you think?

74
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,918
I'll take my leave.

75
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:11,048
My late aunt

76
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,008
and Mrs. Sasaki

77
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:17,262
tried very hard to teach me
of a mother's love.

78
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:20,307
But not really.

79
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:33,278
My head aches
before every reading practice.

80
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:37,825
Would you read it to me?

81
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:40,035
Pardon?

82
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,296
Oh, how kind of her.

83
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,175
Lady Minami said
such nice things about me!

84
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:56,093
Is that so?

85
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,518
You're a Japanese lady,
why don't you speak Japanese?

86
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,186
I'm sick of it.

87
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,772
The books he makes me read
are all Japanese.

88
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:12,401
So read that for me.

89
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:26,457
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

90
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:31,879
Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid.

91
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:34,006
Maids are like...

92
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,050
a spoon... no...

93
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,678
are like chopsticks..."

94
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:46,310
Is it a spoon?

95
00:11:55,819 --> 00:11:57,571
I don't know how to read, Miss.

96
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,826
Not at all? What about Korean?

97
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,437
This is your name. Can't you read it?

98
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:39,196
Reading can be learned,

99
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,616
and I don't care if you curse or steal.

100
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,835
But don't ever lie to me. Understood?

101
00:12:54,837 --> 00:12:55,963
Yes, Miss.

102
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:01,969
She's my mother.

103
00:13:04,972 --> 00:13:07,141
She's beautiful, quite the charmer!

104
00:13:08,142 --> 00:13:10,686
<i><font color="#80ffff">And me? Am I "quite the charmer"?</i></font>

105
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,066
Everyone says
I can't compare to my mother.

106
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:22,614
Count Fujiwara said...

107
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,200
So you've met the Count?

108
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:26,577
Pardon?

109
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,328
No, I've never met him...

110
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:32,082
My aunt! I heard it from my aunt.

111
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,459
She was his nanny.

112
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,171
What did the Count say about me?

113
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:40,716
He said your face...

114
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:46,430
Every night in bed he thinks
of your assets... your face.

115
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:51,643
Why in bed, I wonder?

116
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:57,149
What's with your foot?

117
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:05,532
I've nowhere to go.

118
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:09,661
I've just stayed in this house
since coming to Korea when I was 5.

119
00:14:11,997 --> 00:14:15,792
But in new shoes, even paths
I always take seem different.

120
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,920
The ones from here

121
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:20,797
<i><font color="#80ffff">up to here should fit you.</i></font>

122
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:27,429
Why don't you pick something prettier?
Like this one.

123
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:31,391
It's time for reading practice.

124
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:34,478
<i><font color="#80ffff">- I'll go alone.
- Miss?</i></font>

125
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,271
But it's raining.

126
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:57,334
At noon, come knock on the door. Okay?

127
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:02,047
<i><font color="#80ffff">See you at--</i></font>

128
00:15:40,377 --> 00:15:41,211
This is...

129
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:26,691
My new handmaiden.

130
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,528
The snake, the snake!

131
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:37,744
<i><font color="#80ffff">You mustn't pass that point.</i></font>

132
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,247
Be warned!

133
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:43,333
The snake marks the "bounds of knowledge".

134
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:01,810
He has a habit of licking the pen
when he's thinking hard.

135
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:03,937
He's not a dirty person.

136
00:18:06,022 --> 00:18:09,109
What kind of a handmaiden
uses the umbrella for herself?

137
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:10,026
Pardon?

138
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,404
<i><font color="#80ffff">Miss.</i></font>

139
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,030
<i><font color="#80ffff">Miss!</i></font>

140
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:20,203
<i><font color="#80ffff">Miss.</i></font>

141
00:18:26,793 --> 00:18:28,420
<i><font color="#80ffff">I don't have an upset stomach.
It's okay.</i></font>

142
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:33,091
<i><font color="#80ffff">It's because the books are so boring.</i></font>

143
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:37,095
You must read a ton of books.

144
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:39,347
You must be so knowledgeable.

145
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:51,318
I'm sorry about the prank.

146
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:53,236
I won't do it again.

147
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:55,489
Forgive me.

148
00:19:19,262 --> 00:19:20,180
The Count?

149
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:22,224
Today?

150
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:28,605
No wonder you insisted on a bath.

151
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:31,441
When my aunt heard
a guest was coming,

152
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:34,152
she dropped everything
and bathed her Baby Miss.

153
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:39,449
Nothing made her happier than
when guests praised the baby's scent.

154
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,703
You are my Baby Miss.

155
00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:48,166
Auntie gives babies candy during baths

156
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,335
<i><font color="#80ffff">to teach them how sweet bath time is.</i></font>

157
00:19:51,336 --> 00:19:52,170
What's wrong?

158
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:57,509
One of my teeth must be sharp.
It keeps cutting me.

159
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:44,681
<i><font color="#80ffff">So this was the scent.</i></font>

160
00:21:43,823 --> 00:21:44,908
It's smooth now.

161
00:22:00,715 --> 00:22:01,883
Welcome, sir!

162
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:15,814
You are too kind to greet me
like this upon my arrival,

163
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:19,150
when the journey has left me so unkempt.

164
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:20,568
Now your tedium is over.

165
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:25,365
I'll ensure your painting lessons
are stimulating.

166
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:29,786
This must be Okju.

167
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:32,205
At your service, milord.

168
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:36,918
You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position?

169
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,632
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

170
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:46,845
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

171
00:22:46,928 --> 00:22:49,431
<i><font color="#80ffff">Thank you for introducing her.</i></font>

172
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:54,269
<i><font color="#80ffff">You found the perfect maid for me.</i></font>

173
00:22:56,813 --> 00:23:00,316
It was tough looking for one
that wasn't chubby.

174
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:04,487
Take care of the lonely lady.

175
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:06,781
Here.

176
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:30,346
Count Fujiwara asks Miss Hideko
to kindly allow her maid Tamako

177
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,017
to be sent to his Lordship
for a brief errand.

178
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,944
Did you call for me, milord?

179
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:45,862
<i><font color="#80ffff">You may enter.</i></font>

180
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:27,862
You tried to fool me with a fake coin.

181
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:29,447
How dare you?

182
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:39,123
<i><font color="#80ffff">You think I'm Tamako,
a poor Korean handmaiden.</i></font>

183
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,544
<i><font color="#80ffff">But my real name is Nam Sookee.</i></font>

184
00:24:43,086 --> 00:24:49,217
<i><font color="#80ffff">Raised by Miss Boksun,
top purveyor of stolen goods.</i></font>

185
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,555
<i><font color="#80ffff">I was able to tell a real coin
from a fake when I was 5.</i></font>

186
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:56,724
<i><font color="#80ffff">Then learned to forge stamps from Gugai,</i></font>

187
00:24:56,808 --> 00:25:00,395
<i><font color="#80ffff">and pickpocketing from Kutan,</i></font>

188
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:04,524
<i><font color="#80ffff">but these babies will never
learn such useful skills.</i></font>

189
00:25:05,316 --> 00:25:07,610
<i><font color="#80ffff">Abandoned as newborns,</i></font>

190
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:10,822
<i><font color="#80ffff">we'll wash and feed them,
then sell them to Japan.</i></font>

191
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:13,116
<i><font color="#80ffff">What meaningful work.</i></font>

192
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:17,537
<i><font color="#80ffff">Instead of starving, they grow up
to be rich gentlemen and ladies.</i></font>

193
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:23,293
<i><font color="#80ffff">Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid.
I wouldn't be so miserly.</i></font>

194
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:28,715
<i><font color="#80ffff">I wish my breasts gave milk.
I'd breastfeed all of them.</i></font>

195
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:39,267
<i><font color="#80ffff">Count!</i></font>

196
00:26:09,714 --> 00:26:12,759
I'll tell you the story of an interpreter,

197
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,848
who bribed his way
into translating for high officials.

198
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:23,937
After helping Japan annex Korea,
he got rights to a gold mine.

199
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:26,898
<i><font color="#80ffff">Now he wants to turn fully Japanese.</i></font>

200
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:30,944
So he gets naturalized,

201
00:26:31,736 --> 00:26:34,822
marries the daughter
of a fallen Japanese noble,

202
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:38,701
and adopts his wife's family name Kouzuki.

203
00:26:39,953 --> 00:26:44,207
Ba... bas...

204
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:49,295
That bastard builds a mansion,
fills it with books and antiques.

205
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:54,842
He invites Japanese collectors
to his library,

206
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:58,972
<i><font color="#80ffff">holds readings of rare books,
and auctions the books off.</i></font>

207
00:26:59,472 --> 00:27:02,350
He loves books and paintings
like his own flesh,

208
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:03,851
<i><font color="#80ffff">but he can't help parting with a few.</i></font>

209
00:27:04,352 --> 00:27:07,855
What to do, when he must sell,
but can't bear to?

210
00:27:07,939 --> 00:27:09,399
He sells a fake.

211
00:27:12,694 --> 00:27:17,448
He seeks out a specialist
to create intricate forgeries.

212
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:20,243
Unlike him, this specialist...

213
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:22,787
is a real Japanese of noble birth!

214
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:27,750
Count Fujiwara from Nagoya.

215
00:27:29,585 --> 00:27:32,547
<i><font color="#80ffff">So, who is this?</i></font>

216
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:36,467
It's the wife. His Japanese wife.

217
00:27:38,177 --> 00:27:40,847
- You'll seduce her--
- Is she pretty?

218
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,725
The Jap wife died ages ago
with no children.

219
00:27:44,392 --> 00:27:48,896
But the dead wife's
dead sister's living daughter

220
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,440
performs those book readings.

221
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:51,733
But is she pretty?

222
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,402
She's an orphan. Her father was rich.

223
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:58,781
Soon she'll fall in love with me,
and we'll elope to Japan.

224
00:27:59,198 --> 00:28:00,658
After marrying her there

225
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,705
and inheriting her fortune,
I'll declare her insane

226
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:07,749
and lock her up in a madhouse.

227
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:09,042
<i><font color="#80ffff">Right!</i></font>

228
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:13,296
<i><font color="#80ffff">Sookee will be my mouse,
work as her maid,</i></font>

229
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:15,798
eavesdrop on her sleeptalking,

230
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:17,383
and hand her over to me.

231
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:22,972
Stay by her side during the day
and gently persuade her to fall in love.

232
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:24,640
<i><font color="#80ffff">Love?</i></font>

233
00:28:25,475 --> 00:28:27,101
<i><font color="#80ffff">What does a crook know about love?</i></font>

234
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:35,860
What about her fortune?
Is she rich for sure?

235
00:28:36,944 --> 00:28:40,615
<i><font color="#80ffff">Every night in bed
I think of her assets.</i></font>

236
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:43,910
<i><font color="#80ffff">1.5 million in cash. 300,000 in bonds.</i></font>

237
00:28:47,288 --> 00:28:50,291
The uncle is just a guardian.
It's Hideko's fortune.

238
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:54,087
That's why Kouzuki
schemes to marry the girl.

239
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:56,839
To his w... wife's niece?

240
00:28:57,423 --> 00:28:58,633
What a s... sick f... f...

241
00:28:58,716 --> 00:29:00,301
Right, a sick fuck.

242
00:29:02,136 --> 00:29:04,597
So what's our share?

243
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,725
I'll share 50,000.

244
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:10,019
Sookee also gets
the dresses and jewellery.

245
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:12,730
I'll do it! Take me!

246
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:15,983
My Japanese is better,
and I've worked as a maid before!

247
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:31,332
On top of the fifty,

248
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:37,088
I get dresses, jewellery
and my own 100,000.

249
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:43,094
B... b... beautiful!

250
00:29:43,177 --> 00:29:46,013
I... I... I'm utterly speechless
in your presence!

251
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,893
If you stutter like that
and make your face go red,

252
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:53,563
those uppity bitches will feel superior,

253
00:29:53,646 --> 00:29:55,648
and then they'll open up to you,
all right?

254
00:29:55,731 --> 00:29:57,441
Now, how to make your face go red.

255
00:29:57,525 --> 00:30:00,027
Listen carefully. Breathe in,

256
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:02,321
pull in your stomach,

257
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:05,366
pull your chin down
and tighten your butthole,

258
00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:07,743
then hold your breath
and swallow your saliva ten times.

259
00:30:08,244 --> 00:30:09,078
Get it?

260
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:11,414
Let's just try it.

261
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:29,640
Would you like to wear a navy kimono
with white peonies

262
00:30:29,724 --> 00:30:32,143
or a black kimono with cranes?

263
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:36,355
Would you like to wear
a caterpillar patterned poop color

264
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:38,858
or a poop patterned caterpillar color?

265
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:42,653
<i><font color="#80ffff">Don't ask! If you ask a question,
she'll start to think.</i></font>

266
00:30:43,154 --> 00:30:45,656
You think, and she doesn't.

267
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,909
That's how you control the Miss.

268
00:30:47,992 --> 00:30:48,993
All right?

269
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:49,911
All right.

270
00:30:54,707 --> 00:30:56,751
Here's the letter. Pay attention.

271
00:31:00,171 --> 00:31:02,131
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

272
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:07,011
Count Fujiwara has informed me
of your urgent need for a maid.

273
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:10,932
A maid is like a pair of chopsticks.

274
00:31:11,015 --> 00:31:15,311
Her presence is little noted, but
her absence causes much distress."

275
00:31:17,396 --> 00:31:21,108
<i><font color="#80ffff">Did my mom cry before they hanged her?</i></font>

276
00:31:21,734 --> 00:31:23,903
<i><font color="#80ffff">Women who stole once</i></font>

277
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:28,199
and got hanged cried.

278
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:29,992
They cried a lot.

279
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:36,290
Your mother stole a thousand times,

280
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:40,002
was caught just once and died once.

281
00:31:41,963 --> 00:31:43,089
Did she cry?

282
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,053
She laughed.

283
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:52,974
Said she was lucky
to have you before dying

284
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:55,351
and that she had no regrets.

285
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:00,898
You will surely become a brave thief.

286
00:32:13,327 --> 00:32:15,288
It should have been me!

287
00:32:16,706 --> 00:32:22,795
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

288
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:35,391
Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo,

289
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:39,145
how you'll be an even greater thief
than your mother.

290
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:41,856
Who believes the words of a swindler?

291
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:47,695
When I give the signal,
"fully ripe",

292
00:32:47,778 --> 00:32:49,822
arrange for her and me to be alone.

293
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:51,907
Then I'll gobble her up to the pit.

294
00:32:51,991 --> 00:32:55,244
She's so naive
she wouldn't know what a man wants

295
00:32:55,328 --> 00:32:57,705
even if he pulled on her nipples.

296
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,916
<i><font color="#80ffff">So it's your job to tell her</i></font>

297
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,170
<i><font color="#80ffff">that everything is because of me.</i></font>

298
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,423
"Oh my, since the Count arrived,

299
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:10,176
your toenails are growing much faster!"

300
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:13,304
<i><font color="#80ffff">That sort of thing, all right?</i></font>

301
00:33:14,847 --> 00:33:15,806
Here, a gift.

302
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:30,529
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

303
00:33:32,156 --> 00:33:34,867
<i><font color="#80ffff">That'll be mine
when she goes to the madhouse.</i></font>

304
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,372
<i><font color="#80ffff">It pains my heart to see this poor girl.</i></font>

305
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:41,999
Have you ever seen sapphires so blue?

306
00:33:45,795 --> 00:33:47,421
Let's take a look...

307
00:33:49,673 --> 00:33:53,177
This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel.

308
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:58,974
It's all right, Miss.
Spinels are expensive too.

309
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,435
How do you know?

310
00:34:02,228 --> 00:34:06,399
Oh, my Auntie...
I mean, Lady Minami taught me.

311
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:08,776
But it's fine!

312
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:10,444
There's no need to be ashamed at all.

313
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:13,114
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

314
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:14,156
Is that so?

315
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:31,590
<i><font color="#80ffff">Of all the things
I've washed and dressed,</i></font>

316
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:34,552
<i><font color="#80ffff">has anything been this pretty?</i></font>

317
00:34:36,804 --> 00:34:39,098
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'd like to show her
to the people at home.</i></font>

318
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:41,976
<i><font color="#80ffff">What would they say?</i></font>

319
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:45,771
<i><font color="#80ffff">Probably this?</i></font>

320
00:34:49,191 --> 00:34:50,359
Mesmerizing!

321
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:54,113
S... spellbindingly beautiful!

322
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:02,079
<i><font color="#80ffff">He's shameless.</i></font>

323
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:10,713
The Count kept offering me wine.

324
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:18,846
<i><font color="#80ffff">Does it feel okay?</i></font>

325
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:23,058
It's suffocating.
How do ladies wear such things?

326
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:25,519
You think this is suffocating?

327
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,898
Miss, you're killing me!

328
00:35:32,776 --> 00:35:35,488
<i><font color="#80ffff">Dressed up, you look like a lady too.</i></font>

329
00:35:40,284 --> 00:35:41,702
I think I know

330
00:35:43,537 --> 00:35:45,372
what the Count meant.

331
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:48,542
Your face...

332
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:51,962
Every night in bed,

333
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,965
I think of your face.

334
00:35:58,844 --> 00:36:00,513
Don't be silly, Miss.

335
00:36:08,312 --> 00:36:10,689
<i><font color="#80ffff">Ladies truly are the dolls of maids.</i></font>

336
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:16,195
<i><font color="#80ffff">All these buttons are for my amusement.</i></font>

337
00:36:17,363 --> 00:36:19,782
<i><font color="#80ffff">If I undo the buttons
and pull out the cords,</i></font>

338
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,828
<i><font color="#80ffff">then the sweet things within,</i></font>

339
00:36:25,496 --> 00:36:27,831
<i><font color="#80ffff">those sweet and soft things...</i></font>

340
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:34,713
<i><font color="#80ffff">If I were still a pickpocket
I'd slip my hand inside...</i></font>

341
00:37:07,997 --> 00:37:11,667
Miss, are you truly going
to marry your uncle?

342
00:37:15,421 --> 00:37:19,425
That's what he raised me for,
knowing he'd need my fortune.

343
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:22,720
<i><font color="#80ffff">There's a famous collector in France.</i></font>

344
00:37:22,803 --> 00:37:26,098
He'll be putting his entire library up
for auction.

345
00:37:26,181 --> 00:37:28,892
<i><font color="#80ffff">The gold mine's proceeds
won't cover the cost.</i></font>

346
00:37:31,645 --> 00:37:35,316
If it were me, I'd sell books to buy gold,
not the opposite.

347
00:37:37,484 --> 00:37:40,696
Have you ever thought of
marrying someone else?

348
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:42,489
<i><font color="#80ffff">Like Count Fujiwara, for example--</i></font>

349
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:45,868
You're very nosy for a handmaiden.

350
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:15,189
<i><font color="#80ffff">For now,</i></font>

351
00:38:15,606 --> 00:38:17,733
<i><font color="#80ffff">the Lady needn't go read
to the sick fuck,</i></font>

352
00:38:17,816 --> 00:38:19,777
<i><font color="#80ffff">who wants to marry his wife's niece.</i></font>

353
00:38:21,904 --> 00:38:26,241
<i><font color="#80ffff">Instead the fake Count goes
to the Library to make fake books.</i></font>

354
00:38:30,245 --> 00:38:33,999
<i><font color="#80ffff">The Lady waits for her
2 o'clock art class,</i></font>

355
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,376
<i><font color="#80ffff">and waits...</i></font>

356
00:38:37,753 --> 00:38:39,963
<i><font color="#80ffff">Poor girl,</i></font>

357
00:38:40,047 --> 00:38:42,424
<i><font color="#80ffff">losing her heart to a fake.</i></font>

358
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:18,752
<i><font color="#80ffff">Please, Count!</i></font>

359
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:13,474
Sorry to be late.

360
00:40:14,183 --> 00:40:15,517
It's fine.

361
00:40:23,734 --> 00:40:28,030
Maybe I need more practice
to give it dimensionality.

362
00:40:28,113 --> 00:40:30,616
Dimensionality... perhaps.

363
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:34,119
Nonetheless, you have a vision
that transcends mere skill.

364
00:40:34,703 --> 00:40:37,873
<i><font color="#80ffff">It's as if you see directly
into an object's essence.</i></font>

365
00:40:38,874 --> 00:40:42,961
For example, the fact that this peach
contains a lot of water.

366
00:40:44,046 --> 00:40:46,507
I hesitate to stand before you,

367
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,675
for fear that you might read my thoughts.

368
00:41:03,857 --> 00:41:05,150
That's enough for today.

369
00:41:12,074 --> 00:41:13,617
Almost fully ripe.

370
00:41:14,868 --> 00:41:15,702
<i><font color="#80ffff">Already?</i></font>

371
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:21,625
<i><font color="#80ffff">Damn...</i></font>

372
00:41:25,712 --> 00:41:26,880
Do you know what?

373
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:30,676
Since the Count arrived,
your cheeks have grown flushed.

374
00:41:30,759 --> 00:41:31,677
Have they?

375
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:40,519
How did your mother die?

376
00:41:42,145 --> 00:41:47,067
When I was a baby,
at a big house, she was hanged...

377
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,113
- I mean, she hanged--
- Hanged herself like my aunt, huh?

378
00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:53,657
Well, pretty much.

379
00:42:01,373 --> 00:42:05,586
She must have often hugged you
when she was alive, right?

380
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:13,969
My mother died giving birth to me.

381
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:21,852
So it's as if I strangled her myself.

382
00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:26,481
I wish I'd never been born.

383
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:33,280
No baby is ever guilty of being born.

384
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:36,742
If your mother thought
you could understand

385
00:42:36,825 --> 00:42:39,077
this is what she'd have said.

386
00:42:40,203 --> 00:42:43,498
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying,

387
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,168
that she had no regrets.

388
00:42:53,216 --> 00:42:54,927
Wait here a moment, Miss.

389
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,721
I'll go pick mushrooms.

390
00:42:59,973 --> 00:43:02,851
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

391
00:43:02,935 --> 00:43:04,436
I'll go with you.

392
00:43:05,604 --> 00:43:06,855
I'll be quick.

393
00:43:07,814 --> 00:43:08,857
Before it rains.

394
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:19,326
Good girl--

395
00:43:24,665 --> 00:43:26,667
<i><font color="#80ffff">What a coincidence.</i></font>

396
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:28,335
<i><font color="#80ffff">Indeed.</i></font>

397
00:43:28,794 --> 00:43:30,045
<i><font color="#80ffff">May I sit next to you?</i></font>

398
00:43:57,322 --> 00:44:00,075
<i><font color="#80ffff">The lady sits, shy and trembling.</i></font>

399
00:44:00,158 --> 00:44:02,995
<i><font color="#80ffff">The gentleman is persistent.</i></font>

400
00:44:03,787 --> 00:44:07,457
<i><font color="#80ffff">The perceptive maid
has stepped out for a moment.</i></font>

401
00:44:08,709 --> 00:44:10,961
<i><font color="#80ffff">All is well, Sookee.</i></font>

402
00:44:11,753 --> 00:44:14,756
<i><font color="#80ffff">Everyone's performing
their roles so damned well.</i></font>

403
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:17,592
<i><font color="#80ffff">Damn.</i></font>

404
00:44:23,432 --> 00:44:25,600
You know servants can't use this entrance!

405
00:44:34,443 --> 00:44:35,277
Hey!

406
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:43,660
<i><font color="#80ffff">I wish I'd never come here.</i></font>

407
00:44:46,496 --> 00:44:48,373
<i><font color="#80ffff">It was wrong to come.</i></font>

408
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:53,045
Tamako, you brought watercolors, right?

409
00:44:54,046 --> 00:44:55,881
Of course, milord!

410
00:44:55,964 --> 00:44:57,382
Watercolor paints and brushes--

411
00:44:57,466 --> 00:44:59,551
Go and get the oils.

412
00:44:59,634 --> 00:45:03,138
A day like this demands oils!

413
00:45:26,036 --> 00:45:27,079
Shit!

414
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,627
Lady!

415
00:45:35,504 --> 00:45:37,047
Milord!

416
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:52,062
Lady...

417
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:16,419
<i><font color="#80ffff">A blackout! Bring a lantern.</i></font>

418
00:46:35,063 --> 00:46:37,566
<i><font color="#80ffff">I need to think.</i></font>

419
00:46:38,483 --> 00:46:40,402
<i><font color="#80ffff">I need to become rich,</i></font>

420
00:46:40,777 --> 00:46:45,115
<i><font color="#80ffff">sail off to a distant harbor,
eat food I scarcely recognize,</i></font>

421
00:46:45,198 --> 00:46:47,909
<i><font color="#80ffff">buy my fill of glittering baubles,
and...</i></font>

422
00:46:48,577 --> 00:46:50,120
<i><font color="#80ffff">not think of Hideko.</i></font>

423
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:53,206
<i><font color="#80ffff">Never think of Hideko--</i></font>

424
00:47:21,401 --> 00:47:23,445
<i><font color="#80ffff">I returned
and you didn't even come to me.</i></font>

425
00:47:24,863 --> 00:47:27,449
It was late, I must have fallen asleep.
My apologies.

426
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:32,037
You know how hard it is
to do those readings?

427
00:47:32,996 --> 00:47:35,999
Must I remove my makeup
and change all by myself?

428
00:47:37,209 --> 00:47:39,211
I feel a nightmare coming. Sleep here.

429
00:48:05,237 --> 00:48:06,863
He proposed to me.

430
00:48:10,408 --> 00:48:11,660
On the 15th,

431
00:48:13,245 --> 00:48:17,249
when my uncle visits his mine,
he wants to elope to Japan.

432
00:48:20,293 --> 00:48:21,962
What did you say?

433
00:48:24,965 --> 00:48:26,675
I said I wasn't sure.

434
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:27,592
Why?

435
00:48:28,593 --> 00:48:29,427
I'm scared.

436
00:48:30,595 --> 00:48:31,846
Of your uncle's anger?

437
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:35,433
Of the Count.

438
00:48:38,103 --> 00:48:40,689
What's to be scared of? He's so kind.

439
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:45,318
I don't know, I just feel it.

440
00:48:49,572 --> 00:48:52,242
It's like the reflex of pulling
your hand back from a flame.

441
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,205
Tell me...

442
00:49:05,964 --> 00:49:07,841
What is it that men want?

443
00:49:11,553 --> 00:49:12,387
Pardon?

444
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:17,309
I mean after getting married, at night...

445
00:49:21,146 --> 00:49:24,024
How would I know?
I'm practically a child

446
00:49:24,107 --> 00:49:27,986
with no mother.
There's no one here to...

447
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:35,035
First.

448
00:49:37,662 --> 00:49:39,205
I guess we'd kiss?

449
00:49:42,334 --> 00:49:43,168
And?

450
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,880
He would hold you in his arms.

451
00:49:47,714 --> 00:49:48,548
Standing?

452
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:53,219
Only when there's nowhere to lie down
or you're in a hurry.

453
00:49:53,303 --> 00:49:56,181
Normally you do it on the bed.

454
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,892
You'll know when it happens.

455
00:49:58,975 --> 00:50:01,019
It's just like drinking
for the first time.

456
00:50:01,102 --> 00:50:02,270
When it happens?

457
00:50:06,107 --> 00:50:06,941
But...

458
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:10,779
Could someone be like a blind person,

459
00:50:11,529 --> 00:50:15,408

<i><font color="#80ffff">What the hell.</i></font>

<i><font color="#80ffff">Poor thing,</i></font>

463
00:50:24,876 --> 00:50:31,424
<i><font color="#80ffff">alone in a strange country,

467
00:50:59,494 --> 00:51:02,414
<i><font color="#80ffff">the sourness turns sweet,</i></font>

468
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,501
<i><font color="#80ffff">the sweetness turns savoury...</i></font>

469
00:51:06,584 --> 00:51:08,086
How do you know all this?

470
00:51:09,462 --> 00:51:11,297
Do you have experience?

471
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:17,053
My friend Kutan taught me.

472
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,973
Taught you? With words?

473
00:51:20,056 --> 00:51:22,392
Yes, only with words.

474
00:51:41,786 --> 00:51:43,246
So this is how it feels.

475
00:51:43,788 --> 00:51:46,499
That's what you will feel for the Count.

476
00:51:47,584 --> 00:51:48,501
Really?

477
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:50,879
The Count, truly...

478
00:51:53,965 --> 00:51:56,843
He won't think
he's making love to a corpse?

479
00:51:58,803 --> 00:52:01,139
You know about my cold hands and feet.

480
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:02,974
Really?

481
00:52:03,725 --> 00:52:04,559
Here.

482
00:52:13,443 --> 00:52:15,153
It feels just fine.

483
00:52:15,695 --> 00:52:16,529
You like it?

484
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:21,409
Do it to me. I want to know how it feels.

485
00:52:25,914 --> 00:52:30,126
I'm sure he'll want to do this too.

486
00:52:30,752 --> 00:52:31,836
And then...

487
00:52:38,885 --> 00:52:40,553
It's so cute.

488
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:45,225
If the Count sees this...

489
00:52:55,652 --> 00:52:58,571
Will he really be as tender as this?

490
00:52:59,572 --> 00:53:00,740
Of course.

491
00:53:00,823 --> 00:53:03,660
He'll also touch you like this.

492
00:53:04,077 --> 00:53:04,911
<i><font color="#80ffff">And like this...</i></font>

493
00:53:08,873 --> 00:53:11,167
Keep doing what the Count will.

494
00:53:14,379 --> 00:53:17,423
And this is what he'll say.

495
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:23,304
"It's so soft, warm,

496
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:26,849
wet, and...

497
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:31,604
s... s... spellbindingly beautiful!"

498
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,127
<i><font color="#80ffff">Okju.</i></font>

499

<i><font color="#80ffff">Hideko.</i></font>

500
00:54:01,843 --> 00:54:04,220

501

<i><font color="#80ffff">Dad.</i></font>

502
00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:12,437
Now, the model must stay still.

503
00:54:13,271 --> 00:54:16,983
<i><font color="#80ffff">Okju.</i></font>

504
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:24,699
<i><font color="#80ffff">- Hideko...

505
00:54:24,782 --> 00:54:26,200
<i><font color="#80ffff">Stop!</i></font>

506
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:30,496
<i><font color="#80ffff">...doesn't like it,

507
00:54:32,373 --> 00:54:33,458
<i><font color="#80ffff">Stop it!</i></font>

508
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:34,667
I can't do this.

509
00:54:38,796 --> 00:54:39,881
Come here, Tamako.

510
00:54:44,135 --> 00:54:45,720
Find something else to keep you busy.

511
00:54:45,803 --> 00:54:46,929
Do you know what I mean?

512
00:54:57,106 --> 00:54:59,067
I have nothing else to do.

513
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:02,445
My job is to look after the Lady.

514
00:55:13,873 --> 00:55:16,959
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

515
00:55:17,043 --> 00:55:19,045
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

516
00:55:19,128 --> 00:55:20,755
If I miss this chance, I'm finished!

517
00:55:22,215 --> 00:55:24,592
Can you feel it?
How much I want it?

518
00:55:24,676 --> 00:55:29,639
After fighting so hard
to escape my garbage heap of a life,

519
00:55:29,722 --> 00:55:33,226
you think I'll let you ruin it, you bitch?

520
00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:38,564
Shall I tell the Lady
you're nothing but a lowly pickpocket?

521
00:55:38,648 --> 00:55:42,068
Fine, I'll have something to tell her too.

522
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:46,197
That you're nothing but the son
of a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman--

523
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,657
Sookee.

524
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,784
Think of your family at home.

525
00:55:50,201 --> 00:55:53,913
Boksun raising babies with her bad back
and those two idiots.

526
00:55:53,996 --> 00:55:56,332
How will they feel
if you go home empty-handed?

527
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,209
Want to ruin your mother's reputation?

528
00:55:58,668 --> 00:56:00,628
You should go home in glory.

529
00:56:06,175 --> 00:56:09,804
So don't push Hideko too hard.

530
00:56:09,887 --> 00:56:11,264
She's got no one on this earth.

531
00:56:11,347 --> 00:56:14,434
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

532
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:19,021
And please...

533
00:56:20,565 --> 00:56:25,111
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

534
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:35,204
Oh my.

535
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:39,167
Your toenails have grown faster
since the Count arrived.

536
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,752
How curious.

537
00:56:42,211 --> 00:56:46,174
Miss, doesn't it bother you not to know?

538
00:56:47,258 --> 00:56:50,219
How many ships sail on the wide sea,

539
00:56:51,053 --> 00:56:53,347
people leaving, people returning,

540
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,100
those saying farewell
or welcoming people back.

541
00:56:56,601 --> 00:56:58,644
Where is the farthest you've traveled?

542
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:00,188
The hill beyond the manor?

543
00:57:07,195 --> 00:57:11,365
My uncle will chase me wherever I go.

544
00:57:13,868 --> 00:57:16,120
This is how I lived my life.

545
00:57:18,664 --> 00:57:22,543
I could be content here,
if you are with me.

546
00:57:27,882 --> 00:57:30,426
<i><font color="#80ffff">You can walk with me in new shoes,</i></font>

548
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:38,601

549
00:57:41,103 --> 00:57:42,855
You're fortunate, Miss.

550
00:57:43,439 --> 00:57:46,901
The man who loves you
has the power to protect you.

551
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,986
That's rare.

552
00:57:49,987 --> 00:57:54,075
But I'm not sure... if I love him.

553
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:56,452
You do love him.

554
00:58:00,414 --> 00:58:01,791
How do you know?

555
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:05,628
You stare out the window all day,

556
00:58:06,796 --> 00:58:08,881
turn in your sleep and sigh,

557
00:58:11,717 --> 00:58:13,052
and your toenails...

558
00:58:13,135 --> 00:58:14,846
What if I said I don't love him?

559
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:18,975
What if I said that I love someone else?

560

<i><font color="#80ffff">I have no one on this earth...</i></font>

562
00:58:31,696 --> 00:58:33,030
You will love him.

01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:22,739
I am the Lady's handmaiden.

615
01:10:23,156 --> 01:10:24,992
- What's your name?
- It's Tamako.

616
01:10:26,493 --> 01:10:29,204
Then, what kind of treatment

617
01:10:29,955 --> 01:10:32,624
do you believe your Lady requires?

618
01:10:47,055 --> 01:10:50,434
She should be confined in a place

619
01:10:50,517 --> 01:10:56,356
where no one can harm her
and where she can do no harm.

620
01:11:00,986 --> 01:11:05,824
Just a few tests, then let's have
lamb chops at the Peace Hotel.

621
01:11:22,341 --> 01:11:24,301
It's almost over. Good work.

622

What is this?

627

She is the Countess.

It's because her nanny was Korean.

My poor Lady, she's gone nuts.

If it would be of any help,

639

this is from her mother

Put it in your mouth, Hideko.

651

Hold out your hand.

He'll smother you with his giant body,

If I fail, there's a place called
a "mental hospital" in Japan.

Established by rational Germans,

709

it's very effective in treating lunacy.

710
01:19:52,475 --> 01:19:56,229
They dig holes in the dirt,
put a patient in each one,

711
01:19:56,312 --> 01:19:57,730
and put lids on top.

712
01:19:57,814 --> 01:20:00,358
When the patients get better,
they get a leash,

713

so they can crawl around like dogs.

<i><font color="#80ffff">a rope slithered around my neck.</i></font>

770
01:26:14,232 --> 01:26:16,984
<i><font color="#80ffff">The duke slowly tightened the rope.</i></font>

771
01:26:17,401 --> 01:26:22,114
<i><font color="#80ffff">Like a drowning man grasping at straws,</i></font>

772
01:26:22,198 --> 01:26:26,619
<i><font color="#80ffff">I pulled the swirling currents
of her hair.</i></font>

773
01:26:27,787 --> 01:26:30,122
<i><font color="#80ffff">Then the duke spoke.</i></font>

774
01:26:32,667 --> 01:26:35,253
<i><font color="#80ffff">The ten minutes are almost up.</i></font>

775
01:26:45,429 --> 01:26:47,557
Slowly, my dear, said the Duchess...

776
01:26:48,015 --> 01:26:54,772
I haven't yet fully savored his pain.

777
01:27:00,736 --> 01:27:04,282
No, the knight cried, don't stop!

778
01:27:06,409 --> 01:27:09,662
Please let me die

779
01:27:09,745 --> 01:27:11,914
in the midst of this pain.

780
01:27:12,373 --> 01:27:14,834
In this suffocating pain.

781
01:27:58,461 --> 01:27:59,879
Is it Sade?

782
01:28:00,713 --> 01:28:02,381
It's Sade-esque.

783
01:28:02,923 --> 01:28:07,970
<i><font color="#80ffff">It is believed to be the same Japanese man
who wrote The Lizard Skin.</i></font>

784
01:28:08,763 --> 01:28:13,351
It was acquired from a Japanese sailor
on a ship from Hamburg.

785
01:28:23,402 --> 01:28:26,697
Cheap hair and shabby clothes,

786
01:28:27,365 --> 01:28:29,784
old and worn down,

787
01:28:29,867 --> 01:28:33,287
a body foul with food waste
and human secretion.

788
01:28:35,206 --> 01:28:39,710
Can you imagine my joy when

789
01:28:41,003 --> 01:28:44,382
after such a journey,

790
01:28:44,882 --> 01:28:49,261
it sat on my shelf with its brothers?

791
01:28:49,345 --> 01:28:50,680
Even compared with an unopened

792
01:28:50,763 --> 01:28:53,974
first-edition of Milton's,
it wouldn't be outstripped.

793
01:28:55,893 --> 01:28:56,727
That's right.

794
01:28:57,478 --> 01:29:02,316
These are the babes
to whom I feel the most affection.

795
01:29:03,609 --> 01:29:09,573
It used to contain an elaborate
monochrome woodcut illustration,

796
01:29:11,867 --> 01:29:13,327
but as you can see...

797
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:14,745
<i><font color="#80ffff">So unfortunate.</i></font>

798
01:29:16,914 --> 01:29:21,085
If that were intact,
you could've named your price.

799
01:29:22,837 --> 01:29:27,216
The author felt words alone
could not fully describe the positions,

800
01:29:27,299 --> 01:29:31,011
and so included an illustration.

801
01:29:32,388 --> 01:29:35,641
In that regard,
before we start the bidding...

802
01:29:36,559 --> 01:29:37,435
Hideko!

803
01:29:37,935 --> 01:29:40,020
Why don't you show us this scene?

804
01:30:18,434 --> 01:30:21,437
PAIN IS A GARMENT

805
01:31:43,936 --> 01:31:45,312
<i><font color="#80ffff">Beautiful!</i></font>

806
01:31:51,944 --> 01:31:54,071
See you again.

807
01:31:54,572 --> 01:31:56,824
Yes, thank you.

808
01:31:56,907 --> 01:31:59,743
Today's reading was outstanding.

809
01:32:00,411 --> 01:32:01,829
Yes, thank you.

810
01:32:02,538 --> 01:32:05,207
Especially the puppet!

811
01:32:33,485 --> 01:32:35,404
<i><font color="#80ffff">You are of noble birth,</i></font>

812
01:32:35,487 --> 01:32:40,242
<i><font color="#80ffff">yet you engage in the lowly work
of copying paintings.</i></font>

813
01:32:40,326 --> 01:32:43,579
There was a time

814
01:32:43,662 --> 01:32:46,665
when I dissipated my wit and skills
on gambling.

815
01:32:47,166 --> 01:32:50,628
Imagine the torment
of having so many women

816
01:32:50,711 --> 01:32:52,421
make advances on me,

817
01:32:52,504 --> 01:32:55,215
when I couldn't afford
to buy them a glass of Burgundy.

818
01:32:56,967 --> 01:33:00,971
Do the women here make advances on you?

819
01:33:01,805 --> 01:33:03,724
I look at women's eyes,

820
01:33:03,807 --> 01:33:04,975
only the eyes.

821
01:33:05,809 --> 01:33:09,438
<i><font color="#80ffff">They turn their gaze away,</i></font>

822
01:33:09,521 --> 01:33:12,024
<i><font color="#80ffff">but then they always look back.</i></font>

823
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:15,235
It's a silent exchange
of question and answer.

824
01:33:16,195 --> 01:33:21,158
If I were to slide
under someone's covers tonight,

825
01:33:21,241 --> 01:33:25,663
only one woman here would refuse me.

826
01:33:26,789 --> 01:33:28,540
<i><font color="#80ffff">Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?</i></font>

827
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:35,714
Is she not your former wife?

828
01:33:36,215 --> 01:33:39,051
You left her to marry a Japanese woman.

829
01:33:39,551 --> 01:33:43,055
But the servants tell me
you still share a bed with her.

830
01:33:45,557 --> 01:33:48,102
Can I ask you something?

831
01:33:51,271 --> 01:33:52,439
<i><font color="#80ffff">Of course.</i></font>

832
01:33:53,857 --> 01:33:58,529
You went so far as to abandon your wife,
why this urge to become Japanese?

833
01:34:01,156 --> 01:34:02,866
Because Korea is ugly

834
01:34:03,325 --> 01:34:06,161
and Japan is beautiful.

835
01:34:07,329 --> 01:34:10,499
Some Japanese say Japan is ugly,

836
01:34:10,582 --> 01:34:12,084
and Korea is beautiful.

837
01:34:12,668 --> 01:34:15,087
Beauty is cruel by nature.

838
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:19,174
Korea is soft, slow, dull,
and therefore hopeless.

839
01:34:20,509 --> 01:34:24,930
Let's talk about that one woman
who would deny you.

840
01:34:28,308 --> 01:34:32,229
Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?

841
01:34:32,312 --> 01:34:34,314
Mrs. Sasaki...

842
01:34:36,608 --> 01:34:38,193
If I gave her the right signal,

843
01:34:38,277 --> 01:34:42,656
<i><font color="#80ffff">she'd knock on my door
without her underwear.</i></font>

844
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:52,416
My thoughts exactly.

845
01:34:54,585 --> 01:34:55,961
Then who is it?

846
01:34:56,545 --> 01:34:58,714
The one who would deny you?

847
01:35:01,216 --> 01:35:04,136
I heard you own the highest quality

848
01:35:04,219 --> 01:35:07,848
antique bookmaking tools
of the East and West,

849
01:35:08,682 --> 01:35:10,017
but I don't see them here.

850
01:35:10,392 --> 01:35:12,644
I'll show them to you later.

851
01:35:14,104 --> 01:35:19,943
Who is the one person to refuse you?

852
01:35:22,613 --> 01:35:27,326
I met Hideko's eyes by chance,
but she didn't look away.

853
01:35:27,409 --> 01:35:30,704
Indeed it was I, who shifted my gaze.

854
01:35:30,788 --> 01:35:31,872
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hideko,</i></font>

855
01:35:32,498 --> 01:35:38,212
Will she make an appearance
in your lewd dreams tonight?

856
01:35:40,047 --> 01:35:43,133
<i><font color="#80ffff">Even if honored with such a visit,</i></font>

857
01:35:43,717 --> 01:35:46,095
<i><font color="#80ffff">I don't think I could consummate.</i></font>

858
01:35:46,637 --> 01:35:50,557
I would happily regret it
the moment I begin

859
01:35:51,058 --> 01:35:54,353
because her body
would be as cold as a waterfowl.

860
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:01,985
That is the result of long training.

861
01:36:03,779 --> 01:36:07,116
<i><font color="#80ffff">I heard you are engaged to her.</i></font>

862
01:36:11,286 --> 01:36:16,917
<i><font color="#80ffff">If I'm not mistaken,
you are yet to have intercourse?</i></font>

863
01:36:18,043 --> 01:36:20,754
<i><font color="#80ffff">Her eyes have no desire.</i></font>

864
01:36:21,171 --> 01:36:23,715
<i><font color="#80ffff">It means her soul is dead inside.</i></font>

865
01:36:25,676 --> 01:36:27,427
<i><font color="#80ffff">You should go easy on her training,</i></font>

866
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:31,598
<i><font color="#80ffff">unless you enjoy making love
to a corpse.</i></font>

867
01:36:55,122 --> 01:36:56,582
Would you like a smoke?

868
01:37:05,257 --> 01:37:09,094
How did such a noble count

869
01:37:09,178 --> 01:37:13,348
fall into the grouty habit
of smoking cigarettes?

870
01:38:06,944 --> 01:38:10,572
This is my particular way
of possessing beauty.

871
01:38:12,199 --> 01:38:15,702
Hideko too must have received
painting lessons.

872
01:38:16,745 --> 01:38:18,413
No, she did not.

873
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:23,335
I was too occupied teaching her
to read with correct diction.

874
01:38:24,586 --> 01:38:25,587
<i><font color="#80ffff">Is that so?</i></font>

875
01:38:26,088 --> 01:38:28,257
In England, where I studied,

876
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:34,388
all ladies were expected to produce
vibrant color and graceful lines,

877
01:38:35,555 --> 01:38:37,599
even in the less noble families.

878
01:38:56,702 --> 01:38:58,829
You have a phone call, sir.

879
01:38:59,705 --> 01:39:01,498
At this hour?

880
01:39:01,581 --> 01:39:03,250
<i><font color="#80ffff">It's the Iwamura Bookstore.</i></font>

881
01:39:04,251 --> 01:39:05,585
Is that so?

882
01:39:05,669 --> 01:39:07,629
Excuse me a moment.

883
01:39:17,681 --> 01:39:19,224
You are mesmerizing.

884
01:39:21,143 --> 01:39:23,937
Men use the word "mesmerizing"

885
01:39:24,021 --> 01:39:26,982
when they wish to touch a lady's breasts.

886
01:39:27,941 --> 01:39:31,528
I'm familiar
with Western conversational etiquette.

887
01:39:33,739 --> 01:39:36,575
I do a bit of reading, you know.

888
01:39:37,284 --> 01:39:39,202
There was no calculation in what I said.

889
01:39:39,786 --> 01:39:44,207
It was a reflex,
like pulling one's hand from a flame.

890
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:46,668
I'm no flame.

891
01:39:47,419 --> 01:39:50,922
I'm cold as a waterfowl, your Lordship.

892
01:39:56,803 --> 01:39:58,972
He will return soon.

893
01:39:59,056 --> 01:40:01,641
Mr. Iwamura only called
with a frivolous inquiry,

894
01:40:01,725 --> 01:40:03,769
at my request.

895
01:40:03,852 --> 01:40:07,481
There's an issue regarding
your future you should know.

896
01:40:07,564 --> 01:40:10,776
I'll wait by the stone lamp at midnight.

897
01:40:12,569 --> 01:40:15,697
<i><font color="#80ffff">That Iwamura is a real fool.</i></font>

898
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:23,705
Good night, Miss.

899
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:37,237
My maid is asleep in the room next door.

900
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,614
I don't fancy being
in scandalous rumors with you.

901
01:41:39,698 --> 01:41:43,243
<i><font color="#80ffff">I saw Junko go to the servants' quarters
with her pillow.</i></font>

902
01:41:43,326 --> 01:41:45,454
Consider your reputation as a nobleman.

903
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:47,873
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'm no nobleman.</i></font>

904
01:41:47,956 --> 01:41:49,749
<i><font color="#80ffff">I'm not even Japanese.</i></font>

905
01:41:49,833 --> 01:41:52,419
<i><font color="#80ffff">Do you think it was easy for
a Korean farmhand's son to reach here?</i></font>

906
01:41:53,545 --> 01:41:57,048
After fifteen hard years in Japan,
I heard some things about you.

907
01:41:57,549 --> 01:41:59,426
Another three years were spent to prepare.

908
01:42:00,093 --> 01:42:02,971
I studied bookmaking
and learned to paint forgeries.

909
01:42:03,805 --> 01:42:05,849
All so that I could meet you.

910
01:42:06,224 --> 01:42:07,767
To seduce and marry you,

911
01:42:07,851 --> 01:42:10,353
to possess your father's inheritance,

912
01:42:10,979 --> 01:42:12,606
and then probably to get rid of you.

913
01:42:14,733 --> 01:42:16,234
But I knew as soon as I met you.

914
01:42:16,818 --> 01:42:18,653
For a man to seduce you would be--

915
01:42:21,198 --> 01:42:22,282
...impossible.

916
01:42:24,075 --> 01:42:27,412
So in place of seduction,
I decided to propose a deal.

917
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:32,375
Most marriages are like being imprisoned,
but this one will free you.

918
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:35,045
I'll rescue you from here,

919
01:42:35,128 --> 01:42:38,590
take you far away, and give you freedom.

920
01:42:40,091 --> 01:42:42,260
Of course, we'll split the money.

921
01:42:43,470 --> 01:42:44,846
Nonsense.

922
01:42:45,889 --> 01:42:48,808
Does marrying an old man
with a black tongue

923
01:42:49,226 --> 01:42:50,352
at your tender age makes sense?

924
01:42:50,435 --> 01:42:52,562
I won't marry anyone.

925
01:42:52,646 --> 01:42:53,980
What have you in mind?

926
01:42:59,945 --> 01:43:01,404
That's not proper.

927
01:43:01,947 --> 01:43:03,114
There's no beauty in that.

928
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:05,992
If you kill yourself,
what of your fortune?

929
01:43:06,743 --> 01:43:10,914
That will be the sum of your efforts?
Your fortune going to that pervert?

930
01:43:11,581 --> 01:43:14,876
So he can buy 10 little girls
and teach them to read books?

931
01:43:16,962 --> 01:43:19,172
My uncle will find us somehow.

932
01:43:19,589 --> 01:43:21,007
Then he'll take us to the basement.

933
01:43:22,133 --> 01:43:23,218
Uncle.

934
01:43:24,344 --> 01:43:25,262
The basement?

935
01:43:25,345 --> 01:43:28,640
<i><font color="#80ffff">It says here when people are hanged,</i></font>

936
01:43:28,723 --> 01:43:33,478
their tongues stick out
and faeces is expelled.

937
01:43:34,604 --> 01:43:38,650
But that day, aunt's mouth was shut

938
01:43:39,442 --> 01:43:41,361
and her bottom was clean.

939
01:43:42,904 --> 01:43:44,990
Do you want to go somewhere nice?

940
01:44:02,757 --> 01:44:06,595
I'll tell you in detail
what I did to your aunt

941
01:44:06,678 --> 01:44:08,430
after I caught her running away.

942
01:44:09,055 --> 01:44:13,602
So don't you ever think of running,
understood?

943
01:44:31,703 --> 01:44:33,246
That day I just watched and listened.

944
01:44:33,997 --> 01:44:37,500
But if I ever end up there again...

945
01:44:42,297 --> 01:44:43,632
This is highly concentrated opium.

946
01:44:44,132 --> 01:44:45,967
Three drops will make you sleep all day.

947
01:44:46,384 --> 01:44:48,887
Five drops will knock down a horse.

948
01:44:49,429 --> 01:44:51,181
If you crave death within five minutes,

949
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,975
drink it all.

950
01:44:54,059 --> 01:44:57,395
If you carry this,
he can never take you to the basement.

951
01:44:57,479 --> 01:44:58,563
At least not alive.

952
01:44:59,731 --> 01:45:01,316
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

953
01:45:01,983 --> 01:45:03,693
It's more expensive than jewels.

954
01:45:15,372 --> 01:45:20,335
Bring a girl to be my maid.
One who could disappear and not be missed.

955
01:45:20,752 --> 01:45:22,462
<i><font color="#80ffff">If a bit dense, all the better.</i></font>

956
01:45:22,545 --> 01:45:26,633
We'll send her to a madhouse
under my name.

957
01:45:29,052 --> 01:45:30,970
They dig a hole in the ground,

958
01:45:31,054 --> 01:45:33,890
put a patient in there and close the lid.

959
01:45:34,808 --> 01:45:37,394
I want my name to be buried in that hole.

960
01:45:38,436 --> 01:45:40,939
I can find you a new maid,

961
01:45:41,022 --> 01:45:43,233
but what do we do about Junko?

962
01:45:48,613 --> 01:45:53,576
You really think
I'm prettier than Miss Hideko?

963
01:45:54,994 --> 01:45:59,082
Sure, Hideko's pretty, and you're pretty.

964
01:45:59,165 --> 01:46:00,875
What? You speak Korean?

965
01:46:02,544 --> 01:46:04,003
You know...

966
01:46:05,088 --> 01:46:05,922
I learned it.

967
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:08,883
To speak more easily with you.

968
01:46:10,677 --> 01:46:13,138
I really wanted to say this to you.

969
01:46:14,848 --> 01:46:16,391
You are just mesmerizing.

970
01:46:16,474 --> 01:46:17,892
Oh my gosh!

971
01:46:19,853 --> 01:46:21,438
You little tart!

972
01:46:26,568 --> 01:46:28,611
I can't!

973
01:46:28,987 --> 01:46:31,781
<i><font color="#80ffff">If they catch me with a guest,

<i><font color="#80ffff">Forget this wretched place.
Come live with me!</i></font>

975
01:47:24,334 --> 01:47:25,460
Oh, fucking hell!

976
01:47:26,377 --> 01:47:27,462
Fucking hell?

977
01:47:27,545 --> 01:47:28,922
Fucking hell...

978

980
01:48:28,648 --> 01:48:30,900
We're alike, somehow.

981
01:48:31,609 --> 01:48:32,986
I heard you're an orphan, too.

982
01:48:37,282 --> 01:48:38,533
Mother!

983
01:48:49,794 --> 01:48:54,591
<i><font color="#80ffff">Show Sookee your clothes

this letter, she's totally illiterate.</i></font>

986
01:49:05,560 --> 01:49:07,061
Would you read it to me?

987
01:49:07,478 --> 01:49:08,563
Pardon?

988
01:49:09,731 --> 01:49:13,735
"...looking for a maid.
Maids are like...

989
01:49:14,819 --> 01:49:16,321
a spoon... no...

990
01:49:18,406 --> 01:49:20,867

991
01:49:24,787 --> 01:49:26,748
Is it a spoon?

992
01:49:26,831 --> 01:49:27,707
COUNTESS FUJIWARA HIDEKO

993
01:49:27,790 --> 01:49:30,585
This is your name. Can't you read it?

994
01:49:36,132 --> 01:49:37,467
What's with your foot?

995
01:49:42,013 --> 01:49:42,847
<i><font color="#80ffff">Who did it?</i></font>

<i><font color="#80ffff">Who took Tamako 's shoe?</i></font>

997
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,567
Apologize before all the servants!

998
01:49:58,529 --> 01:50:01,407
If she ever runs away
because of one of you,

999
01:50:01,491 --> 01:50:03,368
I'll strip you all naked
and throw you out!

1000
01:50:05,161 --> 01:50:06,120
Fucking hell.

1001

All smooth.

1002

Do you like the scent?

1003
01:50:21,552 --> 01:50:23,179
Do you want to come in?

1004
01:50:23,262 --> 01:50:24,097
Pardon?

1005
01:50:44,659 --> 01:50:46,244
<i><font color="#80ffff">This must be Okju.</i></font>

it'll put me in an awkward position.</i></font>

1008

A decent bone structure for a Korean...

1009
01:51:05,972 --> 01:51:10,393
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

1010
01:51:14,105 --> 01:51:16,858
<i><font color="#80ffff">- What?

<i><font color="#80ffff">Isn't that right, Miss?</i></font>

1019
01:51:48,598 --> 01:51:50,266
There's no need to be ashamed at all.

1020
01:51:50,349 --> 01:51:52,643
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

1021

I'll tell you how to keep her
from getting suspicious.

1027
01:52:18,503 --> 01:52:21,631
Keep her busy
until the day of the wedding.

1028
01:52:22,131 --> 01:52:24,258
Make her spend all her energy

on making you fall in love with me."

1030
01:52:28,596 --> 01:52:31,933
In other words,
don't fall in love with me so easily.

1031
01:52:42,777 --> 01:52:43,611
Mesmerizing!

1032
01:52:46,989 --> 01:52:47,824
Me?

1033
01:52:56,999 --> 01:52:59,460
Dressed up, you look like a lady too.

1034
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:09,428
Almost fully ripe.

1035
01:53:19,188 --> 01:53:21,607
How did your mother die?

1036
01:53:22,108 --> 01:53:25,486
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

1037
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:28,364
That she had no regrets.

1038
01:53:29,782 --> 01:53:33,870
<i><font color="#80ffff">Is this the companionship

I'll be quick.

1043
01:53:45,089 --> 01:53:46,090
Before it rains.

1044

<i><font color="#80ffff">What's with her?</i></font>

1045

Men are disgusting.

1046
01:54:12,575 --> 01:54:15,453
How can they be so single-minded?

1047
01:54:16,037 --> 01:54:17,205
What's on my mind?

1048
01:54:18,497 --> 01:54:21,751
You don't really believe
that I crave your body, do you?

1049
01:54:23,878 --> 01:54:25,004
You do!

1050

You read too many of those books.

If there's one thing I'm after, Miss...

It's not your eyes, your hands or ass,

1053

it's your money, only that.

1054
01:54:38,351 --> 01:54:40,394
Of all that you have, money is the best.

1055
01:54:42,730 --> 01:54:46,025
It feels great being so rude
to a noble lady.

1056

<i><font color="#80ffff">What's with her?</i></font>

<i><font color="#80ffff">Try to bear it.</i></font>

Only if she sees this
will she believe the proposal.

1063

Think of me as that puppet,

What woman?

1065
01:55:38,494 --> 01:55:39,912
The duchess Juliette.

1066

<i><font color="#80ffff">Lady!</i></font>

<i><font color="#80ffff">Yes, sir!</i></font>

1083
01:56:44,518 --> 01:56:47,646
THE SOUND OF BELLS
ON A WINDLESS NIGHT

1084
01:56:49,482 --> 01:56:53,694
"'When do I put this in?'
asked Jinlian.

1085
01:56:54,528 --> 01:56:58,991
Does the lady breathe deeply
and swallow hard?

1086
01:57:00,409 --> 01:57:03,537
<i><font color="#80ffff">Does she whisper sweetly in your ear,</i></font>

1087
01:57:03,621 --> 01:57:05,498
<i><font color="#80ffff">and kiss you?</i></font>

1088
01:57:10,461 --> 01:57:12,546
Does she embrace you tightly

1089
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:14,548
and caress your nipples?

1090
01:57:16,967 --> 01:57:21,514
Does her secret part become slippery

1091
01:57:22,807 --> 01:57:29,438
as she gently bites your shoulder?

1092
01:57:30,940 --> 01:57:34,151
<i><font color="#80ffff">Then, put in the bells."</i></font>

1094

It's so cute.

1095
01:58:08,185 --> 01:58:09,770
If the Count sees this...

1096
01:58:17,194 --> 01:58:19,572
Will he really be as tender as this?

1097
01:58:21,073 --> 01:58:22,324
Of course.

1098
01:58:22,408 --> 01:58:25,327
And he'll touch you like this...

1099
01:58:26,328 --> 01:58:27,455
And like this...

1100
01:58:36,213 --> 01:58:38,007
Tamako, keep doing

1101
01:58:39,091 --> 01:58:40,718
what the Count will.

1102
01:58:43,471 --> 01:58:44,638
The Count...

1103
01:58:45,139 --> 01:58:46,932
The Count...

1104
01:58:47,016 --> 01:58:49,602
He'll go crazy over this.

1105
01:58:51,937 --> 01:58:55,399
And this is what he'll say.

1106

<i><font color="#80ffff">"It's so soft, warm, wet, and...</i></font>

01:59:43,447 --> 01:59:46,367
Shall I teach you more, Miss?

1109
01:59:46,450 --> 01:59:48,827
Yes...

1110
01:59:49,411 --> 01:59:50,871
Teach me everything.

1111
02:00:35,833 --> 02:00:40,170
I wish that I had breast milk
so I could feed you.

1112
02:00:55,144 --> 02:00:56,895
Do you like it when I do this?

1113
02:00:58,564 --> 02:00:59,898
Do you like me?

1114
02:01:01,817 --> 02:01:04,570
Can you promise that you won't betray me?

1115
02:01:06,238 --> 02:01:08,157
I'll never...

1116
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:09,158
never...

1117
02:01:10,534 --> 02:01:11,535
ever...

1118
02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:32,056
Miss, how could such an innocent...

1119
02:01:32,473 --> 02:01:34,183
You must be a natural.

1120
02:02:30,322 --> 02:02:31,156
Stop!

1121
02:02:33,784 --> 02:02:36,453
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

1122

<i><font color="#80ffff">She's got no one on this earth.</i></font>

1123

<i><font color="#80ffff">And please...</i></font>

1125
02:02:44,461 --> 02:02:49,425
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

1126
02:02:56,515 --> 02:02:57,516
<i><font color="#80ffff">You see?</i></font>

1127
02:02:59,143 --> 02:03:01,812
If you don't give the impression
you want this marriage,

1128
02:03:01,895 --> 02:03:05,149
she may throw another fit
and refuse to go forward.

1129
02:03:05,232 --> 02:03:08,360
Be more convincing
when you pretend to love me.

1130
02:03:08,444 --> 02:03:09,528
I can't do it.

1131
02:03:09,903 --> 02:03:10,738
What?

1132
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,823
I want to quit.

1133
02:03:14,992 --> 02:03:16,160
What's with you all today?

1134
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:18,787
Why?

1135
02:03:19,913 --> 02:03:21,915
I hate everyone.
My mom, dad, aunt, uncle,

1136
02:03:21,999 --> 02:03:23,250
you and...

1137
02:03:29,131 --> 02:03:30,632
I don't like Sookee, either.

1138
02:03:30,716 --> 02:03:32,301
You feel sorry for her?

1139
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:37,681
What is it with women?

1140
02:03:40,893 --> 02:03:44,480
You know what that poor Sookee said
about your Ladyship?

1141
02:03:45,063 --> 02:03:48,650
That you're too naive to get it
even if someone pulls on your nipples.

1142
02:03:48,734 --> 02:03:51,653
<i><font color="#80ffff">That she was nice out of pity,

1143
02:03:51,737 --> 02:03:53,447
<i><font color="#80ffff">That you were so gullible!</i></font>

<i><font color="#80ffff">That naive servant's face...</i></font>

1145
02:03:57,242 --> 02:03:59,578
Yes... you will love him.

1146
02:03:59,661 --> 02:04:02,706
If I say that I love someone else...

1147
02:04:04,124 --> 02:04:08,462
I have no one on this earth...

1148
02:04:09,046 --> 02:04:11,465
Would you still want me to marry him?

1149
02:04:11,882 --> 02:04:12,716
Yes.

1150

Miss, I'm sorry!

1155
02:05:55,611 --> 02:05:56,445
Let go!

<i><font color="#80ffff">What are you sorry about?</i></font>

1160

I tried to trick you
into marrying that bastard.

1161
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:16,214
I was going to put you
in a madhouse and run off.

1162
02:06:17,633 --> 02:06:21,553
Don't die. Don't get married, Miss!

1163
02:06:23,847 --> 02:06:27,309
Sookee, are you worried about me?

1164
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:34,566
I'm worried about you.

1165
02:06:40,030 --> 02:06:42,699
How do you know my name?

1166
02:06:44,159 --> 02:06:46,286
You think you're tricking me?

1167
02:06:48,914 --> 02:06:50,290
You're the one being tricked.

1168
02:06:51,959 --> 02:06:54,169
You're the one bound for the madhouse.

1169

1171

I won't say sorry,
since you tried to trick me too.

1172

That fucking son of a bitch!

1173
02:07:23,281 --> 02:07:26,284
Oh, sorry Miss!

Always remember the basement.

Is this what you've been reading

Some Englishmen who frequented the brothel

The manner of ordering wine

<i><font color="#80ffff">That my wife Fujiwara Hideko
has died.</i></font>

1223
02:15:32,353 --> 02:15:34,981
You didn't just ask them to keep her?

1224
02:15:35,899 --> 02:15:39,194
I doubt Sookee would want
to live there very long.

1225
02:15:47,911 --> 02:15:48,953
Fuck!

1226
02:15:53,917 --> 02:15:55,543
<i><font color="#80ffff">Bastard.</i></font>

1227
02:15:55,627 --> 02:15:59,047
I never said I wasn't a bastard.

1228
02:16:00,673 --> 02:16:04,928
<i><font color="#80ffff">You'll become a colonial girl
named Nam Sookee.</i></font>

1229
02:16:05,011 --> 02:16:06,971
You know I'm an expert
at document forgery, right?

1230
02:16:07,055 --> 02:16:09,015
I arranged it with a photography studio.

1231
02:16:10,266 --> 02:16:14,020
From tomorrow,
we'll give Sookee a new life.

1232
02:16:14,103 --> 02:16:15,396
I'm glad.

1233
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:17,148
<i><font color="#80ffff">Marry me once again.</i></font>

1234
02:16:18,149 --> 02:16:19,734
This time as Nam Sookee.

1235
02:16:21,736 --> 02:16:23,655
You want another wedding night?

1236
02:16:30,078 --> 02:16:33,206
I think I slightly like you.

1237
02:16:36,709 --> 02:16:38,962
Poor Sookee, in a place like that

1238
02:16:40,255 --> 02:16:42,090
all by herself...

1239
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:47,387
Did such a thought ever cross your mind?

1240
02:16:47,845 --> 02:16:49,973
Not at all. Why should I pity her?

1241
02:16:50,473 --> 02:16:53,017
Where I come from,
it's illegal to be naive.

1242
02:16:53,768 --> 02:16:57,272
Where you come from, it's not naive
to fall in love with a business partner?

1243
02:16:57,355 --> 02:16:59,440
Of course. It's illegal.

1244
02:16:59,941 --> 02:17:03,278
So even if my love for you
leads me to ruin,

1245
02:17:03,861 --> 02:17:05,280
don't pity me.

1246
02:17:06,072 --> 02:17:06,906
<i><font color="#80ffff">Love?</i></font>

1247
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:10,994
What does a crook know about love?

1248
02:17:33,850 --> 02:17:36,394
Fire!

1249
02:17:45,987 --> 02:17:48,323
C... c... come this way!

1250
02:17:48,406 --> 02:17:50,783
This way!

1251
02:19:00,061 --> 02:19:02,897
Because you desired me,

1252
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:05,233
and overcame all obstacles to reach me,

1253
02:19:05,316 --> 02:19:07,276
I have been born anew, it's true.

1254
02:19:08,861 --> 02:19:10,530
I'm grateful for that.

1255
02:19:12,907 --> 02:19:14,784
I'll allow a kiss.

1256
02:19:19,872 --> 02:19:20,707
No.

1257
02:19:21,124 --> 02:19:21,958
Why not?

1258
02:19:25,336 --> 02:19:27,380
I don't like kisses with conditions.

1259
02:19:27,463 --> 02:19:30,091
I never learned how to stop halfway.

1260
02:19:32,343 --> 02:19:37,682
After this I'll thrust in deep,
to your navel.

1261
02:19:38,766 --> 02:19:40,268
Please do that.

1262
02:19:43,980 --> 02:19:45,523
Those aren't the eyes of one who wants it.

1263
02:19:46,107 --> 02:19:48,735
<i><font color="#80ffff">You know you can't deceive me
in such matters.</i></font>

1264
02:19:53,906 --> 02:19:57,994
If I could be yours for ten minutes,

1265
02:19:58,077 --> 02:19:59,328
what would you give in exchange?

1266
02:20:00,705 --> 02:20:02,999
Whatever your heart desires.

1267
02:20:03,082 --> 02:20:05,376
Anything in this whole wide world.

1268
02:20:30,234 --> 02:20:31,861
There's much I want to teach you.

1269
02:20:33,863 --> 02:20:36,616
You'll become a completely new woman.

1270
02:22:28,227 --> 02:22:31,147
It won't hurt.
You've seen it in those books.

1271
02:22:31,230 --> 02:22:35,067
In truth, women feel the greatest pleasure

1272
02:22:35,151 --> 02:22:36,819
when taken by force.

1273
02:22:37,361 --> 02:22:40,156
Now I'm going to rip your underwear.

1274
02:24:58,252 --> 02:25:00,379
Would you fetch those for me?

1275
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:13,309
Okay, here we go.

1276
02:25:13,392 --> 02:25:15,311
One, two, three.

1277

<i><font color="#80ffff">I feel "slightly" grateful.</i></font>

1290
02:27:05,629 --> 02:27:08,966
You wished to see my bookmaking tools?

1291
02:27:09,592 --> 02:27:12,887
Don't just look,
experience them for yourself.

1292
02:27:13,888 --> 02:27:15,681
I'll choose five books that I cherish...

1293
02:27:16,390 --> 02:27:19,018
that I used to cherish more than anything.

1294
02:27:21,312 --> 02:27:23,480
Let's see... First,

1295
02:27:26,567 --> 02:27:28,652
<i><font color="#80ffff">Confessions of a Whip</i></font>

1296
02:27:37,453 --> 02:27:38,746
<i><font color="#80ffff">The Lizard Skin</i></font>

1297
02:27:51,258 --> 02:27:54,929
<i><font color="#80ffff">Decadent Girls Who Sell Lingerie</i></font>

1298
02:28:04,271 --> 02:28:06,982
May I please smoke a cigarette, sir?

1299
02:28:08,067 --> 02:28:08,901
Sir.

1300
02:28:12,071 --> 02:28:13,280
<i><font color="#80ffff">Bells and Balls</i></font>

1301
02:28:17,618 --> 02:28:19,245
<i><font color="#80ffff">The Mortician's Bedroom</i></font>

1302
02:28:31,757 --> 02:28:34,385
How could you let a little girl fool you?

1303
02:28:37,763 --> 02:28:42,268
<i><font color="#80ffff">But don't worry.
I'll catch them for you soon.</i></font>

1304
02:28:47,648 --> 02:28:50,401
I'll bind books with the skin
of those two bitches and you

1305
02:28:50,484 --> 02:28:54,530
and place them on the shelf.

1306
02:28:55,906 --> 02:29:01,161
I arranged so that no two girls
traveling together can leave Kobe.

1307
02:29:03,998 --> 02:29:06,166
Please change the destination to Shanghai.

1308
02:29:06,583 --> 02:29:09,670
Changing two tickets,
from Vladivostok to Shanghai.

1309
02:29:09,753 --> 02:29:11,505
Yes, that's correct.

1310
02:29:12,298 --> 02:29:13,257
<i><font color="#80ffff">Show me your passports.</i></font>

1311
02:29:20,973 --> 02:29:22,433
Miss Nam Sookee?

1312
02:29:25,853 --> 02:29:27,062
<i><font color="#80ffff">Mr. Go Pan-dol?</i></font>

1313
02:29:35,696 --> 02:29:38,157
You need to pay an additional 3 yen.

1314
02:29:38,782 --> 02:29:39,616
All right.

1315
02:29:44,288 --> 02:29:49,376
Hideko is a peach
that I left on the branch,

1316
02:29:50,044 --> 02:29:52,463
imagining what the taste will be like.

1317
02:29:53,255 --> 02:29:56,133
Would I have plucked it someday?

1318
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:57,634
No.

1319
02:29:58,927 --> 02:30:03,307
I'm just an old man
who likes dirty stories.

1320
02:30:05,184 --> 02:30:08,312
Even listening to the same story,
people imagine different things.

1321
02:30:09,313 --> 02:30:12,316
Peering into each of those fantasies

1322
02:30:12,858 --> 02:30:15,819
was this old man's humble recreation.

1323
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:19,406
What to do, now that it's all over?

1324
02:30:20,074 --> 02:30:22,451
You should at least tell me your story.

1325
02:30:24,286 --> 02:30:27,498
<i><font color="#80ffff">How did that bitch Hideko taste?</i></font>

1326
02:30:28,582 --> 02:30:31,543
Was she fully ripe?
Tell me.

1327
02:30:34,546 --> 02:30:36,924
A cigarette might help my memory.

1328
02:30:38,092 --> 02:30:40,344
Right, right...

1329
02:30:41,136 --> 02:30:44,890
You have that silly penchant
for cigarettes?

1330
02:31:01,907 --> 02:31:05,619
So how was Hideko?

1331
02:31:11,917 --> 02:31:15,712
You have no windows here.

1332
02:31:19,466 --> 02:31:22,469
Sookee could be listening in.
Let's do our best.

1333
02:31:34,565 --> 02:31:35,816
<i><font color="#80ffff">That's it, good.</i></font>

1334
02:31:48,328 --> 02:31:50,038
<i><font color="#80ffff">What's this?</i></font>

1335
02:31:50,122 --> 02:31:52,499
You can't stop there, dear fellow.

1336
02:31:52,583 --> 02:31:54,918
So, where did you touch first?

1337
02:31:55,377 --> 02:31:56,211
<i><font color="#80ffff">Her face?</i></font>

1338
02:31:59,006 --> 02:32:00,382
Her breasts?

1339
02:32:02,009 --> 02:32:04,011
Or straight for her
c... cunt?

1340
02:32:06,513 --> 02:32:07,931
Was it soft?

1341
02:32:08,807 --> 02:32:10,350
Did it tighten up?

1342
02:32:12,019 --> 02:32:13,854
Did it have many wrinkles?

1343
02:32:14,855 --> 02:32:17,024
Was it sufficiently wet?

1344
02:32:17,107 --> 02:32:20,611
How was the viscosity and transparency
of her vaginal secretion?

1345
02:32:22,070 --> 02:32:24,198
Please, one more cigarette, sir.

1346
02:32:51,183 --> 02:32:58,357
<i><font color="#80ffff">Spider thread pulled into strings...</i></font>

1353

But how was she coy,

02:34:17,644 --> 02:34:21,815
<i><font color="#80ffff">how was she bold,
tell it to me in detail!</i></font>

1355
02:34:22,316 --> 02:34:25,694
A story is all about the journey.

1356
02:34:25,777 --> 02:34:27,487
You should know.

1357

<i><font color="#80ffff">Did she resist?</i></font>

1358

So did you pinch her ass as punishment?

1359
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:38,790
Or did she spit at you in contempt?

1360
02:34:39,916 --> 02:34:41,335
Or else...

1361
02:34:41,960 --> 02:34:44,129
Did she beg you to do it?

Hideko is my wife.

1365
02:34:55,974 --> 02:35:00,270

<i><font color="#80ffff">It's odd...</i></font>

Your smoke.

1368
02:36:43,790 --> 02:36:47,210
It's cold, blue...

<i><font color="#80ffff">and strangely beautiful.</i></font>

You too have become soft, slow and dull.

1371

Mercury is most deadly
in its gaseous state.

1372
