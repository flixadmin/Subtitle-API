00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,781
I shouldn't have gone to
the future without you.

800
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,574
I shouldn't have left you
like that.

801
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,120
I mean, that was the same thing
that I got so mad at you for.

802
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:36,624
But I know now that we can't
solve this

803
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,584
if we don't stick together.

804
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,921
- I can barely
solve things with you,

805
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,174
so without you...

806
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:47,426
- Are we making jokes already?
Really?

807
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,682
- Let's bring our kid home.

808
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,231
- There's something else
that I wanted to tell you.

809
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:04,903
Barry, the way that Thawne
looks when he talks about Nora.

810
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,574
I've only ever seen that
in one other person.

811
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,244
You.

812
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,788
- What are you saying?

813
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,084
- I think Thawne might
actually care about Nora.
