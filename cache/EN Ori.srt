1
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:06,352
<i>Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust.</i>

2
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,354
<i>Thousands of years ago,</i>

3
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:11,774
<i>these were the forces
that ruled our world.</i>

4
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:14,860
<i>A world where prey
were scared of predators.</i>

5
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:20,199
<i>And predators had an uncontrollable,
biological urge...</i>

6
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:22,535
<i>to maim, and maul, and...</i>

7
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:27,498
Blood! Blood! Blood!

8
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:36,715
And death.

9
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:45,766
Back then, the world was divided in two.

10
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:46,934
Vicious predator...

11
00:01:47,894 --> 00:01:49,520
or meek prey.

12
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:55,985
But over time, we evolved.

13
00:01:56,152 --> 00:01:59,780
And moved beyond our primitive,
savage ways.

14
00:01:59,948 --> 00:02:03,826
Now, predator and prey live in harmony.

15
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,873
And every young mammal has
multitudinous opportunities.

16
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,999
Yeah.

17
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:13,500
I don't have to cower in a herd anymore.

18
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:17,086
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

19
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:22,425
I don't have to be
a lonely hunter anymore.

20
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:24,969
Today, I can hunt for tax exemptions.

21
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:27,847
I'm gonna be an actuary!

22
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,268
And I can make the world a better place.

23
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:34,020
I am going to be...

24
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:37,857
a police officer!

25
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:44,697
Bunny cop? That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard.

26
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,534
It may seem impossible
to small minds...

27
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,370
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

28
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:53,363
But, just 211 miles away...

29
00:02:53,531 --> 00:02:57,116
stands the great city of Zootopia!

30
00:02:57,284 --> 00:03:00,620
Where our ancestors
first joined together in peace...

31
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:07,126
and declared that
anyone can be anything!

32
00:03:08,828 --> 00:03:10,954
Thank you and good night!

33
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:15,292
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?

34
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,335
Nope.

35
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:19,129
Well, we gave up on our dreams
and we settled. Right, Bon?

36
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:21,548
Oh, yes, that's right, Stu.
We settled hard.

37
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:24,551
See, that's the beauty
of complacency, Jude.

38
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,054
If you don't try anything new,
you'll never fail.

39
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,597
I like trying actually.

40
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:30,223
What you father means, hon...

41
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:31,892
is it's gonna be difficult,

42
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,353
impossible even,
for you to become a police officer.

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,064
Right. There's never been a bunny cop.
Bunnies don't do that.

44
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:38,273
- Never.
- Never.

45
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:41,276
Then, I guess I'll have to be
the first one.

46
00:03:41,444 --> 00:03:46,073
Because I am gonna make the world
a better place.

47
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,118
Or, heck, you know, you want to talk
about making the world a better place...

48
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:52,037
no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

49
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:54,164
Yes! Your dad, me...

50
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,418
your 275 brothers and sisters.
We're changing the world!

51
00:03:58,586 --> 00:03:59,461
One carrot at a time.

52
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:02,381
Amen to that.
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

53
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,675
Just putting the seeds in the ground.

54
00:04:04,842 --> 00:04:07,427
At one with the soil.
Just getting covered in dirt.

55
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,262
You get it, honey.
It's great to have dreams.

56
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,307
Yeah. Just as long as you don't
believe in them too much.

57
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:15,143
Where'd the heck she go?

58
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:17,979
Give me your tickets right now...

59
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:20,774
or I'm gonna kick
your meek little sheep butt.

60
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,567
Cut it out, Gideon!

61
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,153
What are you gonna do? Cry?

62
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:26,071
Hey!

63
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,281
You heard her. Cut it out.

64
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,325
Nice costume, loser.

65
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:32,411
What crazy world are you living in

66
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:34,871
where you think a bunny
could be a cop?

67
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,207
Kindly return my friend's tickets.

68
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:38,291
Come and get them.

69
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,460
But watch out, because I'm a fox,

70
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:42,671
and like you said
in your dumb little stage play...

71
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,173
us predators used to eat prey.

72
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:47,634
And that killer instinct
is still in our "Dunnah. "

73
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:49,928
I'm pretty much sure
it's pronounced "DNA."

74
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:51,638
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

75
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:53,640
You don't scare me, Gideon.

76
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:57,769
- You scared now?
- Look at her nose twitch!

77
00:04:57,895 --> 00:04:58,770
She is scared!

78
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:00,731
Cry little baby bunny.

79
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:01,648
Cry, cry...

80
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:07,446
You don't know when to quit, do you?

81
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:16,413
I want you to remember this moment...

82
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:20,333
the next time you think you will ever
be anything more than just a stupid...

83
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:22,419
carrot-farming, dumb bunny.

84
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:28,633
That looks bad.

85
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:30,302
Are you okay, Judy?

86
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,596
Yeah. I'm okay.

87
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:34,473
Here you go.

88
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,391
Wow! You got our tickets!

89
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:37,934
You're awesome, Judy!

90
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:41,480
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't
know what he's talking about.

91
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:43,690
Well, he was right about one thing.

92
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:49,445
I don't know when to quit.

93
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,072
Listen up, cadets.

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,243
Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems
within its city limits.

95
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:57,536
Tundratown...

96
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:58,871
Sahara Square...

97
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:00,748
Rainforest District, to name a few.

98
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:03,167
You're gonna have to
master all of them

99
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:05,669
before you hit the streets,
or guess what?

100
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:07,711
You'll be dead!

101
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:10,797
Scorching sandstorm!

102
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:14,551
You're dead, Bunny Bumpkin!

103
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:17,554
1,000-foot fall!

104
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:20,432
You're dead, Carrot Face!

105
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:22,392
Frigid ice wall!

106
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:25,896
You're dead, Farm Girl!

107
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:28,565
Enormous criminal.

108
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,985
You're dead.
Dead, dead, dead!

109
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:42,287
Filthy toilet! You're dead, Fluff Butt.

110
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:45,123
<i>Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny!</i>

111
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,458
<i>There's never been a bunny cop.</i>

112
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:47,584
<i>- Never.
- Never.</i>

113
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:50,420
<i>Just a stupid,
carrot-farming dumb bunny.</i>

114
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,492
<i>As mayor of Zootopia,
I am proud to announce...</i>

115
00:07:20,702 --> 00:07:23,912
<i>that my Mammal Inclusion Initiative
has produced...</i>

116
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:26,790
<i>its first police academy graduate.</i>

117
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:32,295
<i>Valedictorian of her class,
ZPD's very first rabbit officer...</i>

118
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:34,381
<i>Judy Hopps.</i>

119
00:07:34,549 --> 00:07:35,966
Oh, gosh.

120
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:40,095
<i>Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.</i>

121
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:41,763
<i>- Oh, yes. Right!
- Thank you.</i>

122
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,223
Yay, Judy!

123
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:44,141
<i>Judy...</i>

124
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:48,353
<i>it is my great privilege
to officially assign you...</i>

125
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,648
<i>to the heart of Zootopia: Precinct One.</i>

126
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:52,983
<i>City Center.</i>

127
00:07:54,777 --> 00:07:56,611
Congratulations, Officer Hopps.

128
00:07:57,071 --> 00:08:00,490
I won't let you down. This has been
my dream since I was a kid.

129
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,243
It's a real proud day for us little guys.

130
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:04,494
Bellwether, make room, will you?
Come on.

131
00:08:05,037 --> 00:08:07,497
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!

132
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:09,325
- Officer Hopps, right here!
- Look this way please!

133
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:10,576
Hold still. Smile!

134
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,663
We're real proud of you, Judy.

135
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:16,332
Yeah. Scared, too.

136
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,751
Really, it's kind of
a proud-scared combo.

137
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:22,504
I mean, Zootopia. So far away.
Such a big city.

138
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:23,505
Guys...

139
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:25,716
I've been working for this my whole life.

140
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:29,219
We know. And we're just
a little excited for you, but terrified.

141
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:32,097
The only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.

142
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:34,725
And also bears.
We have bears to fear, too.

143
00:08:34,976 --> 00:08:36,226
Say nothing of lions and wolves.

144
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:37,436
- Wolves?
- Weasels.

145
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:38,604
You play cribbage with a weasel.

146
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:39,897
And he cheats like there's no tomorrow.

147
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:43,192
You know what, pretty much all
predators. And Zootopia's full of them.

148
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,026
Oh, Stu.

149
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:45,694
And foxes are the worst.

150
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:49,948
Actually, your father does have
a point there. It's in their biology.

151
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:51,408
Remember what happened
with Gideon Grey?

152
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:53,077
When I was nine.

153
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:56,246
Gideon Grey was a jerk
who happened to be a fox.

154
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:58,332
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

155
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:01,085
Sure, we all do. Absolutely.
But just in case...

156
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:03,379
we made you a little care package
to take with you.

157
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:05,589
- And I put some snacks in there.
- This is fox deterrent.

158
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:06,799
Yeah, that's safe, to have that.

159
00:09:06,966 --> 00:09:08,384
This is fox repellent.

160
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:09,510
The deterrent and the repellent,
that's all she needs.

161
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,595
- Check this out!
- For goodness sake.

162
00:09:11,763 --> 00:09:13,555
She has no need for a fox Taser, Stu.

163
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,891
Come on. When is there not
a need for a fox Taser?

164
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,811
Okay, look! I will take this,
to make you stop talking.

165
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:20,604
Terrific! Everyone wins!

166
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,315
<i>Arriving, Zootopia Express.</i>

167
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,986
Okay, gotta go! Bye!

168
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:29,863
Bye, Judy!

169
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:37,996
I love you guys.

170
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:39,998
Love you, too.

171
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,751
Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.

172
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:44,461
Oh, Stu, pull it together.

173
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:46,338
Bye, everybody!

174
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:47,673
- Bye-bye, Judy!
- Bye, Judy!

175
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,425
I love you!

176
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:51,844
Bye! Bye!

177
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:55,931
Goodbye!

178
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:29,131
<i>I messed up tonight
I lost another fight</i>

179
00:10:29,457 --> 00:10:32,960
<i>Lost to myself
But I'll just start again</i>

180
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:35,295
<i>I keep falling down</i>

181

<i>I keep on hitting the ground</i>

00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,341
<i>But I always get up now</i>

183
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:41,426
<i>To see what's next</i>

184
00:10:43,513 --> 00:10:45,639
<i>Birds don't just fly</i>

185
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:47,683
<i>They fall down and get up</i>

186
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:57,817
<i>Nobody learns without getting it wrong</i>

187
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:01,947
<i>I won't give up
No I won't give in</i>

And then I'll start again</i>

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,245
<i>No I won't leave</i>

190
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:14,751
<i>I want to try everything
I want to try even though I could fail</i>

<i>Try everything</i>

197

<i>I'm Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia.</i>

202
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:48,428
Welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.

203
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:51,389
Luxury apartments with charm.

204
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:55,101
Complimentary delousing
once a month. Don't lose your key.

205
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:56,603
Thank you.

206
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:58,897
Hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbor.

207
00:12:59,065 --> 00:13:00,023
Yeah? Well, we're loud.

208
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:02,359
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

209
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:06,529
Greasy walls.

210
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:07,989
Hey, shut up!

211
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:09,074
Rickety bed.

212
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:10,325
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

213
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:11,409
Will you shut up?

214
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:13,036
Crazy neighbors.

215
00:13:13,204 --> 00:13:14,287
I said, "Shut up!"

216
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:15,789
I love it!

217
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:17,123
Shut your mouth, shut up.

218
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:36,309
Come on!

219
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:38,269
He bared his teeth first!

220
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:41,815
Excuse me.

221
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:43,441
Down here.

222
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:44,901
Hi.

223
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:46,986
O- M-Goodness!

224
00:13:47,154 --> 00:13:50,115
They really did hire a bunny! What!

225
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:53,159
I gotta tell you, you are even cuter
than I thought you'd be!

226
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:58,540
You probably didn't know, but a bunny
can call another bunny "cute"...

227
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,291
but when other animals do it...

228
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:01,501
it's a little...

229
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:06,172
I am so sorry!
Me, Benjamin Clawhauser...

230
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,510
the guy everyone thinks is just a flabby,
donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.

231
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:15,223
No, it's okay. Oh, you've actually got...
There's a...

232
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:16,683
In your neck. The fold.

233
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:18,560
Where? Oh!

234
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:21,563
There you went, you little dickens!

235
00:14:22,857 --> 00:14:24,691
I should get to roll call,
which way do I...?

236
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:26,401
Bullpen's over there to the left.

237
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,153
Great. Thank you.

238
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:31,114
That poor little bunny's
gonna get eaten alive.

239
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:45,754
Hey, Officer Hopps.

240
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,756
You ready to make the world
a better place?

241
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:53,178
Atten-hut!

242
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,060
All right! Everybody sit.

243
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:04,522
I've got three items on the docket.

244
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:09,402
First... we need to acknowledge
the elephant in the room.

245
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:11,070
Francine...

246
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:13,114
Happy birthday.

247
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:17,535
Number two.

248
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:20,538
There are some new recruits
with us I should introduce...

249
00:15:20,706 --> 00:15:21,664
but I'm not going to...

250
00:15:21,832 --> 00:15:23,625
because I don't care.

251
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:29,589
Finally, we have
14 missing mammal cases.

252
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:33,593
All predators, from a giant polar bear
to a teensy little otter.

253
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:37,847
And City Hall
is right up my tail to find them.

254
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:41,267
This is priority number one.

255
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:42,602
Assignments.

256
00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:44,062
Officers Grizzoli...

257
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:45,271
Fangmeyer, Delgato.

258
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:48,525
Your teams take missing mammals
from the Rainforest District.

259
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:51,820
Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard.

260
00:15:51,987 --> 00:15:54,489
Your teams take Sahara Square.

261
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:56,741
Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby.

262
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:58,827
Tundratown.

263
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:01,788
And finally, our first bunny...

264
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:04,499
Officer Hopps.

265
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:06,334
Parking Duty.

266
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,127
Dismissed.

267
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:09,921
Parking duty?

268
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:12,298
Chief!

269
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:13,341
Chief Bogo?

270
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:18,346
Sir, you said there were
14 missing mammal cases.

271
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:20,014
- So?
- So, I can handle one.

272
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:23,768
You probably forgot, but I was
top of my class at the Academy.

273
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:26,354
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

274
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:28,523
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.

275
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:31,526
Well, then writing 100 tickets a day
should be easy.

276
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:38,449
100 tickets.
I'm not gonna write 100 tickets.

277
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:40,702
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.

278
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,995
Before noon.

279
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:40,887
Boom!

280
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:42,764
200 tickets before noon!

281
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:49,103
201.

282
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:53,483
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

283
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:22,303
Where'd he go?

284
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:40,863
I don't know what you're doing
skulking around during daylight hours...

285
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:45,410
but I don't want any trouble in here.
So, hit the road.

286
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:47,203
I'm not looking
for any trouble either, sir.

287
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:50,373
I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop...

288
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,041
for my little boy.

289
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:58,840
You want the red or the blue, pal?

290
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:05,555
I'm such a...

291
00:19:05,681 --> 00:19:06,597
Come on, kid. Back up.

292
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:09,100
Listen, buddy. What? There aren't any
fox ice cream joints...

293
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:10,351
in your part of town?

294
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,602
No, no. There are.

295
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:15,565
There are. It's just, my boy,
this goofy little stinker...

296
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:18,693
he loves all things elephant.
Wants to be one when he grows up.

297
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:20,778
Is that adorable?

298
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:25,491
Who the heck am I to crush
his little dreams? Right?

299
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:28,494
You probably can't read, fox,
but the sign says...

300
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:31,830
"We reserve the right
to refuse service...

301
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:34,208
"... to anyone. "
So, beat it.

302
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:36,377
You're holding up the line.

303
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,215
Hello? Excuse me.

304
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:44,343
You're gonna have to wait your turn
like everyone else, meter maid.

305
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:46,303
Actually, I'm an officer.

306
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:48,013
Just had a quick question.

307
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:51,558
Are your customers aware
they're getting snot and mucus...

308
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:52,601
with their cookies and cream?

309
00:19:54,604 --> 00:19:56,063
What are you talking about?

310
00:19:56,314 --> 00:19:59,733
I don't want to cause you any trouble,
but I believe scooping ice cream...

311
00:19:59,943 --> 00:20:02,444
with an ungloved trunk
is a Class 3 health code violation.

312
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:06,198
Which is kind of a big deal.

313
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:08,283
Of course,
I could let you off with a warning...

314
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:12,079
if you were to glove those trunks and,
I don't know...

315
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:15,582
finish selling this nice dad
and his son a...

316
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,708
What was it?

317
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,961
A Jumbo Pop.
Please.

318
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:20,546
A Jumbo Pop.

319
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:23,924
$15.

320
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:27,052
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

321
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,472
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?
I don't have my wallet.

322
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:35,435
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached
to my neck. That's the truth.

323
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:39,398
Oh, boy. I'm sorry, pal.
Got to be about the worst birthday ever.

324
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,733
Please don't be mad at me.

325
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:43,569
Thanks anyway.

326
00:20:49,492 --> 00:20:51,118
Keep the change.

327
00:20:51,286 --> 00:20:53,245
Officer, I can't thank you enough.

328
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:56,164
So kind, really. Can I pay you back?

329
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:58,792
Oh, no, My treat.
It just...

330
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,586
You know, it burns me up
to see folks

331
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,921
with such backward attitudes
toward foxes.

332
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:05,924
I just wanna say
you're a great dad and just a...

333
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:08,969
a real articulate fella.

334
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:13,682
Well, that is high praise. It's rare that
I find someone so non-patronizing.

335
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:14,600
Officer...

336
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:15,934
Hopps. Mister...

337
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:18,437
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

338
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:19,938
And you, little guy...

339
00:21:20,189 --> 00:21:23,358
You want to be an elephant
when you grow up? You be an elephant.

340
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:25,736
Because this is Zootopia.

341
00:21:25,904 --> 00:21:28,196
Anyone can be anything.

342
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:30,824
Boy, I tell him that all the time.

343
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:33,994
All right, here you go. Two paws. Yeah.

344
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:37,122
Look at that smile.
That's a "happy birthday" smile.

345
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,666
All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot-toot.

346
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,210
Toot-toot!

347
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:43,337
Bye, now.

348
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:44,338
Goodbye!

349
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:02,814
Hey, little Toot-Toot...

350
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,028
Popsicles!

351
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:53,529
Get your popsicles!

352
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:19,718
Lumber delivery.

353
00:23:19,886 --> 00:23:20,886
What's with the color?

354
00:23:21,054 --> 00:23:22,054
The color?

355
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:23,972
That's red wood.

356
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:27,976
39, 40. There you go.

357
00:23:28,728 --> 00:23:30,562
Way to work that diaper, big guy.

358
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:33,691
Hey, no kiss bye-bye for daddy?

359
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,570
You kiss me tomorrow,
I'll bite your face off.

360
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:40,739
<i>Ciao.</i>

361
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:47,287
Well. I stood up for you,
and you lied to me.

362
00:23:47,497 --> 00:23:48,706
You liar!

363
00:23:48,915 --> 00:23:50,416
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

364
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,584
And I'm not the liar. He is.

365
00:23:56,423 --> 00:23:57,256
Hey!

366
00:23:57,424 --> 00:24:00,259
All right, slick Nick,
you're under arrest.

367
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,760
Really? For what?

368
00:24:01,928 --> 00:24:04,304
Gee, I don't know.
How about selling food without a permit.

369
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:06,557
Transporting undeclared commerce
across borough lines.

370
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:07,766
False advertising.

371
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:10,853
Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

372
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,272
And I didn't falsely advertise anything.
Take care.

373
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,607
You told that mouse
the popsicle sticks were redwood!

374
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:18,277
That's right. "Red wood. "
With a space in the middle.

375
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:19,778
Wood that is red.

376
00:24:20,697 --> 00:24:24,241
You can't touch me, Carrots.
I've been doing this since I was born.

377
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:26,160
You're gonna want to refrain
from calling me Carrots.

378
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:27,703
My bad. I just naturally assumed

379
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:30,122
you came from some little
carrot-choked Podunk, no?

380
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:31,039
No!

381
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:33,584
Podunk is in Deerbrooke County,
and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

382
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:37,254
Okay. Tell me
if this story sounds familiar.

383
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:39,882
Naive little hick with good grades
and big ideas...

384
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:42,634
decides, "Hey, look at me!
I'm gonna move to Zootopia...

385
00:24:42,802 --> 00:24:45,804
where predators and prey
live in harmony and sing "Kumbaya. "

386
00:24:45,972 --> 00:24:48,015
Only to find, whoopsie...

387
00:24:48,224 --> 00:24:51,310
we don't all get along. And that
dream of becoming a big city cop?

388
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:54,980
Double whoopsie. She's a meter maid.
And, whoopsie number three-sie...

389
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:57,232
no one cares about her or her dreams.

390
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,443
And soon enough, those dreams die

391
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:01,320
and our bunny sinks into emotional
and literal squalor...

392
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:02,988
living in a box under a bridge...

393
00:25:03,156 --> 00:25:05,491
till finally she has no choice
but to go back home...

394
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:08,160
with that cute, fuzzy-wuzzy little tail
between her legs...

395
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:09,244
to become...

396
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:10,954
You're from Bunnyburrow,
is that what you said?

397
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:13,999
So how about a carrot farmer.
That sound about right?

398
00:25:18,004 --> 00:25:21,215
Be careful, now, or it won't just
be your dreams getting crushed.

399
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:25,511
Hey! No one tells me
what I can or can't be!

400
00:25:25,678 --> 00:25:27,679
Especially not some jerk...

401
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:32,351
who never had the guts to try to be
anything more than a popsicle hustler.

402
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:36,021
All right, look.
Everyone comes to Zootopia...

403
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:37,981
thinking they can be
anything they want.

404
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:39,525
Well, you can't.

405
00:25:39,692 --> 00:25:41,944
You can only be what you are.

406
00:25:42,153 --> 00:25:44,279
Sly fox, dumb bunny.

407
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:46,281
I'm not a dumb bunny.

408
00:25:47,158 --> 00:25:49,743
Right. And that's not wet cement.

409
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:52,663
You'll never be a real cop.

410
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:55,082
You're a cute meter maid, though.

411
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,584
Maybe a supervisor one day.

412
00:25:57,752 --> 00:25:59,670
Hang in there.

413
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:23,735
<i>You can't do nothing right, babe</i>

414
00:26:23,903 --> 00:26:32,989
<i>I'm a loser</i>

415
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:54,088
Oh, hey, it's my parents.

416
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:55,756
<i>Oh, there she is!</i>

417
00:26:55,924 --> 00:26:56,673
<i>Hi, sweetheart!</i>

418
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:59,593
<i>Hey there, Jude the dude.
How was your first day on the force?</i>

419
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:01,762
- It was real great.
- Yeah?

420
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,138
<i>Everything you ever hoped?</i>

421
00:27:03,348 --> 00:27:04,598
Absolutely.

422
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:09,228
And more. Everyone's so nice and...

423
00:27:09,354 --> 00:27:10,771
<i>- I feel like I'm making a difference.
- Wait a second.</i>

424
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:12,189
<i>Holy cripes, Bonnie, look at that.</i>

425
00:27:12,357 --> 00:27:13,899
<i>Oh, my sweet heaven!</i>

426
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:16,068
<i>Judy, are you a meter maid?</i>

427
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:18,654
This? No! Oh, no.
This is just a temporary thing.

428
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:20,114
<i>It's the safest job on the force!</i>

429
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:22,908
<i>She's not a real cop.
Our prayers have been answered!</i>

430
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,285
<i>- Glorious day!
- Meter maid! Meter maid!</i>

431
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:28,122
<i>- Meter maid! Meter maid!
- Dad. Dad. Dad!</i>

432
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:29,957
It's been a really long day.
I should really...

433
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,250
<i>That's right, you get some rest.</i>

434
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:32,751
<i>Those meters
aren't gonna maid themselves.</i>

435
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,294
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

436
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:36,630
Buh-bye.

437
00:27:40,218 --> 00:27:42,803
Hey, buddy, turn down
that depressing music.

438
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:47,141
Leave the meter maid alone.
Didn't you hear her conversation?

439
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:48,434
She feels like a failure!

440
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,144
- Oh, shut up!
- You shut up!

441
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:52,563
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

442
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,481
Tomorrow's another day.

443
00:27:54,649 --> 00:27:56,942
Yeah, but it might be worse!

444
00:27:59,404 --> 00:28:01,321
I was 30 seconds over!

445
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:04,950
You're a real hero, lady!

446
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:08,829
My mommy says
she wishes you were dead.

447
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:13,125
Uncool, rabbit.
My tax dollars pay your salary.

448
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:18,505
I am a real cop. I am a real cop.
I am a real cop.

449
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:21,258
Hey, hey! You, bunny!

450
00:28:21,426 --> 00:28:25,304
Sir. If you have a grievance, you may
contest your citation in traffic court.

451
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,347
What are you talking about?
My shop!

452
00:28:27,515 --> 00:28:29,391
It was just robbed! Look!

453
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,893
He's getting away!

454
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:32,478
Are you a cop or not?

455
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:35,439
Yes! Don't worry, sir!
I've got this!

456
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:41,778
Stop! Stop, in the name of the law!

457
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,781
Catch me if you can, Cottontail!

458
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,290
Coming through!

459
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,167
This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-31.

460
00:28:55,335 --> 00:28:56,460
I got dibs!

461
00:28:56,628 --> 00:28:58,045
Officer Hopps. I am in pursuit!

462
00:29:14,812 --> 00:29:16,438
You!

463
00:29:16,606 --> 00:29:17,397
Freeze!

464
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:19,733
Hey, meter maid! Wait for the real cops!

465
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:22,069
Stop!

466
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:50,889
Sorry. Coming through.

467
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:53,308
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.

468
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,189
Bon voyage-e, flat foot!

469
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,250
Hey, stop right there!

470
00:30:18,376 --> 00:30:19,710
Have a donut, copper!

471
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:24,923
Oh, my God. Did you see
those leopard print jeggings?

472
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:32,514
I love your hair.

473
00:30:33,057 --> 00:30:34,141
Thank you.

474
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:36,977
Come to papa.

475
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:42,649
You're gonna have to be patient and
wait in line just like everyone else...

476
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:44,860
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?

477
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,660
I popped the weasel!

478
00:30:53,828 --> 00:30:55,579
Hopps!

479
00:30:57,624 --> 00:30:59,249
Abandoning your post.

480
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:00,751
Inciting a scurry.

481
00:31:00,918 --> 00:31:02,836
Reckless endangerment of rodents.

482
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,838
But, to be fair...

483
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:08,592
you did stop a master criminal
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.

484
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,928
Hate to disagree with you, sir,
but those aren't onions.

485
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:14,806
<i>Those are a crocus varietal
called midnicampum holicithias.</i>

486
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:16,224
They're a Class-C botanical, sir.

487
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:18,935
I grew up in a family where
plant husbandry was kind of a thing.

488
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:20,604
Shut your tiny mouth now!

489
00:31:21,522 --> 00:31:23,273
Sir, I got the bad guy.

490
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:24,483
That's my job.

491
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:27,778
Your job is putting tickets
on parked cars!

492
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:30,697
<i>Chief, Mrs. Otterton's here
to see you again.</i>

493
00:31:30,865 --> 00:31:31,782
Not now.

494
00:31:31,949 --> 00:31:33,200
<i>Okay, I just didn't know
if you'd want to take it this time.</i>

495
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:34,326
<i>She seems really upset.</i>

496
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:35,911
- Not now!
- Sir...

497
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,873
I don't want to be a meter maid,
I want to be a real cop.

498
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:43,794
Do you think the mayor asked me what
I wanted when he assigned you to me?

499
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:46,171
But, sir, if...

500
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:49,049
Life isn't some cartoon musical
where you sing a little song...

501
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:52,636
and your insipid dreams
magically come true.

502
00:31:52,804 --> 00:31:55,555
So, let it go.

503
00:31:56,516 --> 00:31:59,685
Chief Bogo, please.
Five minutes of your time.

504
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:00,894
I'm sorry, sir.

505
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:03,188
I tried to stop her.
She is super-slippery.

506
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:05,065
I gotta go sit down.

507
00:32:05,316 --> 00:32:08,568
Ma'am, as I've told you,
we're doing everything we can.

508
00:32:08,736 --> 00:32:12,531
My husband has been missing for
10 days. His name is Emmitt Otterton.

509
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:13,740
Yes, I know.

510
00:32:13,908 --> 00:32:15,951
He's a florist.

511
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:19,371
We have two beautiful children.
He would never just disappear.

512
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:22,499
Ma'am, our detectives are very busy.

513
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:26,712
Please. There's got to be someone
to find my Emmitt.

514
00:32:26,838 --> 00:32:27,671
Mrs. Otterton...

515
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,797
I will find him.

516
00:32:30,591 --> 00:32:32,050
Thank you.

517
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:35,262
Bless you. Bless you, little bunny.

518
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:38,974
Take this.

519
00:32:39,142 --> 00:32:41,518
Find my Emmitt. Bring him home...

520
00:32:41,686 --> 00:32:43,603
to me and my babies, please.

521
00:32:44,981 --> 00:32:46,106
Mrs. Otterton, please wait out here.

522
00:32:46,274 --> 00:32:47,941
Of course. Thank you both so much.

523
00:32:48,443 --> 00:32:49,401
One second.

524
00:32:50,945 --> 00:32:52,612
You're fired.

525
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,947
What? Why?

526
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:55,449
Insubordination!

527
00:32:55,616 --> 00:32:57,284
Now. I'm going to open this door...

528
00:32:57,452 --> 00:33:00,245
and you're going to tell that otter
you're a former meter maid...

529
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:02,581
with delusions of grandeur...

530
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,458
who will not be taking the case!

531
00:33:04,584 --> 00:33:07,461
I just heard Officer Hopps
is taking the case.

532
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:09,087
Assistant Mayor Bellwether.

533
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:12,507
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative
is really starting to pay off.

534
00:33:12,675 --> 00:33:15,385
Mayor Lionheart is just gonna
be so jazzed!

535
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:16,470
No, let's not tell
the Mayor just yet.

536
00:33:16,637 --> 00:33:19,473
And I've sent it and it is done,
so I did do that.

537
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,141
Well, I'd say the case is in good hands.

538
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:23,935
Us little guys really need to
stick together, right?

539
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:25,395
Like glue.

540
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:26,980
Good one.

541
00:33:27,148 --> 00:33:29,107
Just call me
if you ever need anything, okay?

542
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:31,026
You've always got a friend
at City Hall, Judy.

543
00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:32,611
All right, bye-bye.

544
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:34,821
Thank you, ma'am.

545
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:41,995
I will give you 48 hours.

546
00:33:42,163 --> 00:33:43,246
Yes!

547
00:33:43,414 --> 00:33:44,664
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.

548
00:33:44,832 --> 00:33:45,457
Okay.

549
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:49,836
But, you strike out, you resign.

550
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:55,175
Okay.

551
00:33:55,343 --> 00:33:56,218
Deal!

552
00:33:56,385 --> 00:34:00,180
Splendid. Clawhauser will
give you the complete case file.

553
00:34:00,423 --> 00:34:01,507
Here you go.

554
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:03,133
One missing otter.

555
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:05,719
That's it?

556
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:09,056
Yikes! That is the smallest case file
I've ever seen.

557
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:11,475
Leads, none. Witnesses, none.

558
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:14,687
And you're not in the computer system
yet, so resources, none!

559
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:19,024
I hope you didn't stake your career
on cracking this one!

560
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:22,444
Okay. Last known sighting.

561
00:34:26,574 --> 00:34:28,867
Can I just borrow...
Thank you.

562
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:33,080
Popsicle?

563
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:34,748
The murder weapon.

564
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,416
Get your popsicle.

565
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:40,254
Yeah. Because that...
What does that mean?

566
00:34:40,421 --> 00:34:41,338
It means...

567
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:44,675
I have a lead.

568
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:52,724
Hi! Hello? It's me, again!

569
00:34:52,892 --> 00:34:54,893
Hey, it's Officer Toot-Toot.

570
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,063
No. Actually, it's Officer Hopps...

571
00:34:58,189 --> 00:35:00,065
and I'm here to ask you some questions
about a case.

572
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:02,693
What happened, meter maid?
Did someone steal a traffic cone?

573
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,569
It wasn't me.

574
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:10,075
Hey, Carrots, you're going to
wake the baby. I gotta get to work.

575
00:35:10,368 --> 00:35:11,451
This is important, sir.

576
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:14,746
I think your $10 worth of popsicles
can wait.

577
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,125
I make 200 bucks a day, Fluff!

578
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:21,461
365 days a year, since I was 12.

579
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:23,213
And time is money. Hop along.

580
00:35:23,381 --> 00:35:25,299
Please, just look at the picture.

581
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:28,051
You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle,
right? Do you know him?

582
00:35:28,177 --> 00:35:28,927
I know everybody.

583
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:31,638
And I also know that, somewhere...

584
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:32,931
there's a toy store
missing its stuffed animal,

585
00:35:33,016 --> 00:35:35,726
so why don't you get back to your box?

586
00:35:35,893 --> 00:35:37,602
Fine. Then we'll have to do this
the hard way.

587
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:40,981
Did you just boot my stroller?

588
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:42,983
Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

589
00:35:43,818 --> 00:35:45,777
For what? Hurting your feelings?

590
00:35:45,945 --> 00:35:47,112
Felony Tax Evasion.

591
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:53,118
Yeah, $200 a day, 365 days a year,
since you were 12.

592
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:57,914
That's two decades, so times 20,
which is $1,460,000, I think.

593
00:35:58,082 --> 00:36:01,626
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,
but we are good at multiplying.

594
00:36:01,794 --> 00:36:03,545
Anyway, according to your tax forms...

595
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:06,423
you reported, let me see here... zero!

596
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:10,844
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form
is a punishable offense.

597
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:12,471
Five years jail time.

598
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,848
Well, it's my word against yours.

599
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:17,684
<i>200 bucks a day, Fluff!</i>

600
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:20,520
<i>365 days a year, since I was 12.</i>

601
00:36:20,688 --> 00:36:22,564
Actually, it's your word against yours.

602
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:26,109
And if you want this pen, you're going to
help me find this poor, missing otter...

603
00:36:26,277 --> 00:36:30,113
or the only place you'll be selling
popsicles is the prison cafeteria.

604
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:32,991
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

605
00:36:33,326 --> 00:36:35,327
She hustled you.

606
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:42,084
She hustled you good!

607
00:36:42,293 --> 00:36:45,337
You a cop now, Nick.
You gonna need one of these.

608
00:36:46,506 --> 00:36:47,672
Have fun...

609
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,882
working with the fuzz!

610
00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:52,552
Start talking.

611
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:56,515
I don't know where he is.
I only saw where he went.

612
00:36:56,766 --> 00:36:57,682
Great. Let's go.

613
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,061
It's not exactly a place for...

614
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,354
a cute little bunny.

615
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:04,481
Don't call me cute. Get in the car.

616
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:06,525
Okay. You're the boss.

617
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:26,920
Hi.

618
00:37:27,046 --> 00:37:31,383
Hello?

619
00:37:31,592 --> 00:37:33,468
Hello? Hello?

620
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:38,098
Hello. My name is...

621
00:37:38,307 --> 00:37:41,393
You know, I'm going to hit
the pause button right there...

622
00:37:41,561 --> 00:37:43,812
because we're all good
on Bunny Scout cookies.

623
00:37:44,814 --> 00:37:45,856
No.

624
00:37:46,023 --> 00:37:48,275
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.

625
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:52,195
I'm looking for a missing mammal,
Emmitt Otterton, right here...

626
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:54,948
who may have frequented
this establishment.

627
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,204
Yeah, old Emmitt.

628
00:38:02,457 --> 00:38:04,749
Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

629
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:08,086
But, hey, you should talk
to his yoga instructor.

630
00:38:08,254 --> 00:38:09,921
I'd be happy to take you back.

631
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:10,964
Thank you so much.

632
00:38:11,132 --> 00:38:13,467
I'd appreciate that more than
you can imagine, it would be such...

633
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:14,676
You are naked!

634
00:38:15,178 --> 00:38:17,929
For sure, we're a naturalist club.

635
00:38:18,097 --> 00:38:21,349
Yeah. In Zootopia,
anyone can be anything.

636
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:23,393
These guys, they be naked.

637
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:26,521
Nangi's just on the other side
of the Pleasure Pool.

638
00:38:33,988 --> 00:38:35,113
Oh, boy.

639
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:37,115
Does this make you uncomfortable?

640
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:40,702
Because if so, there is no
shame in calling it quits.

641
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,829
Yes, there is.

642
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:44,998
Boy, that's the spirit.

643
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:49,294
Yeah, some mammals say
the naturalist life is weird...

644
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:51,546
but you know what I say is weird?

645
00:38:51,672 --> 00:38:53,548
Clothes on animals!

646
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,967
Here we go.

647
00:38:56,135 --> 00:39:00,805
As you can see, Nangi's an elephant,
so she'll totally remember everything.

648
00:39:00,973 --> 00:39:02,140
Hey, Nangi.

649
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:05,519
These dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the otter.

650
00:39:05,686 --> 00:39:06,478
Who?

651
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:09,981
Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to
your yoga class for like...

652
00:39:10,149 --> 00:39:11,483
6 years?

653
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:13,235
I have no memory of this beaver.

654
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:15,153
He's an otter, actually.

655
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:17,030
He was here
a couple Wednesdays ago, remember?

656
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:17,948
No.

657
00:39:18,074 --> 00:39:21,868
Yeah, he was wearing
a green cable-knit sweater vest...

658
00:39:21,994 --> 00:39:27,332
and a new pair of corduroy slacks.
And a paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.

659
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,376
Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?

660
00:39:29,544 --> 00:39:30,293
No.

661
00:39:30,336 --> 00:39:34,214
And we both walked him out,
and he got into this big old white car

662
00:39:34,298 --> 00:39:35,674
with a silver trim.

663
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:38,635
Needed a tune-up.
The third cylinder wasn't firing.

664
00:39:38,803 --> 00:39:40,679
- Remember that, Nangi?
- No.

665
00:39:41,264 --> 00:39:45,600
You didn't happen to catch
the license plate number, did you?

666
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,687
Oh, for sure. It was 2-9...

667
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,605
T- H-D...

668
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:52,649
-0-3.
-0-3. Wow.

669
00:39:52,775 --> 00:39:54,192
This is a lot of great info. Thank you.

670
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,529
Told you Nangi has a mind
like a steel trap.

671
00:39:57,697 --> 00:40:01,741
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

672
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:05,078
Well, I had a ball.

673
00:40:05,246 --> 00:40:06,705
You are welcome for the clue...

674
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:08,748
and seeing as how any moron
can run a plate,

675
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,751
I will take that pen and bid you adieu.

676
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:14,713
The plate. I can't run a plate.

677
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,172
I'm not in the system yet.

678
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:18,425
Give me the pen, please.

679
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:20,051
What was it you said?

680
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:22,220
"Any moron can run a plate"?

681
00:40:22,388 --> 00:40:27,142
Gosh. If only there were a moron around
who were up to the task.

682
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,562
Rabbit, I did what you asked!
You can't keep me on the hook forever.

683
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,941
Not forever. Well, I only have
36 hours left to solve this case.

684
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:37,527
So can you run the plate or not?

685
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:41,323
Actually, I just remembered...

686
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:42,782
<i>I have a pal at the DMV.</i>

687
00:40:44,076 --> 00:40:45,577
<i>Flash is the fastest guy in there.</i>

688
00:40:45,745 --> 00:40:47,412
If you need something done, he's on it.

689
00:40:47,538 --> 00:40:50,081
I hope so. We are really fighting
the clock and every minute counts.

690
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:55,045
Wait. They're all sloths?

691
00:41:23,366 --> 00:41:24,908
You said this was going to be quick!

692
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:28,203
Are you saying that because
he's a sloth, he can't be fast?

693
00:41:28,371 --> 00:41:30,789
I thought in Zootopia,
anyone could be anything.

694
00:41:31,248 --> 00:41:33,792
Flash, Flash, hundred-yard dash.
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

695
00:41:35,127 --> 00:41:36,920
Nice to...

696
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:38,922
see you...

697
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:41,466
too.

698
00:41:41,634 --> 00:41:43,927
Hey, Flash,
I'd love you to meet my friend.

699
00:41:44,428 --> 00:41:46,012
Darling, I've forgotten your name.

700
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:49,307
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD, how are you?

701
00:41:49,475 --> 00:41:50,809
I am...

702
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,310
doing...

703
00:41:52,812 --> 00:41:54,312
just...

704
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:55,647
Fine?

705
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:57,982
...as well as...

706
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,359
I can...

707
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:00,694
be.

708
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:02,112
- What...
- Hang in there.

709
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:03,321
...can I...

710
00:42:04,031 --> 00:42:05,615
- do...
- I was hoping you could run a...

711
00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:06,783
...for you...

712
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:07,992
Well, I was hoping you could...

713
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,202
...today?

714
00:42:11,956 --> 00:42:14,332
Well, I was hoping you could
run a plate for us.

715
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,209
We are in a really big hurry.

716
00:42:17,878 --> 00:42:19,129
Sure.

717
00:42:19,296 --> 00:42:20,630
What's the...

718
00:42:21,173 --> 00:42:22,966
- plate...
-2-9-T...

719
00:42:23,134 --> 00:42:24,259
...number?

720
00:42:25,136 --> 00:42:27,137
2-9-T-H-D-0-3

721
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:37,355
Two...

722
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,650
nine...

723
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,153
T- H-D-0-3.

724
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:45,196
...T...

725
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,490
H- D-0-3.

726
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:49,200
...H...

727
00:42:49,368 --> 00:42:51,369
D-0-3.

728
00:42:54,665 --> 00:42:55,540
...D...

729
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:57,167
0-3.

730
00:42:58,669 --> 00:42:59,377
...0...

731
00:42:59,545 --> 00:43:00,628
3.

732
00:43:02,548 --> 00:43:04,048
Hey, Flash, want to hear a joke?

733
00:43:04,216 --> 00:43:05,216
No!

734
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:06,676
Sure.

735
00:43:07,136 --> 00:43:11,222
Okay. What do you call
a three-humped camel?

736
00:43:12,224 --> 00:43:13,641
I don't...

737
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:15,018
know.

738
00:43:15,186 --> 00:43:16,227
What...

739
00:43:16,353 --> 00:43:17,395
do...

740
00:43:17,563 --> 00:43:19,230
you call...

741
00:43:19,398 --> 00:43:21,316
- a...
- Three-humped camel.

742
00:43:21,484 --> 00:43:22,901
...three-humped...

743
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:23,902
camel?

744
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,070
Pregnant.

745
00:43:41,629 --> 00:43:43,004
Yes, very funny, very funny.

746
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:44,422
Can we please just focus on the...

747
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,049
- Hey...
- Wait, wait, wait!

748
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:47,425
...Priscilla!

749
00:43:47,593 --> 00:43:48,760
Oh, no!

750
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:51,262
Yes...

751
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,097
Flash?

752
00:43:53,182 --> 00:43:53,932
What...

753
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:54,933
do...

754
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,768
- No!
- ... you call a...

755
00:43:56,936 --> 00:43:59,354
A three-humped camel? "Pregnant!"
Okay, great, we got it.

756
00:43:59,522 --> 00:44:01,940
...three... humped...

757
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:16,079
- Here...
- Yeah. Hurry.

758
00:44:16,247 --> 00:44:18,289
- ... you...
- Thank you. "2-9-T-H-D-0-3."

759
00:44:18,457 --> 00:44:19,374
...go.

760
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,918
It's registered to
Tundratown Limo Service.

761
00:44:22,086 --> 00:44:25,255
A limo took Otterton,
and the limo's in Tundratown!

762
00:44:25,422 --> 00:44:27,173
Way to hustle, bud.
I love you. I owe you.

763
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:29,133
Hurry! We gotta beat
the rush hour, and...

764
00:44:29,301 --> 00:44:31,261
It's night?

765
00:44:32,346 --> 00:44:34,055
Closed. Great.

766
00:44:34,306 --> 00:44:38,142
And I will bet you
you don't have a warrant to get in.

767
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,186
Darn it. It's a bummer.

768
00:44:40,354 --> 00:44:42,272
You wasted the day on purpose.

769
00:44:42,439 --> 00:44:44,148
Madam, I have a fake badge.

770
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:46,651
I would never impede
your pretend investigation.

771
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:51,948
It's not a pretend investigation. Look,
see? See him? This otter is missing.

772
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:54,826
Then they should've gotten
a real cop to find him.

773
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:56,202
What is your problem?

774
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,246
Does seeing me fail
somehow make you feel better

775
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,164
about your own sad, miserable life?

776
00:45:00,332 --> 00:45:02,375
It does. 100%.

777
00:45:02,585 --> 00:45:05,795
Now, since you're sans warrant...

778
00:45:05,963 --> 00:45:08,798
I guess we're... done?

779
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:13,511
Fine. We are done.
Here's your pen.

780
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:15,513
Hey!

781
00:45:19,393 --> 00:45:20,935
First off, you throw like a bunny.

782
00:45:21,103 --> 00:45:24,606
Second, you're a very sore loser.
See you later, Officer Fluff.

783
00:45:24,773 --> 00:45:27,567
So sad this is over.
I wish I could've helped more.

784
00:45:27,735 --> 00:45:30,945
The thing is, you don't need a warrant
if you have probable cause...

785
00:45:31,113 --> 00:45:35,033
and I'm pretty sure I saw
a shifty lowlife climbing the fence.

786
00:45:35,242 --> 00:45:37,744
So you're helping plenty. Come on.

787
00:45:39,914 --> 00:45:42,582
2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
This is it!

788
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,675
Polar bear fur.

789
00:45:55,888 --> 00:45:57,305
- Oh, my God!
- What?

790
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:00,224
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole.

791
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,435
But on CD.

792
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:03,978
Who still uses CDs?

793
00:46:10,027 --> 00:46:14,322
Carrots, if your otter was here,
he had a very bad day.

794
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:18,284
Those are claw marks.

795
00:46:18,994 --> 00:46:20,662
You ever seen anything like this?

796
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:21,871
No.

797
00:46:22,414 --> 00:46:23,790
Wait, look.

798
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,159
This is him, Emmitt Otterton.

799
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,703
He was definitely here.

800
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,039
What do you think happened?

801
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,918
Now, wait a minute.

802
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,673
Polar bear fur,
Rat Pack music, fancy cup?

803
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,882
I know whose car this is. We got to go.

804
00:46:43,623 --> 00:46:44,582
Why? Whose car is it?

805
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:47,668
The most feared crime-boss
in Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big.

806
00:46:47,836 --> 00:46:50,296
And he does not like me.
So we gotta go!

807
00:46:50,464 --> 00:46:52,256
I'm not leaving.
This is a crime scene.

808
00:46:52,466 --> 00:46:54,759
It's gonna be an even bigger
crime scene if Mr. Big finds me here...

809
00:46:54,968 --> 00:46:56,260
so we're leaving right now.

810
00:46:57,888 --> 00:46:58,888
Raymond!

811
00:46:59,056 --> 00:47:01,098
And is that Kevin?
Long time, no see.

812
00:47:01,683 --> 00:47:06,353
And, speaking of "no see,"
how about you forget you saw me?

813
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:07,563
For old times' sake?

814
00:47:07,814 --> 00:47:08,773
That's a no.

815
00:47:22,746 --> 00:47:24,997
What did you do that made
Mr. Big so mad at you?

816
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:28,793
I may have sold him
a very expensive wool rug...

817
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,838
that was made from the fur
of a skunk...

818
00:47:33,006 --> 00:47:35,007
...'s butt.

819
00:47:36,009 --> 00:47:38,302
Sweet cheese and crackers.

820
00:47:53,068 --> 00:47:54,443
Is that Mr. Big?

821
00:47:54,653 --> 00:47:55,653
No.

822
00:47:55,821 --> 00:47:56,987
What about him?

823
00:47:57,155 --> 00:47:58,322
- Is that him?
- No!

824
00:48:01,368 --> 00:48:02,368
That's got to be him.

825
00:48:02,536 --> 00:48:04,078
Stop talking, stop talking,
stop talking!

826
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,464
Mr. Big, sir. This is a simple...

827
00:48:17,175 --> 00:48:18,217
Yeah.

828
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,429
This is a simple misunderstanding.

829
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:27,351
You come here, unannounced, on the
day my daughter is to be married.

830
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:29,520
Well, actually, we were brought here
against our will, so...

831
00:48:31,273 --> 00:48:33,482
The point is, I did not know
that it was your car...

832
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,152
and I certainly did not know
about your daughter's wedding.

833
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:39,280
I trusted you, Nicky.

834
00:48:39,406 --> 00:48:41,323
I welcomed you into my home.

835
00:48:41,491 --> 00:48:43,742
We broke bread together.

836
00:48:44,327 --> 00:48:46,370
Gram-mama made you a cannoli.

837
00:48:46,538 --> 00:48:48,664
And how did you repay my generosity?

838
00:48:48,832 --> 00:48:52,793
With a rug made from the butt
of a skunk.

839
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:54,753
A skunk-butt rug.

840
00:48:54,921 --> 00:48:56,463
You disrespected me.

841
00:48:56,631 --> 00:49:01,385
You disrespected my Gram-mama,
who I buried in that skunk butt rug.

842
00:49:02,929 --> 00:49:06,640
I told you never to show your face
here again but here you are...

843
00:49:06,808 --> 00:49:09,727
snooping around with this...

844
00:49:09,895 --> 00:49:11,187
What are you? A performer?

845
00:49:11,354 --> 00:49:12,521
What's with the costume?

846
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:13,480
Sir. I am a...

847
00:49:13,648 --> 00:49:15,149
Mime! She is a mime.

848
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:18,485
This... mime cannot speak.
You can't speak if you're a mime.

849
00:49:18,653 --> 00:49:19,904
No, I am a cop.

850
00:49:20,071 --> 00:49:21,697
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.

851
00:49:21,865 --> 00:49:24,408
And my evidence puts him in your car.

852
00:49:24,576 --> 00:49:26,118
So intimidate me all you want.

853
00:49:26,286 --> 00:49:31,040
I'm going to find out what you did
to that otter if it's the last thing I do.

854
00:49:33,084 --> 00:49:35,961
Then I have only one request.

855
00:49:36,129 --> 00:49:39,548
Say hello to Gram-mama.
Ice 'em.

856
00:49:41,176 --> 00:49:42,635
I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!

857
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:44,053
And you never will.

858
00:49:44,221 --> 00:49:45,638
Please! No, no, no!

859
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:48,390
If you're mad at me about the rug,
I've got more rugs!

860
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,561
Daddy! It's time for our dance!

861
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,272
What did we say?

862
00:49:55,482 --> 00:49:57,524
No icing anyone at my wedding!

863
00:49:57,692 --> 00:50:00,152
I have to, baby. Daddy has to.

864
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,237
Ice 'em.

865
00:50:01,404 --> 00:50:02,279
No, no no!

866
00:50:02,447 --> 00:50:03,405
Wait. Please!

867
00:50:03,907 --> 00:50:06,951
She's the bunny
that saved my life yesterday!

868
00:50:07,118 --> 00:50:08,369
From that giant donut.

869
00:50:08,536 --> 00:50:09,536
This bunny?

870
00:50:09,704 --> 00:50:11,372
Yeah! Hi!

871
00:50:11,581 --> 00:50:13,958
Hi. I love your dress.

872
00:50:14,584 --> 00:50:15,668
Thank you.

873
00:50:16,169 --> 00:50:17,169
Put 'em down.

874
00:50:21,007 --> 00:50:22,383
You've done me a great service.

875
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,718
I will help you find the otter.

876
00:50:24,886 --> 00:50:29,807
I will take your kindness
and pay it forward.

877
00:50:57,794 --> 00:50:59,503
Otterton is my florist.

878
00:51:00,046 --> 00:51:02,423
He's like a part of the family.

879
00:51:02,632 --> 00:51:05,551
He had something important
he wanted to discuss.

880
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:08,637
That's why I sent that car
to pick him up.

881
00:51:09,347 --> 00:51:11,098
But he never arrived.

882
00:51:11,474 --> 00:51:13,017
Because he was attacked.

883
00:51:13,184 --> 00:51:15,686
No. He attacked.

884
00:51:16,187 --> 00:51:17,271
Otterton?

885
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,566
Otterton. He went crazy.

886
00:51:20,734 --> 00:51:24,695
Ripped up the car,
scared my driver half to death...

887
00:51:24,863 --> 00:51:27,364
and disappeared into the night.

888
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:30,659
But he's a sweet little otter.

889
00:51:31,703 --> 00:51:36,040
My child, we may be evolved,
but deep down...

890
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:38,417
we are still animals.

891
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:43,672
<i>You want to find Otterton,
talk to the driver of that car.</i>

892
00:51:43,757 --> 00:51:45,341
<i>His name is Manchas...</i>

893
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:48,052
<i>lives in the Rainforest District.</i>

894
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:50,721
<i>Only he can tell you more.</i>

895
00:51:54,517 --> 00:51:56,185
Mr. Manchas?

896
00:51:56,353 --> 00:51:58,395
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

897
00:51:58,605 --> 00:52:01,607
We just wanna know
what happened to Emmitt Otterton.

898
00:52:06,446 --> 00:52:07,529
You...

899
00:52:07,697 --> 00:52:08,906
should be asking...

900
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:11,867
what happened to me.

901
00:52:13,036 --> 00:52:15,996
A teensy otter did that?

902
00:52:16,164 --> 00:52:17,456
What happened?

903
00:52:17,665 --> 00:52:19,458
He was an animal.

904
00:52:20,877 --> 00:52:21,794
<i>Down...</i>

905
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:24,421
<i>on all fours.</i>

906
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:28,884
<i>He was a savage!</i>

907
00:52:39,646 --> 00:52:40,813
There was no warning.

908
00:52:41,022 --> 00:52:43,232
He just kept yelling
about the Night Howlers.

909
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:46,944
Over and over. The Night Howlers.

910
00:52:47,112 --> 00:52:50,489
So you know about
the Night Howlers, too?

911
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,074
Good. Good, good.

912
00:52:52,283 --> 00:52:56,829
Because the Night Howlers are exactly
what we are here to talk about.

913
00:52:56,996 --> 00:52:58,372
- Right?
- Yup.

914
00:52:59,165 --> 00:53:01,250
So, you just open the door...

915
00:53:01,418 --> 00:53:03,001
and tell us what you know...

916
00:53:03,169 --> 00:53:05,295
and we will tell you
what we know. Okay?

917
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:08,966
Okay.

918
00:53:10,009 --> 00:53:11,969
Clever fox.

919
00:53:15,682 --> 00:53:17,808
Mr. Manchas?

920
00:53:22,147 --> 00:53:22,980
Buddy?

921
00:53:23,148 --> 00:53:24,273
Are you...

922
00:53:24,399 --> 00:53:25,274
okay?

923
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,820
Run. Run!

924
00:53:34,784 --> 00:53:35,909
What is wrong with him?

925
00:53:36,077 --> 00:53:37,411
I don't know!

926
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:43,333
Jump!

927
00:53:46,004 --> 00:53:47,004
Come on!

928
00:53:51,968 --> 00:53:53,093
Head down!

929
00:53:55,096 --> 00:53:56,555
Officer Hopps to Dispatch.

930
00:53:56,723 --> 00:54:00,017
Are you familiar with Gazelle, greatest
singer of our lifetime, angel with horns?

931
00:54:00,185 --> 00:54:03,270
Okay, hold on. Keep watching.
Who's that beside her? Who is it?

932
00:54:03,354 --> 00:54:06,648
<i>Wow, you are one hot dancer,
Benjamin Clawhauser.</i>

933
00:54:08,276 --> 00:54:11,737
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real!

934
00:54:11,905 --> 00:54:14,573
It's not, it's just a new app.
Hold on a second.

935
00:54:14,741 --> 00:54:16,200
<i>Clawhauser!</i>

936
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:20,245
Listen to me, we have a 10-91!
Jaguar gone savage!

937
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:21,330
Vine and Tuh-junja!

938
00:54:21,498 --> 00:54:22,664
It's "Tuh-hunga!"

939
00:54:23,249 --> 00:54:24,833
<i>Okay, we're sending backup! Hopps?</i>

940
00:54:25,293 --> 00:54:26,752
<i>Hopps!</i>

941
00:54:28,421 --> 00:54:29,213
There!

942
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:30,839
Head for the sky trams!

943
00:54:40,183 --> 00:54:41,808
Get in! Carrots.

944
00:54:41,976 --> 00:54:42,935
Carrots!

945
00:54:43,102 --> 00:54:43,936
Go!

946
00:54:45,355 --> 00:54:47,189
No, no, no!

947
00:54:47,357 --> 00:54:48,607
Buddy.

948
00:54:48,775 --> 00:54:50,567
One predator to another...

949
00:54:54,906 --> 00:54:56,698
Now, I can tell you're a little tense...

950
00:54:56,866 --> 00:54:58,534
so I'm just gonna give you
a little personal space!

951
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:07,209
Rabbit, whatever you do,
do not let go!

952
00:55:08,545 --> 00:55:10,337
- I'm gonna let go!
- No, you, what?

953
00:55:10,421 --> 00:55:12,422
One, two...

954
00:55:19,264 --> 00:55:21,932
Carrots. You saved my life.

955
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,310
Well. That's what we do at the ZPD.

956
00:55:42,412 --> 00:55:44,454
Well, this should be good.

957
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:47,583
I thought this was
just a missing mammal case...

958
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,251
but it's way bigger.

959
00:55:49,419 --> 00:55:51,545
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

960
00:55:51,713 --> 00:55:55,757
I believe he and this jaguar,
they went savage, sir.

961
00:55:55,925 --> 00:56:00,804
Savage? This isn't the Stone Age,
Hopps. Animals don't "go savage. "

962
00:56:00,888 --> 00:56:03,974
I thought so, too, until I saw this.

963
00:56:06,102 --> 00:56:08,895
What? He was right here.

964
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,522
The "savage" jaguar?

965
00:56:10,648 --> 00:56:13,567
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!

966
00:56:13,651 --> 00:56:19,156
Or, maybe any aggressive predator
looks savage to you rabbits.

967
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,157
Let's go!

968
00:56:20,325 --> 00:56:21,325
Wait, sir.

969
00:56:21,492 --> 00:56:23,410
I'm not the only one who saw him.

970
00:56:23,494 --> 00:56:24,745
Nick!

971
00:56:25,455 --> 00:56:27,372
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

972
00:56:27,498 --> 00:56:29,249
He was a key witness, and I...

973
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:31,585
Two days to find the otter...

974
00:56:31,669 --> 00:56:34,004
or you quit.

975
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,881
That was the deal.

976
00:56:36,007 --> 00:56:37,549
Badge.

977
00:56:43,014 --> 00:56:44,806
- But, sir, we...
- Badge!

978
00:56:50,313 --> 00:56:51,772
No.

979
00:56:52,649 --> 00:56:54,316
What did you say, fox?

980
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,944
Sorry. What I said was, "no. "

981
00:56:58,029 --> 00:57:00,864
She will not be giving you that badge.

982
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,743
Look, you give her a clown vest
and a three-wheeled joke-mobile...

983
00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:07,788
and two days to solve a case
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

984
00:57:08,665 --> 00:57:09,748
Yeah.

985
00:57:09,874 --> 00:57:11,375
No wonder she needed to get help
from a fox.

986
00:57:11,542 --> 00:57:13,710
None of you guys
were gonna help her, were you?

987
00:57:13,878 --> 00:57:15,212
Here's the thing, Chief.

988
00:57:15,338 --> 00:57:16,797
You gave her the 48 hours...

989
00:57:16,881 --> 00:57:18,882
so, technically, we still have...

990
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:21,176
10 left to find our Mr. Otterton...

991
00:57:21,344 --> 00:57:23,679
and that is exactly
what we're gonna do.

992
00:57:23,846 --> 00:57:28,183
So, if you'll excuse us, we have a very
big lead to follow and a case to crack.

993
00:57:28,351 --> 00:57:29,685
Good day.

994
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:36,983
Officer Hopps.

995
00:57:59,549 --> 00:58:01,091
Thank you.

996
00:58:02,176 --> 00:58:04,594
Never let them see that they get to you.

997
00:58:05,847 --> 00:58:07,097
So...

998
00:58:07,265 --> 00:58:09,683
things do get to you?

999
00:58:09,851 --> 00:58:12,269
No, I mean, not anymore...

1000
00:58:12,437 --> 00:58:16,440
but I was small and emotionally
unbalanced like you once.

1001
00:58:16,607 --> 00:58:17,566
Har-har.

1002
00:58:17,734 --> 00:58:19,693
No, it's true.

1003
00:58:19,861 --> 00:58:22,946
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

1004
00:58:23,114 --> 00:58:28,118
and all I wanted to do
was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

1005
00:58:28,202 --> 00:58:30,996
<i>So, my mom scraped together
enough money</i>

1006
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,457
<i>to buy me a brand-new uniform...</i>

1007
00:58:33,624 --> 00:58:36,168
<i>because, by God, I was gonna fit in.</i>

1008
00:58:36,335 --> 00:58:39,713
<i>Even if I was the only predator
in the troop.</i>

1009
00:58:39,797 --> 00:58:40,714
<i>The only fox.</i>

1010
00:58:40,882 --> 00:58:41,715
Okay, Nick.

1011
00:58:41,883 --> 00:58:43,467
<i>I was gonna be part of a pack.</i>

1012
00:58:43,593 --> 00:58:45,093
Ready for initiation?

1013
00:58:45,178 --> 00:58:47,053
Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

1014
00:58:47,138 --> 00:58:48,889
<i>I was so proud.</i>

1015
00:58:51,809 --> 00:58:52,642
Okay.

1016
00:58:52,769 --> 00:58:55,228
Now, raise your right paw
and deliver the oath.

1017
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:58,815
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave...

1018
00:58:58,983 --> 00:59:01,902
loyal, helpful, and trustworthy.

1019
00:59:03,112 --> 00:59:05,906
Even though you're a fox?

1020
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:07,324
What?

1021
00:59:09,827 --> 00:59:12,162
No! What did I do wrong, you guys?

1022
00:59:12,288 --> 00:59:14,498
No, please! Tell me!
What did I do wrong?

1023
00:59:14,624 --> 00:59:16,249
<i>What did I do?</i>

1024
00:59:18,127 --> 00:59:20,670
If you thought we would ever
trust a fox without a muzzle...

1025
00:59:21,088 --> 00:59:23,757
you're even dumber than you look!

1026
00:59:25,092 --> 00:59:27,886
Aw, is he gonna cry?

1027
00:59:43,569 --> 00:59:46,071
<i>I learned two things that day.</i>

1028
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:47,531
One...

1029
00:59:47,698 --> 00:59:51,743
I was never gonna let anyone see
that they got to me.

1030
00:59:52,537 --> 00:59:55,038
And two?

1031
00:59:55,164 --> 01:00:00,168
If the world's only gonna see a fox
as shifty and untrustworthy...

1032
01:00:00,336 --> 01:00:03,338
there's no point in trying
to be anything else.

1033
01:00:03,506 --> 01:00:07,050
Nick, you are so much more than that.

1034
01:00:11,222 --> 01:00:12,848
Boy, look at that traffic down there.

1035
01:00:13,015 --> 01:00:14,683
How about we go out to Chuck
in Traffic Central.

1036
01:00:14,851 --> 01:00:16,560
Chuck, how are things looking
on the Jam Cams?

1037
01:00:17,728 --> 01:00:19,855
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

1038
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:22,315
The Jam Cams.

1039
01:00:22,483 --> 01:00:25,151
- Seriously. It's okay.
- No, no, no.

1040
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:28,488
There are traffic cameras everywhere!

1041
01:00:28,656 --> 01:00:30,365
All over the canopy!

1042
01:00:30,449 --> 01:00:31,741
Whatever happened to that jaguar...

1043
01:00:31,909 --> 01:00:33,118
The traffic cams would have caught it!

1044
01:00:33,286 --> 01:00:34,119
Bingo!

1045
01:00:34,662 --> 01:00:36,121
Pretty sneaky, slick!

1046
01:00:36,289 --> 01:00:39,624
However, if you didn't have access
to the system before...

1047
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:43,420
I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt
is gonna let you into it now.

1048
01:00:43,588 --> 01:00:44,754
No.

1049
01:00:45,631 --> 01:00:47,924
But I have a friend
at City Hall who might.

1050
01:00:48,801 --> 01:00:51,511
Sir, if we could just review
these very important...

1051
01:00:52,138 --> 01:00:52,888
Sir...

1052
01:00:53,055 --> 01:00:54,431
I'm so sorry. Sir!

1053
01:00:54,557 --> 01:00:57,601
Okay. I heard you, Bellwether.
Just take care of it.

1054
01:00:58,269 --> 01:01:00,645
Please. And clear my afternoon.
I'm going out.

1055
01:01:00,813 --> 01:01:03,231
No, no! But, sir, you do have a meeting
with Herds and Grazing.

1056
01:01:03,399 --> 01:01:04,774
Sir, if I could just...

1057
01:01:06,485 --> 01:01:08,445
Oh, mutton chops.

1058
01:01:10,197 --> 01:01:11,656
Assistant Mayor Bellwether?

1059
01:01:11,824 --> 01:01:13,033
We need your help.

1060
01:01:14,535 --> 01:01:16,244
We just need to get into
the traffic cam database.

1061
01:01:25,338 --> 01:01:26,922
So fluffy!

1062
01:01:27,089 --> 01:01:27,839
Hey!

1063
01:01:28,007 --> 01:01:29,466
Sheep never let me get this close.

1064
01:01:29,634 --> 01:01:31,009
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

1065
01:01:31,177 --> 01:01:32,177
It's like cotton candy.

1066
01:01:32,345 --> 01:01:33,303
Stop it!

1067
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:34,554
Where to?

1068
01:01:35,014 --> 01:01:37,974
Rainforest District, Vine and Tujunga.

1069
01:01:38,267 --> 01:01:40,060
There! Traffic cams for the whole city.

1070
01:01:40,227 --> 01:01:42,437
This is so exciting, actually!

1071
01:01:42,605 --> 01:01:44,230
I never get to do
anything this important.

1072
01:01:44,398 --> 01:01:46,775
But you're the Assistant Mayor
of Zootopia.

1073
01:01:46,943 --> 01:01:49,319
I'm more of a glorified secretary.

1074
01:01:49,487 --> 01:01:51,947
I think Mayor Lionheart
just wanted the sheep vote.

1075
01:01:52,114 --> 01:01:53,448
But he did give me that nice mug.

1076
01:01:55,653 --> 01:01:57,070
Feels good to be appreciated.

1077
01:01:57,238 --> 01:01:58,530
<i>Smell-wether!</i>

1078
01:01:58,698 --> 01:02:01,408
That's a fun little name he likes to use.

1079
01:02:01,576 --> 01:02:03,451
I called him Lion-fart once.

1080
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:06,037
He did not care for that. Let me tell you,
it was not a good day for me.

1081
01:02:06,205 --> 01:02:06,955
Yes, sir?

1082
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:08,748
<i>I thought you were going to
cancel my afternoon!</i>

1083
01:02:08,999 --> 01:02:10,792
Oh, dear. I better go.

1084
01:02:10,918 --> 01:02:14,546
Let me know what you find.
It was really nice for me to be...

1085
01:02:14,713 --> 01:02:16,631
<i>While we're young, Smell-wether!</i>

1086
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,760
You think when she goes to sleep
she counts herself?

1087
01:02:20,928 --> 01:02:22,804
Shush. Okay, traffic cams.

1088
01:02:23,055 --> 01:02:26,099
Tujunga, Tujunga... We're in.

1089
01:02:31,689 --> 01:02:33,481
Who are these guys?

1090
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,485
Timberwolves.
Look at these dumb-dumbs.

1091
01:02:42,116 --> 01:02:44,742
Bet you a nickel
one of them is gonna howl.

1092
01:02:44,868 --> 01:02:46,202
And there it is.

1093
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:49,122
What is it with wolves and the howling?
It's like...

1094
01:02:49,206 --> 01:02:51,124
Howlers. Night Howlers.

1095
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:53,459
That's what Manchas was afraid of!
Wolves!

1096
01:02:53,627 --> 01:02:56,087
The wolves are the Night Howlers.
If they took Manchas...

1097
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,964
I'll bet they took Otterton, too.

1098
01:02:58,132 --> 01:03:00,675
All we gotta do
is find out where they went.

1099
01:03:08,225 --> 01:03:09,100
Wait, where did they go?

1100
01:03:09,268 --> 01:03:12,478
If I wanted to avoid surveillance
because I was doing something illegal...

1101
01:03:12,646 --> 01:03:13,605
which I never have...

1102
01:03:13,772 --> 01:03:15,565
I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.

1103
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:17,525
Which would put them out...

1104
01:03:17,651 --> 01:03:19,736
right there.

1105
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:23,448
Well, look at you, Junior Detective.

1106
01:03:23,532 --> 01:03:27,744
You know, I think you'd actually
make a pretty good cop.

1107
01:03:27,911 --> 01:03:29,162
How dare you.

1108
01:03:29,913 --> 01:03:31,122
Acacia Alley?

1109
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:32,624
Ficus Underpass.

1110
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,000
South Canyon.

1111
01:03:34,084 --> 01:03:35,001
They're heading out of town.

1112
01:03:35,794 --> 01:03:37,378
Where does that road go?

1113
01:04:21,965 --> 01:04:23,132
Gary, quit it!

1114
01:04:23,258 --> 01:04:24,175
You're gonna start a howl.

1115
01:04:24,343 --> 01:04:25,343
I didn't start it!

1116
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:34,268
Come on.

1117
01:04:42,069 --> 01:04:44,696
You are a clever bunny.

1118
01:05:00,462 --> 01:05:03,673
It looks like this was a hospital.

1119
01:05:16,687 --> 01:05:18,604
You know, after you.
You're the cop.

1120
01:05:27,072 --> 01:05:29,240
Okay, all clear.

1121
01:05:34,204 --> 01:05:36,581
All this equipment is brand new.

1122
01:05:38,292 --> 01:05:39,292
Carrots.

1123
01:05:41,962 --> 01:05:43,004
Claw marks.

1124
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:45,548
Yeah, huge claw marks.
What kind of...

1125
01:06:05,152 --> 01:06:07,069
Mr. Manchas.

1126
01:06:16,914 --> 01:06:18,414
It's him.

1127
01:06:18,582 --> 01:06:20,583
We found our otter.

1128
01:06:20,751 --> 01:06:22,335
Mr. Otterton.

1129
01:06:22,544 --> 01:06:25,880
My name is Officer Judy Hopps.
Your wife sent me to find you.

1130
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,840
We're gonna get you out of here now.

1131
01:06:29,134 --> 01:06:30,384
Or not.

1132
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:32,804
Guess he's in no rush
to get home to the missus.

1133
01:06:32,971 --> 01:06:35,223
11, 12, 13, 14...

1134
01:06:35,307 --> 01:06:38,518
Not including Manchas, it's 14.

1135
01:06:38,602 --> 01:06:41,479
Chief Bogo
handed out 14 missing mammal files.

1136
01:06:41,563 --> 01:06:42,605
They're all here.

1137
01:06:42,689 --> 01:06:46,442
All the missing mammals are right here.

1138
01:06:51,657 --> 01:06:54,575
Enough! I don't want excuses, Doctor!

1139
01:06:54,701 --> 01:06:55,576
I want answers.

1140
01:06:55,744 --> 01:06:57,036
Mayor Lionheart, please.

1141
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,038
We're doing everything we can.

1142
01:06:59,122 --> 01:07:00,039
Really?

1143
01:07:00,123 --> 01:07:02,041
Because I got a dozen and a half
animals here

1144
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:03,876
who have gone off-the-rails crazy...

1145
01:07:04,044 --> 01:07:05,586
and you can't tell me why.

1146
01:07:05,712 --> 01:07:08,339
Now, I'd call that awfully far
from "doing everything. "

1147
01:07:08,507 --> 01:07:09,715
Sir...

1148
01:07:09,842 --> 01:07:11,592
it may be time
to consider their biology.

1149
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,636
What? What do you mean "biology?"

1150
01:07:13,762 --> 01:07:16,639
The only animals going savage
are predators.

1151
01:07:16,765 --> 01:07:19,433
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.

1152
01:07:20,727 --> 01:07:22,436
Great idea. Tell the public.

1153
01:07:22,604 --> 01:07:25,565
And how do you think they're gonna feel
about their mayor...

1154
01:07:25,732 --> 01:07:27,400
who is a lion?

1155
01:07:27,484 --> 01:07:28,651
I'll be ruined!

1156
01:07:28,735 --> 01:07:30,027
Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

1157
01:07:30,195 --> 01:07:32,321
Chief Bogo doesn't know.

1158
01:07:32,489 --> 01:07:35,741
And we are going to keep it that way.

1159
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:37,368
No, no, no!

1160
01:07:37,578 --> 01:07:38,828
Someone's here.

1161
01:07:38,996 --> 01:07:40,413
Sir, you need to go, now!

1162
01:07:40,581 --> 01:07:42,248
Security! Sweep the area!

1163
01:07:50,382 --> 01:07:52,174
Great! We're dead. We're dead.

1164
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:54,635
That's it. I'm dead, you're dead.
Everybody's dead!

1165
01:07:54,761 --> 01:07:55,845
Can you swim?

1166
01:07:56,013 --> 01:07:58,848
What? Can I swim?
Yes, I can swim. Why?

1167
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:22,705
Carrots! Hopps! Judy!

1168
01:08:23,415 --> 01:08:25,124
We gotta tell Bogo!

1169
01:08:26,293 --> 01:08:30,713
<i>Wow! You are one hot dancer,
Chief Bogo.</i>

1170
01:08:33,258 --> 01:08:35,051
- Chief Bogo!
- Not now!

1171
01:08:35,135 --> 01:08:36,135
Wait, is that Gazelle?

1172
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:37,053
No.

1173
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:40,056
<i>I'm Gazelle,
and you are one hot dancer.</i>

1174
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:41,891
You have the app too?

1175
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,435
Chief!

1176
01:08:44,603 --> 01:08:47,271
Clawhauser, can't you see I'm working
on the missing mammal cases?

1177
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:49,607
Yes of course! About that, sir.
Officer Hopps just called.

1178
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:52,234
She found all of them.

1179
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,071
<i>Wow! I'm impressed.</i>

1180
01:08:58,241 --> 01:09:00,910
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything...

1181
01:09:01,078 --> 01:09:03,746
You don't understand.
I was trying to protect the city!

1182
01:09:03,872 --> 01:09:05,957
You were just trying to protect your job.

1183
01:09:06,124 --> 01:09:08,960
No. Listen, we still don't know
why this is happening.

1184
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:11,420
It could destroy Zootopia.

1185
01:09:11,505 --> 01:09:12,672
You have the right to remain silent.

1186
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:15,299
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1187
01:09:20,806 --> 01:09:22,056
<i>Ladies and gentlemammals.</i>

1188
01:09:23,183 --> 01:09:25,017
<i>14 mammals went missing...</i>

1189
01:09:25,268 --> 01:09:28,854
<i>and all 14 have been found
by our newest recruit...</i>

1190
01:09:29,022 --> 01:09:30,314
<i>who will speak to you in a moment.</i>

1191
01:09:30,482 --> 01:09:31,774
<i>But first, let me remind you...</i>

1192
01:09:31,858 --> 01:09:32,942
I'm so nervous.

1193
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:34,902
Okay. Press Conference 101.

1194
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:37,613
You wanna look smart? Answer
their question with your own question...

1195
01:09:37,781 --> 01:09:40,825
and then answer
that question. Like this.

1196
01:09:40,993 --> 01:09:44,328
"Excuse me. Officer Hopps,
what can you tell us about the case?"

1197
01:09:44,496 --> 01:09:46,080
"Well, was this a tough case?

1198
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:48,374
"Yes. Yes, it was. "
You see?

1199
01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:50,209
You should be there with me.

1200
01:09:50,377 --> 01:09:51,836
We did this together.

1201
01:09:51,962 --> 01:09:55,047
Well, am I a cop?
No. No, I am not.

1202
01:09:55,632 --> 01:09:59,760
Funny you should say that,
because I've been thinking...

1203
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:04,473
It would be nice to have a partner.

1204
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:12,773
Here. In case
you need something to write with.

1205
01:10:14,568 --> 01:10:17,528
<i>At twenty-two hundred hours,
we found all these missing animals...</i>

1206
01:10:17,696 --> 01:10:20,281
Officer Hopps, it's time.

1207
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:24,118
<i>They appear to be in good health,
physically, if not emotionally.</i>

1208
01:10:24,202 --> 01:10:29,165
So now, I'll turn things over
to the officer who cracked the case.

1209
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,042
Officer Judy Hopps.

1210
01:10:32,711 --> 01:10:34,670
- Officer Hopps!
- Officer Hopps!

1211
01:10:34,796 --> 01:10:35,713
Over here!

1212
01:10:35,881 --> 01:10:36,714
Yes?

1213
01:10:36,882 --> 01:10:38,674
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?

1214
01:10:38,842 --> 01:10:43,345
Well, the animals in question...

1215
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:48,476
Are they all different species?

1216
01:10:48,643 --> 01:10:50,644
Yes. Yes, they are.

1217
01:10:51,772 --> 01:10:54,106
Okay, so what is the connection?

1218
01:10:54,191 --> 01:10:57,985
All we know is that they are all
members of the predator family.

1219
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:01,197
So, predators
are the only ones going savage?

1220
01:11:01,281 --> 01:11:04,033
That is accurate. Yes.

1221
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,534
Why is this happening?

1222
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:06,786
We still don't know.

1223
01:11:09,623 --> 01:11:13,375
It may have something
to do with biology.

1224
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:14,835
What do you mean by that?

1225
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,213
A biological component.

1226
01:11:17,297 --> 01:11:20,508
You know, something in their DNA.

1227
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,177
In their DNA?
Can you elaborate on that, please?

1228
01:11:23,261 --> 01:11:27,556
Yes, what I mean is,
thousands of years ago...

1229
01:11:29,226 --> 01:11:34,021
predators survived through
their aggressive...

1230
01:11:34,106 --> 01:11:35,773
hunting instincts.

1231
01:11:35,899 --> 01:11:36,899
For whatever reason...

1232
01:11:37,025 --> 01:11:39,485
they seem to be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways.

1233
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:41,278
Of course they did.

1234
01:11:44,074 --> 01:11:45,491
<i>Aw, is he gonna cry?</i>

1235
01:11:45,575 --> 01:11:47,701
Officer Hopps, could it happen again?

1236
01:11:47,786 --> 01:11:51,163
It is possible.
So we must be vigilant.

1237
01:11:51,248 --> 01:11:54,583
And we at the ZPD are prepared
and are here to protect you.

1238
01:11:54,668 --> 01:11:56,168
Will more mammals go savage?

1239
01:11:56,253 --> 01:11:57,461
What is being done to protect us?

1240
01:11:57,587 --> 01:12:00,005
Have you considered a mandatory
quarantine on predators?

1241
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:03,342
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.
That's all the time that we have.

1242
01:12:03,426 --> 01:12:04,718
No more questions.

1243
01:12:07,264 --> 01:12:08,305
Was I okay?

1244
01:12:08,473 --> 01:12:10,766
You did fine.

1245
01:12:10,934 --> 01:12:12,518
That went so fast.

1246
01:12:12,602 --> 01:12:15,187
I didn't get a chance to mention you,
or say anything about how we...

1247
01:12:15,272 --> 01:12:17,857
I think you said plenty.

1248
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:19,650
What do you mean?

1249
01:12:19,776 --> 01:12:22,153
"Clearly there's
a biological component?"

1250
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:27,158
"These predators may be reverting back
to their primitive, savage ways?"

1251
01:12:27,325 --> 01:12:28,951
Are you serious?

1252
01:12:29,161 --> 01:12:31,620
I just stated
the facts of the case.

1253
01:12:31,788 --> 01:12:34,290
I mean it's not like
a bunny could go savage.

1254
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:36,292
Right. But a fox could?

1255
01:12:36,459 --> 01:12:38,794
Nick, stop it.
You're not like them.

1256
01:12:38,962 --> 01:12:40,713
Oh, there's a "them" now?

1257
01:12:40,881 --> 01:12:43,549
You know what I mean.
You're not that kind of predator.

1258
01:12:43,717 --> 01:12:45,176
The kind that needs to be muzzled?

1259
01:12:45,343 --> 01:12:49,346
The kind that makes you think
you need to carry around fox repellent?

1260
01:12:49,514 --> 01:12:53,350
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice
that little item the first time we met.

1261
01:12:53,518 --> 01:12:56,645
So let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?

1262
01:12:58,231 --> 01:13:00,649
Do you think I might go nuts?

1263
01:13:01,151 --> 01:13:02,985
Do you think I might go savage?

1264
01:13:03,153 --> 01:13:05,237
Do you think I might try to...

1265
01:13:05,405 --> 01:13:06,405
eat you?

1266
01:13:10,035 --> 01:13:11,577
I knew it.

1267
01:13:13,914 --> 01:13:16,165
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me.

1268
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:20,085
Probably best if you don't have
a predator as a partner.

1269
01:13:25,926 --> 01:13:28,010
No. Nick. Nick!

1270
01:13:28,178 --> 01:13:30,179
Officer Hopps! Were you just
threatened by that predator?

1271
01:13:30,347 --> 01:13:32,014
No, he's my friend.

1272
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:33,974
We can't even trust our own friends?

1273
01:13:34,184 --> 01:13:36,018
That is not what I said! Please!

1274
01:13:36,186 --> 01:13:36,852
Are we safe?

1275
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,854
Have any foxes gone savage?

1276
01:13:39,269 --> 01:13:41,562
<i>More bad news in this city
gripped by fear.</i>

1277
01:13:41,647 --> 01:13:44,774
<i>A caribou is in critical condition,
the victim of a mauling...</i>

1278
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:46,943
<i>by a savage polar bear.</i>

1279
01:13:47,069 --> 01:13:49,445
<i>This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week...</i>

1280
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:52,990
<i>after ZPD Officer Judy Hopps
connected the violence</i>

1281
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:55,743
<i>to traditionally predatory animals.</i>

1282
01:13:55,953 --> 01:13:59,622
<i>Meanwhile, a peace rally
organized by pop star Gazelle...</i>

1283
01:13:59,748 --> 01:14:01,207
<i>was marred by protest.</i>

1284
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:02,750
<i>Go back to the forest, predator!</i>

1285
01:14:02,876 --> 01:14:04,877
<i>I'm from the savanna!</i>

1286
01:14:04,962 --> 01:14:06,838
<i>Zootopia is a unique place.</i>

1287
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:10,466
<i>It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city...</i>

1288
01:14:10,634 --> 01:14:13,010
<i>where we celebrate our differences.</i>

1289
01:14:13,178 --> 01:14:14,595
<i>This is not the Zootopia I know.</i>

1290
01:14:16,139 --> 01:14:19,224
<i>The Zootopia I know is better than this.</i>

1291
01:14:19,392 --> 01:14:21,601
<i>We don't just blindly assign blame.</i>

1292
01:14:26,774 --> 01:14:29,067
<i>We don't know why these attacks
keep happening...</i>

1293
01:14:29,944 --> 01:14:34,072
<i>but it is irresponsible
to label all predators as savages.</i>

1294
01:14:40,496 --> 01:14:42,581
That's not my Emmitt.

1295
01:14:45,042 --> 01:14:47,502
<i>We cannot let fear divide us.</i>

1296
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:52,215
<i>Please give me back
the Zootopia I love.</i>

1297
01:14:55,386 --> 01:14:56,761
Come on, Hopps.

1298
01:14:56,929 --> 01:14:58,305
The new mayor wants to see us.

1299
01:14:58,473 --> 01:15:00,765
The mayor? Why?

1300
01:15:00,933 --> 01:15:03,894
It would seem you've arrived.

1301
01:15:07,106 --> 01:15:08,773
Clawhauser?

1302
01:15:08,941 --> 01:15:10,484
What are you doing?

1303
01:15:12,278 --> 01:15:14,154
They thought it would be better...

1304
01:15:14,322 --> 01:15:19,075
if a predator such as myself
wasn't the first face that you see...

1305
01:15:19,243 --> 01:15:21,411
when you walk into the ZPD.

1306
01:15:21,704 --> 01:15:22,829
What?

1307
01:15:23,873 --> 01:15:26,333
They're gonna move me to records.
It's downstairs.

1308
01:15:27,001 --> 01:15:28,960
It's by the boiler.

1309
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,580
Hopps!

1310
01:15:39,505 --> 01:15:40,963
I don't understand.

1311
01:15:41,131 --> 01:15:44,133
Our city is 90% prey, Judy...

1312
01:15:44,301 --> 01:15:46,803
and right now they're just really scared.

1313
01:15:47,513 --> 01:15:50,473
You're a hero to them.
They trust you.

1314
01:15:50,641 --> 01:15:56,979
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want
you to be the public face of the ZPD.

1315
01:16:05,489 --> 01:16:07,156
I'm not a hero.

1316
01:16:07,908 --> 01:16:11,369
I came here
to make the world a better place...

1317
01:16:11,537 --> 01:16:13,079
but I think I broke it.

1318
01:16:13,247 --> 01:16:17,417
Don't give yourself
so much credit, Hopps.

1319
01:16:17,584 --> 01:16:21,003
The world has always been broken,
that's why we need good cops.

1320
01:16:22,506 --> 01:16:23,673
Like you.

1321
01:16:25,259 --> 01:16:30,221
With all due respect, sir, a good cop...

1322
01:16:30,431 --> 01:16:33,683
is supposed to serve and protect.

1323
01:16:33,851 --> 01:16:36,144
Help the city.

1324
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:38,768
Not tear it apart.

1325
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,732
I don't deserve this badge.

1326
01:16:44,858 --> 01:16:45,691
Hopps...

1327
01:16:45,817 --> 01:16:49,028
Judy, you've worked so hard
to get here.

1328
01:16:49,112 --> 01:16:51,739
It's what you wanted
since you were a kid.

1329
01:16:51,865 --> 01:16:53,574
You can't quit.

1330
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:55,743
Thank you for the opportunity.

1331
01:17:15,222 --> 01:17:16,681
A dozen carrots.

1332
01:17:16,848 --> 01:17:17,974
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

1333
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:19,141
Come on.

1334
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:27,817
Hey, there, Jude.
Jude the dude.

1335
01:17:27,985 --> 01:17:30,736
Remember that one?
How we doing?

1336
01:17:30,904 --> 01:17:31,904
I'm fine.

1337
01:17:32,072 --> 01:17:34,532
You are not fine.
Your ears are droopy.

1338
01:17:35,826 --> 01:17:38,202
Why did I think I could
make a difference?

1339
01:17:38,328 --> 01:17:39,954
Because you're a trier,
that's why.

1340
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:41,747
You've always been a trier.

1341
01:17:41,915 --> 01:17:43,374
Oh, I tried.

1342
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:47,336
And it made life so much
worse for so many innocent predators.

1343
01:17:48,088 --> 01:17:49,714
Not all of them, though.
Speak of the devil.

1344
01:17:49,881 --> 01:17:51,132
Right on time.

1345
01:17:53,176 --> 01:17:55,970
Is that Gideon Grey?

1346
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:58,139
Yep. It sure is.
We work with him now.

1347
01:17:58,306 --> 01:17:59,348
He's our partner.

1348
01:17:59,516 --> 01:18:01,517
And we would never have considered it
had you not opened our minds.

1349
01:18:01,685 --> 01:18:02,685
That's right.

1350
01:18:02,853 --> 01:18:05,396
Gid's turned into one of the
top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

1351
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:12,528
That's really cool, you guys.

1352
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:14,363
Gideon Grey.

1353
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:15,948
I'll be darned.

1354
01:18:16,116 --> 01:18:20,578
Hey, Judy. I'd just like to say I'm sorry
for the way I behaved in my youth.

1355
01:18:20,746 --> 01:18:22,538
I had a lot of self-doubt,

1356
01:18:22,622 --> 01:18:26,250
and it manifested itself in the form
of unchecked rage and aggression.

1357
01:18:26,418 --> 01:18:28,544
I was a major jerk.

1358
01:18:29,588 --> 01:18:33,132
I know a thing or two about being a jerk.

1359
01:18:34,217 --> 01:18:36,886
Anyhow, I brought y'all these pies.

1360
01:18:38,263 --> 01:18:41,724
<i>Hey, kids, don't you run through
that midnicampum holicithias.</i>

1361
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,518
Well, now, there's a $4 word, Mr. H.

1362
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:47,313
My family always
just called them Night Howlers.

1363
01:18:48,982 --> 01:18:50,274
What did you say?

1364
01:18:50,442 --> 01:18:51,150
Gid's talking about those flowers, Judy.

1365
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:53,944
I use them to keep the bugs
off the produce...

1366
01:18:54,112 --> 01:18:55,696
but I don't like the little ones
going near 'em...

1367
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:57,239
on account of what happened
to your uncle Terry.

1368
01:18:57,407 --> 01:18:59,241
Yeah, Terry ate one whole
when we were kids

1369
01:18:59,326 --> 01:19:00,576
and went completely nuts.

1370
01:19:00,744 --> 01:19:03,037
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

1371
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:05,539
A bunny can go savage.

1372
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:09,001
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.

1373
01:19:09,169 --> 01:19:13,214
Sure it did! There's a sizable divot
in your arm. I'd call that savage.

1374
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:16,717
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're flowers!

1375
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:19,929
The flowers are making
the predators go savage!

1376
01:19:20,097 --> 01:19:22,098
That's it! That's what I've been missing!

1377
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:23,766
Keys!

1378
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:25,142
Keys, keys, keys!
Hurry! Come on!

1379
01:19:26,103 --> 01:19:27,853
Thank you! I love you! Bye!

1380
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,443
You catch any of that, Bon?

1381
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:35,653
Not one bit.

1382
01:19:35,821 --> 01:19:39,490
That makes me feel a little bit better.
I thought she was talking in tongues.

1383
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,592
Who is it?

1384
01:19:58,885 --> 01:19:59,802
I need to find Nick.

1385
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:01,387
Please.

1386
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:03,639
Nick?

1387
01:20:04,391 --> 01:20:05,724
Nick!

1388
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,062
Oh, Nick.

1389
01:20:10,188 --> 01:20:11,981
Night Howlers aren't wolves.

1390
01:20:12,149 --> 01:20:13,858
They're toxic flowers.

1391
01:20:14,484 --> 01:20:16,068
I think someone
is targeting predators on purpose

1392
01:20:16,153 --> 01:20:18,654
and making them go savage!

1393
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:20,322
Wow.

1394
01:20:21,575 --> 01:20:23,450
Isn't that interesting?

1395
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:29,832
Wait! I know you'll never forgive me!
And I don't blame you.

1396
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:33,752
I wouldn't forgive me either.
I was ignorant...

1397
01:20:34,754 --> 01:20:38,424
And irresponsible and small-minded.

1398
01:20:39,885 --> 01:20:42,428
But predators shouldn't have
to suffer for my mistakes.

1399
01:20:43,346 --> 01:20:45,347
I have to fix this.

1400
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:48,184
But I can't do it without you.

1401
01:20:50,562 --> 01:20:53,230
And after we're done...

1402
01:20:53,398 --> 01:20:55,107
you can hate me.

1403
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:57,776
And that'll be fine.

1404
01:20:57,944 --> 01:21:01,238
Because I was a horrible friend...

1405
01:21:01,406 --> 01:21:02,781
and I hurt you.

1406
01:21:02,949 --> 01:21:09,455
and you can walk away knowing
that you were right all along.

1407
01:21:09,623 --> 01:21:13,584
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1408
01:21:17,547 --> 01:21:26,138
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>

1409
01:21:26,306 --> 01:21:29,225
Don't worry, Carrots.
I'll let you erase it...

1410
01:21:29,392 --> 01:21:30,392
in 48 hours.

1411
01:21:33,313 --> 01:21:35,814
All right. Get in here.

1412
01:21:37,651 --> 01:21:41,737
Okay. You bunnies are so emotional.

1413
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:44,323
There we go. Deep breath.

1414
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:48,160
Are you just trying to steal the pen?
Is that what this is?

1415
01:21:49,162 --> 01:21:51,163
You are standing on my tail, though.
Off, off, off.

1416
01:21:51,248 --> 01:21:52,081
I'm sorry.

1417
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:59,672
I thought you guys only grew carrots.

1418
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:01,548
What's the plan?

1419
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,425
We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.

1420
01:22:03,593 --> 01:22:04,802
Okay. How?

1421
01:22:05,011 --> 01:22:06,303
Know this guy?

1422
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:08,931
I told you. I know everybody.

1423
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:13,394
Step right up.
Anything you need, I got it.

1424
01:22:13,687 --> 01:22:14,603
All your favorite movies!

1425
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,897
I got movies that
haven't even been released yet.

1426
01:22:18,358 --> 01:22:21,402
Hey, 15% off! 20!
Make me an offer! Come on!

1427
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:25,364
Well, well, look who it is.
The duke of bootleg.

1428
01:22:25,615 --> 01:22:26,573
What's it to you, Wilde?

1429
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,075
Shouldn't you be melting down
a popsicle or something?

1430
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:29,326
Hey, if it ain't Flopsy the Copsy.

1431
01:22:30,704 --> 01:22:33,956
We both know those weren't
moldy onions I caught you stealing.

1432
01:22:34,124 --> 01:22:36,375
What were you gonna do
with those Night Howlers, Wezzleton?

1433
01:22:36,543 --> 01:22:38,460
It's Weaselton! Duke Weaselton!

1434
01:22:38,628 --> 01:22:40,462
And I ain't talking, rabbit.

1435
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:42,756
And there ain't nothing
you can do to make me.

1436
01:22:44,342 --> 01:22:45,342
Ice him.

1437
01:22:48,555 --> 01:22:51,098
You dirty rat! Why are you helping her?
She's a cop!

1438
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:54,268
And the godmother
to my future granddaughter.

1439
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,562
I'm gonna name her Judy.

1440
01:22:58,732 --> 01:22:59,898
Ice this weasel.

1441
01:23:00,066 --> 01:23:02,192
All right, all right, please!
I'll talk! I'll talk.

1442
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,861
I stole them Night Howlers
so I could sell 'em.

1443
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:05,863
They offered me what I couldn't refuse.

1444
01:23:06,031 --> 01:23:06,822
Money.

1445
01:23:07,073 --> 01:23:08,907
And to whom did you sell them?

1446
01:23:09,075 --> 01:23:12,077
A ram named Doug.
We got a drop spot underground.

1447
01:23:12,245 --> 01:23:15,247
<i>Just watch it.
Doug is the opposite of friendly.</i>

1448
01:23:16,249 --> 01:23:17,750
<i>He's unfriendly.</i>

1449
01:23:27,927 --> 01:23:29,178
Come on.

1450
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:43,942
The weasel wasn't lying.

1451
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:47,112
Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered
the market on Night Howlers.

1452
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:31,949
You got Doug here.

1453
01:24:32,784 --> 01:24:34,827
What's the mark?

1454
01:24:34,994 --> 01:24:39,164
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

1455
01:24:39,332 --> 01:24:40,999
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast.

1456
01:24:41,167 --> 01:24:42,251
I can hit him.

1457
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,421
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter through
the open window of a moving car.

1458
01:25:00,437 --> 01:25:02,479
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.

1459
01:25:02,647 --> 01:25:05,023
Or you'll see it on the news.
You know, whichever comes first.

1460
01:25:06,025 --> 01:25:09,194
Hey, Doug, open up!
We've got your latte.

1461
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:12,197
Woolter and Jesse are back,
so I'm leaving now.

1462
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:13,449
Out.

1463
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:14,783
Where are you going?
Get back here!

1464
01:25:14,868 --> 01:25:17,119
What are you doing?
He's gonna see you!

1465
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:18,745
What are you looking at? Hey!

1466
01:25:18,872 --> 01:25:21,457
Whatever you're thinking,
stop thinking it. Carrots!

1467
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:23,500
Carrots!

1468
01:25:23,668 --> 01:25:25,961
It better have the extra foam this time.

1469
01:25:29,132 --> 01:25:30,132
Hey, open up!

1470
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:32,718
What are you doing?
You just trapped us in here.

1471
01:25:32,886 --> 01:25:34,470
We need to get this evidence
to the ZPD!

1472
01:25:34,721 --> 01:25:36,638
Great! Here it is. Got it!

1473
01:25:36,806 --> 01:25:38,724
- No. All of it!
- Wait, what?

1474
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:45,230
Great, you're a conductor now?

1475
01:25:45,398 --> 01:25:47,983
It would take a miracle
to get this rust-bucket going.

1476
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:51,904
Well. Hallelujah.

1477
01:25:52,071 --> 01:25:54,865
We kinda got a situation at the lab.

1478
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:56,074
It just got worse!

1479
01:25:57,952 --> 01:25:59,077
Mission accomplished.

1480
01:25:59,162 --> 01:26:01,580
Would it be premature
for me to do a little victory toot-toot?

1481
01:26:01,748 --> 01:26:04,249
All right. One toot-toot.

1482
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:09,171
Well, I can cross that
off the bucket list.

1483
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:22,601
I may have to rescind that victory
toot-toot.

1484
01:26:24,354 --> 01:26:25,729
Maybe that's just hail.

1485
01:26:26,564 --> 01:26:27,397
Come here!

1486
01:26:29,776 --> 01:26:31,485
Back off!

1487
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,449
Incoming!

1488
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:40,661
Carrots!

1489
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:42,287
Don't stop! Keep going!

1490
01:26:42,455 --> 01:26:43,789
No, no! Please stop!

1491
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:45,624
Do not stop this car!

1492
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,439
Speed up, Nick! Speed up!

1493
01:27:09,649 --> 01:27:10,941
There's another train coming!

1494
01:27:11,109 --> 01:27:12,568
Trust me. Speed up!

1495
01:27:16,823 --> 01:27:18,615
Stop the train!

1496
01:27:19,576 --> 01:27:20,576
Hey!

1497
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:22,536
Need some help?

1498
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:27,541
Oh, no, no, no! Too fast!

1499
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:29,501
Hold on!

1500
01:27:40,972 --> 01:27:42,598
I think this is our stop!

1501
01:27:51,691 --> 01:27:54,151
Maybe some of the evidence survived.

1502
01:28:03,703 --> 01:28:05,287
Everything is gone.

1503
01:28:05,455 --> 01:28:07,706
We've lost it all.

1504
01:28:07,832 --> 01:28:08,874
Yeah...

1505
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,375
except for this.

1506
01:28:12,128 --> 01:28:13,670
Nick! Yes!

1507
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:15,964
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.

1508
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:18,800
Cut through
the Natural History Museum!

1509
01:28:30,563 --> 01:28:31,521
There it is!

1510
01:28:31,689 --> 01:28:34,900
Judy!

1511
01:28:35,068 --> 01:28:36,902
Mayor Bellwether!

1512
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:38,153
We found out what's happening.

1513
01:28:38,321 --> 01:28:40,155
Someone's darting predators
with a serum.

1514
01:28:40,323 --> 01:28:42,240
That's what's making them go savage.

1515
01:28:42,408 --> 01:28:45,243
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job!

1516
01:28:45,411 --> 01:28:47,079
Thank you, ma'am.

1517
01:28:51,209 --> 01:28:53,043
How did you know where to find us?

1518
01:28:53,211 --> 01:28:55,045
I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now.

1519
01:28:55,213 --> 01:29:00,217
You know what? I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD.

1520
01:29:04,764 --> 01:29:05,764
Run.

1521
01:29:06,974 --> 01:29:08,350
Get them.

1522
01:29:14,357 --> 01:29:15,023
Carrots!

1523
01:29:17,110 --> 01:29:19,111
I got you! Come here, come here.

1524
01:29:21,364 --> 01:29:23,448
Okay, nowjust relax.

1525
01:29:24,784 --> 01:29:25,784
Blueberry?

1526
01:29:25,952 --> 01:29:27,035
Pass.

1527
01:29:28,788 --> 01:29:30,789
Come on out, Judy.

1528
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:32,249
Take the case.

1529
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:33,625
Get it to Bogo.

1530
01:29:33,793 --> 01:29:35,419
I'm not gonna leave you behind.
That's not happening.

1531
01:29:35,586 --> 01:29:36,962
I can't walk.

1532
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:38,130
We'll think of something.

1533
01:29:38,297 --> 01:29:40,632
We're on the same team, Judy.

1534
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,678
Underestimated, underappreciated.

1535
01:29:44,887 --> 01:29:46,972
Aren't you sick of it?

1536
01:29:49,809 --> 01:29:53,603
Predators.
They may be strong and loud...

1537
01:29:53,771 --> 01:29:57,357
but prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

1538
01:30:00,945 --> 01:30:01,987
Think of it.

1539
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:04,156
90% of the population...

1540
01:30:04,323 --> 01:30:06,575
united against a common enemy.

1541
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:09,161
We'll be unstoppable.

1542
01:30:15,251 --> 01:30:16,668
Over there!

1543
01:30:20,590 --> 01:30:21,590
Help!

1544
01:30:33,352 --> 01:30:36,104
Well, you should have just stayed
on the carrot farm, huh?

1545
01:30:36,272 --> 01:30:38,815
It really is too bad. I did like you.

1546
01:30:38,983 --> 01:30:41,526
What are you going to do? Kill me?

1547
01:30:42,612 --> 01:30:44,529
No, of course not.

1548
01:30:44,697 --> 01:30:45,697
He is.

1549
01:30:46,532 --> 01:30:48,992
No! Nick!

1550
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:54,122
Yes, police! There's a savage fox
in the Natural History Museum.

1551
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:56,374
Officer Hopps is down! Please, hurry.

1552
01:30:56,501 --> 01:30:58,877
No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.

1553
01:30:59,879 --> 01:31:02,130
But he can't help it, can he?

1554
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:06,802
Since preds are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.

1555
01:31:18,189 --> 01:31:20,565
Gosh. Think of the headline!

1556
01:31:20,733 --> 01:31:24,903
"Hero cop killed by savage fox. "

1557
01:31:26,072 --> 01:31:29,741
So that's it? Prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?

1558
01:31:29,909 --> 01:31:31,409
Yeah, pretty much.

1559
01:31:31,577 --> 01:31:32,619
It won't work!

1560
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:35,372
Fear always works.

1561
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:38,583
And I'll dart every predator
in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1562
01:31:41,712 --> 01:31:42,838
Oh, Nick.

1563
01:31:43,422 --> 01:31:44,548
No.

1564
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:48,426
Bye-bye, bunny.

1565
01:31:55,059 --> 01:31:59,271
Blood! Blood! Blood and death.

1566
01:31:59,438 --> 01:32:00,689
All right, you're milking it.

1567
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:02,107
Besides, I think we got it.

1568
01:32:02,275 --> 01:32:04,526
We got it up there, thank you,
Yakety-yak!

1569
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:06,486
You laid it all out beautifully.

1570
01:32:06,612 --> 01:32:07,445
What?

1571
01:32:07,613 --> 01:32:08,780
Are you looking for the serum?

1572
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:10,574
Well, it's right here.

1573
01:32:10,741 --> 01:32:11,741
What you've got in the weapon there?

1574
01:32:11,909 --> 01:32:14,995
Those are blueberries.
From my family's farm.

1575
01:32:15,121 --> 01:32:17,539
They are delicious.
You should try some.

1576
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:21,251
I framed Lionheart.
I can frame you, too.

1577
01:32:21,419 --> 01:32:23,628
It's my word against yours.

1578
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:25,964
Actually...

1579
01:32:26,132 --> 01:32:29,801
<i>And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia
to keep it that way.</i>

1580
01:32:29,969 --> 01:32:31,720
...it's your word against yours.

1581
01:32:31,846 --> 01:32:34,973
It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom.

1582
01:32:43,473 --> 01:32:44,848
<i>Former mayor Dawn Bellwether
is behind bars today...</i>

1583
01:32:45,475 --> 01:32:47,226
<i>guilty of masterminding
the savage attacks</i>

1584
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:49,436
<i>that have plagued Zootopia of late.</i>

1585
01:32:49,604 --> 01:32:53,148
<i>Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot...</i>

1586
01:32:53,316 --> 01:32:55,651
<i>claiming he was just trying
to protect the city.</i>

1587
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:58,278
<i>Did I falsely imprison those animals?</i>

1588
01:32:58,446 --> 01:32:59,697
<i>Well, yes. Yes, I did.</i>

1589
01:32:59,864 --> 01:33:03,659
<i>It was a classic "doing the wrong thing
for the right reason" kind of a deal.</i>

1590
01:33:03,827 --> 01:33:06,745
<i>In related news, doctors say
the Night Howler antidote</i>

1591
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:07,997
<i>is proving effective...</i>

1592
01:33:08,164 --> 01:33:11,000
<i>in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.</i>

1593
01:33:13,998 --> 01:33:18,001
Emmitt.

1594
01:33:21,506 --> 01:33:22,547
Thank you.

1595
01:33:25,677 --> 01:33:27,344
<i>When I was a kid...</i>

1596
01:33:27,512 --> 01:33:31,139
<i>...I thought Zootopia
was this perfect place.</i>

1597
01:33:31,307 --> 01:33:35,686
<i>Where everyone got along
and anyone could be anything.</i>

1598
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:39,982
<i>Turns out, real life's a little bit
more complicated...</i>

1599
01:33:40,149 --> 01:33:42,818
<i>than a slogan on a bumper sticker.</i>

1600
01:33:42,986 --> 01:33:44,653
<i>Real life is messy.</i>

1601
01:33:46,531 --> 01:33:50,075
<i>We all have limitations.
We all make mistakes.</i>

1602
01:33:50,368 --> 01:33:54,705
<i>Which means, hey, glass half-full,
we all have a lot in common.</i>

1603
01:33:54,914 --> 01:33:57,708
<i>And the more we try
to understand one another...</i>

1604
01:33:57,875 --> 01:34:00,752
<i>the more exceptional
each of us will be.</i>

1605
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:03,668
<i>But we have to try.</i>

1606
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:07,463
<i>So, no matter what type of animal
you are...</i>

1607
01:34:07,673 --> 01:34:09,048
<i>from the biggest elephant...</i>

1608
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:12,718
<i>to our first fox...</i>

1609
01:34:13,971 --> 01:34:18,015
<i>I implore you... try.</i>

1610
01:34:18,141 --> 01:34:21,561
<i>Try to make the world a better place.</i>

1611
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:24,230
<i>Look inside yourself...</i>

1612
01:34:24,356 --> 01:34:26,065
<i>and recognize that change...</i>

1613
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:28,859
<i>starts with you.</i>

1614
01:34:30,279 --> 01:34:31,779
<i>It starts with me.</i>

1615
01:34:32,781 --> 01:34:36,075
<i>It starts with all of us.</i>

1616
01:34:44,285 --> 01:34:47,162
All right, enough! Shut it!

1617
01:34:47,413 --> 01:34:51,332
We have some new recruits
with us this morning...

1618
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:52,625
including our first fox.

1619
01:34:53,419 --> 01:34:54,752
Who cares?

1620
01:34:54,879 --> 01:34:57,422
You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

1621
01:34:57,590 --> 01:34:58,715
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

1622
01:34:58,841 --> 01:35:00,717
Assignments.

1623
01:35:00,885 --> 01:35:03,428
Officers Grizzoli,
Fangmeyer, Delgato...

1624
01:35:03,596 --> 01:35:05,597
Tundratown SWAT.

1625
01:35:05,723 --> 01:35:07,765
Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard...

1626
01:35:07,933 --> 01:35:09,934
undercover.

1627
01:35:10,102 --> 01:35:12,437
Hopps, Wilde.

1628
01:35:12,563 --> 01:35:14,063
Parking duty.

1629
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:15,899
Dismissed.

1630
01:35:16,025 --> 01:35:17,942
Just kidding!

1631
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:21,112
We have reports of a street racer
tearing up Savannah Central.

1632
01:35:21,822 --> 01:35:23,615
<i>Find him, shut him down.</i>

1633
01:35:23,699 --> 01:35:27,619
So, are all rabbits bad drivers,
or is it just you?

1634
01:35:29,914 --> 01:35:30,997
Oops. Sorry.

1635
01:35:32,833 --> 01:35:33,833
Sly bunny.

1636
01:35:34,001 --> 01:35:35,293
Dumb fox.

1637
01:35:35,461 --> 01:35:37,503
You know you love me.

1638
01:35:37,671 --> 01:35:39,297
Do I know that?

1639
01:35:39,465 --> 01:35:41,341
Yes. Yes, I do.

1640
01:35:56,023 --> 01:35:59,984
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour.
I hope you have a good explanation.

1641
01:36:01,654 --> 01:36:02,654
Flash?

1642
01:36:02,821 --> 01:36:04,822
Flash? Hundred yard dash?

1643
01:36:08,327 --> 01:36:10,787
Nick.

1644
01:36:12,164 --> 01:36:14,415
<i>Good evening, Zootopia!</i>

1645
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:17,835
<i>Come on, everybody,
put your paws up!</i>

1646
01:36:18,003 --> 01:36:22,048
<i>I messed up tonight
I lost another fight</i>

1647
01:36:22,299 --> 01:36:25,677
<i>Lost to myself
But I'll just start again</i>

1648
01:36:25,886 --> 01:36:27,971
<i>I keep falling down</i>

1649
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:30,306
<i>I keep on hitting the ground</i>

1650
01:36:30,516 --> 01:36:33,643
<i>But I always get up now
To see what's next</i>

1651
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:38,273
<i>I won't give up
No, I won't give in</i>

1652
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:42,443
<i>Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again</i>

1653
01:36:42,611 --> 01:36:46,864
<i>No, I won't leave
I want to try everything</i>

1654
01:36:47,032 --> 01:36:51,369
<i>I want to try even though I could fail</i>

1655
01:36:51,537 --> 01:36:54,872
<i>I won't give up
No, I won't give in</i>

1656
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:59,252
<i>Till I reach the end
Then I'll start again</i>

1657
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:03,381
<i>No, I won't leave
I want to try everything</i>

1658
01:37:03,549 --> 01:37:07,218
<i>I want to try even though I could fail</i>

1659
01:37:11,557 --> 01:37:21,441
<i>Try everything</i>

1660
01:37:25,779 --> 01:37:27,530
<i>Put your paws in the air. Come on!</i>

1661
01:37:33,537 --> 01:37:36,956
<i>Look how far you've come
You filled your heart with love</i>

1662
01:37:37,124 --> 01:37:41,127
<i>Baby, you've done enough
Take a deep breath</i>

1663
01:37:41,295 --> 01:37:45,298
<i>Don't beat yourself up
No need to run so fast</i>

1664
01:37:45,466 --> 01:37:49,761
<i>Sometimes we come last
But we did our best</i>

1665
01:37:49,928 --> 01:37:53,348
<i>I won't give up
No, I won't give in</i>

1666
01:37:53,599 --> 01:37:57,268
<i>Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again</i>

1667
01:37:57,436 --> 01:38:01,439
<i>No, I won't leave
I want to try everything</i>

1668
01:38:01,607 --> 01:38:03,191
<i>I want to try</i>

1669
01:38:03,442 --> 01:38:05,151
<i>Even though I could fail</i>

1670
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:08,821
<i>I won't give up
No, I won't give in</i>

1671
01:38:09,907 --> 01:38:13,951
<i>Till I reach the end
Then I'll start again</i>

1672
01:38:14,119 --> 01:38:18,331
<i>No, I won't leave
I want to try everything</i>

1673
01:38:18,499 --> 01:38:23,127
<i>I want to try even though I could fail</i>

1674
01:38:23,962 --> 01:38:31,135
<i>I'll keep on making those new mistakes</i>

1675
01:38:32,471 --> 01:38:39,811
<i>And I'll keep on making them every day</i>

1676
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:44,524
<i>Those new mistakes</i>

1677
01:38:47,236 --> 01:38:57,161
<i>Try everything</i>

1678
01:39:05,587 --> 01:39:07,505
<i>Come on!</i>

1679
01:39:10,134 --> 01:39:11,634
<i>Shake your tails with me. Come on!</i>

1680
01:39:13,011 --> 01:39:14,095
<i>Yeah!</i>

1681
01:39:18,058 --> 01:39:21,853
<i>I'll keep on making those new mistakes</i>

1682
01:39:26,352 --> 01:39:33,108
<i>I'll keep on making them every day</i>

1683
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:38,071
<i>Those new mistakes</i>

1684
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:58,842
<i>Try everything</i>
