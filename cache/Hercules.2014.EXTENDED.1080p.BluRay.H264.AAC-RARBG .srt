I was well protected.

182
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,065
Ah.

183
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,360
The mighty Hercules. An honor.

184
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,531
Though not quite as big an honor
as I expected.

185
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,326
General, go tell my father
Hercules is here.

186
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,625
Uncle? Hera. Impressive.

187
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,419
It's meant to be.

188
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,964
It took five years and a thousand men
to build her temple.

189
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,383
Hera is the patron goddess of Thrace.

190
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,846
Everyone knows the legend,
how Hera seeks to destroy Hercules.

191
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,391
Perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you.

192
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,851
Mother!

193
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,686
Arius.

194
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,275
- You're Hercules.
- That's right.

195
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,736
My name is Arius.
I know all your Labors by heart.

196
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,864
You killed the giant Geryon
with a single blow,

197
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,741
cleaned the Augean stables
in one night.

198
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:46,867
Hercules is probably tired.

199
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,702
And the Labor of the Hide,
and the Labor of the Mares.

200
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,412
- That's enough, Arius. Come along.

Men who deal in violence
attract violence.

203
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,503
But he's Hercules. He's no mere mortal.
He's the greatest!

204
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,425
Lord Cotys will see you now.

205
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,643
Have you ever met royalty, Hercules?

206
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,646
Once or twice.

this is what Elysium must look like.

Magnificent, aren't they?

218
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,496
Well, do not keep us in suspense.
Are we safe from the monster Hydra?

219
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,334
The Hydra's heads, Your Majesty.

220
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,511
The masks of serpents.

221
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,597
No wonder men thought
they were monsters.

222
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,018
You've done your sovereign
a great service. Come.

A man faced with such adoration
might be tempted to think himself a god.

Welcome.

00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,581
An honor to host such a legend.

235
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,750
Lord Cotys.

236
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,420
But in legend, you fight alone.

237
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,758
My reputation would not exist
without my comrades.

00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,302

243
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,901
Amphiaraus?

244
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,114
The famed seer of Argos.

245
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,534
It is said you have glimpsed
your own death,

246
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,287
so you fight each battle knowing that
it is not yet your time to die.

247
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,957
What else can you tell of the future?

248
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,918
Only what the gods see fit to reveal.

249
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,002
A shame.

250
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,339
It would have been a great gift
to know the outcome of this war.

COTYS: When the kings of yesteryear
built this citadel,

259
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,333
it was intended as
the high seat of all Thrace.

260
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,795
But now Thrace is divided.

261
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,755
This war has depleted our forces.

262
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,551
We're left with nothing but farmers
and merchants to replenish our army.

263
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,761
It takes every one of us
to resist Rhesus.

264
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,265
People think that he cannot be killed
by an ordinary mortal.

265
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,392
Only by a god.

266
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,437
Rhesus is a sorcerer.

267
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,065
His magic words confuse men,
bend them to his will.

268
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,819
He leads an army of monsters,
half horse, half human.

269
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,031
Centaurs?

Let me show you what misery
Rhesus has brought us.

Every week, more refugees arrive
seeking my protection,

274

most of them covered in blood,
crippled or burnt by Rhesus' men.

275
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,476
I feared nothing could ever
be good again, till you arrived.

How we view ourselves
is of little consequence.

00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,903
How others perceive us is important.

279

And your name, like it or not,

280
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,283
is a rallying cry.

281
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,126
I have seen too much reality
to trust in legends, and I am not alone.

I'm convinced these are good people.

00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,160
I see. And who's more convincing,
Cotys or his daughter?

289
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,205
All the gold on Earth is not
as convincing as a pair of breasts.

290
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,541
Maybe, but gold never ages.

291
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,918
Which is why
I got them to double our price.

or "Hercules: A Legend is Born"?

Yes, sir.

When a shield wall is strong,

322
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,893
nothing can ever defeat it!

323
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,605
You must learn to work together,
react together.

324
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,943

I hope the enemy has a sense of humor.

00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,374
Right. Today's lesson,

The Bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe.

If we do not protect them,
then there will be a bloodbath.

Face Rhesus with an untrained army

343

So, out of necessity,
I taught myself the art of healing.

He made me vow
to keep the world away from him.

never harm innocents again.

there truly is a heaven or a hell.
