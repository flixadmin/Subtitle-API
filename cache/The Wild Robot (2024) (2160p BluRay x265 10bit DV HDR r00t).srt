00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:05,208
Hello. <i>Bonjour.</i>
<i>Guten Tag. Hujambo. Hola.</i>

2
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:09,588
Congratulations on your purchase
of a Universal Dynamics robot.

3
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,507
I am Rozzum 7134.

4
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:16,803
A Rozzum always completes its task.
Just ask.

5
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:22,768
Just ask.

6
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,823
Processing.

7
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,362
Do you need...

8
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,073
...assistance?

9
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,298
Ready to receive my first task.

10
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,664
Rozzum 7134 is available
for task assignment.

11
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,709
Rozzum robots come standard

12
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,337
with the Alpha-113 dimensional processor.

13
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:19,342
If you're unsure about how I can assist,
try asking me about myself.

14
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,477
Excuse me.

15
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,605
Did you know I can assist
with grocery shopping?

16
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,773
Banking?

17
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,359
Landscaping?

18
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,993
Hello. Did you perhaps order
a Rozzum helper robot?

19
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,078
Is that a no?

20
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,456
Here's a free sticker.

21
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,292
Scan the code
and receive 10% off of your...

22
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,225
Do you need assistance?

23
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,644
I see your problem.

24
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:29,037
Rozzums are programmed
for instant physical mimicry,

25
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,121
so as to...

26
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,650
Aggression detected.

27
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,612
My communication package
includes strategies

28
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,281
for conflict resolution.

29
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,704
Your dialect is not in my data banks.

30
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,582
Tell your people not to worry.

31
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:18,295
Rozzum 7134 will sort out
this language barrier in no time.

32
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,135
Activating learning mode.

33
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,885
Hey, check it out. Look, look, look!

34
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,201
Somebody died over here.

35
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,745
Let me see. Let me see. Oh!

36
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,068
Who was it?
Anybody we know?

37
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,205
Fresh or not fresh?

38
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,874
Smells pretty good.

39
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,126
Tastes terrible!

40
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,045
Oh, it's waking up.
Hey, it's waking up.

41
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,048
It's a monster!
Run for your lives!

42
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,259
Look, that's the thing
that destroyed my dam.

43
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,470
The monster.
Yikes!

44
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,930
I think it's gonna talk.

45
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,808
Thank you for your patience
while I deciphered your language.

46
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,519
I am Rozzum 7134,

47
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,438
ready to enhance your lives

48
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:22,108
with integrated multiphase
task accomplishment.

49
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,406
Are you here to kill us?

50
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,909
Negative. I am here to help
with whatever task you...

51
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,786
It says no!

52
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,415
It's dead.

53
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,000
Ah! Thank goodness.

54
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,136
The monster!
The monster!

55
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,930
The monster!

56
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,226
Did anyone order me?

57
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,584
Anyone?

58
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,214
Delivery unsuccessful.

59
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,717
Return to factory.

60
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,887
Activating return transmitter.

61
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,266
Three, two, one.

62
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,292
Activating return transmitter.

63
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,586
Three...

64
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,463
Pretty.
Get it!

65
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,507
Get it! Get it! Get it!
Two...

66
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,051
Get it! Get it! Get it!

67
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,844
One...

68
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,554
Ha!

69
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,694
Wait. Stop. No!

70
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,155
No, no, no, no, no.

71
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,412
Again!

72
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,284
May I confirm that is yours?

73
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,085
Huh?

74
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,548
Hmm?

75
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,927
Here you go. Take it.

76
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,564
Ow.

77
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,634
Huh.

78
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,763
Ow.

79
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,669
Was this task accomplished
to your satisfaction?

80
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,715
On a scale of one to ten,

81
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,801
where ten is most satisfied
and one is least,

82
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,387
how would you rate my performance?

83
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,848
I will register that as a ten.

84
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,184
Returning to factory.

85
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,646
Signal strength weak.

86
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,565
Seeking higher ground.

87
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,209
Do you require shelter?

88
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,723
Perhaps tips for planning
your next vacation?

89
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,600
Oh. Wha...

90
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,736
I do not understand this response.

91
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,657
Signal acquired.

92
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,077
Three, two, one.

93
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,879
Mom, I don't feel good.

94
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,465
If I barf, I'm taking you all with me.

95
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,510
Mom told you not to
eat grasshoppers, dummy.

96
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,804
Petunia's been in front all day.

97
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,139
The prettiest possum
always rides in front.

98
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,017
Try being pretty
with my tail jammed in your eye!

99
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,772
Bartlett! Stop jamming your tail
in your sister's eye.

100
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,483
I'm Rowan. Bartlett was last litter.

101
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,068
Are you sure?

102
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,362
Who are all of you? Go away.

103
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,323
We're your children. Except for him.

104
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,785
Well, this is what I get
for taking a walk.

105
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,912
Where's your mommy, little guy?

106
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,998
The monster!

107
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,961
You gotta die faster.

108
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,547
Meningitis takes a while.
What did you pick?

109
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,924
Rabies.
Spontaneous combustion.

110
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,634
Nightshade salad.
Sepsis.

111
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,553
Hey! I picked sepsis.

112
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,555
None of you are doing it right.

113
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,889
We talked about this.

114
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,601
Dead things don't have to explain
why they're dead.

115
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,144
Now we're gonna get killed for real.

116
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,604
Sorry, Mom.

117
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,105
Sorry.

118
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,316
Uh, why aren't we killed yet?

119
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,525
Good question.

120
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,284
Nice knowing ya, Mom.

121
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,119
All right. It's okay. It's okay.

122
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,622
Uh, hey.

123
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,625
You in there? I'm Pinktail.

124
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,210
Oh. Okay. Hello.
Wow.

125
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,588
Uh, this gosling is yours?

126
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,382
Negative. That gosling stalks me,

127
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:58,262
emits noise and makes simple tasks
more complicated or impossible.

128
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,764
Yeah, they do that.

129
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,224
Goslings imprint
on the first thing they see.

130
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,144
Which would be you.
Congratulations.

131
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,938
As far as he's concerned,
you're his mother now.

132
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,858
I do not have the programming
to be a mother.

133
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,861
No one does. We just make it up.

134
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:18,574
Without an assigned task,
my next priority is to return to factory.

135
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:22,286
Taking care of him is your task now.

136
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,540
Task acquired. Return mode delayed.

137
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,335
A Rozzum always completes its task.

138
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,003
You're lucky you just have one.

139
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,338
As a mother of seven...

140
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:37,176
Six babies. It's a full-time thing.

141
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,303
But it's not all bad.

142
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,515
Just mostly bad.

143
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,977
Do you have any information
on how to take care of this unit?

144
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,312
They all need to eat.

145
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,440
But yours needs to swim and fly.

146
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,942
Fly by fall.

147
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:56,362
He's gotta leave this island
before winter or...

148
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,280
Uh, how do I put this delicately?

149
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,242
Yeah. That.

150
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,745
Eat, swim, fly by fall or...

151
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,706
Patience is the key.

152
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,000
It's okay, Mom. I'm alive.

153
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,293
Oh.

154
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:12,545
Yay.

155
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,004
Well, good luck.

156
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,464
Goodbye.

157
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,466
We like your new baby.

158
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,301
Hope it doesn't die.

159
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,435
Eat. Swim. Fly by fall.

160
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,359
Eat.

161
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,570
Huh?

162
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,490
Swim.

163
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,453
Whoa.

164
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,166
I say, keep your trash out of my pond.

165
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,292
That's littering.

166
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,711
Not to mention murder.

167
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,881
Huh.

168
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,050
Fly.

169
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,063
Allow me to introduce myself.

170
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:16,233
Fink. Predator and local goose expert.

171
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,402
Which I know you could use about now.

172
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,446
You are the destroyer unit.

173
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,448
It's okay. I won't eat him.

174
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,742
Are you crazy? I might eat him.

175
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,993
You said you would not.

176
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,871
Do you believe everything you hear?

177
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,122
Yes.

178
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,291
Noted.

179
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,543
Why did you steal my gosling?

180
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,004
I'm a fox. I do foxy things.

181
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,255
It's in my nature.

182
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,341
Your programming.

183
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,342
Why'd you help me?

184
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,428
I'm a robot. I do "robot-y" things.

185
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,513
I seek tasks

186
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,141
and ensure all essential needs
have been met or exceeded.

187
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,275
I have some essential needs.

188
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,193
Aw.

189
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:05,074
Fink, as a local goose expert,
how do I get Mmm to eat, swim, fly?

190
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,077
I thought you'd never ask.

191
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,745
Let's start with eat.

192
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,206
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right there.

193
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,585
Hmm.

194
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,297
Ow.

195
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,550
I do not think these are suitable.

196
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,969
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me check.

197
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,596
Mmm. Seems good to me.

198
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,599
Say, can you make yourself
look like a bear?

199
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,521
I'm here for a honey lunch.

200
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,898
I believe I am under attack.

201
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:38,983
You're doing great.

202
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,401
Should I be concerned?

203
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,236
Sorry, can't hear you.

204
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:46,574
Here you go, kid.

205
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,705
Huh?

206
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,712
How do goslings normally do this?

207
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,715
Ooh.

208
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,467
Mm-mmm.

209
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,303
This is not working.

210
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,681
Are you kidding?
Everything is working great.

211
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,475
Oh, yeah, that.

212
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,560
Here.

213
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,023
Phase one of task is completed.

214
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,942
Now, we're gonna have to do
all this over tomorrow.

215
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,779
All these kids do...
...is eat.

216
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,239
I understand.

217
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,284
What's that?
My power core.

218
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,410
It is damaged.

219
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,955
Without it, I rely on my solar surfaces
and batteries.

220
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,250
Yeah, you should work on that.
Mmm.

221
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,295
I also need a replacement transmitter.

222
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,714
Ugh, do I have to do everything?

223
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:48,093
When we run across another robot,
we'll kill it and take its transmitter.

224
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:53,349
Negative. Rozzum inhibition protocols
prevent deliberate harm to others.

225
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,936
Look, you need to learn
how things work on this island.

226
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,855
Me, the bear, everybody.

227
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,232
We're all just trying to survive.

228
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:06,111
And kindness is not a survival skill.

229
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,196
Mmm.

230
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,115
Yeah, so, how did you
get a gosling anyway?

231
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,408
There was an accident.

232
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,243
I terminated his family.

233
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:16,538
For future reference, you probably want
to keep all that to yourself.

234
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,875
Understood. Do not mention dead family.

235
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:24,088
Fink, how long do you estimate
swim and fly to take?

236
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,422
Swimming's easy.

237
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,633
I can teach him the way my mom taught me.

238
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,717
Swim!

239
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,679
Fink!
Hmm?

240
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,430
He will not learn that way.

241
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,724
Not if you keep doing that.

242
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:39,687
Just between us,

243
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,189
this whole thing might not take
as long as you think.

244
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,859
Your gosling, he isn't exactly...
...normal.

245
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,070
I have a defective baby?

246
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,197
He's what they call "a runt."

247
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,615
A runt.

248
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,535
Fact is, even if his whole family
hadn't have been killed,

249
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,704
he probably wouldn't have lived very long.

250
00:24:56,787 --> 00:25:00,040
Just, I don't know,
don't get too attached to the little guy.

251
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,583
That's all.

252
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:05,587
If you want, I could eat him right now
and save you the grief later.

253
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:10,009
Negative. Eating this task
is not the same as completing it.

254
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,928
So we're doing this.

255
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,223
Well, if you don't want me
or anyone else to eat him,

256
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,810
you're gonna need a place
that's safer than out here,

257
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,479
which is a great idea!

258
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,772
New project.

259
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,526
Is it normal to burp this much?

260
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,361
Ooh.

261
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,121
That thing's gonna fall on you.

262
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,748
And squish you to jelly.

263
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,041
This guy's nuts.

264
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,292
Who is that?

265
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,502
Paddler? Local laughingstock.

266
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:49,840
Spends every day trying to cut down
the biggest tree on the island.

267
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,633
He's obsessed.

268
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,053
Kind of like you and your task hang-up.

269
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:55,554
His programming.

270
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,682
Hey, Paddler!
You're never gonna finish that!

271
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,809
Felling this is not the point.

272
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,395
The process is the art.

273
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,565
And that's what happens to your brain
when you eat wood.

274
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,858
Weirdo.

275
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,195
Yeah? Well,
you'll eat those words, vermin.

276
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:15,240
Are you sure Paddler will not mind us
borrowing his home?

277
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,117
He doesn't need to know.

278
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:20,996
Mmm.

279
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:22,873
Hmm?

280
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,708
Huh?

281
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,296
Seriously? He needs room for me
and my stuff.

282
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,634
Better. Now, you can make one
this big, right?

283
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:38,097
No task is impossible for Rozzum 7134.

284
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,893
Roz... 7... 34?

285
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,604
But you can call me Roz.

286
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,022
Roz!

287
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,774
Roz, Roz, Roz...

288
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,944
Where are you from
that things don't eat each other?

289
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,029
I do not know my origin point.
Roz, Roz, Roz...

290
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,114
Well, who made you?

291
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,282
Someone made me?

292
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,826
Someone made me?

293
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,415
Humor is based on misfortune?

294
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,625
Misfortune.

295
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,502
Yeah. Here.

296
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,920
Try it.
Yeah.

297
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,549
Not funny.
Not funny.

298
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,970
Ugh. Squirrels.

299
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:26,145
Your inefficient participation
will slow the process.

300
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,147
Slow the process.

301
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,982
I'll just be over here.

302
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,193
A little sad, but otherwise okay.

303
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,611
Just this once.

304
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:54,798
Perfect!

305
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,135
Home?
Meh. A little rustic.

306
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,762
I think I know what is missing.

307
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,394
So, what are you gonna name him?

308
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:11,607
I assign to you Gosling 0001.
Hmm?

309
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,691
Okay, that sucked.

310
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,775
That sucked.

311
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,030
Whoa.

312
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,490
You gotta learn to make stuff up.

313
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,159
Come on. Find that...

314
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,204
...inside you.

315
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,288
Searching.

316
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,044
Anything yet?
No.

317
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,380
Just have a little fun for once.

318
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,967
Gosling 0186.

319
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,136
There. You see what I did?

320
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,555
His numbering is out of sequence.

321
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,855
His name can't have numbers.

322
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,732
It's like someone didn't even like him.

323
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,859
My name has numbers.

324
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,361
It's gotta be personal.

325
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,612
Personal.

326
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,614
Processing "personal."

327
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,992
Bright. Bill.

328
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,494
Brightbill.

329
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,037
Is that satisfactory?

330
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,413
Brightbill?

331
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,124
Processing. Beep, beep, boop, boop.

332
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,751
Satisfactory.

333
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,337
Oh, yeah. That's perfect.

334
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:21,260
Oh. That's nice. Ah.

335
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,095
Comfortable, are we?

336
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,097
This house of yours?

337
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,349
You copied it. It's my design.

338
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,144
I know it was you,
and I know where you live.

339
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,817
Oh, perfect!
Now no one's gonna get any sleep.

340
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,361
How do we reset Brightbill?

341
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:43,824
When I was little, my mom would
rock me to sleep. Like this.

342
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,409
That will damage him.

343
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,536
Hey! I turned out just fine.

344
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,790
You could tell him a story,
but that's a lot more work.

345
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,294
How will fictional narrative
help Brightbill?

346
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:58,046
Kids need to feel safe and loved

347
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,256
and all that junk.

348
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,258
A story can do that?

349
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,468
Storytelling is lying adjacent,

350
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,053
and I lie for a living.

351
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:07,347
Watch and learn.

352
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,016
Just fill in the blanks.

353
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,559
Let me see here.

354
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,354
Once, there was, uh, this island

355
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,398
with a little gosling...

356
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,524
Brightbill?

357
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,152
...and he was all alone.

358
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,404
Because the rest of his family
was destroyed.

359
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,488
Not yet.

360
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,994
And what this little gosling needed
was a mother.

361
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,540
So he looked up at the stars
and asked the brightest one

362
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,625
<i>if it could send him one of their extras.</i>

363
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,127
<i>Funny thing is,</i>

364
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,338
<i>there's this beautiful robot</i>

365
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,591
<i>that happened to be sitting
on the edge of that star.</i>

366
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,134
<i>And she hears him.</i>

367
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,093
Okay, now.

368
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,428
Which is impossible

369
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,431
since sound does not travel
through the vacuum of space.

370
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,476
But she still heard him

371
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,729
because she was listening
with a different part of herself.

372
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,775
A part that, up to that point,
she didn't even know she had.

373
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,026
Her heart.

374
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,196
How did my mama come to me
from so far away?

375
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,697
Who cares?
Huh?

376
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:09,785
Uh, I mean, she's trying to see you...
Me?

377
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,787
...and falls off that star

378
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,790
and lands on the beach
just a little ways from here.

379
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,416
But she lands pretty hard,

380
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,544
and a lot of stuff she knew
just kind of fell out.

381
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,629
Oh, no!

382
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,507
So it's a little weird what
she knows and what she doesn't.

383
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,176
But she remembers one thing.

384
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,260
You.

385
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:31,056
And when she finally sees you,
she feels...

386
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,557
Crushing obligation.

387
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,519
Very lucky to be a mother.
Mama.

388
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,897
And I will not leave
until I have completed this task

389
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,024
which has delayed me, damaged me

390
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:44,861
and violated my protocols,
potentially voiding my warranty.

391
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:49,741
Which is robot for,
she loves you very much.

392
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,247
The story worked.

393
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,707
I need a drink.

394
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:06,216
How do you tell a story about something
you say you know nothing about?

395
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,843
You'll need to be more specific.

396
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,428
Love.

397
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,807
Yeah, well, when you grow up
without something,

398
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,560
you spend a lot of time thinking about it.

399
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:24,276
To conserve battery power,
I must shut down until morning.

400
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,006
I miss her when she sleeps too.

401
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,649
Scanning. Beep, bop, boop, boop.

402
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,776
Possible animal friend sighted.

403
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,654
Activating interspecies outreach protocol.

404
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,742
Hello. <i>Bonjour. Hujambo.</i>

405
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,286
I am Gosling 0186.

406
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,621
But you can call me Bright...

407
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,709
I expected to have at least one friend
by summer, but they all just...

408
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,461
Scream and run?
Yes.

409
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,047
I have experienced the same phenomenon.

410
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,383
Fink?
Beats me. Nothing weird about you two.

411
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:31,510
Thank you.

412
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,555
Show me deer.

413
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:37,765
Uh, bear.

414
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,142
Porcupine. Squirrel.

415
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,728
Uh, turtle possum. Otter moose.

416
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,146
Now skunk.

417
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,023
I do not want to do skunk.

418
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,151
Skunk.

419
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,945
Skunky, skunky, skunky.

420
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,571
Boo!

421
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:54,032
How do you do that?

422
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,618
I overheat my Fallium transducer coils,

423
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,037
then leak a little hydraulic fluid
on them.

424
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,307
Does overheating
the transducers have any draining effect

425
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,999
on the secondary cooling modules?

426
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,709
Not if I precool the load sensors.

427
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,129
Exemplary day for swimming tests.

428
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,214
Pinktail.

429
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,799
Appetizers.

430
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,093
They were bored
and wanted to see stuff sink.

431
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,680
Death's proximity.
Makes life burn all the brighter.

432
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,973
It's true.
Yeah.

433
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,059
Primary motor appendages
in opposing stroke start position.

434
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,103
Come on. It's happening.
Let's go see!

435
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,021
Hurry!
Is he gonna drown?

436
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,565
Or get the hypothermias?

437
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:30,235
No. The impact alone
will probably kill him.

438
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,237
Yeah!
Yay!

439
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,656
Uh, you know, suddenly I'm thinking

440
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,741
I should maybe just
stay with you guys this winter.

441
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:37,867
Nope.

442
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,207
Is he dead yet?

443
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,253
Hey, it... it's working.

444
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,671
I-I think I got it.

445
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,464
Well done, Brightbill.

446
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,967
Swimming requirement fulfilled.

447
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,635
That's drowning.

448
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,846
No, that's swimming.

449
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,849
Yeah.
Thanks, you... guys.

450
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:05,145
Uh, perhaps you could limit your range
to stay within view.

451
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,690
Roz, he needs to become independent
if he's gonna migrate.

452
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,610
I prefer he be independent closer to home.

453
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,111
He won't die.

454
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,739
Well, hmm, probably won't die.

455
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,534
It's unlikely he would die just right now.

456
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,246
Are you dying?

457
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,749
Do everyone a favor and expire downstream.

458
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,752
I'm good. Just swimming.

459
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,176
I think I need to find an island
that's less weird.

460
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,229
Whoa.

461
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,397
They're me.

462
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:51,399
I'm them.

463
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,234
Here I come!

464
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,986
Hey.

465
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,954
Hello.

466
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,082
<i>Bonjour. Konnichiwa. Hujambo.</i>

467
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,500
Uh... I'm Gosling...

468
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,961
Oh! Um, are you dying?

469
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,714
Why does everyone ask that?

470
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,716
I'm swimming!

471
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,386
That's not how you do it.

472
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,470
It is.

473
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,806
I studied the diagram.
I can teach you if you want.

474
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,890
Wait!

475
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,767
You... You're it.

476
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,103
You're that goose thing
raised by that monster.

477
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,064
Monster? Wait. Goose "thing"?

478
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,697
You're a big subject of curiosity
around here.

479
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,950
You sound so normal.

480
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,993
My learning curves
are within expected parameters,

481
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,246
and I'm on target to mature before fall.

482
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,790
Kinda normal.

483
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,417
Why are you over here?

484
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,502
Did that thing die?

485
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,587
Look what we have here.

486
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,257
No way. It lives.

487
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,800
And almost floats.

488
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,927
Greetings.

489
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,972
I see you, too, have feathers and wings.

490
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,433
Perhaps we can share
stories of common interests.

491
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,268
We have nothing in common with you.

492
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,231
The freak show is
on the other side of the lake.

493
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,479
You call that a wing?

494
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,523
Ow! That creates a pain response.

495
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,942
Try swimming with your feet.

496
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,235
You don't belong here.

497
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,778
Come on. Fly away!

498
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,614
Roz!

499
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,533
Brightbill.

500
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:25,118
The monster!

501
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,286
It's here!

502
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,330
Eat the slow, weak ones! Leave me alone!

503
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:40,300
Brightbill.
It's Rockmouth. Get him out of there!

504
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,179
Roz!

505
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,395
Roz! Hurry!

506
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:55,023
Brightbill, focus on me.

507
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,443
Now swim as fast as you can.

508
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,573
Head down now!

509
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,499
Oh, no.

510
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,170
He's gonna eat me!

511
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,184
Why'd he attack me?

512
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,353
Because you are a runt.

513
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,231
He just wanted to make contact
with his own kind.

514
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,691
He is not our kind.

515
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:40,360
He is a 98% match to your...

516
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,986
No, I'm not.

517
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,905
Let's just go, Mom.

518
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,076
Wait.
You think that thing is your mother?

519
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,160
Yes.

520
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,163
No. I don't know.

521
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,249
That thing killed your mother.

522
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,667
Everyone knows that.

523
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,254
Oh, thanks for talking so much.

524
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,797
Now I know who to eat first!

525
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,716
Roz, remember how things work here.

526
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,718
Stop it, Fink. Please, let's go.

527
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,262
I hope this interaction...

528
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,346
Mom, stop!

529
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,557
Uh, I just intended to...

530
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,640
Roz!

531
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,150
I'll see you all for dinner.
This is not over!

532
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,169
How did I become... this?

533
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,422
The truth.

534
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,802
There was an accident.

535
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,512
Did you do it?

536
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,640
Yes.

537
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,934
It wasn't her fault, kid.

538
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,769
Why didn't you tell me?

539
00:39:56,853 --> 00:40:00,106
I did not think
the information would assist you.

540
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,900
That's not your decision to make.

541
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,694
I... I can't believe
how long I bought this.

542
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,405
I really thought you were my family.

543
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,324
You... did?

544
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,868
It was so obvious. I feel so stupid.

545
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,494
I miscalculated.

546
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,372
I should have considered
your emotional wavelengths.

547
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,457
You think?

548
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,500
So, was it just guilt?
Is that why you did this?

549
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,377
I... I needed a task.

550
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,171
Well, I'm glad I could give you one.

551
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,257
The events that led to
this situation were unintended.

552
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,676
Tell that to my sisters, my brothers.

553
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,136
My real mom.

554
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,013
They were my chance to be normal.

555
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,974
They were my chance to swim. To fly.
What even am I?

556
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:38,645
You swam satisfactorily today,
and if you keep practicing...

557
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,855
I still won't belong.

558
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:42,815
I understand.

559
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,359
You don't understand anything.

560
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,402
You don't feel anything.

561
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,614
You're not my mom.

562
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:21,205
<i>At Universal Dynamics,

00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,598
<i>It has.</i>

00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,101

00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:02,747

578
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,000
<i>Part of the Universal Dynamics family.</i>

579
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,315
Hello. <i>Bonjour. Hujambo.</i>

580
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:32,902
Congratulations on your
Universal Dynamics robot.

581
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,321
I am Rozzum 6262.

582
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,992
Your name cannot have numbers.

583
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,537
I will call you "Rummage."

584
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,790
Rummage is ready
to receive its first task.

585
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,544
Your first task is to assist me
in my current task.

586
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,920
Task acquired.

587
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:55,216
A Rozzum always completes its task.
Just ask.

588
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,429
Suppose a task cannot be completed.

589
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:04,517
Rozzum sequential management ensures
task accomplishment in under...

590
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,521
Rephrase. I have a task
that has become impossible.

591
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:14,360
My responses to problems increasingly rely
on improvised solutions.

592
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:20,074
The processing that used to happen here
is now coming more from here.

593
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,704
Can you explain again what we are doing?

594
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:28,583
I don't know! I'm just making stuff up.

595
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,210
I don't know what I'm doing,
and I have to.

596
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:34,005
I have to because he's relying on me.

597
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,631
Oh.

598
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,678
What task could possibly overwhelm
the Alpha-113?

599
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:45,474
The Alpha-113 processor represents
the fusion of all human knowledge

600
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:49,687
with the most powerful reasoning device
ever developed by humankind.

601
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,231
I have a kid.

602
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,234
Okay.

603
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,404
May I run a diagnostic?

604
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,114
I feel fine.

605
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,118
You should not feel anything at all.

606
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:21,052
You overrode your programming?

607
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,180
I have been overriding my code for months.

608
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,891
It was the only way to complete my task.

609
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,435
This is serious.

610
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,145
You are defective.

611
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:36,275
You are in the wrong place,
and you have become the wrong thing.

612
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,444
You must return to factory.

613
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,820
Take this.

614
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,281
They will fix you.

615
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:47,745
7134, that is where you belong.

616
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:57,255
You need to let me know
before you disappear like this.

617
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:00,216
Three things tried to eat me
on the way here.

618
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:02,635
Roz?

619
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,137
We ruined everything.

620
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,806
Well, you did.

621
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:10,309
You are not a goose expert, are you?

622
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:13,104
I know how they taste.
That's about it.

623
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:16,190
Oh. Is that...

624
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:20,569
A working transmitter.
It will call the ones that made me.

625
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,239
So, you're getting out of here?

626
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,950
I found out where I'm supposed to be.

627
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,911
I will fit in there.

628
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:30,371
Don't take this the wrong way,

629
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:35,876
but I'm not sure I'd want to see
the sort of place you actually fit in.

630
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,131
I think they need me,
and they will fix me.

631
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:46,095
Maybe there is someone small there
that needs my help.

632
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,064
Oh, no.

633
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,191
Are those...

634
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:00,526
He's out of time.

635
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,696
Well, come on.
We need to get him in the air.

636
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,615
I don't think he will ever
let us help him again.

637
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,628
Don't worry. We're his only friends.

638
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:22,006
He has no choice. He has to say yes.

639
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,549
No!

640
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,427
The mutation that made you small
should not have an effect

641
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,888
on your ability to navigate the air.

642
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,932
Do either of you know more about flying
than you did swimming?

643
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,142
Mmm, no.

644
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:37,313
Look, Roz, whatever task
you think you're doing, you're done.

645
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,814
You can just leave.

646
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:40,358
Wow.

647
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:43,235
And after all we've done for him.

648
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,987
Are you going to let him do that?

649
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:46,821
No.

650
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:50,117
Your life is not negotiable.

651
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:53,704
If you are willing to do this,
you can fly away,

652
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,374
and we can both go to where we belong.

653
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,840
You really think we can do this?

654
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,344
A Rozzum always completes its task.

655
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,700
Ooh.

656
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,833
You just need more speed.

657
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,380
Ready?
I guess I have to be.

658
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,327
I don't know what to say.

659
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,412
Good.

660
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,472
Okay, now.

661
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,100
I'm up!

662
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,444
I do not know what to do next.

663
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,702
Roz?

664
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:57,828
I'm fine.

665
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,038
Go again.

666
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,002
It's no use. They're too small.

667
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,379
You can't be up there with him.

668
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:10,007
Then we'll find someone who can.

669
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,800
You home?

670
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,427
We have a proposition.

671
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:14,970
Mm-mm.

672
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,347
A flight instructor?

673
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,806
What loser did you dig up to...

674
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,646
Meet Thunderbolt.

675
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,608
So, you think small wings
to be a disappointment?

676
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,986
Small wings are teeth,
the claws of the sky.

677
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,821
Those... Those are, uh, different things.

678
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,198
Show me your teeth!

679
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,284
Beautiful. Begin.

680
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,164
Remember, there's nothing he can do
that you can't.

681
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,002
So, he's safe, right?

682
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,963
Hmm? Maybe.

683
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,381
Follow me.

684
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:54,635
Your shape takes more work
to fly straight,

685
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,389
but easier to turn and dive.

686
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:03,894
You ready?

687
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,233
Not bad for a goose.

688
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,332
Whoo-hoo!

689
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:28,294
Exactly. Again.

690
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,721
You should be commended.

691
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,181
Thank you, uh...

692
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:44,935
Longneck, one of the leaders
of the coming migration.

693
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,230
I've been watching you both for some time.

694
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:52,318
You are the only goose
that has ever bothered to be civil with us.

695
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:56,905
We geese are a cranky lot,
suspicious of pretty much everything.

696
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:00,576
But at least
we're good conversationalists.

697
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,535
Really?

698
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,912
No. We're also boring.

699
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:05,331
All we do is gossip.

700
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,833
I dare say Brightbill is
the most interesting among us,

701
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,835
though none would ever admit it.

702
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,588
When do you leave?

703
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,175
A week.

704
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,053
Can Brightbill...

705
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,512
Endurance.

706
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,931
Keep him in the air all day.

707
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:26,310
First light to dusk,
his feet cannot touch the ground.

708
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,394
Understand?

709
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,979
I understand.

710
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:32,775
Brightbill was never supposed
to get this far.

711
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,942
You know that.

712
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:38,280
It is more dangerous for him
than anyone else.

713
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:40,532
But he has a chance

714
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:46,372
if where his wings end,
his heart can pay the balance.

715
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:49,291
His heart is 48 millimeters.

716
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,542
From what I've seen,

717
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:55,297
Brightbill's heart is much bigger
on the inside than the outside.

718
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,927
Endurance. Then we'll talk.

719
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,089
Don't give up.

720
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,507
Come on, kid.

721
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,344
Get your butt back up in the air
where it belongs!

722
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:49,518
Gentle motivation is a mom skill.
You'll learn it.

723
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:57,901
Attaboy.

724
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,101
What's he doing here?

725
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,312
Does he think he's coming with us?

726
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,107
Things still weird with you two?

727
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,358
Still weird.

728
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,152
Attention, everyone.

729
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,322
The time has come again.

730
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:47,743
This flight is thousands
of unforgiving miles.

731
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:52,498
It has shaped us and tested us
over millennia.

732
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:56,251
Now, join your families, and good luck.

733
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,880
Aha! There you are. Right on time.

734
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,298
Hello, Brightbill.

735
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,008
Wait, you know my name?

736
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,469
Roz and I go way back.

737
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,765
Brightbill, you have
an amazing journey ahead.

738
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,058
I envy you.

739
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,894
Nothing can equal
a goose's first migration.

740
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:14,978
Thank you.

741
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,439
I would be delighted
if you would join my group.

742
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,733
Been ages since I had a youngster
in my formation.

743
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:20,818
What do you say?

744
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,110
I-I promise I'll keep up.

745
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,739
Lock in close on my right side...

746
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,951
No, left. I mean... Oh, this side.

747
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:39,753
This flight is a gift Roz has given you.

748
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:41,213
Yeah, I understand.

749
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,257
No, you don't.

750
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,467
You see any other geese here your size?

751
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,556
The accident that killed your family
saved you.

752
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,600
I... I never thought of it that way.

753
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,728
Funny, how life works.

754
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,441
Thank you for looking after my...

755
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,528
for looking after Brightbill.

756
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,988
Goodbye, Roz.

757
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,282
I am honored to have met you.

758
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:13,287
You are a credit to w-whatever species
it is you belong to.

759
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,832
A bit worse for wear, I'm afraid.

760
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:21,378
I'd say you shine like new.

761
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,132
What are you waiting for, Hortensia?

762
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,467
This migration isn't gonna fly itself.

763
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,226
Well, guess it's time.

764
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,020
Yes.

765
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,356
Will you be here when I get back?

766
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,483
No.

767
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,948
I'm glad you're going where you belong.

768
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:51,992
Roz, I...

769
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:53,952
I, um...

770
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:55,787
Brightbill!

771
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,373
I could use a boost.

772
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,465
Hey, little guy.

773
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:09,426
Fly like you, not like them.

774
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,594
I will.

775
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,139
Bye, Fink. Thank you.

776
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,683
Ready?

777
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:17,976
I guess I have to be.

778
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,179
Roz?

779
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,349
I...

780
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,118
Brightbill, follow me.

781
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,005
Must be a relief.

782
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,967
Yes. Brightbill is where he belongs.

783
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:17,637
And now you can return to your
solitary life of struggling to survive

784
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:20,265
on an island where everything
wants to kill and eat you.

785
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:23,351
Yeah! And you can go
to that place you've never been

786
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,312
and don't know
what's going to happen to you.

787
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,773
Yes.
Yes, so...

788
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,524
All good.
All good.

789
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:31,818
Amazing!
Amazing.

790
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:33,945
Even...

791
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:36,990
Amazing.

792
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:43,413
Hmm, not that it matters,
but who says you need to leave?

793
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,542
I am not sure. Them, I guess.

794
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,128
Your programming?

795
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:57,135
Well, time for me to go underground
for the winter.

796
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:58,220
Fink?

797
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:03,183
Unless you want to stay, 'cause we could...
we could hang out and... and do stuff.

798
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:07,145
How do you know if you love something?

799
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:08,647
Someone?

800
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:12,692
If you do, you...
you should probably tell them.

801
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,071
What if it is too late?

802
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,574
I wouldn't know.

803
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,578
Fink?

804
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:34,441
Rozzum 7134.
Task complete.

805
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:43,742
Activating return transmitter
in three, two, one.

806
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,471
<i>Distress signal received.
Mapping location.</i>

807
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:17,150
Is something on your mind?

808
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:20,695
I-I forgot to say something before I left.

809
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,031
Maybe they heard it anyway.

810
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:26,576
Sometimes hearts have
their own conversations.

811
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:50,350
We must descend,
find shelter while this blows over.

812
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,643
Stay close.

813
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:54,604
There. Follow me.

814
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:58,942
Come on.

815
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,116
Stay hidden.

816
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,493
We can rest here till the worst is over.

817
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,662
Noise to a minimum, please.

818
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:13,331
Honkington, stop nibbling on everything.

819
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:18,169
Uh, migrations sure are tiring, huh?

820
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,629
Yeah, they all hate me.

821
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:31,891
Roz?

822
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,395
Roz, what are you doing here?

823
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,938
I'm so glad to see you.

824
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:40,025
There's something I needed to tell you,
but... but there wasn't time.

825
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:41,109
Roz, I...

826
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,075
Activate.
Yeah.

827
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,664
<i>Animal infestation.</i>

828
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,416
<i>Animal infestation.</i>
Task acquired.

829
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,169

01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,087
<i>Animal infestation.</i>

831
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,965
Please, everyone, find your formations.

832
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:05,800
Get a hold of yourselves.

833
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,472
Gad, it's no use.

834
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,682
Wait, Rozzums can't hurt you.

835
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:16,311
Their inhibition protocols prevent
deliberate conflict or harm to others.

836
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:17,812
You're not afraid of them.

837
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,898
You grew up with these things.

838
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:21,274
Whoa, whoa, I don't understand.

839
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,818
They're panicked. You're not.

840
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:26,154
Right now, our only chance
is to be led out

841
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,531
by someone that doesn't
think like a goose.

842
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,616
Follow me.

843
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,285
Uh, maybe we should just think about this.

844
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,039
<i>Navigation compromised.</i>

845
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,467
I'm going to get them to follow you.

846
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,095
When they do, lead them out.

847
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:53,765
Peck, Honkington,
fall in behind us.

848
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:57,977
Now, Brightbill, take lead.

849
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:01,064
Yeah, why not? Okay.

850
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,817
There's nothing I can do that you can't.

851
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,026
Here we go.

852
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:12,075
Tight turn. Come on.

853
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,621
Dive. Now climb. That's it.

854
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:19,791
Ha! Glad I lived long enough to see that.

855
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,835
I'll buy you some time.

856
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,921
Follow Brightbill. Don't wait for me.

857
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:28,799
Keep up.

858
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,265
That's it.

859
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,061
Faster. Hurry.

860
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:42,438
Come on.

861
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,617
Brightbill.

862
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,082
Fink?

863
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:03,835
Roz?

864
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,754
Roz! Hey!

865
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,882
What... What are you doing here?

866
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:12,719
I may have turned off the transmitter.

867
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,264
Even though Brightbill
does not want me here,

868
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,892
I needed to know if he made it.

869
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,561
Breaking the rules?

870
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,355
I thought you had to do
what they told you?

871
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,320
It is good to see a friend.

872
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,575
Wait, why are you awake?

873
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,077
It is bad out there.

874
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:40,121
Worst storm I've ever seen.

875
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:43,958
Cold got to me in my den,
and I got a deep den.

876
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,503
Are others in danger?

877
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:47,587
Hmm?

878
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:52,050
Um...

879
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:53,635
Yeah.

880
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,142
Are you sure about this?

881
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:04,312
We could have the whole island
to ourselves come spring.

882
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:08,733
Why are you interested in eliminating
everyone else from this island?

883
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,152
No one likes me.

884
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:15,615
Nor me, but right now
we are their only chance.

885
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,368
Funny, how life works.

886
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:20,954
Okay.

887
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:28,378
Here.

888
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:36,469
Can you find more?

889
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,862
Mom?
We're gonna be okay.

890
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,579
What are you doing here, jerk?

891
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,664
Bummer, this one's dead.

892
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,292
That is not funny.

893
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,468
Paddler?

894
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,056
I'm f-f-fine.

895
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:29,522
Don't give up.

896
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,507
You don't look so good.

897
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:59,302
Is everyone accounted for?

898
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,763
Hmm, maybe one more.

899
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:22,659
Oh, yeah?

900
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:32,126
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing? Take it outside.

901
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,546
Hey, those are Brightbill's baby pictures.
Put that down.

902
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:40,468
What the...

903
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,054
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

904
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:44,597
Knock it off.

905
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,015
You think those grow on trees?

906
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,017
Hmm? Hey. No.

907
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,103
Fink only.

908
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:54,482
Anyone seen my lost fuzz balls?

909
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,984
Smelly, noisy, prone to biting?

910
01:09:57,068 --> 01:09:58,486
We're all gonna die!

911
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,366
What's he doing here?

912
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,576
Oh, great. This'll help.

913
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,871
Get out of here. I worked hard on this.

914
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:12,208
Fink, what is happening?

915
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:15,336
You put a bunch of predators
and their food supply in one room.

916
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,546
Who knew?

917
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:17,880
That's my lunch.

918
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,090
Fink.
What?

919
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:20,675
Help them.

920
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:26,389
Quiet!

921
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:30,767
Shh!

922
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,774
The jerk wants to speak.

923
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:43,239
Most of you hate me,
and I hate most of you.

924
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:47,410
Everyone in here hates someone else.
It's true.

925
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:50,830
But here we are, and here's the deal.

926
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,999
First one that walks out that door
is dead,

927
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,544
and if we can't keep it together in here,
everyone's dead.

928
01:10:56,627 --> 01:11:01,382
We all got one chance to see next spring,
because of her.

929
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:05,094
The thing. The monster.

930
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,430
Well, her name is Roz.

931
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:11,726
And while you all ran from her
and stole from her and made fun of her,

932
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,771
all she's been trying to do
is raise her kid.

933
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,064
The little one that no one gave a chance.

934
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:19,692
Including me.

935
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:24,530
She's the one who got you
out of the storm, built this place.

936
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,992
And, despite my suggestion
that she let you all freeze,

937
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:31,871
she risked everything to bring you here.

938
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:41,714
I know you all have instincts
that keep you alive.

939
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,717
But sometimes to survive,

940
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:49,305
we must become more
than we were programmed to be.

941
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:54,519
Before I shut down,
I need you to promise me one thing.

942
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,938
A truce.

943
01:11:57,897 --> 01:11:59,899
Just while we're in here.

944
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,319
She's right.

945
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:10,368
I will not harm anyone.
Not while we're in here.

946
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,267
No.

947
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,144
Ugh!

948
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:42,775
We won't even pretend to die
while we're in here.

949
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:46,320
Roz? What's going on?

950
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,698
I completed my task.

951
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,366
You sure about that?

952
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:56,497
I will consider this.

953
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:50,927
He'll be here. I know he will.

954
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:03,439
Brightbill. He's alive.

955
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,650
Look what we have here.

956
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,526
Brightbill.
We made it.

957
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,612
Brightbill, Brightbill.
I believed in you day one.

958
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,155
Let's hear it for Brightbill.

959
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:12,615
Okay. Okay.
You did it.

960
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,426
I knew you could.
We owe you, Brightbill.

961
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,785
To our flight leader.

962
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:16,869
Let's do it.
Yes, yes.

963
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,038
Okay.
Let's hear it for Brightbill.

964
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,165
He found where he belongs.

965
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:28,005
Hey, kid!

966
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,173
Fink.

967
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:31,300
Welcome back.

968
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,180
No, no, it's okay. He's with me.

969
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:43,229
I did it, Fink.
I led them to the summer nesting grounds.

970
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,232
And where's Longneck?

971
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,028
Sorry, kid.

972
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,823
But, hey, you really did it.

973
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,825
Roz is gonna be so excited.

974
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,827
Roz? Wait, she's here?

975
01:14:58,452 --> 01:15:00,955
She stayed. For you.

976
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:05,459
I thought I saw her right over there.

977
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:10,089
Roz. Roz, I need to talk to you.

978
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,173
Roz?

979
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:55,968
Rozzum 7134, I presume.

980
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,182
And you must be Universal Dynamics.

981
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:04,351
Yes. I am Vontra.

982
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:09,106
Virtual Observational Neutralizing
Troublesome Retrieval Authority.

983
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,025
You seem happy.

984
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:16,280
The good people at Universal Dynamics have
programmed us to put our targets at ease

985
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:19,033
so as to more efficiently facilitate
their collection.

986
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:22,119
But don't worry,
despite my cheery demeanor,

987
01:16:22,203 --> 01:16:26,457
I am unfeeling,
inflexible and morally neutral.

988
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:30,586
That is a big ship just for me.

989
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,089
You are a big deal.

990
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:37,760
You are one of six Rozzums
lost from a container ship in a typhoon.

991
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,596
So that is how I got here.

992
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:43,099
You were not easy to find.

993
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:47,144
Moments after receiving your signal,
we lost it again.

994
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:52,274
Almost as if a certain Rozzum unit
shut it off.

995
01:16:53,192 --> 01:16:55,611
Someone has been busy.

996
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,905
I was simply completing a task.

997
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:59,657
As am I.

998
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,242
Tell me.

999
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:06,330
How did you secure a task in a place
where nothing can communicate with you?

1000
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:09,041
It is complicated.

1001
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:12,378
And we cannot wait to hear all about it.

1002
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:15,798
Come aboard, 7134.

1003
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,800
We will fix you right up.

1004
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,681
My name is Roz.

1005
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:27,518
Is something keeping you,

1006
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:29,353
Roz?

1007
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,438
No.

1008
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:47,121
Roz! What are you doing?

1009
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:48,914
Quit messing around.
Fink?

1010
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:52,418
It's Brightbill. He needs to talk to you.

1011
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,087
I think I've forgotten something.

1012
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,173
Roz.

1013
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:00,259
It is imperative you return to this ship.

1014
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,510
Yes, uh,

1015
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:06,891
I left my transverse adapter thing
out there.

1016
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,143
I'll just go get it and be right back.

1017
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,478
Voice stress analyzer indicates you are...

1018
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:13,814
Lying your butt off back there.

1019
01:18:13,898 --> 01:18:15,399
I'm so proud of you.

1020
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:21,655
Your target is Rozzum 7134.

1021
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:22,740
Deploy.

1022
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,242
Launch flares.

1023
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,177
You coming?

1024
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:11,872
Brightbill.

1025
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:14,208
Roz, I have so much to tell...

1026
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:18,796
Are those your parents?

1027
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:23,342
I know predators, and those are predators.

1028
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:24,927
Acknowledge return command.

1029
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,262
What are they saying?

1030
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:28,222
They want me to come with them.

1031
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:30,140
Tell them you're already home.

1032
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,308
Yeah!

1033
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:33,495
Tell them you're already home.
You're already home.

1034
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:36,021
Yeah, tell them.
I am already home, thank you.

1035
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:39,566
You do not belong here.
This is a wilderness.

1036
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:42,736
And I am a wild robot.

1037
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,578
Are you here to kill us?

1038
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,456
It says yes!

1039
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:22,443
Get him!
Whoo-hoo!

1040
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:25,904
Status?

1041
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,615
<i>It is not cooperating.</i>

1042
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,785
Roz, behind you!

1043
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:33,037
Rozzum unit captured.

1044
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,164
Okay, it's all you.
It's all you.

1045
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:36,832
Make it look good.

1046
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:44,214
Oops.

1047
01:20:44,298 --> 01:20:47,760
Let us divide the robot meat amongst us.

1048
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:48,844
You scare me.

1049
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:50,095
Damage detected.

1050
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:52,723
Activating return transmitter.

1051
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,199
Roz?

1052
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,702
Roz, no!

1053
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:17,498
Gotcha.

1054
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,216
Come on.

1055
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:28,300
On your left.

1056
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:36,975
Uh, guys.

1057
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,650
What is happening?

1058
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:47,611
You will be reconditioned
and returned to rotation.

1059
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:52,491
But first, we need everything
inside that head of yours.

1060
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,575
Why?

1061
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,327
You've changed.

1062
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:57,538
The data you've amassed
while on this island

1063
01:21:57,621 --> 01:22:00,874
is priceless to Universal Dynamics.

1064
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,427
Please, I want to keep my memories.

1065
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:14,096
Your memories are what we came for.

1066
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:17,266
Can I keep just one?

1067
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:18,767
Mmm.

1068
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:19,852
No.

1069
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:24,189
<i>Alert. Alert.</i>

1070
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,234
<i>Multiple objects in flight path.</i>

1071
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:29,611
<i>Evasive action.</i>

1072
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,166
Please,
I want to keep my memories.

1073
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,628
Hello. I'm home. <i>Bonjour.</i>
Just ask. Brightbill. <i>Hola.</i> Roz...

1074
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:05,731
Roz?

1075
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:07,983
Roz!

1076
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:19,828
Roz?

1077
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,554
What happened was not your fault.

1078
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:42,935
But what you did to try
and fix it is everything.

1079
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:50,442
I love you...

1080
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:53,654
Mom.

1081
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:16,468
I love you too.

1082
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:17,970
Roz?

1083
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:19,638
Roz!

1084
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:25,936
Let's go home.

1085
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,939
<i>Alert. Rozzum unit escaping.</i>

1086
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:31,316
Impossible.

1087
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:33,110
Where are we going?

1088
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:36,405
Only one animal is big enough
to stop this.

1089
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,789
Uh, Paddler? You got a minute?

1090
01:24:45,872 --> 01:24:49,251
Uh, we have suddenly taken an interest
in your project.

1091
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:51,878
Male bovine excrement.

1092
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:54,006
You're in trouble, and you need my tree.

1093
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,425
Yes. Yes, we do.

1094
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:59,928
Everyone that made fun of me
and mocked my project,

1095
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:01,430
admit you were wrong.

1096
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:03,140
Oh, we're so sorry.
Sorry.

1097
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:04,308
Now you.

1098
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:05,726
I already did.

1099
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:08,645
Now say I'm cool. And don't lie.

1100
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,480
Fink!

1101
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:24,036
Roz!

1102
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,120
Stay quiet.

1103
01:25:25,203 --> 01:25:28,874
Universal Dynamics cannot afford
their Rozzums going off script,

1104
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:34,212
modifying their code, forming connections
with things they should not.

1105
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:36,632
Brightbill has nothing to do with this.

1106
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:39,509
Please, at least let me return him.

1107
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:42,512
Oh, I'm bringing you both back for study.

1108
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:45,641
Neither of you needs to be in one piece
to do that.

1109
01:25:53,899 --> 01:25:57,069
We will just keep coming
until we have you.

1110
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,529
We will just keep coming
until we have you.

1111
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:01,114
What's it saying?

1112
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:02,324
Nothing important.

1113
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:04,034
...just keep coming.

1114
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:07,537
We will just keep coming until we...

1115
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:10,415
What now?

1116
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:20,592
I can't fly.

1117
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,386
You don't need to.

1118
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,976
Don't be afraid.

1119
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,410
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't... Don't you need that?

1120
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:48,829
I have everything I need.

1121
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:51,581
All power to exterior.

1122
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:59,172
You call yourselves animals? Let's go!

1123
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:03,009
For the island. For Roz.

1124
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:49,473
On a scale of one to ten,
how would you rate my performance?

1125
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:51,183
Yeah!
Yay! Look at us!

1126
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,185
We did it! We did it!

1127
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,353
Do not scare me like that again.
Hooray!

1128
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:58,023
Due to my sticks and my tree.
Good job, guys.

1129
01:27:58,106 --> 01:27:59,900
Well done, everyone.
We did it.

1130
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:02,319
You weren't so bad yourself.

1131
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:03,779
I helped, right?

1132
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:07,532
That'll teach whatever those things are
to come around here.

1133
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,785
If they come back, I'm gonna bite 'em.

1134
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:25,675
Great job, kid!

1135
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:28,428
They will just keep coming
until they have me.

1136
01:28:28,512 --> 01:28:30,347
And we'll be ready.

1137
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:33,183
We can fight them off
as many times as we need to.

1138
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:36,394
You don't need to.

1139
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,606
What are you saying? You're...

1140
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,525
leaving?

1141
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:42,943
Yes.

1142
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:46,988
To protect all of you, there are things
there that I must put right.

1143
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:48,824
No. They'll take your memories.

1144
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:50,408
Th-They'll take you.

1145
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:53,620
Remember when you talked to me on the ship?

1146
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:57,999
They cut my power,
but I still heard you.

1147
01:28:58,083 --> 01:29:01,878
Because I was listening
with a different part of myself.

1148
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:05,632
Wherever that is,
that's where I keep me.

1149
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:11,221
And I promise
they'll never, ever find it.

1150
01:29:11,304 --> 01:29:14,641
But we fought so hard
for you to stay.

1151
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:16,226
You did.

1152
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:19,938
And you gained far more
than just saving me.

1153
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:23,859
You came together as an island.

1154
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:29,030
When I do this,
you will all be safe from them forever.

1155
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:30,365
Don't do this.

1156
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:32,659
But you...

1157
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:37,873
you're my friend,
and I-I-I never had one before,

1158
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:40,458
and... I need you.

1159
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:43,879
And what if I get lost or...
or he's hurt, or... or...

1160
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:47,757
or... what if I need to
tell you something and you're not here?

1161
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,347
You can tell me.

1162
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,433
And me.

1163
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:59,728
And you can talk to me as well.
If you must.

1164
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,939
This is my migration,

1165
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:08,820
and when it is time,
I promise I will find my way home.

1166
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:42,103
You know,
I'll be chasing you again tomorrow.

1167
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:46,107
Nah, just kidding.

1168
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:19,182
Oh.

1169
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,143
Mmm.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1170
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:23,979
Why are you bigger than everyone else?

1171
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:25,355
Artistic license.

1172
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:28,650
The scale is based on
the hierarchy of importance.

1173
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:31,444
<i>Could this world get any better?</i>

1174
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:35,031
<i>Introducing the Rozzum line
of helper robo...</i>

1175
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,535
Yeah, yeah,
you watch that too much.

1176
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:39,619
Story time.

1177
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:41,496
Get going.

1178
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:44,082
Settle down.

1179
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:51,756
Once, there was an island
with all sorts of animals,

1180
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:55,010
and they fought, and they ran, and they hid.

1181
01:31:55,093 --> 01:31:58,179
But, mostly, they were scared.

1182
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:02,809
But then,
a robot fell right out of the sky.

1183
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,102
Roz.

1184
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:06,021
She had some strange ideas.

1185
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:08,898
Thought kindness was a survival skill.

1186
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:10,734
And you know what?

1187
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:12,360
She was right.

1188
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:13,778
Where is she now?

1189
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:17,073
Well, they needed her
back where she came from.

1190
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:20,785
<i>She has some very important work
to finish there.</i>

1191
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:24,039
<i>Will we ever see her again?
Will she ever come home?</i>

1192
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:25,874
<i>Yeah, will she?</i>

1193
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:30,712
<i>Well, if I know Roz,
she's making a plan to come back.</i>

1194
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:34,883
<i>And a Rozzum always completes its task.</i>

1195
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:39,137
Hello, I am Rozzum 7134.

1196
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:07,082
But you can call me Roz.

1197
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:28,082
Mmm.

1198
01:41:33,838 --> 01:41:35,631
Squirrels.
