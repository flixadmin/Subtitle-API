would unleash
the full power of the Bifrost

of space-time.

I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

it's theirs.

So, you just intend to go in there
and take it?

Yes.

Listen to what he's saying.

517
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,587
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

518
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,381
It's the stories I grew up with as a child.

519

I'm just going to drive him. That's it.

I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

- Jane!

Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realize. Let it go.

Let it go? This is my life.

We're investigating a security threat.

We need to appropriate your records

543

By "appropriate," do you mean steal?

I can't just buy replacements

Then I'm sure you can do it again.

And I'm sure I can sue you
for violating my constitutional rights!

but we're the good guys.

And everything I know
about this phenomenon

554
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:27,827
is either in this lab or in this book.

01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:08,418
Good.

812
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,964
In that case, I'll buy you another round,
and you leave town tonight.

813
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,054
Two boilermakers.

814
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:12,940
LAUFEY: Kill him.

815
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,736
After all I've done for you?

816
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:23,785
So you're the one
who showed us the way into Asgard.

817
01:09:24,202 --> 01:09:26,371
That was just a bit of fun, really.

818
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:30,541
To ruin my brother's big day.

819
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:35,171
And to protect the realm
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

820
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:38,841
I will hear you.

821
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:46,641
I will conceal you
and a handful of your soldiers,

822
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:52,397
lead you into Odin's chambers,
and you can slay him where he lies.

823
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:54,399
Why not kill him yourself?

824
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:55,900
(SNORTS)

825
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:59,278
I suspect that the Asgardians
would not take kindly

826
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:01,572
to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.

827
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:05,702
Once Odin is dead,
I will return the Casket to you

828
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:10,915
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

829
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,002
Glory.

830
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,755
I...

831
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:20,800
Accept.

832
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:28,474
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

833
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:33,771
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

834
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:35,690
You were shrouded from me,

835
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,900
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

836
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:41,654
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

837
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:43,364
Or perhaps someone has found a way

838
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:46,492
to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.

839
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:49,829
You have great power, Heimdall.

840
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,833
Did Odin ever fear you?

841
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:57,795
- No.
- And why is that?

842
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:01,090
Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.

843
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:05,636
He was your king
and you're sworn to obey me now.

844
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:07,472
Yes?

845
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:13,728
Yes.

846
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,690
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

847
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:20,777
until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

848
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,993
(BANGING ON DOOR)

849
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,502
(GASPS) Oh, my God. Is he okay?

850
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,629
He's fine. Not injured at all.

851
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,298
- (GROANS)
- I'm sorry, my friend.

852
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:44,217
- What happened?
- We drank, we fought,

853
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,802
he made his ancestors proud.

854
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:48,095
Ah, put him on the bed.

855
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:54,852
(GROANS)

856
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:57,438
Okay. (LAUGHING)

857
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,610
I still don't think
you're the God of Thunder.

858
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:05,696
But you ought to be.

859
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,209
Are these your chambers?

860
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:22,046
Uh, it's more
of a temporary living situation.

861
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:23,130
Oh.

862
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:27,134
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

863
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,596
Actually, um, I never have guests.

864
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,976
That's not the right place for it.

865
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:37,603
I'm sorry, um...

866
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:41,649
Can we go outside?

867
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:43,943
Yes, of course.

868
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,742
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep

869
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:55,872
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

870
01:12:57,164 --> 01:13:00,585
I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

871
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:06,549
I'm really glad you're safe.

872
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:10,177
You've been very kind to me,

873
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,847
and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.

874
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,849
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

875
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,059
so I think that kind of evens things out.

876
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:21,147
Perhaps I had it coming.

877
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:28,529
Oh, my God!

878
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:31,073
I don't believe it!

879
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:34,702
It was all I could get back.
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

880
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:39,457
No, no, this is great! This is...
I don't have to start from scratch now.

881
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,208
Thank you.

882
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:47,173
What's wrong?

883
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,508
S.H.I.E.L.D.

884
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:50,968
Whatever they are,

885
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:53,971
they're gonna do
everything in their power

886
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:56,849
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

887
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,476
No, Jane.

888
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,853
Listen to me. You must not give up.

889
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,397
- You must finish what you've started.
- Why?

890
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:04,899
Because you're right.

891
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:06,943
Here, look.

892
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:12,990
Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

893
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:16,160
Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

894
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,510
What is that?

895
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:36,681
My father explained it to me like this,

896
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,516
that your world

897
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:41,435
is one of the Nine Realms
of the Cosmos,

898
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:44,397
linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil,

899
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,065
the Worlds Tree.

900
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,735
Now you see it every day
without realizing.

901
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:53,030
The images glimpsed through, uh,
what did you call it? This...

902
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:55,241
This Hooble Telescope.

903
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:58,369
- Hubble.
- Hubble Telescope.

904
01:14:58,452 --> 01:14:59,370
(LAUGHS)

905
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,165
Tell me more.

906
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,209
So, the Nine Realms.

907
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:08,462
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.

908
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,214
This is Alfheim.

909
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:13,217
Vanaheim. Jotunheim.

910
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,469
And Asgard.

911
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,847
<i>And that's where I come from.</i>

912
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,657
Thank you, Jane.

913

FANDRAL: Our dearest friend banished,
Loki on the throne,

914
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,292
Asgard on the brink of war,
yet you've managed to consume

915
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,670
four wild boar,
six pheasant, a side of beef,

916
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:53,132
and two casks of ale. Shame on you.
Don't you care?

917
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,177
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!

918
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,220
Stop it, both of you!

919
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,388
Stop.

920
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:03,225
- We all know what we have to do.
- We must go.

921
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:07,730
We must find Thor.

922
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,316
It's treason.

923
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:12,276
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

924
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:14,570
Thor would do the same for us.

925
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:17,073
Now shush.

926
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:20,785
Heimdall might be watching.

930
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:38,094
You would defy the commands of Loki,
our king,

931
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,222
break every oath you
have taken as warriors,

932
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:43,724
and commit treason to bring Thor back?

933
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,309
- Yes.
- Good.

934
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:47,269
So you'll help us?

I cannot open the bridge to you.

Complicated fellow, isn't he?

937
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,278
Now what do we do?

938
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:58,948
Look!

939
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:19,677
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, sir.

940

We got massive energy readings
out of nowhere

Yeah.

It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

But you won't be able to convince
the scientific community of any of it.

Not without hard evidence.

I've never been happier to see anyone.

But you should not have come.

We're here to take you home.

01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,815
(YELLING)

1135
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:25,465
(LAUGHING)

1136
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:41,689
Thor!

1137
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:50,823
Brother, please.

1138
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:55,912
(LAUGHING)

1139
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:03,169
Enough!

1140
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:24,816
(GRUNTING)

1141
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:35,952
(SCREAMING)

1142
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:48,548
Look at you,

1143
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:52,427
the Mighty Thor,

1144
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:57,265
with all your strength,

1145
01:38:58,558 --> 01:39:01,018
and what good does it do you now, huh?

1146
01:39:02,562 --> 01:39:06,149
Do you hear me, Brother?
There's nothing you can do!

1147
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,334
What are you doing?

1148
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:30,673
If you destroy the bridge,
you'll never see her again!

1149
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:41,559
Forgive me, Jane.

1150
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,563
(BOTH YELLING)

1151
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:22,350
I could have done it, Father!

1152
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:25,394
I could have done it!

1153
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:27,063
For you!

1154
01:40:27,813 --> 01:40:29,315
For all of us!

1155
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:32,818
No, Loki.

1156
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:42,453
Loki, no.

1157
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:45,540
No!

1158
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:51,420
No.

1159
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:08,896
JANE: It's gone.

1160
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:18,257
(ALL LAUGHING)

1161
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:24,305
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1162
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:28,768
I flew into the giant metal creature
and laid him low!

1163
01:42:28,851 --> 01:42:32,396
FANDRAL: Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?

1164
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:38,653
VOLSTAGG: As a matter of fact, falling
was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...

1165
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:55,670
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1166
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:02,843
FRIGGA: <i>How is he?</i>

1167
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,181
SIF: <i>He mourns for his brother.</i>

1168
01:43:08,516 --> 01:43:09,684
<i>And...</i>

1169
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:12,395
<i>He misses her.</i>

1170
01:43:13,396 --> 01:43:14,730
<i>The mortal.</i>

1171
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:32,915
You'll be a wise king.

1172
01:43:37,378 --> 01:43:39,755
There will never be
a wiser king than you.

1173
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:42,883
Or a better father.

1174
01:43:53,769 --> 01:43:56,939
I have much to learn.

1175
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:00,443
I know that now.

1176
01:44:05,448 --> 01:44:07,241
Someday, perhaps,

1177
01:44:08,701 --> 01:44:10,619
I shall make you proud.

1178
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:20,296
You've already made me proud.

1179
01:44:34,977 --> 01:44:36,979
THOR: So Earth is lost to us.

1180
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:39,064
No.

1181
01:44:40,316 --> 01:44:42,109
There is always hope.

1182
01:44:46,322 --> 01:44:47,823
Can you see her?

1183
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:49,825
(HEIMDALL LAUGHS)

1184
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:51,660
<i>Yes.</i>

1185
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:57,500
ERIK: I have the particle detectors!

1186
01:44:57,583 --> 01:44:59,877
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite codes?

1187
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,046
DARCY: Yeah. Have you seen my Taser?

1188
01:45:02,129 --> 01:45:03,547
THOR: <i>How is she?</i>

1189
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:05,674
ERIK: In the car. Come on, Jane!

1190
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:08,135
HEIMDALL: <i>She searches for you.</i>

1191
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:19,626
NICK FURY: Dr. Selvig.

1192
01:53:22,462 --> 01:53:24,631
So you're the man behind all this?

1193
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,844
It's quite a labyrinth.

1194
01:53:29,511 --> 01:53:32,931
I was thinking
they're taking me down here to kill me.

1195
01:53:40,647 --> 01:53:43,442
I've been hearing
about the New Mexico situation.

1196
01:53:44,401 --> 01:53:48,030
Your work has impressed a lot of people
who are much smarter than I am.

1197
01:53:48,113 --> 01:53:50,198
I have a lot to work with.

1198
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:54,119
The Foster Theory.
A gateway to another dimension.

1199
01:53:54,786 --> 01:53:55,954
It's unprecedented.

1200
01:53:58,498 --> 01:53:59,458
Isn't it?

1201
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:06,506
Legend tells us one thing,
history, another.

1202
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:10,927
But every now and then,
we find something that belongs to both.

1203
01:54:18,852 --> 01:54:19,728
What is it?

1204
01:54:19,811 --> 01:54:20,854
Power, Doctor.

1205
01:54:21,563 --> 01:54:23,440
If we can figure out how to tap it,

1206
01:54:24,024 --> 01:54:25,359
maybe unlimited power.

1207
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:33,408
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

1208
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:37,537
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
