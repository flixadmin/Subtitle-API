1
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,131
Man: Brace the wind.

2
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,779
Melisandre: The lord of light
has made good on his promise, my king.

3
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,806
His fires have melted the snows away.

4
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,266
The way ahead is clear.

5
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,018
We ride for winterfell.

6
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,227
And you will take it.

7
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,565
The lord has shown me
Bolton banners burning.

8
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,444
You will receive what is yours by right.

9
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,841
Your grace?

10
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,385
Prepare to form up.

11
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,844
Your grace?

12
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,849
Tell me.

13
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,184
The men,

14
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,936
many deserted before dawn.

15
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,732
Stannis: How many?

16
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,734
General: Nearly half.

17
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,487
All the sellswords with all the horses.

18
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,499
Your grace?

19
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,797
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

20
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,996
Cut her down.

21
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,510
General: Your grace?

22
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,639
The lady melisandre
was just seen riding out of camp.

23
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,612
Get the men into marching formation.

24
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,657
On to winterfell.

25
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,080
He raised his hands,

26
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,918
and they all stood up at once.

27
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,090
Tens of thousands of them.
The biggest army in the world.

28
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,218
So what are you gonna do?

29
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,848
I'm gonna hope they don't learn
how to climb the wall.

30
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:09,392
But the dragonglass...

31
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,562
No one's ever getting that back now.

32
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,566
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

33
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,319
But you killed a white Walker.

34
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,737
Jon: With longclaw.

35
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,574
I saw them shatter steel axes
like they were glass.

36
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,661
- But longclaw...
- Samwell: Is valyrian steel.

37
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,247
How many valyrian steel swords
are left in the seven kingdoms?

38
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,790
Not enough.

39
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,145
The first lord commander in history

40
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,882
to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers
to save the lives of wildlings.

41
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,597
How's it feel to be friends
with the most hated man in castle black?

42
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,534
Samwell: You were friends with me
when I first came here.

43
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,018
And I wasn't winning
any elections back then.

44
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,854
Here's to us, then.

45
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,273
Long may they sneer.

46
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,657
What?

47
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,288
I wanted to ask you something.

48
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,416
To ask something of you.

49
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,130
Send me, gilly, and the baby to oldtown

50
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,424
so I can become a maester.

51
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,135
That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.

52
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,178
I need you here, Sam.

53
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,558
Ifyouleave,
who's left to give me advice I trust?

54
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:32,893
Well, there's edd.

55
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,858
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

56
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,236
More use to everyone
now that maester aemon is gone.

57
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,489
The citadel has the
world's greatest library.

58
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:52,412
I'll learn about history,
strategy, healing.

59
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,790
And other things, things
that will help when...

60
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,418
When they come.

61
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:04,507
If gilly stays here, then she'll die.

62
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:09,220
And the baby that she
named after me will die.

63
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,223
And I'll end up dying, too,
trying to protect them.

64
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,562
Which means that the last thing
that I'll see in this world

65
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,690
will be the look in her
eyes when I fail them.

66
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,365
And I'd rather see 1,000 white walkers
than see that.

67
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,547
Thank you.

68
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,694
You know at the citadel
they'll make you swear off women, too.

69
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,221
Oh, they'll bloody try.

70
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,350
Sam.

71
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,227
What?

72
00:07:58,687 --> 00:07:59,980
Sam.

73
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,377
You had just been beaten half to death.
How did you...

74
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,402
Oh, very carefully.

75
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:12,701
I'm glad the end of the world's
working out well for someone.

76
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,540
I'll come back.

77
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,085
To your return.

78
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,295
To my return.

79
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,146
Man: Aye, this way.

80
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,725
Podrick: My iadyl

81
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,521
Stannis.

82
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,898
Stannis Baratheon is
coming. His whole army.

83
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,142
How do you know it's Stannis?

84
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,236
He's carrying his flaming heart banners.
From the Blackwater.

85
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,114
I'll never forget it.

86
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,360
Trench here.

87
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,573
Another one 300 yards from the castle wall.
Hurry them along.

88
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,450
- Right, curlew.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,868
Dig between those two rises.

90
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,431
- Spread out.
- Soldier: I'm with you.

91
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,122
Soldier 2: Archers!
Soldier 3: Spread out!

92
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,460
And send out a foraging party immediately.
Siege begins at sunrise.

93
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,379
There's not going to
be a siege, your grace.

94
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,090
Soldier: We've got no chance!

95
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,873
Soldier: No, please, please.

96
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,967
Bolton has women fighting for him?

97
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,388
I don't fight for the boltons.

98
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,641
I'm brienne of tarth.

99
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,521
I was kingsguard to renly Baratheon.

100
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,364
I was there when he was murdered
by a shadow with your face.

101
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,787
You murdered him with blood magic?

102
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,502
I did.

103
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,556
In the name of renly of house Baratheon,

104
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,269
first of his name, rightful king
of the andals and the first men,

105
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,397
lord of the seven kingdoms
and protector of the realm,

106
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:43,568
I, brienne of tarth, sentence you to die.

107
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,452
Do you have any last words?

108
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,212
Go on, do your duty.

109
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,566
Ramsay: Looks like we're done here.

110
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,418
I surrender! I surrender!

111
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,629
And I accept your surrender.

112
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,017
Let's head back.

113
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,019
My wife must be lonely.

114
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,179
My lady.

115
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,557
I've come to escort you
back to your chamber.

116
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,142
Go with her, please.

117
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,731
I know what ramsay is.

118
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,985
I know what he'll do to me.

119
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,574
If I'm going to die,

120
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,994
let it happen
while there's still some of me left.

121
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,163
Die?

122
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,668
Who said anything about dying?
You can't die.

123
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,462
Your father was warden of the north.
Ramsay needs you.

124
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,176
Though I suppose he
doesn't need all of you.

125
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,305
Just the parts he'll use to make his heir,

126
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,683
until you've given him a boy or two,
and he's finished using them.

127
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:27,356
Then he's got incredible
plans for those parts.

128
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:32,570
So, shall we wait for him to come back
or should we begin now?

129
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,033
You're leaving it to me?

130
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,367
Good.

131
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,244
Let's begin.

132
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,957
Reek! Stop!

133
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,551
Man: Open the gate!

134
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,435
He's coming back.

135
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,659
I can see I have my work cut out for me.

136
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,412
You two, out.

137
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,053
You were the first person
on my list, you know.

138
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,056
For killing syrio forel. Remember him?

139
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,767
Probably not.

140
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,396
I've gotten a few of the others.

141
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,275
The many-faced god
stole a few more from me.

142
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:01,445
But I'm glad he left me you.

143
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,742
Do you know who I am?

144
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,706
I can't hear you.

145
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,926
You know who I am.

146
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,803
I'm Arya stark.

147
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,106
Do you know who you are?

148
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,485
You're no one.

149
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,697
You're nothing.

150
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,659
Jaqen: A girl has taken a life.

151
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,037
The wrong life.

152
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,124
I was right about her.

153
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,375
You were.

154
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,962
You're not ready.

155
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,507
Not at all.

156
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,014
That man's life was not yours to take.

157
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,392
A girl stole from the many-faced god.

158
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,938
Now a debt is owed.

159
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,279
Only death can pay for life.

160
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,795
No! No!

161
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,422
No, you don't die! Don't die!

162
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,222
Why are you crying?

163
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,809
He was my friend.

164
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,812
No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

165
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,730
Jaqen: He was no one.

166
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,278
But if you're...

167
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,532
Who's this?

168
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,243
Jaqen: No one at all.

169
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,956
Just as a girl should have been
before she took a face from the hall.

170
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,463
The faces are for no one.

171
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,341
You are still someone.

172
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,972
And to someone,
the faces are as good as poison.

173
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,029
Arya: I can't see.

174
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,911
What's happening?

175
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,956
What's happening?

176
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,844
- Doran: I wish you a safe journey home.
- Thank you.

177
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,142
Forgive me, child.

178
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,481
I wish you all the happiness in the world.

179
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,333
Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.

180
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,960
Maybe I'll come visit you.

181
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,378
Don't wait too long.

182
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,172
Got a noblewoman to marry back home.

183
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:35,094
You want a good girl,
but you need the bad pussy.

184
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:41,100
Jaime: Whenever you're ready, my lord.

185
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,659
Try not to lose it this time.

186
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,163
I'll never take it off again.

187
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,792
I know you didn't want to leave dorne,

188
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,086
but I'm glad you're coming home.

189
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,569
Your mother's desperate to see you.

190
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,965
I'm glad trystane is coming with us.

191
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,133
He seems like a nice boy.

192
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,635
You're lucky.

193
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,347
Arranged marriages are rarely so...

194
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,057
So well arranged.

195
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,892
Do you think mother will like him?

196
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,355
If she sees you're
happy, I'm sure she will.

197
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,357
And you really believe that?

198
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,236
Have you ever known your mother
to like anyone aside from her children?

199
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,531
She likes you.

200
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,741
I'm not so sure about that.

201
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,702
Listen...

202
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,582
There's something I wanted to tell you.

203
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,210
Something I should have told you long ago.

204
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,134
Now that you've seen more of the world,

205
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:02,598
you've learned how complicated
things can be, people can be.

206
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,518
The lannisters and the martells
have hated each other for years,

207
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,687
but you've fallen in love with trystane.

208
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,565
It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?

209
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,819
You happen to fall in love with the man
you were assigned to marry?

210
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,362
My point is,

211
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,950
we don't choose whom we love.

212
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,661
It just, well...

213
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,459
It's beyond our control.
I sound like an idiot.

214
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,543
No, you don't.

215
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,422
What I'm trying to say...
What I'm trying and failing to say...

216
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,566
I know what you're trying to say.

217
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,133
No, I'm afraid you don't.

218
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,011
I do.

219
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,265
I know.

220
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,143
About you and mother.

221
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,565
I think a part of me always knew.

222
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,861
And I'm glad.

223
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,408
I'm glad that you're my father.

224
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,903
Myrcella?

225
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,533
Myrcella?

226
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,001
Myrcella? Myrcella?

227
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,498
You love her, don't you?

228
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,295
How could you not?

229
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,965
Of course, it's hopeless
for the both of you.

230
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,761
A sellsword from the fighting pits
and a disgraced knight.

231
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,684
Neither one of you is
fit consort for a queen.

232
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,477
But we always want the wrong woman.

233
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,230
Does he always talk so much?

234
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,318
Jorah the andal.

235
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,114
He should not be here.

236
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,532
Daario: No, but he is.

237
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,076
Our queen ordered him exiled from city.

238
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,495
Our queen would be dead if not for him.

239
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,624
It's true. And I would
be dead if not for the...

240
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,504
Little man.

241
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,131
Dwarf.

242
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,176
I believe that's the word.

243
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:09,886
Apologies.

244
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,639
My valyrian is a bit nostril.

245
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,684
A bit rusty.

246
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:18,770
Thank you.

247
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,480
Grey worm: I am sorry.

248
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,025
Sorry I not there to fight for our queen.

249
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,569
You missed a good scrap.

250
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,945
None of that matters now.

251
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,738
The longer we sit here bantering,

252
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,283
the longer Daenerys is out there
in the wilderness.

253
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,577
He's right. The dragon headed north.

254
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,638
If we're going to find her,
that's where we'll have to go.

255
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,746
Jorah: We?

256
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,874
You're a Lannister.

257
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,460
The queen intends to remove
your family from power.

258
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,336
And I intend to help her do it.

259
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,714
Jorah: You've been here
for how many days now?

260
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,426
I've fought for her for years.
Since she was little more than a child.

261
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,344
- You betrayed her.
- Careful now.

262
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,930
And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.

263
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,474
The second time, thanks to you.

264
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,018
Don't blame me for your crimes, mormont.

265
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,562
He's right. Our queen exiled jorah.

266
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,482
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

267
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,902
Perhaps she feels differently
about him now. Perhaps not.

268
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,625
The only way we'll know is if we ask her.

269
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,740
Tyrion: Fine, fine. I
suppose he can join us.

270
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,618
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

271
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,996
If I ever kill you, your
eyes will be wide open.

272
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,749
Daario: Forgive me,
but why would we bring you?

273
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,502
Pardon me?

274
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,504
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?

275
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,507
Not precisely, but I have
other skills that would be useful.

276
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,091
Can you fight?

277
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,010
I have fought.

278
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,678
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

279
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,971
Are you good on a horse?

280
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,265
Middling.

281
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,600
So mainly you talk.

282
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,853
And drink. I've survived so far.

283
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:45,774
Which I respect, but you would
not help us on this expedition.

284
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,902
You would help us here in meereen, though.

285
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,198
None of us have experience
governing a city except for him.

286
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,535
You want to prove your value to the queen?
Prove it right here in meereen.

287
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,204
He's a foreign dwarf
that barely speaks the language.

288
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,847
Why would the meereenese listen to him?

289
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,415
They wouldn't.

290
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,584
They will listen to grey worm.

291
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,336
I'll come with you.

292
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,338
I'll find our queen.

293
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,840
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.

294
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,260
He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.

295
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,804
But you still can't go.

296
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,847
The people believe in you.

297
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,975
They know you speak for the queen.

298
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,810
It's true.

299
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,979
Only the unsullied
can keep the peace in meereen.

300
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:27,399
Ifyouleave,
half this city will consume the other half.

301
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,900
And missandei.

302
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,695
Our queen trusts no one
more than missandei.

303
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,573
Certainly not me.

304
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,409
The queen's closest confidante,

305
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,828
the commander of the unsullied,

306
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,831
and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

307
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,667
Good fortune, my friends.

308
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,586
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

309
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,588
Try not to ruin her.

310
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,234
Looks like it's you and
me, jorah the andal.

311
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:54,676
Let's find some good horses.

312
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,804
We have so much to talk about.

313
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,505
Varys: Hello, old friend.

314
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:38,053
I thought we were so happy together
until you abandoned me.

315
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,682
I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.

316
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,310
The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,

317
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,437
if one knows how to listen.

318
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:52,651
They tell me you've already found favor
with the mother of dragons.

319
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,487
Well, she didn't execute me,

320
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,739
so that's a promising start.

321
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,159
Now the heroes are off to find her,

322
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,536
and I'm stuck here

323
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,581
trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.

324
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,416
Any advice for an old comrade?

325
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,834
Varys: Information is the key.

326
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,629
You need to learn
your enemy's strengths and strategies.

327
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,215
You need to learn
which of your friends are not your friends.

328
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,553
If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.

329
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,013
If only.

330
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,309
A grand old city,

331
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,438
choking on violence,
corruption, and deceit.

332
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:35,860
Who could possibly have any experience
managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

333
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,119
I did miss you.

334
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,122
Oh, I know.

335
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,270
We have to go home.

336
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,654
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

337
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,948
Does it hurt?

338
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,661
We have to go home.

339
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,166
Drogon.

340
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,626
Can you take me back to meereen?

341
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,091
How far did you carry me?

342
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,935
Drogon, we need to return.

343
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,353
My people need me.

344
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,554
Well, there's no food.

345
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,475
At the very least,
you could hunt us some supper.

346
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,384
Confess.

347
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,722
Confess.

348
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,652
I have sinned.

349
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,071
I see that now.

350
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,658
How can I have been so blind for so long?

351
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,121
I want to be clean again.

352
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,915
I want absolution.

353
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,754
The crone came to me
with her lamp raised high.

354
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,798
And by its holy light...

355
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,299
You wish to make a confession?

356
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,140
Once I've confessed, will I be free?

357
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,601
Your grace will be dealt with
according to her sins.

358
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,731
The mother have mercy, then.

359
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,986
I lay with a man outside
the bonds of marriage. I confess.

360
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,904
Name him.

361
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:17,285
Lancel Lannister.

362
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,413
Your cousin and the king's squire.

363
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,267
- I was lonely and afraid.
- High sparrow: You had a husband.

364
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,460
A husband off whoring every chance he...

365
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,628
His sins do not pardon your own.

366
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,759
May the gods forgive me.

367
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,220
Other men?

368
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,850
No others?

369
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:48,066
High sparrow: Speaking falsehoods
before the gods is a great crime.

370
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,567
You understand this?

371
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,277
I do.

372
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,824
There are those that say your children
were not fathered by king Robert,

373
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,746
that they are bastards
born of incest and adultery.

374
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,081
A lie.

375
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,583
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

376
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,711
He wants the throne, but his
brother's children stand in his way.

377
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,506
So he claims they are not his brother's.

378
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,466
That filth.

379
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:17,678
There is not one shred of truth to it.

380
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,180
I deny it.

381
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,934
Good.

382
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:27,396
But these are terrible charges.

383
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,483
And the realm must know the truth of them.

384
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:35,154
If your grace has given honest testimony,
your trial will prove your innocence.

385
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,198
Trial? I have confessed.

386
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,617
To a single sin.

387
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,868
Others you have denied.

388
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:45,164
Your trial will separate the truths
from the falsehoods.

389
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,710
I bow to the wisdom of your high holiness.

390
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,382
But if! Might beg

391
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:57,552
for just one drop of the mother's mercy.

392
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,889
I haven't seen my son...

393
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,226
I don't know how long it's been.

394
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,603
I need to see him, please.

395
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:11,232
You have taken the first step
on the path back to righteousness.

396
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,278
In light of this,

397
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,738
I will permit you to
return to the red keep.

398
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,742
Thank you.

399
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,578
Thank you.

400
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,580
High sparrow: The mother is merciful.

401
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,874
It is her you should thank.

402
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,709
I will. I will.

403
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,503
I swear it, day and night.

404
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,548
High sparrow: Good.

405
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,761
Am I free to go?

406
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,098
After your atonement.

407
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,144
My atonement?

408
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,364
A sinner comes before you.

409
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:09,702
Cersei of house Lannister.

410
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:12,872
Mother to his grace king tommen.

411
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,750
Widow of his grace king Robert.

412
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:21,547
She has committed the acts
of falsehood and fornication.

413
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,468
She has confessed her sins

414
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,303
and begged for forgiveness.

415
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,014
To demonstrate her repentance,

416
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:34,101
she will cast aside
all pride, all artifice,

417
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,605
and present herself as the gods made her

418
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,523
to you,

419
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:42,526
the good people of the city.

420
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,946
She comes before you with a solemn heart,

421
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,449
shorn of secrets,

422
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:53,245
naked before the eyes of gods and men,

423
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,291
to make her walk of atonement.

424
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,315
Shame. Shame.

425
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,234
Shame.

426
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,320
Shame.

427
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,280
Shame.

428
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,699
Shame.

429
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,286
Shame.

430
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,955
Shame.

431
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,498
Shame.

432
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,501
Shame.

433
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:42,795
Shame.

434
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,006
Shame.

435
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,551
Shame.

436
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:50,845
Shame.

437
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,347
Shame.

438
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,349
Shame.

439
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,226
Shame.

440
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,603
Shame.

441
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:01,730
Shame.

442
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,774
Shame.

443
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,402
Shame.

444
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,612
Shame.

445
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,448
- Man: Cunt!
- Shame.

446
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,740
Woman: Sinner! Woman 2: Whore!

447
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,367
- Shame.
- Woman 3: Whore!

448
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,035
Shame.

449
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:16,703
- Whore!
- Whore!

450
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:17,872
Shame.

451
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:18,956
Bitch.

452
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:21,667
Shame.

453
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,462
Shame.

454
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:26,755
- Whore!

00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,216

- Bitch! Brother fucker!

456

00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,972

00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,016
Shame.

459
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:39,310
- All hail the royal tits.
- You're a bitch!

460
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,561
Shame.

461
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,812

Shame. Shame.

00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,199
- Brother fucker!

468
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,160
I've had half as many cocks as the queen.

469
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,579
Shame.

470
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,332
- Whore! Sinner!

471
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:05,586

- Whore!

00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,595

Crowd: Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore!

Shame.

481
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:34,573
Shame.

482
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,868
Shame.

483
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,662
Shame.

484
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:41,956

00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,438
Shame. Shame.

00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:49,648
Shame.

504
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:53,527
Shame. Shame.

505
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,530
Shame.

506
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,490
Shame.

507
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,867
Shame.

508
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,786
Shame.

509
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,747
Shame.

510
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,206
Shame.

00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,421
Shame.

512
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,632
Shame.

513
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,469
Shame. Shame.

514
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:21,972
Shame.

515
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:01,970
Your grace.

516
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,270
It's good to have you back.

517
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,608
Come.

518
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,193
We'll take you inside.

519
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,716
I need to have a look at those feet.

520
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:28,122
May I have the honor of presenting
the newest member of the kingsguard?

521
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,975
If it please your grace,
he has taken a holy vow of silence.

522
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,935
He has sworn that he will not speak

523
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,813
until all his grace's enemies are dead,

524
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,774
and evil has been driven from the realm.

525
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:04,867
Who came to your aid? Stannis.

526
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,076
Now he needs you.

527
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,721
We don't have enough men
to make any difference.

528
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,246
The wildlings will make a difference.

529
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,932
The wildlings will never fight for Stannis.

530
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,667
- I told him before...
- You saved their bloody lives.

531
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,545
If they're gonna live
in the seven kingdoms,

532
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,965
safe behind our wall,
they ought to fight for the damn place.

533
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,676
- It's not their fight.
- Man: Open the gates!

534
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,697
Stannis?

535
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:52,748
Shireen? The Princess?

536
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:48,720
Lord commander.

537
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,474
It's one of the wildlings you brought back.
Says he knows your uncle benjen.

538
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,184
Says he's still alive.

539
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:57,938
Are you sure he's talking about benjen?

540
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,773
Said he was first ranger.

541

542
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:14,413
