00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,776
Two years ago.

482
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:38,862
An alley in the theater district.

483
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:42,615
You killed my mother and father,
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

484
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,367
I was there.

485
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:48,705
Rings a bell.

486
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,417
You looked right at me.

487
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:54,461
I was busy that year.

488
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,258
My parents were important people.

489
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,596
It was a big deal in all the newspapers.

490
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:07,557
I don't read the papers much.
Don't watch TV.

491
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,392
It's always the same bad news.

492
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,063
You really don't remember?

493
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,192
Oh, hey, some of 'em stick with you.

494
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,862
There was this mustached fella,
he was a big fat crybaby,

495
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,574
comes back to me in my dreams
all the time,

496
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,368
like he's important.

497
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:30,872
I can't even recall his name.

498
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,833
<i>Did I stab him? Toss him off a roof?</i>

499
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,669
I don't know.

500
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:39,631
My parents were in evening clothes.

501
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:41,883
It was cold and wet.

502
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:49,390
You grabbed my mother's pearl necklace,
it broke.

503
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,394
Oh...

504
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:57,982
Oh, yeah.

505
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:02,195
And the beads went everywhere.

506
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,280
<i>Coming back to me now.</i>

507
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:11,120
Nice looking blonde lady,
silver fox type dude, and a kid.

508
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:14,999
That was you?

509
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,627
That was me.

510
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:20,588
Who hired you?

511
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,173
Maybe nobody did.

512
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,676
Maybe I just saw some rich suckers.

513
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:28,263
Somebody like that
walks into a dark alley,

514
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:30,223
they deserved it
'cause they let it happen.

515
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:33,268
That's the way of the world,
isn't it, son?

516
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:34,519
Don't call me son.

517
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:37,981
Why? If I did what you think I did,
then I made you what you are.

518
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:40,817
Just like Gotham made me.

519
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:45,321
<i>Just like the rich folks
like your parents made Gotham.</i>

520
00:31:47,824 --> 00:31:49,784
I might as well call you son.

521
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,413
I can make you tell me who hired you.

522
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,624
You think so?

523
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,167
I could hurt you.

524
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:00,962
I can shoot you in the knee.

525
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,757
Or the stomach.

526
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,343
But you can't make me
tell you a damn thing.

527
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,931
Killer's code ain't much,
but it's what I've got.

528
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:17,520
If I did what you say I did
and someone hired me to do it,

529
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:19,814
you'll never know their name.

530
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:23,526
<i>Not if you take me apart piece by piece.</i>

531
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,528
You better believe that.

532
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:29,032
Well, then I guess
there's nothing left to say.

533
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,491
(COCKS GUN)

534
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:36,039
Here's to you, son.

535
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,710
You've been a long time coming.

536
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,504
You want me to kill you?

537
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,716
Why?

538
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:52,472
Little rich kid like you
wouldn't understand.

539
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,725
Try me.

540
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,897
A man gets tired.

541
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,986
Doing wrong and going unpunished.

542
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,031
<i>Nothing happens.</i>

543
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,996
You start to wonder if there is a God.

544
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:27,757
Tighten your left hand grip.

545
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,761
<i>Aim right here,</i>

546
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:35,264
a little low. She'll kick.

547
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:44,482
Come on. Pull the damn trigger.

548
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,277
No.

549
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,363
Don't lose your nerve now. Do it!

550
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:53,616
Look at me.

551
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,162
I'm a monster.

552
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,875
You need to kill me.

553
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:07,380
I wish you were a monster.

554
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,428
But you're just a man.

555
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:24,313

Hey. Hey.

Hey!

561
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,852
I think there's been a mistake.

I'm the man with the ice cream.

568
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:42,141
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Oh, yeah.

569
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:45,269
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
You knocked me around pretty good.

570
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:48,439
I guess that ice cream
must be delicious, huh?

571
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:49,899
(CHUCKLES) It was pretty good.

572
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:53,569
You look kind of uncomfortable.

573
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:58,616
I have a sharp knife here.

HELZINGER: Help me out?

00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,415
You have to promise to be nice, okay?

577
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:10,545
There's no ice cream in here,
so there's no reason to get mad. Okay?

578
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:11,879
Promise?

579
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,130
Okay.

Sir?

585
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:40,491
This is an official certificate from
the Gotham Board of Health and Hygiene.

586
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:44,912
It states that Oswald Cobblepot
has passed all mandated tests,

587
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,667
and by the laws of Gotham City
is hereby declared

sane.

I'm sane?

You're as sane and normal
as any other citizen.

No more therapy?

00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:12,023
Oswald, you're a free man.

595
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,900
I don't follow you.

596
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,903
You are sane,
ergo there is no reason for you

597
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:19,363
to be in a mental health institution.

598
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,949
You are free to go.

599
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,910
I'm fine right here.

600
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:29,290
Oswald, Oswald, Oswald,
you are just feeling anxious about change.

601
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:32,960
That is totally normal, to feel that way
upon release from care.

602
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,964
Okay. I guess if it's normal...

603
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,802
You are a sane, gentle, good man.

604
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,597
And good things happen to good people.

605

They do?

00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,393
I've never heard that before.

A true thing. Trust me.

And now,
why don't you go back to your room

615
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,378
and get your belongings together.

Are you sure about that? Letting him go?

620
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:32,937
Not really. He's an experiment.

621
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:35,773
He's a notorious criminal.
There'll be an outcry.

622

The outcry will pass.

623
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,735
People are afraid of progress,
Ms. Peabody,

624
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:42,113
and yet somehow we keep progressing.

625
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:44,949
I hope you'll at least alert the police
he's been released.

626
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:47,284
Enough input, Ms. Peabody.

627
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:50,746
I have other reasons,
deeper plans for Cobblepot

628
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:52,581
that you can't know about now.

(INHALES DEEPLY) For your own safety.

Deeper plans?

00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:03,175
Deeper than building semi-human creatures
in the basement?

632
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:07,513
I'm sure I don't want to know,
thank you very much.

On your head be it.

634
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:34,790
There's a reason why
we might've missed Malone, okay?

635
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:37,043
His record goes back
to nursery school on up.

636
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:40,963
Assault, robbery, battery, couple of hits
for the mob. But this is way, way back.

637
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,381
Last few years, nothing.

638
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:44,967
That's why his name
never came up as a potential suspect.

639
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,303
Oh, flying under the radar, I guess.
It happens.

640
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,721
Guess we'll never know
if he really did it.

641
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:51,640
Ah, the boy says he confessed.
That's good enough for me.

642
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,977
Malone killed the Waynes.

643
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:57,229
The question is,
who paid him to kill the Waynes?

644
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:59,482
It's a question
I no longer care to ponder.

645
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:04,445
Hey, Ed. How you doing?

646
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:07,656
Oh, getting along just fine. Keeping busy.

647
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:09,825
Any news on the Kringle front?

648
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:13,370
Uh, no. Damn.
Sorry, I've been a little busy.

649
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,247
I'll get into it, don't worry.

650
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:17,249
Me, worry? (CHUCKLES)

651
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:20,169
Yeah. I'll let you know
as soon as I know anything.

652
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:23,881
- Detective Gordon, do you have a second?
- Uh, yeah.

653
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:30,513
You'll let me know? I bet you will.

654
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:34,350
Acting like you forgot all about
Kristen Kringle. Sure you forgot.

655
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:36,685
- You're ready.
- Thanks, Detective.

656
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,395
ED: <i>You suspect me somehow.
That must be it.</i>

657
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:42,483
You're trying to lull me
into a false sense of security

658
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,194
while the claws of your investigation
close around me, eh?

659
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:46,737
Is that it, my little man?

660
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:48,656
You take me to be a fool?

661
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:51,867
<i>We'll see about your clever little plan,
Jim Gordon. We'll see.</i>

662
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:56,080
I can make plans of my own.

663
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:01,043
ALFRED: <i>Master Bruce.</i>

664
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:14,765
BRUCE: <i>Alfred,
I have left home for a while</i>

665
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,809
<i>to live on the streets with Selina.</i>

666
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:20,563
<i>Please. Wait and listen before you react.</i>

667
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,899
<i>You need not worry that I'm in danger,
or that I've lost my mind.</i>

668
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:27,903
<i>I've thought long and hard
about this decision.</i>

669
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,864
<i>And I know it's the right one.</i>

670
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,700
<i>Malone's death made me realize
a couple of things.</i>

671
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:37,746
<i>You can't kill murder.
You can't get revenge on evil.</i>

672
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:41,250
<i>You can only begin to fight such things
by not doing them.</i>

673
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:43,210
<i>And you can only fight them
where they live.</i>

674
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:47,965
<i>Not just at Wayne Enterprises.
In the streets, in the slums,</i>

675
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:49,800
<i>in the bad parts of town.</i>

676
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,595
<i>So that's where I'm going.</i>

677
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:55,264
He's lost his mind.

678
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:58,058
BRUCE: <i>I'm not going to start
battling muggers or anything.</i>

679
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:02,354
<i>But one day I am going to do something
to help the people of Gotham.</i>

680
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:03,814
<i>I don't know what yet.</i>

681
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:06,525
<i>But I will.</i>

682
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,777
<i>Meantime, I need to learn stuff.</i>

683
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:10,487
<i>Number one, I need to learn how to live</i>

684
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,698
<i>in the same world
other people have to live in.</i>

685
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:16,827
<i>Selina is giving me a place to sleep
and will show me the ropes,</i>

686
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,623
<i>so like I say, there's no need to worry.</i>

687
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:25,252
<i>I'll be in touch soon,
and I'll come home eventually.</i>

688
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:31,091
<i>Please, Alfred, trust me,
and honor my wishes.</i>

689
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:33,219
<i>Don't try to bring me back.</i>

690
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,804
<i>I need to do this.</i>

691
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:39,058
<i>Sincerely, your good friend,</i>

692
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:41,310
<i>Bruce.</i>

693
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:02,891
