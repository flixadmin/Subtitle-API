1
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,256
(Whoosh)

2
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,662
(Gasps) How did--

3
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,511
halt!

4
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,917
Halt!

5
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,156
Uhh!

6
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,483
Jade: Show me
whatcha got, shendu!

7
00:01:57,485 --> 00:01:59,751
Eat digital steel!

8
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,020
Tohru: No!

9
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,555
That's right, t.

10
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,159
Another slice
of dragon toast
for the Jade-ster!

11
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:09,928
Ohh! My flame-on button
keeps jamming!

12
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:15,234
Uh...Boys and girls,
I am trying to concentrate.

13
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,535
So are we!

14
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,204
We have to get
to <i> medieval evil,</i>
level 7!

15
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,741
Uncle: Forget level 7.
We are going to the opera.

16
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,076
Tonight!

17
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:28,147
But uncle, my shang dynasty
exhibit opens tomorrow.

18
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:29,681
I am swamped!

19
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:31,617
Whoa! Opera?

20
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:35,087
Since when does uncle
go for fat ladies
in viking helmets?

21
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:38,924
Not viking opera!
Peking opera...

22
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:42,027
With very special
performers.

23
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,029
<i>Seven little fortunes?</i>

24
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,765
(Gasps) But,
uncle, that is--

25
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:50,035
the troupe with
which I received
my opera training.

26
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,504
Sensei?

27
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,273
You were
in the opera?

28
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,441
When uncle was very young.

29
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,243
(Laughs)

30
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:01,280
Then how come
I never hear you
sing in the shower?

31
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:04,249
There's more to
the Peking opera than song,

32
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,485
as you will see tonight.

33
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,153
Uncle,
this must mean--

34
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:13,125
yes. My old friend wing
is now the director
of this troupe...

35
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,631
And I have not seen him
in nearly 60 years.

36
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,981
This is the story of
Lao sheng, the farmer.

37
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:42,521
Lao sheng's beautiful
daughter qing yi
means the world to him.

38
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:46,858
(Atonal)
¶ oh, fair daughter ¶

39
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,832
¶ our cow is sick
and delivers sour milk ¶

40
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,971
Jade, pay attention
like the rest of us!

41
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,839
(Snores)

42
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,140
(Snorts)

43
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,079
(Sheepishly) Heh!
I am multi-tasking.

44
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,214
Now you are one-tasking!

45
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,216
Bwaaa!

46
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,352
That is
4,000 years old!

47
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,153
Excuse me!

48
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,555
Pardon me!

49
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,790
(Artifact rolls)

50
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,660
(Gasps) Wing!

51
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,763
(Rolling continues)

52
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,598
Um, meanwhile...

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,333
We arrive at the castle,

54
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:34,406
where the villain,
also known as
the "jing," lives.

55
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,977
Bwaaaa!

56
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,146
Whoa! Where'd
Mr. creepers come from?

57
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:44,149
(Coyly) Uncle cannot
reveal old stage secret.

58
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,491
Uncle: Villainous jing
summons a powerful ghost,

59
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:55,193
and together they
terrorize farmer Lao.

60
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,136
Butt whoop?!

61
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,437
Now you're talkin'!

62
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,505
Jackie: Excuse me.

63
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,440
Oh! Pardon me.

64
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,208
Yes. Very exciting.

65
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,844
Jackie!
I'm trying to watch!

66
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,881
Ahh!
Everyone's favorite!

67
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:19,284
The clown provides
welcome comic relief.

68
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,719
Audience: Ha ha ha!

69
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:22,621
Ha ha ha ha!

70
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,089
Ha ha ha ha!

71
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,358
Ha ha ha ha!

72
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,560
And cooler moves
than Jackie!

73
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,966
So, you think
uncle's old friend

74
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,902
calls him "uncle,"
too?

75
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,874
Chuckles, is that you?

76
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:45,877
Chuckles?!
Chuckles?!

77
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,746
Beetlebrow!

78
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:53,018
So, you remember
your nickname for me
after 60 years?

79
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,619
Ha ha ha!

80
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:58,657
Who can forget
those fuzzy caterpillars
living over your eyes?

81
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,193
And your
never-ending pranks

82
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,928
and gift
of laughter.

83
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,164
Is he talking
about the same guy?

84
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,669
So, you have come
to see my "family"
at work.

85
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:16,842
And to introduce
my family to you.

86
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,511
My nephew Jackie...

87
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:23,115
Ah, yes!
Butterfingers.

88
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:29,154
Uh, hello. I have heard
so much about you.

89
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,391
I am sorry
I have to run.

90
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:35,260
I am mounting an exhibit
at the pacific Asia museum.

91
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,695
Uh...Bye-bye.

92
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:40,065
Please excuse his manners.

93
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,934
(Proudly) And this
is my apprentice tohru.

94
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,137
(Video game pings)

95
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,805
(Clears throat)

96
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,208
This alarm tells me
I must tend to the shop now.

97
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,644
A pleasure meeting you.

98
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:57,149
And last, but not least,
my great-niece Jade.

99
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,952
Jade: Hey!

100
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,888
No trapdoors?

101
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,425
So, how do you do all that
passing-through-walls stuff?

102
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,162
Yoo-hoo! Anybody home?

103
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:14,566
True artisans never
reveal the secrets
of their stagecraft.

104
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,969
All part of the "magic"
of the theater.

105
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,739
Uncle told you so, Jade.

106
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,141
Youthful enthusiasm.

107
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:27,579
I remember a time when
we were brimming with it.

108
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:30,449
We trained very hard
in school...

109
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,250
Though <i> you,</i> chuckles,

110
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,153
trained hardest in
the art of merry-making.

111
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:49,968
Ah! So much talent!

112
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,704
You might have become
the grandest clown

113
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,973
in this or
any other troupe...

114
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:03,281
But you chose to abandon
the magic of the theater

115
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:07,486
for other <i> kinds</i> of magic...

116
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:14,259
Turning your back on years
of study and brotherhood.

117
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,795
With great sorrow,
brother wing,

118
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,965
but I discovered
my true calling.

119
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,433
Jade: Hmm...

120
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,843
So <i> that's</i> what
that's for! Heh!

121
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,381
It would seem
your proteges

122
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:40,886
possess the same
lack of respect for
the theater as you!

123
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:43,655
Ohh! Perhaps
this is my cue

124
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,358
to again take leave
of the opera!

125
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,929
And this time,
it shall be with
great pleasure!

126
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,998
But, uncle,
I never found out

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,967
how they do that secret
melting-through-walls thing.

128
00:08:55,969 --> 00:09:00,071
Pfft! A cheap trick
called magic makeup!

129
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,306
What?!

130
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,948
(Yawns)

131
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,217
A typo? (Groans)

132
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:25,764
What?!
That is impossible!

133
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,898
Aah!

134
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,076
Uh...Shouldn't you be
at the opera?

135
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,614
Another one?

136
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,816
(Grunting)

137
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,424
Waah!

138
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,892
Uhh!

139
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,662
No! Those are priceless!

140
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,500
don't they pay you
at the opera?!

141
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,237
(Groans)

142
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,850
Huhh!

143
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,769
Whooo!

144
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,040
Stop!

145
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,809
Hey, Jackie,
trying out for the opera?

146
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,812
Jade, what are you
doing here?

147
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,981
Thought you should know,
uncle's not himself.

148
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,484
He and wing-ding
had a falling out.

149
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,687
Jackie: Aah!
Which beats
falling down.

150
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,821
Uhh!

151
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,723
Uhh!

152
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:02,227
Jade, stay back!
They are thieves!

153
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,629
don't they pay them
at the opera?

154
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,001
All aboard
the magic bus.

155
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,103
Jackie: Wait!

156
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,271
(Panting)

157
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,773
Uhh!

158
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,174
Let me in!

159
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,246
Buck fifty.

160
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,081
But they didn't pay!

161
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,387
Let's put a wrinkle
in your hocus-pocus!

162
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,761
(Grunts)

163
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,998
Jade, how did you--

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,866
Jackie, hit the deck!

165
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,107
That's gonna
leave a mark.

166
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,241
Uhh!

167
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:00,819
(Sighs) Talk about
a hard act to follow.

168
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,256
Wing: Now, artisans,

169
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,158
once more from the top.

170
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,063
Ah! Have you
returned to apologize
for chuckles?

171
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,800
We have returned to accuse
your artisans of a crime.

172
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,736
What?!

173
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,739
These two abused
theater magic

174
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,640
in order to steal
a small fortune

175
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,243
in ancient artifacts
from the museum
last night.

176
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:30,181
My performers know
better than to use
sacred magic

177
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,183
outside the theater!

178
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:34,853
Perhaps the artifacts
are missing

179
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:39,324
because you dropped
them somewhere...
Butterfingers.

180
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,825
(Sputters)

181
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:45,797
Or perhaps we
witnessed your ghost
suffer a black eye!

182
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,965
Yeah!

183
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,902
Yes! Aha!

184
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,875
Uh...

185
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,409
Heh heh!
Heh!

186
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,911
Well?

187
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:02,180
It did not go well.

188
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,348
Well, it's obvious

189
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,483
mega-brow is
the ringleader of the gang.

190
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,052
No! Beetlebrow
may be a stubborn,

191
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:12,190
self-righteous,
intolerant mule...

192
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,593
But I know him
to be honorable

193
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,595
and incorruptible.

194
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:20,031
He would never
tolerate criminals

195
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,933
in his company!
- But, uncle,

196
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,201
we saw them!

197
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:27,605
Promise me you will leave
matters to the police.

198
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,742
(Sighs) I promise.

199
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:32,811
Tch! That makes
<i>one</i> of us.

200
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,749
Uncle, why do you
insist on coming back

201
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,117
if wing upsets you?

202
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,585
Wing not important!

203
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,520
Uncle likes
good opera,

204
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,622
that is all.

205
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,859
(Clears throat)

206
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,328
Jade has been
in ladies' room
long time.

207
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,896
Did she fall in?

208
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:55,266
The stolen loot has to be
somewhere on the premises.

209
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,313
Ooh!

210
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,349
Magic makeup.

211
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,151
Cool!

212
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:16,221
Time to get the goods
on the gruesome twosome.

213
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,990
(Footsteps)

214
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,792
(Doorknob rattling)

215
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,262
(Gasps)

216
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,633
(Gasps)

217
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,573
Duh!

218
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,216
Aw, just that
singing farmer.

219
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,767
Well, do you think
the others suspect us?

220
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:06,537
Hmm...I am more concerned
with chuckles' nephew.

221
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,507
Wing: Quickly, artisans.
Curtain time nears!

222
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,977
Besides,
any suspicions

223
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,546
will first lead
to our fellow jings.

224
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:19,050
Just be prepared
to grab our cash cow

225
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:22,921
in the event
a quick getaway
becomes necessary.

226
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:29,360
The walls have ears...
<i>And</i> eyes.

227
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,730
Jade: Psst!

228
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,400
Down here.

229
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,534
Aah!

230
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,236
Found our crooks.

231
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,942
Jade, what is going--

232
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,777
the bad guys only play
the villains off-stage.

233
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,179
On-stage, the bad guys
play the good guys!

234
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,715
In <i> English,</i> Jade.

235
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,884
Those guys are the thieves.

236
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,858
(Stage performance
musical fanfare playing)

237
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,499
Whoa! Talk about
your dedicated actors.

238
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,172
Their "cash cow."

239
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,306
That's it!

240
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,407
What is it?

241
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,608
Where they hide the loot.

242
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,711
Come on! They're gonna
try and bolt with it!

243
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:22,447
Jade, we can't
just go out there.

244
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,248
If uncle sees us...

245
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,219
Uncle won't need
to know it's us.

246
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,154
You have to
be kidding.

247
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:36,627
(Atonal)
¶ oh, fair daughter ¶

248
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:43,768
¶ our cow is sick
and delivers sour milk ¶

249
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,379
what?! It is too early
for the clown's entrance.

250
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,284
Uh...

251
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:05,656
¶ I will take
the sick cow to a doctor ¶

252
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,031
I do not recall
a second clown
in this opera.

253
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:20,938
¶ The cow will feel
better in the castle ¶

254
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,707
these are not the lyrics!

255
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,577
¶ The cow must see
a doctor ¶

256
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,713
both: ¶ the castle ¶

257
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,081
¶ a doctor ¶

258
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,682
both: ¶ the castle ¶

259
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,851
Jade: ¶ a doctor ¶

260
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:34,952
¶ duh ¶

261
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,554
¶ don't you goons
know anything ¶

262
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,623
¶ about proper
cow care? ¶

263
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,158
who is <i> that?!</i>

264
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,227
Ohh!

265
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,963
Ai-yaaa!

266
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,514
We do not fight
a clown in this scene.

267
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,617
Apparently, I do.

268
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,620
I'm sorry. I will bring
this back. Thank you!

269
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,735
Brother wing, I--

270
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:28,606
so, the prankster
takes his revenge
on my opera!

271
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,475
I hope you are happy.

272
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,697
Jade: Uhh!

273
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,535
Audience: Ha ha ha ha!

274
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,474
Your oafish proteges

275
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,278
have dishonored
the sanctity
of my stage!

276
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,920
(Gasps)

277
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,390
What is the meaning of--

278
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:22,160
it would seem
the sanctity
of your stage

279
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:26,063
has been
previously dishonored.

280
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,903
And so, I take my exit.

281
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,639
Facial!

282
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:35,773
Uhh!

283
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,850
Clowning around
has its moments,

284
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,519
but I think I will stick
with my calling--

285
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,987
archaeology.

286
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,191
I was blind.

287
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:56,761
It was <i> your</i> proteges
who were the honorable ones.

288
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:59,830
We rock! Uh-huh!

289
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:04,235
I will always wish the opera
had kept you, my friend.

290
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:07,505
And that is my cue
to say good-bye.

291
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,509
One more thing.

292
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:15,079
I hope it will not
be another 60 years

293
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,481
before we meet
again, beetlebrow.

294
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,985
As do I, chuckles.

295
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,829
Hey, Jackie,

296
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,397
where did you live
when you were little?

297
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,401
My father put me through
the martial opera school.

298
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,503
One thing's difference--
we have to stay there,

299
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,038
live there, eat there.

300
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,474
So many different teachers
teach you how to dance,

301
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:46,477
kicking, punch, acrobatic,
all kind of things.

302
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,246
School is very,
very important.
