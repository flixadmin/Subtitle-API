310
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:33,713

311
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:35,882
Walt doesn't run shit.

312
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:38,551
Because there are no TV and film rights.

313
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:41,255
Harlan never allowed any adaptations of his books.

314
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:42,655
Hated the idea.

315
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:43,756
No.

316
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,024
Yeah!

317
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:46,726
Drives Walt nuts.

318
00:14:46,728 --> 00:14:48,828
'Cause that's where the real money is.

319
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,198
When Walt would get a little Irish courage in him,

320
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,133
- <i>he'd get into it with Harlan.</i>
- The window is...

321
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:55,603
Did he "get into it" at the party?

322
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:57,603

Harlan took you aside at the party.

The Netflix guys, their business affair guy.

337
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:34,208
He sent something over. It's hard numbers this time,

338
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,975
and I just think this is a window

339
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,744
that's not gonna stay open.

340
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:38,845
We need to take advantage of it

341
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,847
and then you just need to look at the numbers!

342
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:42,882
- Yeah, Walt, look...
- Dad! Dad!

01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:57,717
this gathering would be, uh, beneficial

1592
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:01,255
is because Harlan altered his will

1593
01:08:01,257 --> 01:08:02,889
a week before he died.

1594
01:08:02,891 --> 01:08:04,258
He sealed it.

1595
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,859
He asked me not to submit it to the courts

1596
01:08:06,861 --> 01:08:08,295
for probate until after his death.

1597

- The house,

1604
01:08:22,378 --> 01:08:24,043
which he owned outright.

1605
01:08:24,045 --> 01:08:25,112

I gave the doctors my number,

But we must look a little closer.

And when we do, we see the donut hole

has a hole in its center.

Yeah, but Fran wanted money,

2419

ergo she did not want the crime exposed.
