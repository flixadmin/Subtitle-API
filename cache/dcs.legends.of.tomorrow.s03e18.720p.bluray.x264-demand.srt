<i>Previously on</i> Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:04,939
<i>We can't change history.</i>

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:07,580
If that happens, the Darhks
will be able to free their demon.

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,882
<i>Do not let him
take you away from me.</i>

5
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,961
We can save Nora and stop Mallus
from being freed together.

6
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,216
<i>We have the six Totems.</i>

7
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,390
What if the only way to kill Mallus
is to let him out?

8
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,120
<i>We are here to help you
create the anachronism</i>

9
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,104
so we can release Mallus
and then we can kill him.

10
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,679
I'll find you. Go!

11
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,187
No.

12
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,040
Nora.

13
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,438
Mallus is taller than I thought.

14
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,126
My name is Malice, you fools.

15
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,216
- "Malice"?
- Oh!

16
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,546
I knew it. It sounds way cooler.

17
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:57,176
Hand over the totems,
or I will lay waste to your world.

18
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,552
You want the totems?

19
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,012
Come and get them.

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,700
Amaya!

21
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,908
All right, everyone, fall back.

22
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,994
Rip, we're gonna need an evac.

23
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,291
<i>We're in over our heads here.</i>

24
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,039
If my read
of the situation is correct,

25
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,870
what you need is a miracle.

26
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,042
I'm going to buy you some time.

27
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,962
- Wally, create a distraction.
- Got it.

28
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,425
I'm starting to think letting Malice
out of his cage was a bad idea.

29
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,804
<i>The</i> Waverider's <i>time drive
is highly unstable.</i>

30
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,538
<i>- Removing it...</i>
- May very well be the only way

31
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,303
to hold our adversary at bay.

32
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,933
<i>I believe I know
what you're planning.</i>

33
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,516
<i>It is extremely reckless
with a low likelihood of success.</i>

34
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:54,400
Well, then, seems like I've finally
learned to think like a Legend.

35
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,070
<i>- The odds of survival are 0.00...</i>
- I know.

36
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,489
I will miss you, Gideon.

37
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,282
- Truly.
<i>- No more than I'll miss you, Rip.</i>

38
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,209
Guys, I can't hold him off
much longer.

39
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,286
I'm gonna get her to the MedBay.

40
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,427
Wally, I need you
back on the ship now.

41
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,064
<i>So you're saying you don't fit in?</i>

42
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,353
<i>You're an outcast.</i>

43
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,858
<i>A misfit.</i>

44
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,568
<i>Let's assume.</i>

45
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,029
Sounds to me like you're a Legend.

46
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,772
<i>Together, you are the best crew,</i>

47
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,085
the best team a captain
could ever hope for.

48
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,961
<i>Love changes everything.</i>

49
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,300
<i>Daddy.</i>

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,517
Gideon, give me eyes on Rip.

51
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,186
<i>I have a visual, Captain.</i>

52
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,353
What the hell is he doing?

53
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,023
<i>Rip disengaged the time drive,
making it unstable.</i>

54
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,693
<i>When it reaches critical mass,
it will consume Mallus.</i>

55
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:16,779
And Rip.

56
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,608
Gideon, time jump us out of here.

57
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,702
She can't.

58
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,239
Rip has our time drive.

59
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,411
<i>Yes, but there is another one.</i>

60
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,873
From the Jumpship.

61
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,536
Wally.

62
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,993
Gideon, put me through to Rip.

63
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,421
<i>Rip.</i>

64
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,208
A little busy at the moment, Sara.

65
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,336
Look, you didn't tell us that
you were buying us time with your life.

66
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,588
Listen carefully.

67
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,885
This gambit will not kill Mallus.

68
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,742
<i>It will only delay him long enough
for you to make an escape.</i>

69
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,177
There has to be another way.

70
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,679
No, there isn't.

71
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,761
It's all right, Sara.

72
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,107
I should very much
like to see my wife and son again.

73
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,642
<i>I will miss you, Captain Lance,</i>

74
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,486
<i>you and the rest of the Legends.</i>

75
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,153
My one hope is that
you all live up to that name.

76
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,494
<i>Captain Lance, the time drive
is reaching critical mass.</i>

77
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,581
Can we jump?

78
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,201
<i>Ms. Tomaz has finished
making repairs.</i>

79
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,703
<i>We have 15 seconds.</i>

80
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,669
Goodbye.

81
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,790
Goodbye, Captain.

82
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,002
Gideon, get us out of here.

83
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,515
Ironic, isn't it?

84
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,902
A time demon who's run out of time.

85
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,838
You don't drink.

86
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,842
Yeah, well, we lost Rip.

87
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,058
Okay, somebody's got to say it,
so I'm gonna say it.

88
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,270
This is all our fault.

89
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,516
Apparently I'm not gonna say it,
but, yeah, we let Mallus out.

90
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,146
Well, whose stupid idea
was it to fight him

91
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,025
with some magic necklaces?

92
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,356
It wasn't the totems that failed.

93
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,566
It was us.

94
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,196
Yeah, we might wanna
rethink that whole

95
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,869
"we screw up things
for the better" motto.

96
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,581
Okay, so what's the plan, Captain?

97
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,330
All I know is that Rip gave his life

98
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,126
so that we could take
the totems somewhere

99
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,580
that Mallus can't find them.

100
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,509
So that's what we're gonna do.

101
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,421
And where is that?

102
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,631
The Old West.

103
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,762
Salvation, North Dakota.

104
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,435
It's basically a temporal blind spot.

105
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,139
Wait a sec, we just
unleashed an ancient time demon

106
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,316
who's about to
lay waste to all of history,

107
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,938
and our plan is to hide?

108
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,519
Yes, it is.

109
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,321
Gideon, plot a course.

110
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,281
Well, I hope you're here to make
good on your promise and kill me,

111
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,117
which would work out
for both of us, be a real win-win.

112
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,668
Mercy killing is not my style.

113
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,711
Even if it was,

114
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,585
you don't deserve my mercy.

115
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,927
You deserve to live out
the rest of your days

116
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,097
knowing that you
destroyed your own daughter.

117
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,437
What are you doing here?

118
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,475
Uh, it's my lab.

119
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,101
Don't do anything stupid.

120
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,774
<i>Captain, we've arrived
in the Wild West.</i>

121
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,444
Thank you, Gideon. Have everyone
meet me in the fabrication room.

122
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,781
Ray?

123
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,490
Nothing stupid.

124
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,163
Is she right? Are you
really planning something stupid?

125
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,248
Maybe.

126
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,125
Probably. Most likely.

127
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,786
But it could fix this whole thing.

128
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,330
And get Nora back.

129
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,974
Yo, this is tight.

130
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,474
I know everyone's dead,
I know time is broken,

131
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,850
but can we just
take a second to acknowledge this?

132
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,898
You know, as much as
I enjoy this getup,

133
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,318
and actually really do,
Mallus is still out there.

134
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:30,523
And we'll deal with him, but first,
we need to get our heads on straight.

135
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,858
How long is that gonna take?

136
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,739
- Depends.
- On what?

137
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,239
How strong the whiskey is.

138
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,124
All right, I think it's working.

139
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,922
I am on the edges of a plan.

140
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,169
Great. Let's hear it.

141
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,394
So we know that the six totems are
the only thing that can stop Mallus.

142
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,092
They weren't much
use to us last time.

143
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,970
"Us" being the keyword.

144
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,143
You and Amaya were born
to wield the totems,

145
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,346
- and the rest of us are just...
- Losers.

146
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,649
That's why Rip picked us,
Snart, the Professor,

147
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,977
stupid hawk, flying chicken people.

148
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,821
We're all expendable.

149
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,069
Not that any of these
unwashed hayseeds

150
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,741
look like righteous totem bearers.

151
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,868
Who you calling a hayseed?

152
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,033
Jonah Hex.

153
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,450
You know this guy?

154
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,206
Me and these ruffians go way back.

155
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,662
Wally, Zari, this is Jonah Hex.

156
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,168
Nice hat.

157
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,175
Thank you, ma'am.

158
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,251
Obviously joking.

159
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,132
So, who died and made you sheriff?

160
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,509
- That'd be the old sheriff.
- Oh.

161
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,012
Now, it's my job
to keep the peace around here.

162
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,684
So you can't be causing any trouble.

163
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,854
We are not here to cause trouble.
We're here to avoid it.

164
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,238
This the trouble
you aiming to avoid?

165
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,533
Not exactly.

166
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,458
Looks like Fallus.

167
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,381
- Malice.
- Mallus.

168
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,175
Has brought back our old buddies.

169
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,848
I thought Mallus wasn't supposed
to be able to find us here.

170
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,217
Fools.

171
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,181
Mallus sees all,

172
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,438
knows all.

173
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,356
Then why did he bring back
you germs to do his business?

174
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,024
Because he's probably
still recovering

175
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,897
from that beatdown Rip gave him.

176
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:35,903
Oh, now do not confuse Mallus' clemency
with weakness, my hearties.

177
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,908
Mallus will spare your lives...

178
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,994
It's actually Malice.

179
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,139
It's actually Mallus.

180
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,699
- No, Malice.
- Mallus!

181
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,992
Guys, it doesn't matter.

182
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,167
If you surrender the six totems.

183
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,876
Yeah, sorry, we only brought two,

184
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,295
and mine's kind of
a family heirloom, so...

185
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,382
Then we have no choice,
but to march our army on your town,

186
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,427
and kill every fool
who has given you shelter.

187
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,379
You leave my town out of this.

188
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,055
You have been warned.

189
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:05,558
We'll be back to collect the totems,
shall we say, high noon tomorrow?

190
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,148
Toodles.

191
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,399
Well, so much for hiding out.

192
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,444
Guys, if you can hear me, I need you
to put the <i>Waverider</i> on lockdown.

193
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,565
You know I'm only doing this
because of my daughter.

194
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,869
- Wow.
- Well, if this works, we can save her.

195
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,200
Going somewhere, Raymond?

196
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,081
Uh...

197
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,128
Ha! No, no, of course not.

198
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,332
Zari rerouted the time drive, so...

199
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,133
Yeah, Gideon just said
someone re-rerouted it.

200
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,429
- What are you doing?
- Sara wanted the ship on lockdown.

201
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,055
- So...
- So you decided to

202
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,099
load Damien Darhk into the Jumpship?

203
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,805
- Hey, Nate.
- Don't wave.

204
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,215
Have you lost your complete mind?

205
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,602
I know this looks bad.

206
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,934
- Yeah.
- But there's a...

207
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,110
There's a completely
rational explanation.

208
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,527
I'm listening.

209
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:57,948
Me, too.

210
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,618
- Sorry.
- Oh, my nose!

211
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,783
Ray, what are you doing?

212
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,250
You know, not that I couldn't watch
Pompadour get punched out all day,

213
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,063
but you could've just
told him where we're going.

214
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,398
- Ray, open the door.
- Where are we going?

215
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,129
To right before
Mallus took over Nora.

216
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,376
And I can't tell anybody

217
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,903
because we're not supposed to travel
to events in which we participated.

218
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,446
I will punch through this door!

219
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,448
- And no one on your team trusts me.
- Damn it, Ray.

220
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,553
That goes without saying.

221
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,302
Whoa!

222
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,328
Didn't you hear me over comms?

223
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,455
Ray punched me in the face
with his giant banana hands,

224
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,015
and took off with Damien Darhk.

225
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,648
What are you doing?

226
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,606
Lyoga root?

227
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,612
Do you really think
this is the best time

228
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,189
to go on a psychedelic vision quest?

229
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,525
Who am I kidding?

230
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,179
It's never a bad time to go.

231
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:45,911
You can't come with me, Nathaniel.

232
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,117
I'm going all the way
back to the beginning.

233
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,836
To meet with my ancestors,
the original totem bearers.

234
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,255
Why?

235
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,208
Sara thinks we're not cut out
to wield the totems.

236
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,214
But I believe the reason we
didn't defeat Mallus the first time

237
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,466
is because we didn't know how.

238
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,117
So you wanna talk
to the original bearers

239
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,430
so they can teach you
the totem user manual.

240
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,260
- I am definitely coming with you.
- No.

241
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,180
It was my decision
to save my village.

242
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,982
I shattered history
and allowed the demon to escape.

243
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,319
It's up to me to
find a way to stop him.

244
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,234
Amaya.

245
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,649
Amaya, look at me.

246
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,576
We decided to save your village.

247
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,371
Now if you're gonna go on
some crazy drug trip,

248
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,661
you better believe
I'm coming with you.

249
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,371
No, Nathaniel.

250
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,623
You're only supposed to
take a sip of that.

251
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,673
Really?

252
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,722
I'll see you on the other side.

253
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:00,946
Nate?

254
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,404
Nate, open your eyes.

255
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,820
Totem bearers.

256
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,194
What are they doing?

257
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,702
Oh, snap! They got lasers.

258
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,177
Nathaniel.

259
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,638
Wake up.

260
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,563
They beat him
with the Care Bear stare.

261
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:29,764
No.

262
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,555
They stopped Mallus together.

263
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,184
That is the only way to defeat him.

264
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,019
Together. Together.

265
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,578
What gives, Gideon?

266
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,239
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

267
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,371
Begging your pardons, ma'am.

268
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,755
Captain Lance thought
that you might need a hand.

269
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,458
Yeah, I think she was
just trying to get rid of you.

270
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,549
What in tarnation is that?

271
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:13,175
It's a computer program I designed
to act as a temporal beacon.

272
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,681
Like a smoke signal.

273
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,015
Sara wants us to
find new totem bearers,

274
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,849
but we're a little short on allies.

275
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,937
Well, the Legends,
they may be an unorthodox lot,

276
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,865
but they got a knack
for making friends.

277
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,532
Like you?

278
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,532
I don't take a shine to most folks.

279
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,493
Me neither.

280
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,334
Hmm.

281
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,582
Well, you're sending out
a smoke signal.

282
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,913
I'll bet you a greenback
you'll get a response.

283
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,835
I'll take that bet.

284
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,543
Sheriff.

285
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,253
Now, you can call me Jonah.

286
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,310
Ma'am.

287
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,521
<i>Hello, this is
Nathaniel Heywood speaking.</i>

288
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,394
<i>And we have a Code 113.</i>

289
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,646
<i>Repeat, a Code 113.</i>

290
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,610
If the code is 113, it's off
to the bridge for you and me.

291
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,362
You memorized Ray's song?

292
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,068
He sings it often enough.

293
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,370
Nathaniel and I shared
a cup of Lyoga root tea

294
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,267
to access the memories
of the original totem bearers.

295
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,034
- Ay.
- Oh, you're still high.

296
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,398
Now the reason the totems
haven't been working for us

297
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,038
is not because we're unworthy.

298
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,692
It's because we've been
using them wrong.

299
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,675
The totems were not
designed to be used individually.

300
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,878
Individually.

301
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,338
- Individually.
- Shut up.

302
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,549
Their elemental powers
combine to create

303
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,884
a perfect being of light
to fight Mallus with.

304
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,622
- Like Voltron.
- "Like Voltron"?

305
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,873
Defender of the Universe.

306
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,897
Right, well,

307
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,646
weren't all of the original
totem bearers actually from Zambesi?

308
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,496
But you all wield them now. I mean,
do you think that was an accident?

309
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:48,572
Yes, I do.

310
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,194
Mick, the chances of you
running into your father

311
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,321
in Vietnam are next to zero.

312
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,652
And yet, you did.

313
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,703
You came out a better man for it.

314
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:01,208
Zari, you remember the way your totem
called mine the moment you put it on?

315
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,959
It wanted you to stay with us.

316
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,579
So maybe it wasn't
a coincidence that I joined the team.

317
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,667
No.

318
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,591
That was just another one
of the Englishman's crazy ideas.

319
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,793
- Sara...
- Mmm-hmm.

320
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:11,887
Please.

321
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,587
We have to try.

322
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,391
- Fine.
- Sick! Yes!

323
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,140
Because no coincidences.

324
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,309
All right, Amaya.

325
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,892
It's your show. How do we
create this magical light being?

326
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,772
All right, everyone, over here.

327
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,900
Make a circle.

328
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,576
Mick, your fire is gonna provide
our champion with its spark.

329
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,704
Zari, use your air to give it breath.

330
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,204
Wally, use water to flow
life's blood through its veins.

331
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,660
- Nate...
- I will use the Earth Totem

332
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,087
to give Voltron flesh.

333
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,413
You gotta stop calling it that.

334
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,923
I will never stop calling it that.

335
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,217
I'm gonna use my spirit
to provide it with a soul.

336
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:56,802
But, without the final totem,
our champion will be incomplete.

337
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,678
No, it's not happening.

338
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:02,227
Without the Death Totem, the other
five totems can only imprison Mallus.

339
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,391
We need Death to kill him.

340
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,848
Once and for all.

341
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,151
Don't worry, if you turn
into a witch bitch, I'll kill you.

342
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,570
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

343
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,446
All right.

344
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,358
Let's do it.

345
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,748
We're good.

346
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,325
Okay, hold hands.

347
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,754
Come on, come on.

348
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,922
Clear your minds,
and focus on your breath.

349
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:36,800
Imagine a perfect warrior
of justice, mercy and light.

350
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,766
<i>Why does Pretty have
such girly hands?</i>

351
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,598
<i>Damn, this Lyoga root is strong.</i>

352
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,252
<i>Concentrate, Nate, think about
Voltron, Defender of the Universe.</i>

353
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,481
<i>I kinda pictured myself
wielding something cool</i>

354
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,688
<i>like a Lightning Totem.</i>

355
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,148
<i>Am I crazy or is Jonah Hex hot?</i>

356
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,761
<i>Eh, you could do worse than Hex.</i>

357
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,866
<i>Wait, you can hear me?</i>

358
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,285
<i>We can all hear each other.</i>

359
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,091
<i>Even what I said
about Pretty's girly hands?</i>

360
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,412
- Yes.
- Okay.

361
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,661
Please. We need to clear our minds.

362
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,165
- Whoa.
- It's working.

363
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,091
Are we making a baby?

364
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,293
Guys, we have to focus.

365
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,549
You telling us to focus is
making it harder to focus.

366
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,951
All right, look, this is why
we're not worthy of the totems.

367
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,807
Seriously, are we making a baby?

368
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,893
Everyone, just shut up.

369
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,347
Whoa! Whoa!

370
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,441
A Cronen-baby.

371
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,526
Is it supposed to be gooey?

372
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,068
- Mick!
- What?

373
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,117
I'm just putting this slop
out of its misery.

374
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,402
Aw. Voltron.

375
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,784
Right. We need to try again.

376
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,160
No, what we need to do,

377
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,913
is find some people that are
worthy of using these totems.

378
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,005
If that's not an entrance line,
I don't know what is.

379
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,542
I got your message.

380
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,963
We all did.

381
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,841
You guys just can't seem to

382
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,672
keep yourselves
out of trouble, can you?

383
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,471
Whoa! Sounds like I'm really
giving you the business in there.

384
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,736
- Yeah, still hurts.
- Sorry.

385
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,865
Okay, so here's the plan.

386
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,995
We have to knock Nora out.

387
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,962
Gently because I know
she's still your daughter.

388
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,394
And we probably have to
keep her unconscious

389
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,284
until we figure out
a way to de-demonize her.

390
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,672
We better move quickly.

391
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,423
I can't believe you were
ever this young, Nana Baa.

392
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,254
I can't believe you came to my aid.

393
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,094
If you only knew
the odds against that happening.

394
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,184
Odds?

395
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,990
I've been given
a chance to fight alongside

396
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:49,724
the woman who saved Zambesi.

397
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,638
What was I supposed to say, no?

398
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:52,732
Am I still high?

399
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,059
Or is the water witch a pal,

400
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,987
Helen of Troy a warrior princess
and Jax is wearing a wedding ring.

401
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,273
I believe you owe me a greenback.

402
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,073
Not to look a gift horse
in the mouth,

403
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,245
but I was hoping for
some real soldiers.

404
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,750
I'm Helen. Nice to meet you.

405
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,953
Nice to meet you, little lady.

406
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,464
Well, it's really good
seeing you again, Jax.

407
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,195
I just wish
it was under better circumstances.

408
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,337
Hey, listen, I'm just glad that
we got Zari's beacon in time.

409
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,714
I mean, going up
against three armies,

410
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,050
y'all are gonna need
all the help you can get.

411
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,310
Hey, what happened to Ray?

412
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,103
You do not wanna know.

413
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,235
Come on, do it now.

414
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,734
Before it's too late. Go!

415
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,484
Oh, man, you really
shouldn't hit your daughter.

416
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,531
You stole my nanite gun?

417
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,705
But that'll kill her.

418
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,127
Sorry, honey.

419
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,928
Nora.

420
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,505
Nora.

421
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,382
Dad, why?

422
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,017
'Cause I love you.

423
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,261
And I couldn't watch you
become a monster

424
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,604
like me.

425
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,975
You fool.

426
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,938
You thought destroying this vessel
would thwart my return?

427
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,195
I'll gladly take you instead.

428
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,660
I was counting on that.

429
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,831
Goodbye, Nora.

430
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,991
- Go, go.
- No.

431
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,368
Get her out of here.

432
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,206
- Go!
- No!

433
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,166
Dad!

434
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,502
Dad!

435
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,265
Is it weird that I keep
expecting your granddaughter

436
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,062
to use that thing
to try to drown me again?

437
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,481
This Kuasa never suffered in the war.

438
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,941
She never worked for the Darhks.

439
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,360
She's a good person
who's led a good life.

440
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,358
And she and Mari shared the totem.

441
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,110
It worked.

442
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,450
I can't believe it.

443
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,118
I can.

444
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,658
You told us
the universe was guiding us,

445
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,955
prepping us for this fight.

446
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,616
You listened to your heart,

447
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:20,124
and it drove you to do a really
good/super-messy thing.

448
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,376
Since when did you
have time to have a baby?

449
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,989
You've only been gone
a couple of months.

450
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,699
Well, I mean,
that's how it is for you guys.

451
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,134
But for me, it's been five years.

452
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:32,892
Here, look.

453
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,427
Her name's Martina.

454
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,683
And her and her mom
are the light of my life, man.

455
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,898
Well.

456
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:40,984
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

457
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,776
- Okay. Yeah.
- Cheers.

458
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,404
Okay, stay with me, Nora.

459
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,949
Okay, you're safe.

460
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,579
My dad, my dad.

461
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,710
He traded places with you
as Malice's vessel to save you.

462
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,507
How could you let him do that?

463
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,363
- Why didn't you stop him?
- It's okay.

464
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,130
No, no, Dad!

465
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,468
Just point, and shoot.

466
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,021
Damn, girl.

467
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,316
Damn, where did you
learn to shoot like that?

468
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,897
I learned to fight in Themyscira.

469
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,570
But the Legends were
the ones that inspired me.

470
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,659
They gave me the gift of a new life.

471
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,955
It is an honor to be here
to help you save yours.

472
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,533
Thank you, but we need to be
teaching you to use the totems.

473
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:41,813
And I'm pretty sure you didn't
learn that in Themyscira.

474
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,248
It's not why we're here, Sara.

475
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,921
We're here to help you,
not replace you.

476
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:49,172
Look, we've already tried twice,
and we failed miserably.

477
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,548
You still don't see it, do you, Sara?

478
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,131
You guys made Kuasa
and Helen's life better,

479
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,744
and that is just
the tip of the iceberg.

480
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:58,852
We are all here
to support the Legends,

481
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,248
and what, you're gonna
stand there and tell me

482
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,107
that you aren't the exact people to
wield the totems against Mallus now?

483
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,022
Good speech.

484
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,530
Thank you.

485
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:13,029
And, uh, it's a good point.

486
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,360
By the way,

487
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,372
I wanted to ask you, did you
mean what you said the last time

488
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,824
we saw each other?

489
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,162
When I told you to run?

490
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,502
No, before that.

491
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:25,791
Oh!

492
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,915
Oh, you mean,
when I told you I loved you.

493
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,629
Yeah.

494
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,339
What do you think?

495
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,923
I, uh, think that...

496
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,349
Howdy, partners.

497
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,519
What did I miss?

498
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,603
Where's Darhk?

499
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,188
- Um...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

500
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,605
Wrong Darhk, wrong Darhk!

501
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,355
No, no, look, look, look. She's...
She's been de-Mallused.

502
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,444
She's no longer a demon.

503
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,521
So we don't have to
fight Mallus anymore?

504
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,731
Uh... Not exactly.

505
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,862
And what about Damien Darhk?

506
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,068
Long story short,

507
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,078
um, he sacrificed himself for Nora,

508
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,248
and now, he's Mallus' vessel. So...

509
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,246
What's new in the Old West?

510
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,623
Well, Caesar, Blackbeard,

511
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:10,298
and Leif Erikson's crazy sister
are demon pawns.

512
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,876
They gave us an ultimatum
to hand over the totems.

513
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,970
How long do we have?

514
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,094
Oh.

515
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,865
All right.

516
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,868
We're facing an army
of Romans, Vikings and pirates.

517
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:45,117
But you know what today is?

518
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,710
Today is the day

519
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:52,791
that we prove that Rip
did not sacrifice his life in vain.

520
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:54,469
And today

521
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,421
is the day that we prove
that we are not losers.

522
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,339
And today

523
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,926
is the day that we earn
the name Legends.

524
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,265
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

525
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,683
All right, all right.

526
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,060
Now, how do we sneak out the back?

527
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,673
Nice of you to bring your fan club.

528
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
So...

529
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,848
About that ultimatum.

530
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,723
There is honor
in surrender, Captain Lance.

531
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,180
Our new god may grant you mercy.

532
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,435
Yes, be a good girl,

533
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:54,395
and hand us over your magic baubles.

534
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,854
I changed my mind.

535
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,114
New terms.

536
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,863
Get out of town,

537
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,569
or get hurt.

538
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,204
Attack!

539
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,666
Can you believe this is
my first time on a horse?

540
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,815
Haven't you ever learned

541
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,147
never to turn your back
on your enemies?

542
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,823
Caesar.

543
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,079
That's a Roman nose.

544
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,058
I should've known.

545
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,857
It was just a tall tale.

546
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,107
You're not the Dread Pirate Jiwe.

547
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,900
No, her name is Amaya Jiwe
of the great tribe of Zambesi.

548
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,208
Toodles.

549
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,262
Dynamite?

550
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,349
Are you sure about this?

551
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,967
No, but it's too late
for second-guessing.

552
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,157
Do it now.

553
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,755
So, we should probably
get back to fighting.

554
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,008
Aye.

555
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,435
Well, next round's on me.

556
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,661
Uh, not to be a buzzkill,
but this doesn't look good.

557
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,626
It's Mallus.

558
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,955
Go, make good your preparations.

559
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,664
The rest of us shall buy you time.

560
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,924
All right, you heard the lady.

561
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,926
Hopefully, this goes
better than last time.

562
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,804
Right. We have to believe
in the totems,

563
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,350
that they've chosen each of us.

564
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,269
Well, if this really
is the end of the world,

565
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,189
then I choose to surround myself
with you guys.

566
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,152
Come on.

567
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,772
Whoa. You feel that?

568
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,866
It's working.

569
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,864
All right, now imagine
a powerful light of pure goodness.

570
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,791
Something's forming.

571
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,501
Can I peek? I'm gonna peek.

572
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,753
- Oh, God.
- "Oh, God"?

573
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,751
- What, "Oh, God"?
- Everyone, focus!

574
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,219
Wait.

575
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,427
Is somebody thinking of...

576
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,074
I'm sorry, you said
think of something pure,

577
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,760
- and I thought...
- No, you didn't.

578
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,181
Again, I said I'm sorry.

579
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,027
Yeah, I can't stop
thinking about him either.

580
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,556
Guys, whatever you've got to...

581
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,857
What in the Sam Hill is going on?

582
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,613
I think this is part of Sara's plan.

583
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,751
<i>I Io-Io-love you.</i>

584
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,041
The Blue God, he has returned.

585
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,253
That is your captain's plan?

586
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,779
Where in the hell
are Sara and the others?

587
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,886
- That is Sara and the others.
- What?

588
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,510
<i>Beebo hungry.</i>

589
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,847
Man, have I missed you guys.

590
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,542
Let the gods of
Olympus make manifest.

591
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,800
Oh! Hey, I know you're
not gonna take that, Beebo.

592
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,927
- Nana Baa.
- Come on, guys, you got this.

593
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,062
<i>Beebo can't breathe.</i>

594
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,014
Don't you dare give up on me, Lance.

595
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,280
<i>Beebo!</i>

596
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,153
- Oh!
- Yeah, come on, that's it.

597
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,529
Kick his ass!

598
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,340
- Yes!
- Yes!

599
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,554
<i>Hmm.</i>

600
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,225
Not even the six can stop me now.

601
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:02,368
<i>Beebo want cuddles.</i>

602
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,742
No!

603
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:09,120
<i>Whee!</i>

604
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,802
Guys? Guys!

605
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,773
Are you all right?

606
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,350
Guys, we did it.

607
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:34,111
The totems united to
create a single, furry lovechild.

608
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,938
Worst orgy ever.

609
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,652
Dad.

610
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,117
Ah. I'm sorry, Nora.

611
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,782
He died a good man.

612
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,872
Damnation.

613
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,619
Now I've just seen about everything.

614
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,668
So wait, what, that's it?

615
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,954
You destroyed the demon?

616
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,289
I'm just glad the ancestors
aren't here to see this.

617
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,383
Yeah, but Rip would be proud.

618
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,462
Yes!

619
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,802
- Whoo!
- We did it, Mick!

620
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:05,972
Get off me!

621
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,078
The totems came together
when the world needed them most.

622
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,160
Now it's time for them
to find new bearers.

623
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,079
I trust you'll keep them
safe until they do, <i>Nana.</i>

624
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,917
Are you sure you don't
want the power to move earth,

625
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,218
call on the dead?

626
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,091
No, I'm good with just steel.

627
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,091
And I prefer being
a Speedster over a water wizard.

628
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,595
Too old for jewelry.

629
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,274
Nana Baa.

630
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,152
Unhand me, you fiend!

631
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,567
You shall pay dearly for this.

632
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:00,694
He saved us.

633
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,368
Beebo is our one true god.

634
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,030
The bonny ones
always be the craziest.

635
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:13,162
Well, I guess we better get to
mind-wiping Mallus' three amigos.

636
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,213
Guys, you think this is crazy,
try having a kid.

637
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,335
Oh, no, thank you.

638
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,382
I bet you're damn good at it.

639
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,503
I'll be seeing you, Ms. Lance.

640
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,176
Well, you can count on it,
Ms. Sharpe.

641
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,601
Come on.

642
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:29,681
- No.
- Oh.

643
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:45,034
Seeing as though this is the last time
we see one another.

644
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,662
Something to remember me by.

645
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,541
Oh, your dirty hat.

646
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,420
That's weird.

647
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:56,797
Sweet.

648
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:01,838
Hey.

649
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,591
Stop, I need to... I need to
talk to her for, like, two seconds.

650
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,224
Alone, please.

651
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,929
I lied.
It'll be more like 20 seconds.

652
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,857
So, I found something
on the ship that was your dad's.

653
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:21,153
And I thought maybe you'd
want something to remember him by.

654
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,732
As I spend the rest of my life
rotting in a Time Bureau prison?

655
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:32,786
That's my father's time stone.

656
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,118
He died to give you a second chance.

657
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:38,583
Don't waste it.

658
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,637
Are you glad I picked you up
in Zambesi six months ago?

659
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,064
I think the words you used were,
"Just one more mission."

660
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,062
It's better than the line
they used on me.

661
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,939
"Come with us if you wanna live."

662
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,611
I almost die every week on the ship.

663
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,281
But you found a home.

664
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,483
I did.

665
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:11,992
And as much fun as this has been,
it's time for me to go home.

666
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,243
Amaya, you can't
leave me and Sara, and...

667
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,871
You guys are my family.

668
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,043
Always will be.

669
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,586
But I have another family
waiting for me in the years to come.

670
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,346
And they need me more.

671
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,467
Well, you will always
have a home on the <i>Waverider.</i>

672
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,680
I'm gonna miss you guys.

673
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,974
- Um... Is that Jonah Hex's hat?
- Shut up.

674
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,354
- Is there...
- I can't.

675
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,505
- Do they...
- Stop, please.

676
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:43,689
- I'll miss that.
- Is this...

677
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,450
Yeah.

678
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,778
I guess this place is all right,
if you like untouched nature,

679
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,078
and beautiful views.

680
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,406
I do love it here.

681
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,042
But there are a lot
of things I'm gonna miss.

682
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,875
Like cheese puffs, and sports bras.

683
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,081
Mmm-hmm.

684
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,587
And you, Nathaniel.

685
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,632
You aren't gonna miss
any of those things.

686
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,175
Because you're not
gonna remember them.

687
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,110
I don't wanna forget.

688
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,820
Because if I do,

689
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,574
I would have lost the only
part of you that I'm allowed to keep.

690
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,465
Goodbye, Amaya.

691
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,805
Don't turn around.

692
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,223
Don't turn around.

693
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,133
Don't turn around.

694
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:20,918
Good call, Mick.

695
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,123
When I said Aruba, I meant me.

696
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,704
Not all of you.

697
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,916
Still, nothing helps
a broken heart like a good tan.

698
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,801
Should've invited Ava.

699
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,378
Oh, we've got plans.

700
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,472
And until then, she's busy fixing

701
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,266
all those pesky anachronisms
we left behind.

702
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,808
Well, that's the thing about
defeating an ancient time demon.

703
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:43,184
Everything else seems boring.

704
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,810
I'm good with boring.

705
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,654
Hey, idiot. Get out of here.
This is a private beach.

706
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,069
Fancy meeting you lot out here.

707
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,612
Constantine?

708
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,860
Did you really think I was him?

709
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,288
It's me.

710
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,498
Gary, Ray obviously
has been day-drinking.

711
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,957
The wig's too much, right?

712
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,961
No, it's very presidential.

713
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,459
Gary, what do you want?

714
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,082
He's been with me, love.

715
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,135
Oh, I need a word with you sorry lot.

716
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,008
Now...

717
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,887
Whose brilliant idea was it

718
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,811
to let an ancient demon
out of his bloody cage?

719
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,599
Sara's.

720
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,314
Well, you opened a door, love.

721
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,313
And Mallus wasn't
the only thing that got out.
