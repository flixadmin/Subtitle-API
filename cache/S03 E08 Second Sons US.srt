1
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,485
I'll give you one try, girl.

2
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,490
Kill me and you're free.

3
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,327
But if I live, I'll break both your hands.

4
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,331
Go on, hit me.

5
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,834
Hit me hard.

6
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,637
Sulk all you want.

7
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,099
Truth is, you're lucky.

8
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:09,022
You don't wanna be alone out here, girl.
Someone worse than me would find you.

9
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:13,026
-There's no one worse than you.
-You never knew my brother.

10
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,820
He once killed a man for snoring.

11
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,865
There's plenty worse than me.

12
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:23,161
There's men who like to beat little girls,
men who like to rape them.

13
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,788
I saved your sister from some of them.

14
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,210
-You're lying.
-Ask her, if you ever see her again.

15
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,340
Ask her who came back for her
when the mob had her on her back.

16
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,802
They would have taken her
every which way and left her there

17
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,471
with her throat cut open.

18
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,772
-Is that the Blackwater?
-The Blackwater?

19
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,942
Where do you think I'm taking you?

20
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,821
Back to King's Landing,
to Joffrey and the Queen.

21
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,491
Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen.

22
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,578
That's the Red Fork.
I'm taking you to the Twins.

23
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,873
But why?

24
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,085
Because your mother
and brother will be there,

25
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,795
and they'll pay me for you.

26
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,924
Why would they be at the Twins?

27
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,470
Those outlaws
you love so much, never told you?

28
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,014
The whole countryside is yapping about it.

29
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,185
Your uncle is marrying
one of the Frey girls.

30
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,189
So, quit trying to bash my skull in
and we might just make it there

31
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:34,691
in time for the wedding.

32
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,586
Men who fight for gold
have neither honor nor loyalty.

33
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,754
They cannot be trusted.

34
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,465
They can be trusted
to kill you if they're well paid.

35
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,801
The Yunkish are paying them well.

36
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,302
You know these men?

37
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,305
Only by the broken swords
on their banners.

38
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,145
They're called the Second Sons.
A company led by a Braavosi named Mero,

39
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,941
-"The Titan's Bastard."
-Is he more titan or bastard?

40
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,402
He's a dangerous man, Khaleesi.

41
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,903
They all are.

42
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,826
-How many?
-Two thousand, Your Grace.

43
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,997
-Armored and mounted.
-Enough to make a difference?

44
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,587
It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.

45
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,923
I'm sure the sellswords prefer
to fight for the winning side.

46
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,176
I imagine you're right.

47
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,846
I'd like to talk
to the Titan's Bastard about winning.

48
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,308
-He may not agree to meet.
-He will.

49
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,187
A man who fights for gold
can't afford to lose to a girl.

50
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,400
Your Grace, allow me to present
the captains of the Second Sons...

51
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,028
Mero of Braavos...

52
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,281
Prendahl na Ghezn...

53
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,535
-and then...
-Daario Naharis.

54
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,459
You are the Mother of Dragons?

55
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,671
I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in Lys.

56
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,673
-Mind your tongue.
-Why?

57
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,383
I didn't mind hers.

58
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,554
She licked my ass
like she was born to do it.

59
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,478
-You, slave girl, bring wine.
-We have no slaves here.

60
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,274
You'll all be slaves
after the battle unless I save you.

61
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,404
Take your clothes off
and come and sit on Mero's lap,

62
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,198
and I may give you my Second Sons.

63
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,992
Give me your Second Sons
and I may not have you gelded.

64
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,246
Ser Barristan, how many men
fight for the Second Sons?

65
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:57,250
-Under two thousand, Your Grace.
-We have more, don't we?

66
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,502
Ten thousand, Unsullied.

67
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,004
I'm only a young girl,
new to the ways of war,

68
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,424
but perhaps a seasoned captain,
like yourself, can explain to me

69
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,468
how you propose to defeat us.

70
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,388
I hope the old man is better
with a sword than he is with a lie.

71
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,723
You have eight thousand Unsullied.

72
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,189
-You're very young to be a captain.
-He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.

73
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,151
Even if your numbers are right,
you must admit

74
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,861
the odds don't favor your side.

75
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,904
The Second Sons have faced
worse odds and won.

76
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,448
The Second Sons have faced
worse odds and run.

77
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,327
Or you could fight for me.

78
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,333
We've taken the slavers' gold.
We fight for Yunkai.

79
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,336
I would pay you as much and more.

80
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,090
Our contract is our bond.

81
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,844
If we break our bond,
no one will hire the Second Sons again.

82
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,972
Ride with me
and you'll never need another contract.

83
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,392
You'll have gold and castles,
and lordships of your choosing

84
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,060
when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.

85
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,688
You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.

86
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,814
You have no cavalry.

87
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,153
A fortnight ago, I had no army.
A year ago, I had no dragons.

88
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,699
You have two days to decide.

89
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,872
Show me your cunt.
I wanna see if it's worth fighting for.

90
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,505
You seem to be enjoying my wine.

91
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,716
Perhaps you'd like a flagon
to help you ponder.

92
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,717
Only a flagon?

93
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,012
And what are my brothers in arms to drink?

94
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,805
-A barrel, then.
-Good.

95
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,684
The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone.

96
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,356
In the Second Sons, we share everything.

97
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,942
After the battle,
maybe we'll all share you.

98
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,574
I'll come looking for you
when this is over.

99
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:02,750
Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle,
kill that one first.

100
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,794
Gladly, Your Grace.

101
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,474
Half Robert, half lowborn.

102
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,395
Show the boy to his chambers.

103
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,939
Have the maids draw him a bath
and find him some decent clothes.

104
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,401
I'll come visit you soon.

105
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,871
-What do you mean to do with him?
-You know what I mean to do with him.

106
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,081
Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?

107
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,709
If it needs to be done, do it.
Don't torture the boy.

108
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,878
Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, My King?

109
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,297
No.

110
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,259
If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.

111
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:40,014
Her panic seeps into her meat,
darkens it, fouls the flavor.

112
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,600
You've slaughtered many lambs?

113
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,103
And none have seen the blade.

114
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,115
"And... and no... and no...

115
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:04,830
V... V... Visenya, Targaryen

116
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:10,169
rod... r... rode, Vhagar...

117
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,589
Vha..."

118
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,800
Fuck me.

119
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:24,392
"Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar,

120
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:29,230
the smallest of the dragons,

121
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:36,695
though still l... l... large
e... e... enog... enough... enough...

122
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,450
to swallow a... a horse whole."

123
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,714
Your Grace.

124
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,092
They feeding you enough?

125
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,596
Two meals a day.
Cold for breakfast, hot for supper.

126
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,890
I cannot complain.

127
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,144
You don't belong in a place like this.

128
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,146
Well, it's sad to say,
but I've seen worse.

129
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,399
Yeah.

130
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,404
I'm sorry about your son.

131
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,074
Didn't get the chance to tell you before.

132
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,994
Good lad. Loyal lad.

133
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,499
Melisandre's returned.

134
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,838
-I didn't know she'd been gone.
-Came back with a bastard boy.

135
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,217
-Robert's bastard boy.
-Why?

136
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,929
She says there's power in king's blood.

137
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,225
-She's going to kill him.
-Sacrifice him.

138
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,561
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I'm not a lettered man,

139
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,564
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

140
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,151
-The boy is your nephew.
-What of it? We're at war.

141
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,030
Why should I spare
the son of some tavern slut

142
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,407
Robert bedded one drunken night?

143
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,285
Because he has your blood in his veins.

144
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,580
So did Renly.

145
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,500
Renly wronged you.

146
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,003
Renly declared himself king
when the throne belonged to you.

147
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,339
He raised an army, stole your bannermen.

148
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,509
This boy has done you no harm.
He's an innocent.

149
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,177
How many boys live in Westeros?

150
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,597
How many girls?
How many men? How many women?

151
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,099
The darkness
will devour them all, she says.

152
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,520
The night that never ends.
Unless I triumph.

153
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,398
I never asked for this.
No more than I asked to be king.

154
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:41,695
We do not choose our destiny,
but we must do our duty, no?

155
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,990
Great or small, we must do our duty.

156
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,329
What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?

157
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:54,750
Your Grace, wh...

158
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,711
why did you come to see me today?

159
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,880
I came to free you...

160
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,759
if you swear never to raise your hand
to the Lady Melisandre again.

161
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,262
I swear it.

162
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:12,059
-I can't swear never to speak against her.
-You have little regard for your own life.

163
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,310
Quite little, Your Grace.

164
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,145
Verging on none.

165
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,191
You could have freed me
yesterday or tomorrow...

166
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,946
but you came to me now before this boy
is put to the knife because...

167
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,615
you knew I'd counsel restraint.

168
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,619
You came to hear me say it
because you believe it yourself.

169
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,583
You're not a man who slaughters
innocents for gain or glory.

170
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,298
When my son was five he said to me...

171
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,967
"I don't ever wanna die."

172
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,679
I wanted to say to him,
"You won't, child. You won't ever."

173
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,767
I hated the idea of him
lying awake in the dark, afraid.

174
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,690
I think mothers and fathers
made up the gods

175
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,818
because they wanted their children
to sleep through the night.

176
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,697
I saw a vision in the flames.

177
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,160
A great battle in the snow.

178
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,454
I saw it.

179
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,293
And you saw whatever she gave birth to.

180
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,422
I never believed,
but when you see the truth,

181
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,510
when it's right there in front of you
as real as these iron bars,

182
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,388
how can you deny her God is real?

183
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,955
-That dragon bitch. She talks too much.
-You talk too much.

184
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,875
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

185
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,586
Eight thousand Unsullied stand
between her and your cock.

186
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:05,255
My cock will find a way.

187
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,884
Tell him. Is there any place
that my cock can't reach?

188
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,220
She'll tell me
whatever you pay her to tell me.

189
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,765
Daario Naharis,
the whore who doesn't like whores.

190
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,476
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.

191
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,520
And I'm no whore, my friend.

192
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,856
She sells her sheath
and you sell your blade.

193
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,234
-What's the difference?
-I fight for beauty.

194
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,070
-For beauty?
-We fight for gold.

195
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,074
The gods gave men two gifts
to entertain ourselves before we die...

196
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,786
the thrill of fucking a woman
who wants to be fucked,

197
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,580
and the thrill of killing a man
who wants to kill you.

198
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,376
-You'll die young.
-What do we do about the dragon girl?

199
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,295
We can't beat eight thousand Unsullied
on the battlefield.

200
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,672
There won't be a battle.

201
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,132
And we don't have
to deal with her eunuchs.

202
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,633
We only have to deal with her.

203
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,760
-She's well guarded.
-Tonight's a new moon.

204
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,389
One of us slips into her camp,
past her Unsullied and her knights.

205
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,142
Which one of us?

206
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,104
Close your eyes, love.

207
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,737
Three coins.

208
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,989
A coin from Meereen...

209
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,491
a coin from Volantis,

210
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,162
and a coin from Braavos.
The Braavosi does the deed.

211
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,501
One for each of us, darling.

212
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:26,962
No peeking.

213
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:48,150
Do you hear me?
Follow my voice. I'm right here.

214
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,779
You have something for me?

215
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:57,993
Valar morghulis.

216
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,059
Lady Sansa.

217
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:29,066
-You look very handsome, My Lord.
-Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams.

218
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,152
But you do look glorious.

219
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,619
Perhaps we could have
a moment alone. Do you mind?

220
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,291
Podrick, could you escort
Lady Stark's handmaiden?

221
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,018
My Lady, I want you to know...

222
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,230
I didn't ask for this.

223
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,149
I hope I will not disappoint you, My Lord.

224
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,317
N... no, don't.

225
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,946
Y... you don't have to speak to me
as a prisoner anymore.

226
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:19,449
You won't be a prisoner after today.
You'll be my wife.

227
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,663
I suppose
that's a different kind of prison.

228
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:32,212
I just wanted to say--
I... I'm just trying to say, very badly...

229
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,590
I just... I just...

230
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,510
just want to say I know how you feel.

231
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,973
I doubt that very much, My Lord.

232
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,438
You're right. I... I have no idea
how you feel, and...

233
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,565
you have no idea how I feel.

234
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,700
But I promise you one thing, My Lady.

235
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,162
I won't ever hurt you.

236
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,710
Do you drink wine?

237
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,546
When I have to.

238
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,633
Well, today you have to.

239
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,476
You look radiant, Your Grace.

240
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,064
-Radiant? Why radiant?
-It's the word that came to mind.

241
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,527
We're going to be sisters soon.
We should be friends.

242
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,656
You're a musical girl, aren't you?

243
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,367
I imagine you have a lovely voice.

244
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,037
A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.

245
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,581
But you know the song,
"The Rains of Castamere"?

246
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,834
Of course.
They play it so often here at court.

247
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,879
So, you know the story
of House Reyne of Castamere?

248
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,048
Not as well as you, I'm sure.

249
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:02,260
House Reyne was
a powerful family. Very wealthy.

250
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,304
The second wealthiest in Westeros.

251
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,850
Aren't the Tyrells the second
wealthiest family in Westeros now?

252
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,480
Of course, ambitious climbers don't want
to stop on the second highest rung.

253
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:19,111
If only you could take that final step,
you'd see further than all the rest.

254
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,656
You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

255
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,661
So, Lord Reyne built a castle
as grand as Casterly Rock.

256
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:31,540
He gave his wife diamonds
larger than any my mother ever wore.

257
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:36,044
And finally, one day,
he rebelled against my father.

258
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,006
Do you know where House Reyne is now?

259
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:40,924
Gone.

260
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:42,884
Gone.

261
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,472
A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered?

262
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,477
Every man, woman, and child...
put to the sword.

263
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:57,858
I remember seeing their bodies hanging
high above the gates of Casterly Rock.

264
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,861
My father let them rot
up there all summer.

265
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,612
It was a long summer.

266
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:08,869
"And now the rains weep o'er their halls,
and not a soul to hear."

267
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,378
If you ever call me sister again,
I'll have you strangled in your sleep.

268
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,578
What are you doing?

269
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,581
Your father's gone.

270
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,459
As the father of the realm,

271
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,629
it is my duty to give you away
to your husband.

272
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:28,425
You may now cloak the bride
and bring her under your protection.

273
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,206
C... could you... could...

274
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,339
Thank you.

275
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,766
Your Grace, Your Grace,
My Lords, My Ladies,

276
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:24,648
we stand here in the sight of gods and men
to witness the union of man and wife.

277
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:30,403
One flesh, one heart,
one soul, now and forever.

278
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,507
Have you ever seen one like it?

279
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,468
I've never seen anything like any of this.

280
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,097
-Not in my life.
-It's shocking, isn't it,

281
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,766
the first time you encounter real wealth?

282
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,561
When I was your age,
I lived on one bowl of stew a day.

283
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,772
And stew is a kind word for it.

284
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,901
In Flea Bottom,
we called them bowls of brown.

285
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,114
We'd pretend that the meat
in them was chicken.

286
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,284
We knew it wasn't chicken.

287
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,672
Here, taste this.

288
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,426
You think I'm trying to poison you?

289
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,533
That's good.

290
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,081
-That's really good.
-Where do you think it's from?

291
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,002
-I couldn't even guess.
-Doesn't matter, does it?

292
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,629
It's the real thing or it's not.

293
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,799
You only need a tongue
to tell the difference.

294
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,720
Go on, have some more.

295
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,727
You still don't trust it.

296
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,397
You think this is all a mistake
and that you'll have to pay somehow

297
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,734
-for every bite you take.
-That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.

298
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,239
There are no mistakes. Not for us.

299
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,368
I'm a mistake.

300
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,996
I'm only here because my father
grabbed my mother

301
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,790
instead of the girl next to her
in the tavern.

302
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,793
Your father chose your mother
because the Lord of Light willed it.

303
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,713
He willed it
so you could be here right now

304
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,926
with a power inside you,
you can't even begin to understand.

305
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,681
And He brought me here
to draw it from you...

306
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,975
and birth it into the world.

307
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,939
We're both a part of His plan.

308
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,319
He wants this for us.
No, He demands this of us.

309
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,908
I don't understand. This...

310
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:27,080
-this doesn't seem very religious.
-According to whom?

311
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,834
The Silent Sisters?

312
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:35,672
With their stern looks,
muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts?

313
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,592
What have their gods done for you?

314
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,223
When you pray to them,
what's their answer?

315
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,393
A god is real or he's not.

316
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,896
You only need eyes to see.

317
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,529
Death is coming
for everyone and everything.

318
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,907
A darkness that will swallow the dawn.

319
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,077
And we can stop it...

320
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,204
you and I.

321
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,317
Let me show you what you have inside you.

322
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,195
Come fight death with me.

323
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,267
What are you doing?

324
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,689
You have to trust me.

325
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,840
What? Get it away!

326
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,135
Get it off me!

327
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,263
Don't fight, don't fight.
They won't take much.

328
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,391
Why are you doing this?

329
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,978
I told you there's power
in the blood of kings.

330
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,314
-And you have so much blood.
-No.

331
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,942
No, no, no, no, no!

332
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,112
Not there. Not there!

333
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,953
You can blame Ser Davos.

334
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,747
He didn't believe
in the power of king's blood.

335
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,668
He wanted a demonstration.

336
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,756
Please. Please, Your Grace. My Lord!

337
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,962
The usurper, Robb Stark.

338
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,760
The usurper, Balon Greyjoy.

339
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,266
The usurper, Joffrey Baratheon.

340
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:40,375
So, their son will be your nephew.
After you're wed to Cersei, of course.

341
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:46,214
And you will be the king's stepfather
and brother-in-law.

342
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,800
When you marry the king,

343
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,969
Joffrey's mother
will become his sister-in-law...

344
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,849
and your son will be Loras' nephew?

345
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,894
Grandson? I'm not sure.

346
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:03,064
But your brother
will become your father-in-law.

347
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,941
That much is beyond dispute.

348
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,922
Will you pardon me, My Lord?

349
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,843
Of course. Of course. En... enjoy.

350
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,267
Perhaps you could talk
to your bride-to-be instead.

351
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,105
I've got a lifetime for that.

352
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,410
Stay.

353
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,377
Yes, and it always fascinates me
how they manage to hang things like that.

354
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,212
You seem rather drunk.

355
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,257
Rather less than I plan to be.

356
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,677
Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk
at his own wedding?

357
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,097
This isn't about your wedding.
Renly Baratheon had a wedding.

358
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:24,103
Your wife needs a child,
a Lannister child, as soon as possible.

359
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,773
-And?
-If you're going to give her one,

360
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,985
-you need to perform.
-What did you once call me?

361
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,822
A drunken little lust-filled beast.

362
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,532
-More than once.
-There you have it.

363
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,159
Nothing to worry about.

364
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,915
Drinking and lust,
no man can match me in these things.

365
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,626
I am the God of tits and wine.

366
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:52,507
I shall build a shrine to myself
at the next brothel I visit.

367
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:58,513
You can drink, you can joke,
you can engage in juvenile attempts

368
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,934
to make your father uncomfortable,
but you will do your duty.

369
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,775
Oh, yes, a girl like you...

370
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:43,891
Well...

371
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,565
-My father once told me--
-Nobody cares

372
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,525
what your father once told you.

373
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,551
-Congratulations, My Lady.
-Oh, thank you, Your Grace.

374
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,554
Well, you've done it.
You've married a Lannister.

375
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,222
Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.

376
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,892
It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?

377
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,104
-What a glorious day.
-Yes, Your Grace.

378
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:34,775
I suppose it doesn't really matter
which Lannister puts the baby into you.

379
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,156
Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight
after my uncle passes out.

380
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,283
How'd you like that?

381
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:47,538
You wouldn't? Oh, that's all right.

382
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,665
Ser Meryn and Ser Boros
will hold you down.

383
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,297
Time for the bedding ceremony.

384
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,175
There will be no bedding ceremony.

385
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,844
Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle?

386
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,723
Come, everyone. Pick her up
and carry her to her wedding bed.

387
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,477
Get rid of her gown.
She won't be needing it any longer.

388
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,521
Ladies, attend to my uncle.
He's not heavy.

389
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:16,943
-There will be no bedding ceremony.
-There will be if I command it.

390
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:24,408
Then you'll be fucking
your own bride with a wooden cock.

391
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,746
What did you say?

392
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,963
What did you say?

393
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,050
I believe we can dispense
with the bedding, Your Grace.

394
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,596
I'm sure Tyrion did not mean
to threaten the king.

395
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,356
A bad joke, Your Grace.

396
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:59,443
Made out of envy
of your own royal manhood.

397
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:06,242
Mine is so small.
My poor wife won't even know I'm there.

398
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,370
Your uncle is clearly
quite drunk, Your Grace.

399
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:10,997
I am.

400
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,708
Guilty.

401
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,627
But...

402
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:24,844
but it is my wedding night.
My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.

403
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,265
Come, wife.

404
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,981
I vomited on a girl once
in the middle of the act.

405
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:37,982
Not proud of it.

406
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:43,946
But I think honesty is important
between a man and wife, don't you agree?

407
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,742
Come, I'll tell you all about it.
Put you in the mood.

408
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,278
-Is that wise, My Lord?
-Tyrion, Sansa.

409
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,698
My name is Tyrion.

410
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,284
Is that wise, Tyrion?

411
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,708
Nothing was ever wiser.

412
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,264
Astoundingly long.

413
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,768
-What?
-Neck.

414
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,603
You have one.

415
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,818
-How old are you exactly?
-Fourteen.

416
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,032
Well...

417
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,827
talk won't make you any older.

418
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:26,173
My lord father has commanded me
to consummate this marriage.

419
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:45,794
Stop.

420
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,715
I can't.

421
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,223
-I could, I won't.
-But your father...

422
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:01,560
If my father wants someone to get fucked,
I know where he can start.

423
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,068
I won't share your bed.

424
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,448
Not until you want me to.

425
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,411
What if I never want you to?

426
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,300
And so, my watch begins.

427
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,482
-Nineteen?
-Yes, Your Grace.

428
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,277
How can anyone speak 19 languages?

429
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,697
It only took Your Grace a year
to learn Dothraki reasonably well.

430
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:41,577
Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki,
or grunt at my husband and hope...

431
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,622
What do you mean reasonably well?

432
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,877
Dothraki is difficult
for the mouth to master.

433
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,129
So guttural and harsh.

434
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,473
Athjahakar.

435
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,395
-Athjahaka.
-Ath-ja-hakar.

436
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,231
Athjahakar.

437
00:44:12,649 --> 00:44:15,361
Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.

438
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,156
Your High Valyrian
is very good, Your Grace.

439
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,368
The gods could not devise
a more perfect tongue.

440
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,663
It is the only proper language for poetry.

441
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,837
No screaming or she dies.

442
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,353
What do you want?

443
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,190
-You.
-Let her go.

444
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,275
Don't scream, lovely girl.

445
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,244
You were sent here to kill me?

446
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,871
So, why haven't you?

447
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,499
I don't want to.

448
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,710
What do your captains have
to say about that?

449
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,003
You should ask them.

450
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:25,180
-Why?
-We had philosophical differences.

451
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,599
-Over what?
-Your beauty.

452
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,185
It meant more to me than it did to them.

453
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,939
-You're a strange man.
-I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet.

454
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,318
-I only do what I want to do.
-What, and this is supposed to impress me?

455
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,028
Yes.

456
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,741
Why would I trust a man
who murders his comrades?

457
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:49,246
They ordered me to murder you.
I told them I preferred not to.

458
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,415
They told me I had no choice.

459
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:56,420
I told them I am Daario Naharis.
I always have a choice.

460
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,756
They drew their swords...

461
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,426
and I drew mine.

462
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,751
Will you fight for me?

463
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,510
Swear to me.

464
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,933
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

465
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,602
My sword is yours, my life is yours...

466
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,729
my heart is yours.

467
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:18,335
-You really ought to knock.
-I brought your breakfast.

468
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,290
It's getting dark.

469
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,043
We could stay here for the night.

470
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,453
How hard can it be to build a fire?

471
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,497
It doesn't matter.

472
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,249
Come under the furs.
We can keep each other warm.

473
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,854
He winked at me before.

474
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,984
-I doubt it.
-I saw... I saw him wink at me.

475
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,361
He blinked.

476
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:53,490
I suppose it's a rather
philosophical difference

477
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,200
between a wink and a blink.

478
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,619
A what?

479
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:03,333
Well, I mean, there's no real difference.

480
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,505
A wink is on purpose.

481
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,385
You thought of a name yet?

482
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,475
It... it would be easier
to refer to him if he had a name.

483
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,186
Sometimes, do you talk fancy
on purpose to confuse me?

484
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:28,567
What? No. This is just the way I talk.

485
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,697
I'll build that fire.

486
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,541
Don't you think he should have a name?

487
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,879
I don't know many boys' names.

488
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,175
Let's see, there's Duncan...

489
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,510
Kevan, Jon...

490
00:50:57,053 --> 00:51:01,308
-Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer.
-Craster.

491
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,187
Yes.

492
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,774
-May... maybe that's not...
-Mormont.

493
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,610
That's a lovely idea, but...

494
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,945
Mormont's a last name.

495
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,740
Why is it a last name?

496
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,785
Well, it's a family name.

497
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,289
For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly.

498
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:29,711
Samwell is my birth name
and Tarly is my family name.

499
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:34,674
You... you see?
So, my father is also a Tarly.

500
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,012
-His name is Samwell Tarly too?
-No...

501
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:42,891
-Randyll Tarly.
-Randyll is a handsome name.

502
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,561
Please don't name him Randyll.

503
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,901
Is your father cruel like mine?

504
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,032
Different manner of cruel.

505
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,089
Not Randyll, then.

506
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,488
Don't.

507
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,284
-Don't go out there.
-I'll be back.

508
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,536
I just want to look.

509
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:21,948
