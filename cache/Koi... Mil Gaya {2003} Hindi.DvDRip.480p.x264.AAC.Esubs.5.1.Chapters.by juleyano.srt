1
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,489
The universe is made of
several groups of stars...

2
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:05,422
which are called the galaxies.

3
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,288
The galaxy our planet Earth belongs to

4
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,860
is called the Milky Way.

5
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,359
My husband, who was a space scientist
firmly believed...

6
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,272
that like the Milky Way, there
exist several other galaxies...

7
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,206
on which there could be life.

8
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,541
He had just one goal in life:
To discover life on other planets.

9
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:38,553
He had invented several types of
gadgets to collect data.

10
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,887
He used to send sound signals
into space...

11
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,064
and always said that a sound
is something that never dies.

12
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,791
That it reverberates in space forever.

13
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,101
He was sure that some day...

14
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:57,235
someone from another world would
listen to his sound signals...

15
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,006
and respond.

16
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,239
One evening...

17
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,913
Sonia!

18
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:22,004
Coming, dear. What happened?

19
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,793
Look! They're responding!

20
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,003
These sounds...?

21
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,269
I used the word "OM" to make a
pattern on this octopad.

22
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:43,107
I converted it digitally on the computer
to send sound bytes into space.

23
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,676
And look at this. Someone from
another world is responding to me.

24
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,682
I've succeeded in my research !

25
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,523
I've achieved a breakthrough, Sonia!

26
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,287
We must inform the
space centre immediately.

27
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,909
You see this Research Centre, Dr Mehra?

28
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,978
This is what we have been
researching for years...

29
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,279
and they contacted you of all the people?
How is that possible?

30
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,687
Why not? I too have spent a
lifetime doing this research.

31
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,692
I sent them various sound waves.

32
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,689
I invented so many sound
producing instruments

33
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,058
And after all my experiments,
when I sent the word "OM" to them...

34
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:38,561
in different variations and notes,
why isn't it possible that...

35
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,970
They say day-dreaming is a bad habit.

36
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,699
I must go home, to bed.

37
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:21,441
They don't realise that every discovery
or find is initially a dream.

38
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,349
Don't be disheartened.

39
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,089
People in the world always
reject new findings...

40
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,721
but accept them later.
That's what they're doing to us.

41
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:41,695
ls it possible for the worlds
in the universe...

42
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,671
separated by millions of miles...

43
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,805
to ever meet?- Why not?

44
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,107
Man has gone to the Moon. He has sent
space-shuttles to Mars and Jupiter.

45
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,576
Similarly, they must be trying
to find out about our world too.

46
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,711
Which is why UFO's
have often been sighted.

47
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,495
Why are the lights
going on and off?

48
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,664
What's happening?

49
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,571
Sanjay! Look there!

50
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,353
They didn't believe what I said.
But they've come!

51
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,219
No...

52
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,655
In a single moment, every dream
of our life was shattered.

53
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,523
The one who tried to
locate another world...

54
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,000
was lost to a world
no one knows about.

55
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,463
After his death, I had
no other support in Canada.

56
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,202
Rohit was very small,
so I came back home.

57
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:40,884
From what you say, I now understand
the whole case history.

58
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,347
These are the x-rays
of Rohifs brain.

59
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:49,695
See this white patch?
It's called the gliosys.

60
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,698
It's caused by an injury
to the brain.

61
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,702
But nothing of the sort
ever happened to Rohit, Doctor.

62
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:04,975
It did, Mrs Mehra, when you fell on
your stomach during the accident...

63
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,605
it caused an injury
to the baby's brain...

64
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:12,114
Who was in your womb and
this pan of his brain was damaged.

65
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:18,847
That's why he doesn't have a normal
mental growth and is weak in studies.

66
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:24,054
Although he's eight, his brain is
that of a two-and-a-half-year old's.

67
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,524
I'm afraid, even when he grows up,
his mental faculties will be stunted.

68
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:39,810
There surely would be a cure, doctor?
- There is. A brain surgery.

69
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,148
However... - What?

70
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,547
Chances of success in this case
are very bleak.

71
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,756
If the surgery fails, his whole
body could be paralyzed.

72
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,822
or it could even result in death.

73
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:03,795
No. I've already lost
everything I ever had.

74
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,201
I have nothing except Rohit.

75
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,935
I can't afford to lose him.

76
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,757
“Although he's eight, his brain is
that of a two-and-a-half-year old's“.

77
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,022
"Even when he grows up, his mental
faculties will be stunted".

78
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,656
Sorry, my foot! look at what you've
done to my house with that ball of yours.

79
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,797
I'm in the police force.
If you break another window pane...

80
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,626
I'll have you locked up.
Get that?

81
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,698
Argues with me.
Bloody crooks.

82
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:24,876
What harm have I done to you?
You've broken a window pane again!

83
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,046
I break your window pane.
But I do say sorry, don't I?

84
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:32,256
Are you doing me a favour?
How many years have I put up with you!

85
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,258
I'm not sparing you today. I'm not!

86
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,220
No one needs to be scared.
- Oh yes, let him come.

87
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:46,564
God! What have they done! They've
wrecked all the window panes!

88
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,735
The rain, the sunshine, the dust...

89
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,309
everything's in there, except me!

90
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,477
Don't get angry uncle.

91
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,812
When I grow up, I'll mend
all your windows Uncle.

92
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,852
How much more do you want to grow up?
You're as tall as a tree already.

93
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,591
You want to be the Eiffel Tower?
- Don't insult our friend.

94
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,323
We'll replace all your window panes.
- Go ahead and do it!

95
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,788
Let's have five hundred bucks first.
- Five hundred bucks? What for?

96
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:18,470
We'll have to buy new ones, you see.
So let's have the money.

97
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,799
Rascals! You ask a
policeman for money?

98
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,475
Get going before I give
you a thrashing! Scram!

99
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,137
Rohit, hurry up son.
You'll be late for school

100
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,414
Today's a very important day, Lord.
I'm going to a higher class.

101
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,650
The seventh standard.
Take care of me, Lord.

102
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,052
Ma, have you never been to school?

103
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,289
We don't carry old books to a new class.

104
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,995
I'll be given new books
in the seventh standard.

105
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,434
You're not going to
the seventh standard.

106
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,801
Why not? All my friends are!

107
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,172
You've failed your grades.

108
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,048
I've failed again?

109
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:08,820
Yes.

110
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,820
I'm not going to school. Never!

111
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,862
That teacher's a nasty man.
I do all my studies, he still fails me.

112
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:23,794
And he promotes everyone else.
That's why I will not go to school.

113
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,364
Study harder this time, Rohit.
You will surely pass.

114
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,132
No.

115
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,844
There will be new students
in my class, Ma.

116
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,007
They'll tease me and make fun of me.

117
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,615
They'll call me a tall stick and
other things. I'm not going to school.

118
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:43,748
Throw those books away.
I don't want them.

119
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,491
It is not possible, Mrs Mehra.

120
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,626
Forget about promoting Rohit
to the seventh standard...

121
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,095
he shouldn't be in this school
in the first place.

122
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,999
There are special schools
for children like him.

123
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,633
There is no school like that
in this town.

124
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:11,483
But I'm trying to get
a transfer to Delhi...

125
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,880
where there are special schools
for children like Rohit.

126
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,054
The chairman of the bank I'm working
for has even promised me a transfer.

127
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,187
It's only a matter of a year, sir.

128
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,067
One last favour, sir.

129
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,599
Teachers never consider educating
children a favour.

130
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:42,774
But giving him a promotion like this
won't help him in any way.

131
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,246
Father, I know Rohit will never
become what I wanted him to be...

132
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,556
nor what his father wished for him.

133
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,992
But still, for the sake
of Rohifs happiness...

134
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,566
please, I request

135
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:13,542
This is the last time.

136
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:22,484
lfx is equal to 12,
and y is equal to 8...

137
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,848
what would x plus 3y be?
Hurry up and write down the answer.

138
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,002
How much would x plus 3y be?
Show me your answer.

139
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,248
This is the right answer.

140
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,427
Yours ought to be the first hand to
rise in the class next time.

141
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:14,899

"The skies will bow
at your feet..."

155
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:33,288
"and there will be
no one like you around"

156
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:48,637
“The sight of the birds...“

157
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,484
"awakens a desire"

158
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:59,250
“Although we tread the earth...“

159
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:04,327
"we will reach for the skies"

160
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:12,160
"We will reach for the skies"

161
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,707
What are you shaking your head for?
You're all of six feet...

162
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,009
and you move around with these
two feet nothings. Aren't you ashamed?

163
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,347
Get out of our way.

164
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,948
We got here first,
so we'll cross first.

165
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:03,653
Get your bikes out of our way.

166
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,820
We do not believe in going in
the backward direction, moron.

167
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:09,255
We'll do the needful. You will always
keep moving in a backward direction!

168
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,392
He's begun to talk too much, Raj.

169
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:19,996
Rohit, these dogs are barking far too
much today. So let's give them a shot.

170
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,798
Oh yes, the formula... - 320!

171
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:38,589
Catch him.

172
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:24,797
Move....move.

173
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:55,127
May I ask, where you gentlemen
were going to, in such a hurry?

174
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:59,735
How dare you enter a no-entry zone?
- He knocked our bikes down, sir.

175
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,334
That doesn't mean you will
violate traffic rules.

176
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,903
Sukhwani, give them a ticket.

177
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:09,473
Excuse me, sir.
Perhaps you don't know who I am.

178
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,851
I know. You're Raj, the District
Magistrate Harbans Saxena's son.

179
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:18,015
Sukhwani, collect double the
fine from them. - Yes sir.

180
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,586
And have this news splashed
in the local newspapers.

181
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:25,128
People ought to know that when
Inspector Khan is in-charge...

182
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:30,095
no one can take things for granted.
Not even if he's Distt. Magistrate's son...

183
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:34,671
or the District Magistrate himself.
I hope you've got the message.

184
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,740
Colonel! Come on out!

185
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:46,880
Harbans! I have never seen
a moron like you!

186
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:48,381
Couldn't you even
come to receive me?

187
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,621
Malhotra, there can't be a bigger
idiot than you in the world!

188
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,859
You sent a fax that you were coming,
but you didn't tell me when and how!

189
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,997
Where would I have come
to receive you, you idiot?

190
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,560
Relax... must you welcome someone
with swear words like this?

191
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:07,636
But that's how this duffer is!
Look at him! He won't even embrace me.

192
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:16,809
My dear friend!
So nice to meet you.

193
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:18,873
Now that he has retired...

194
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,918
he has come to spend the rest of
his life with his friend.

195
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,755
And this friendship we will
celebrate for a whole year to come.

196
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:30,119
To begin with, we'll have a grand
party at our bungalow this evening.

197
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,092
At least come and sit down first.
- Come.

198
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:41,529
Well, well! I forgot to ask you
the most impoﬂant question!

199
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:45,810
Where's our little doll...?
Our tiny little girl?

200
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:50,607
Your tiny little doll has grown up.
- ls it?

201
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,410
But where is she, lndu?

202
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:19,302
Why're you late?
- Not late at all.

203
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,807
The bus has yet to come...

204
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,242
and we'll have a blast watching
the three and half hour movie!

205
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:27,175
Three and a half hour movie?
- That's the fashion nowadays.

206
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,118
The bus has arrived!

207
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,717
Come quick|y....we may miss the bus.
Come quickly.

208
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,221
The bus has left, we miss the movie
and our ho|iday's in ruins!

209
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:51,399
I've just arrived in the city.
Can you tell me where Shanti Villa is?

210
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,078
Shanti Villa? Over there...
- No, it's on this side!

211
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,209
But... - The jeep's going empty...

212
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,477
the girl's gullible,
she'll drop us at the movies.

213
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,518
Let's go. We'll take you there.

214
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,208
By the way, my name is Nisha
What's yours?

215
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:32,377
What places could one see here?
- Several.

216
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,986
How about the nightlife here?
What do folks do in the nights?

217
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,218
They sleep.

218
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,560
Are there no discos in town?
- There are. But kids aren't allowed.

219
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,396
Kids?

220
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,811
Hey! This is not Shanti Villa!
- This is a cinema hall.

221
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,452
But I... - You want to go Shanti Villa.

222
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:16,159
And we want go to the movie!

223
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,261
Shanti Villa's not far though,
Take a right, a left...

224
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,765
then right, left, left...
you'll reach Shanti Villa.

225
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,464
So you guys wanted a lift!
- Right, auntie!

226
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,939
You ought to be ashamed!
You fool people along with these kids?

227
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:40,540
And on top of that, you are laughing?
- I'm laughing at your nose.

228
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:44,550
When you scream, it twitches funnily!
Like a deflated balloon!

229
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,927
You shouldn't have done that, Rohit.

230
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,996
When someone asks for your help...

231
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:59,032
you must help him,
not make a fool out of him.

232
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:00,567
But I'd have missed the movie.

233
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:04,134
What did I read out to you
from the Gita ?

234
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:11,277
God is forever willing to help those
who help others.

235
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:16,754
Didn't I read that out to you?
- You did. But I forgot.

236
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:22,992
The next time you meet that girl,
you're going to apologise to her.

237
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,163
You'll say sorry to her.
- I will.

238
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:36,574
What's this, Ma?
- It's a computer your Papa made.

239
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,937
Papa built a computer?

240
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,679
Through the computer and
the instruments he invented...

241
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:48,479
he spoke to people who live
far away, on the stars.

242
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:53,591
There are people on the stars?
- Yes.

243
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,598
I can't see anything, Ma.

244
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:13,406
There are several things
one cannot see.

245
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:17,911
But they do exist.

246
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,457
What? - Party!

247
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,401
Know what, Harbans?
Your jokes are still as hilarious.

248
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,072
Nothing has changed in all these years.
- Why not, daddy?

249
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,905
Look at Raj. He used to be a little
kid, but he's now as tall as a pole.

250
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,975
I'm sure someone pulled his legs!

251
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:54,918
She used to be small and fat too,
crying, “Mummy!“ for everything.

252
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,321
You've met after years and
you've already started fighting?

253
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,560
Fights make the bond of
friendship stronger, Right?

254
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:32,055
One must eat on time
and sing praises of the Lord!

255
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,247
Give me more.

256
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,054
Their age to eat, all right.

257
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,258
So what's the spread like?
Where are the papad?

258
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,228
It's a queue. I'll come
in the line.

259
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,976
ls that mutton?
Give me some, I do eat it.

260
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,640
Give us some food.
- You just took a plateful!

261
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,513
That's gone down already.
- Where's down?

262
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,779
Here.
- God! Amazing tummy!

263
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:09,925
300 million people in the country
live under the poverty line.

264
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,390
They don't get to see
a fistful of foodgrains...

265
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,630
and you're taking a second helping?
- That's none of your business.

266
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:17,566
Right.

267
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:19,665
Give us some food.

268
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,634
Bittu! Give me some more!

269
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:25,468
Wait.

270
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,510
Oh my god! Escape from here.

271
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:29,840
Let the boys continue drinking,
I'm famished.

272
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,884
C'mon!

273
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:01,976
Who does he think he is?
lfl could get my hands on him!

274
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:04,677
I'm not going to spare him!

275
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,265
What are you up to?
What were you stealing?

276
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,436
No... I was only saying sorry.

277
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,567
Take a look.
That's his way of saying sorry.

278
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,904
By sticking chewing gum to the seat.

279
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,950
So you were sticking
chewing gum, were you?

280
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,114
He's was the one last night!

281
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,781
Jerk, you've started getting
too big for your boots?

282
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,351
You challenged us the day other
and you're now teasing girls?

283
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,260
He's the one who took me
to a cinema hall...

284
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,298
pretending to show me the house.
He even spilt food on my head!

285
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,930
That was nothing, Nisha. With what
he was doing today...

286
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,572
you'd have had to cut your hair!
Look at the chewing gum!

287
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,376
Such a rascal behind
that innocent face?

288
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,380
We ought to hand him over
to the police!

289
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:51,485
Oh no, why hand him over to the
police for something so trivial?

290
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,949
We'll let him go.
What say, Raj?

291
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:57,994
Scram.

292
00:34:59,530 --> 00:34:59,996
Get lost.

293
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,904
Raj, why're allowing him to leave?
He should be taught a lesson.

294
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,388
Don't hit me! I'm telling you
the truth. I was only saying sorry.

295
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,939
Quite a champion with
your scooter, aren't you?

296
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,113
To be honest, that madcap
isn't at fault Nisha.

297
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,944
The sight of you could
drive anyone crazy.

298
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,889
Are you flirting with me?

299
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:12,024
Not at all. On rare occasions,
I speak the truth.

300
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,961
He won't get into mischief anymore.

301
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,024
He's been given a solid punishment.

302
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:34,374
But my son isn't like you,
because God hasn't made him like you.

303
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,114
He's a youth, no doubt.
But he has the brains of a child.

304
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,293
A naive, innocent chi|d..

305
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,592
who can't tell the difference
between good and bad.

306
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:53,395
You boys beat him up mercilessly
and broke his scooter!

307
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,166
Because you thought he was
teasing this girl?

308
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,276
He came here not to tease you
or to harass you...

309
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:04,104
he came to apologise to you.
Look at this!

310
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,946
He wanted to say he was sorry.

311
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:12,857
Anyway, I can't hold this against you
because you are new to this town.

312
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:17,594
But Raj...?
He knows everything.

313
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,930
He used to be Rohifs class-fellow.

314
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,430
Because he's normal...

315
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,362
he moved ahead in life.
And my son remained where he was.

316
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:32,635
But you know something?
I don't regret it at all!

317
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,305
Because if normal people
are like what you are...

318
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:42,709
I'm glad my son is abnormal.

319
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,346
Rohit, what are you doing
in this computer class?

320
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,048
Rohit has also chosen computers
in his options, sir.

321
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,421
Go and take your seat.

322
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,121
I want to learn computers too, sir.

323
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,627
You need brains to learn computers.

324
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:29,966
And you're so bright,
you're still in the seventh.

325
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,600
My father was a great scientist, sir.
He even had a computer.

326
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,573
I want to become like my Papa, sir.
- So go and learn from your father.

327
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,104
He's no longer in this world, sir.

328
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,450
So go to the world he's in and learn.
And stop picking on my brains!

329
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,181
Go away. Out!

330
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,137
Avon cycle!

331
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:48,171
Ma...

332
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:55,278
ls this cycle for me, Ma?
- Yes, it's for you.

333
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:00,221
It's a very nice bicycle, Ma!
Avon! Thank you, Ma!

334
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,590
Say thank-you to her. She's the
one who brought it for you.

335
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,697
I'm not saying thank-you,
and I'm not saying sorry either.

336
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,236
I don't want the cycle.

337
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:23,911
Have you seen his anger?

338
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,565
It's true I've made a mistake.

339
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:47,561
But how was I to know that you
weren't up to any mischief...

340
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,908
and had come to say sorry to me?
Anyway, let bygones be bygones.

341
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,237
I'll say sorry to you now, okay?

342
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:08,551
And not just me...Raj, Monty and the
other boys will say sorry to you too.

343
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,792
And no one will
bother you ever again.

344
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,030
What if someone does bother me?

345
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:20,493
You and I will get together
and beat him up!

346
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,968
God! You too?
- Of course.

347
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,336
We're friends now, aren't we?
- Really?

348
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,009
C'mon!

349
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,116
All of you will now say
sorry to Rohit.

350
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,497
Didn't I tell you?
Are you happy now?

351
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,929
And listen everybody...
no fights ever again.

352
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,432
Only friendship.

353
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,537
Wait here, I'll be back in a minute.

354
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:17,083
No, I don't know to dance.
- There's nothing you've got to know.

355
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,361
Just hold my body like this
and sway to the music.

356
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:24,100
No, I feel scared.
- What are you scared of?

357
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,531
I'll teach you.
- No, I don't want to learn.

358
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,869
Hey! You're breaking into a sweat.

359
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,398
Oh yes, a bit of it.

360
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,922
It'll rid you of your fear
and you'll stop sweating.

361
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,853
But I'm all right.
- Have some.

362
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:56,491
It's not nice at all...
- It's very nice. Have it. Go on.

363
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,997
Then, let's dance together.

364
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,635
You're forcing him to have liquor?

365
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,367
what harm will some Bacardi do?
He's not a kid anymore.

366
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:11,611
I told you not to bother
Rohit anymore. But you guys...

367
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:13,782
Let's go, Rohit...

368
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:23,586
<i>11</i>

369
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,928
“I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose...“

370
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:06,132
"who knows where I'm going..."

371
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,112
“I'm sliding...“

372
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,608
"what have you done to me?"

373
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,423
“I'm breaking loose,
I'm breaking free...“

374
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,697
"who knows where I'm going..."

375
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:49,742
"|'m giving way..."

376
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:53,143
“I'm moving with you“

377
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,185
"What spell is this..."

378
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:45,528
"that we slip, as we walk?"

379
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:51,865
"We're having so much of fun,
things have changed so much"

380
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,889
"Why have things changed?"

381
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,892
"They have changed, all right"

382
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,570
“I'm breaking loose,
I'm breaking free...“

383
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,766
"who knows where I'm going..."

384
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,238
“I've begun to slide...“

385
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,978
"what have you done to me?"

386
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,965
"What's makes you so innocent?"

387
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,032
"It's because you're so sweet"

388
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,304
"And why do you find me so sweet?
Tell me"

389
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,474
"Why must I tell you?"

390
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,498
"Say something"

391
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,467
"What should I say?"

392
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:01,304
“I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose...“

393
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:04,502
"who knows where I'm going..."

394
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:07,937
“I've begun to slide...“

395
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,849
“I'm moving with you“

396
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,709
“I'm breaking free,
I'm breaking loose...“

397
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,813
"who knows where I'm going..."

398
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:22,351
"rm sﬂpping..."

399
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:32,595
"what have you done to me?"

400
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,773
"Over to you, I come"

401
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:49,109
Mr Sukhwani...

402
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,678
What is it... ? Sister!

403
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:56,318
What madness is this?
- All thanks to your darling son!

404
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:59,663
I've got into the habit of
living with broken windows.

405
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,656
I got breeze, water and even
the sunshine inside my house.

406
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:07,199
But ever since I fixed these panes,
it's suffocating and hot in there.

407
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:12,571
But why must you break the panes?
Can't you just open the windows?

408
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:19,079
Why didn't it occur to me!
Thanks for the suggestion.

409
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:23,419
Shame on me! I must be the first
Sindhi to cause losses to himself!

410
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:26,479
Really?

411
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,724
She's now your girlfriend.
- How?

412
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:32,523
She presented you a bicycle?
- She even took you to the club?

413
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,764
Yes, she danced with me too.
- She dropped you home...

414
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:37,832
and said good night?
- Did she give you a good-night kiss?

415
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:39,595
No.

416
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,831
So how does she become his girlfriend?
- Why not?

417
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,775
They become boyfriend and girlfriend
only when they exchange kisses.

418
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,141
So what should he do?

419
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:54,108
My Mummy's absolutely right.
Men are real idiots.

420
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,110
They don't even know that they
must further their friendship...

421
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,450
before getting down to kisses.
- I want to meet your Mummy!

422
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:04,125
She thinks we men are idiots?
- Oh yes.

423
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,991
Know what, Rohit?
Give her a nice present.

424
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,830
Where do I have the money
to give her a present?

425
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,462
Ma gives me just a rupee every day.

426
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,305
But you can give Nisha a rose.
Can't you?

427
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:26,511
Didn't you tell me about a boy
whose mind is like a child's?

428
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:30,981
There was a nice article on the Net,
I've got a print-out.

429
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:35,492
It says, such people ought to be
given a lot of love and sympathy.

430
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:36,758
That is their only cure.

431
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,415
What are you up to?

432
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:04,213
Come on up here.

433
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:15,224
Why're you hiding the rose?
- I'm not.

434
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:17,825
It's a present for you.

435
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,670
Why're you blushing?

436
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,216
My friends say...

437
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,709
that when a girl and a boy
exchange kisses...

438
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,216
they become boyfriend
and girlfriend.

439
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:42,854
Your friends are right.
lam indeed your girlfriend.

440
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:44,822
Really? - Yes.

441
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,530
Nisha...
- Yes, Papa?

442
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,501
I must leave now.
- No, come on inside.

443
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,697
My Mummy and Papa will be
very happy to meet you.

444
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,601
Papa, Mama... this is Rohit.

445
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,600
Sit down, son.

446
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,081
Will you have something to
drink, Rohit? Tea, coffee...?

447
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:12,452
Bournvita (a malt drink).
- Bournvita?

448
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,924
Yes, Bournvita is a must
for strength and vigour.

449
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:19,151
Look at me. I'm in the seventh,
but I'm the tallest in my class.

450
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,158
Thanks to Bournvita.

451
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,102
Sorry, Rohit. We have no Bournvita.

452
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:28,867
No....

453
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:31,935
But you must have Bournvita at home!
You must drink it every day.

454
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:35,468
Oh yes. We'll have some bought today.
- And we'll drink it too.

455
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:40,776
Call from District magistrate, sir.
- Tell him I'm coming.

456
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,011
Nisha, save the page, my child.
I'll be back soon.

457
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,494
You know computers?
- Yes.

458
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,139
I also know that you want
to learn to operate it.

459
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,408
Will you teach me?
- Of course.

460
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,246
So let's go to my house!
I have my Papa's computer.

461
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,591
These stars...?
- Yes!

462
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:29,865
My Papa was a big scientist.
He spoke to people living on the stars.

463
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,497
Really! - Yes indeed.

464
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:39,836
What's this?

465
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:43,278
I don't know.

466
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,208
Looks like one of
your Papa's projects.

467
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:51,411
Look, it says "press B"

468
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,891
Nothing's happening.
- That says "B" too. See?

469
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,628
Let's connect them and see.

470
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,741
How did you play that?
- I know the tune. Ma taught me.

471
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:54,349
Want to hear it?

472
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:08,893
Rohit, teach me to play it.
- It's very easy. Give me your finger.

473
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:18,800
<i>11</i>

"Whom have you found?"

00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:36,285
" I've found someone"

480
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:56,561

483
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,495
"Whom have you found?"

484
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:27,499
“ I've found someone“

485
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:10,279
"What does meeting me do to you?
Tell me, will you?"

486
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:14,044
"Tell me, will you?"

487
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:22,380
“I'll tell you in your ear...“

488
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:25,289
"come closer, will you?"

489
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:33,361
" I know what you're
going to tell me"

490
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:37,234
“I'm not going to heed
your request to come closer“

491
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:41,034
"Listen to me... do listen!"

492
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:47,712

00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:03,763
"Whom have you found?"

496
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:08,436
“ I've found someone“

497
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:55,750
"When you are with me,
you're close to me..."

498
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,821
"you're close to me,
even when you |eave"

499
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:12,093
"There can't be a realisation
like this one"

500
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:18,998
"| can't figure out
why all this happening..."

501
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:22,837
“I can't figure out
what's happening in my heart“

502
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:26,840
"You must, figure it out!"

503
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:33,251
"My head did always beat..."

01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:37,256

01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:45,534
"that I've found someone?"

506
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:49,170
"Whom have you found?"

507
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:53,540
“ I've found someone“

508
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:57,610
"My dreams, my imagination..."

01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,140

01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,943

511
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,718
"that I've found someone?"

512
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:14,557
"|'ve found someone"

513
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:29,233
Rohit, come quickly.
Dinner is sewed.

514
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:48,594
Kasauli Tigers are a strong side...

515
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,766
But the Blue Bulls are no easy team,
score is even at 50:50.

516
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:02,467
Gas has entered the final few minutes
with score at 60:58.

517
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:06,137
Blue Bulls passed the ball &
Kasauli Tigers have snatched it mid-way.

518
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,215
Kasauli Tiger's Raj Saxena is
moving forward swiftly...

519
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,976
..Crosses the halftime with the ball.

520
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:18,893
You idiot!

521
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:23,329
A beautiful girl walks
away with the boy.

522
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:26,503
Girl takes away the boy and players
take away the ball.

523
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,670
I'm confused over which game's
commentary should I give?

524
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,832
Anyway, Raj moves forward and
passes the ba||..

525
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,011
But Blue Bulls snatch
the ballonce again...

526
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:38,681
The game has resumed again and the
Blue Bulls seem to be in control.

527
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,177
And a basket from the Blue Bulls!

528
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:46,686
The scores are even, a few seconds to go
and the match is getting exciting...

529
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,119
The game has resumed again and
Blue Bulls seem to be in control.

530
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:54,023
the supporters of both the side
are vociferously cheering their teams.

531
01:03:54,564 --> 01:04:02,564
And there's another basket
by Raj Saxena!

532
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:11,703
The winners of the Hero Cup
are the Kasauli Tigers!

533
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:48,617
What's happening here, Rohit?

534
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:53,047
I want to play basketball too.
I too want to become a champion.

535
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,120
People will clap for me then.

536
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,186
Like Nisha was clapping for me?

537
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,959
But how will you learn on your own?
Let us teach you.

538
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:11,997
Will you really teach me?
- Of course. We'll teach you.

539
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:36,988
You're not hurt, are you?
- No... it's okay. Go ahead.

540
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,500
I don't want to learn!
I don't want to!

541
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:59,347
How will you get any applause
unless you learn?

542
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:11,359
You dare take me on
over Nisha?

543
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:16,368
Watch your step in the future.
Understand?

544
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:34,049
Ma says those who sin
are always punished.

545
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:39,722
But I have committed no sin.
So why am I being punished?

546
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:42,560
Everybody pokes fun at me.

547
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,398
If You don't help me,
who will?

548
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:48,896
You have so much of strength.

549
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,737
Give me some of Your strength, Lord.

550
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:57,879
Please... give me some strength, Lord!

551
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:04,702
What are you up to...?!

552
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:09,504
What have you been doing!
- I did nothing.

553
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:14,548
It's happening on its own, Ma!
- You did nothing...? Nothing?

554
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,394
What's happening, Ma?

555
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,592
There's a power failure in the
whole of the city, sir.

556
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:36,332
It's pitch dark everywhere.

557
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,464
What's up with this torch, Sukhwani?

558
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:41,072
It doesn't work on electricity anyway.

559
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:47,944
Looks like there's going to be a storm.
A deadly storm.

560
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:31,782
Sir! Look!

561
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:36,624
God!

562
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:35,253
There's news of a UFO being sighted
in Kasauli, in Northern India.

563
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:40,418
Several space organisations all over
the world refuse to believe this incident

564
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:44,356
Because no radar station in the world
nor satellites in space...

565
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:46,560
could detect any signals of the UFO.

566
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:50,437
But UFO legends abound,
like ghost stories.

567
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,238
Those who see them, believe them.
Those who don't, refuse to believe it.

568
01:11:55,778 --> 01:12:02,150
A similar UFO sighting was reported
in Bangalore in May, 2001.

569
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,082
There are claims of UFO sightings
not only in India...

570
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:07,619
but all over the world.

571
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:10,984
Although there is no strong evidence,
there are people who believe in them.

572
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:07,881
The burning grass and this crater
is evidence that the spacecraft...

573
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:13,450
that flew over Kasauli last night
landed right here.

574
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:17,084
Looks like this is where
the spacecraft landed.

575
01:13:20,028 --> 01:13:21,018
This is amazing!

576
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:27,363
The aliens from another planet chose
our town over the rest of the world!

577
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:33,409
Imagine how popular and famous
our little hill station is going to be!

578
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:37,779
I announce a two-day official holiday
to celebrate this event!

579
01:13:58,534 --> 01:13:59,160
What's all this?

580
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:03,361
There's a carnival at Mall Road.
People are dressed like aliens.

581
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,507
C'mon, Rohit. Wear something unusual.
- All right. I'll be back in a moment.

582
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:21,681
What are you doing? - I'm making
eyes and a mouth on this pitcher.

583
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:24,526
What for? - I'm going to dress up
like an alien...

584
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:25,852
and go to the carnival
with my friends.

585
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:30,023
Like an alien...?

586
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,367
You're not going anywhere.

587
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:35,203
Why not? All my friends
are going, Ma.

588
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:36,735
There's a difference between
the rest ofthem and you....

589
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:40,068
What difference?
- No arguments, I say!

590
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:43,108
You're not going. That's it.
- God! Let's go!

591
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:04,325
Extra terrestrials... aliens?

592
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,927
What are you saying, Mr Khan ?

593
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:10,566
It's a fact that a spaceship
landed here, Harbans.

594
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:14,035
It could also be a fact that someone
emerged from the spaceship.

595
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:17,235
That's right, sir. That's exactly
what has happened.

596
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:19,878
I have inspected the whole region.

597
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:24,876
From the footprints, it appears as if
some aliens came out of the spaceship.

598
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,416
But... - But what?

599
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:34,419
One of them did not go back.
- What makes you say that?

600
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:39,101
There were footprints of some aliens
which led to the jungles...

601
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:44,005
but the footprints of one of them
did not lead back to the spaceship.

602
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:47,765
What if they are indeed the
footprints of an alien?

603
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:49,605
We'll capture it.

604
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:53,008
That will be a bigger achievement
that man landing on the Moon.

605
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,343
It'll unravel thousands of
secrets of the universe.

606
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,717
But what if the alien is dangerous?
- We'll simply shoot it.

607
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:04,450
Whatever it is, till this is
fully proved...

608
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,626
we must keep it to ourselves.

609
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:09,063
The whole of the hill station is
in a festive mood...

610
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:10,857
it'll unnecessarily spread panic.

611
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:46,934
It's no use calling me!
Ma won't let me go! Go away, Bittu!

612
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:59,341
What are you whistling for?
Haven't I said, I can't come? Go away!

613
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:44,727
Know what, Rohit? There's an alien
in the forest.

614
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:46,917
What's an alien?

615
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:50,823
Those from other planets
are called aliens.

616
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:53,995
How are they to look at?
- I don't know.

617
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:58,064
They could look like animals,
or even like us.

618
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:02,172
Could they even look like Bittu?
- Bittu?

619
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:06,905
Yes, a kid came from the forest last night.
I thought it was Bittu.

620
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:10,813
I smashed the pitcher and shouted at him.
He ran away into the forest.

621
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:14,547
And see...? The pitcher's been
put together.

622
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:16,588
It must've been another pitcher.
- No, this is the one.

623
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,590
I drew eyes and a mouth on it.
Take a look.

624
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:26,590
It wasn't that alien, was it?
- Let's go and check.

625
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:32,502
If it can put together a pitcher,
it can do anything. I'm feeling soared.

626
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:36,338
What's there to be scared of?
I'm with you. Come on, come.

627
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:14,342
Rohit, looks like it was really a kid.
- Yes. Let's go back. - Let's go.

628
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,713
Have you landed from up there?

629
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,227
That's where he seems
to have come from.

630
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,762
We must do something for him.

631
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:46,398
If the police catch him,
God knows what they will do.

632
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:51,078
And if he remains in the jungle,
the wild animals will eat him up.

633
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:59,445
So what must we do?
- We'll have to hide him.

634
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:04,452
Will you go with us?

635
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:08,523
Will you be my friend?

636
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:37,879
Jai Hind, sir. - Jai Hind.

637
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:40,483
Good morning, sir.

638
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,127
Have this roll developed and printed.
- Okay.

639
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:46,851
Make it fast.

640
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:54,625
You've done an amazing job, sir!
This is a fantastic idea!

641
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:58,101
A po|iceman's job can't be trusted.
Hired today, fired tomorrow.

642
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:01,037
Especially with an honest man like you,
anything is possible.

643
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:03,939
What rubbish are you talking Sukhwani?
- I'm only praising you.

644
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:09,208
This is a terrific side-business.
As long as weddings are held...

645
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:14,116
you're going to do roaring business!
- Sukhwani! Do as you are told

646
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:23,528
This is Khan here, sir.

647
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:27,965
I've taken pictures of the footprints
as you asked me to.

648
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:30,536
I'll soon have them sent to you.

649
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:34,798
Your opinion in this matter is
very important, sir.

650
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:34,196
What happened...? What's wrong?

651
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:35,235
What?

652
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:41,139
What happened?

653
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:43,634
Rohit, open the door

654
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:51,312
I'm glad you're here.
- Why? Any problem?

655
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,613
Yes, he was screaming away!

656
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:58,219
He must be hungry.

657
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:02,263
There are so many things here.
He won't eat anything.

658
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:04,527
He must be eating something else.

659
01:25:05,967 --> 01:25:07,526
What do you eat?

660
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:14,868
Glass?

661
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:20,709
Wood?

662
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:24,083
The net? The ventilator?

663
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:28,554
- No, Rohit He's trying
to say something else.

664
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:34,017
The air...? The rays?

665
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:39,056
Sunlight? - Sunlight!

666
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:41,193
God! He speaks!

667
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:44,530
He understands what we say!

668
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:49,434
Which means, apaﬂ from having those
powers, he's also very intelligent.

669
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:52,803
Oh yes. But how's he
going to eat the sunlight?

670
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,345
Sunlight isn't something
you eat, is it?

671
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:57,985
What we eat gives
our body its energy.

672
01:25:58,186 --> 01:26:00,883
Maybe they draw their energy
from sunlight.

673
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:15,837
Rohit, look...

674
01:26:16,771 --> 01:26:18,398
Hide quickly! Hurry!

675
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,306
What are you doing here
so early in the day...?

676
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:29,074
Nothing at all, Ma.

677
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:32,845
Nisha! When did you arrive?
- Right now, auntie.

678
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:36,991
So join us for breakfast. Come on.
- Go ahead. We'll come in a while.

679
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:40,656
I'm getting late for the office.
Come quickly.

680
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:56,668
Why's that jug of water here?
Bring it along when you come, okay?

681
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,479
Don't come out.
We'll be back in a moment, okay?

682
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:08,954
Bye, Nisha... Rohit, make sure
you finish your breakfast!

683
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:11,247
WOW!

684
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:25,131
Found the ball, Bittu? - No.

685
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,001
What a sixer. The hall's disappeared
outside the stadium!

686
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,973
Not outside the stadium.
It's inside that outhouse. Look.

687
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:32,447
Yes, come on. - Come on.

688
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:39,781
Where's the ball?

689
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,561
What are you guys doing here?
- There's someone in there!

690
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:54,395
A ghost! - A monkey!
- Our ball is in his hand.

691
01:27:57,572 --> 01:28:00,542
Why have you come out?
Didn't I tell you not to come out?

692
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:09,416
What ball? You've ruined everyihing!
Everybody's got to know!

693
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,344
Who's that?

694
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:17,516
First promise us that you will not
utter a word about this to anyone.

695
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:22,463
He's a friend of mine.
Like all of you are.

696
01:28:28,436 --> 01:28:31,565
He came in that spaceship.

697
01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:34,898
The spaceship has left,
but this poor chap got left behind.

698
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:25,087
Magic! - That's magic! Magic!

699
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:27,091
"Magic..."

700
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:30,220
"Magic...."

701
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:38,798
<i>11</i>

702
01:29:54,522 --> 01:30:02,522
"Magic...."

703
01:30:25,052 --> 01:30:33,052
"The earth and the skies..."
"the rose and the rosegardens..."

704
01:30:35,096 --> 01:30:40,034
"the hills and the winds
are meeting today"

705
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:48,234
"This is magic..."

706
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:57,644
"sheer magic"

707
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:28,577
"What spell is this?"

708
01:31:28,783 --> 01:31:31,047
"It's a new language of
love altogether"

709
01:31:31,252 --> 01:31:36,156
" No one despairs anymore"

710
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:50,598
"We're silent..."
"so are you"

711
01:31:50,838 --> 01:31:54,797
"And yet, we say so much"

712
01:31:55,009 --> 01:32:00,311
"How did this wonder happen?"

713
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:08,515
"It's magic..."

714
01:32:09,123 --> 01:32:17,123
"sheer magic"

715
01:32:57,538 --> 01:32:59,836
"You are the one our eyes cherish..."

716
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:02,305
"you are the one
who lives in our head..."

717
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:07,448
"we expect nothing from you in return"

718
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:26,660
"That you have come to see us..."

719
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:30,996
"we dream lovely dreams"

720
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:36,302
"Promise to be a friend always"

721
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:44,510
"It's magic..."

722
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:54,120
"sheer magic"

723
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:05,769
Why're you guys laughing so much?

724
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:07,734
Some new spaceship joke on SMS ?

725
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:11,742
The spaceship is old hat. We're laughing
at a new twist to the story!

726
01:34:12,613 --> 01:34:15,082
Will Nisha and Rohifs children
be normal or abnormal?

727
01:34:16,217 --> 01:34:17,378
Rohit and Nisha's children?

728
01:34:17,585 --> 01:34:21,021
As if you don't know. Nisha spends
all her time with Rohit.

729
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,216
Raj, do something
while you have the time.

730
01:34:25,593 --> 01:34:28,119
Else, that madcap will make away
with your goodies.

731
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:38,571
Harbans, any news on the alien?

732
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:44,135
No. Looks like Inspector Khan
was mistaken.

733
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:47,741
Else, we'd have had some
information on it by now.

734
01:34:51,819 --> 01:34:54,481
I have good news for you.
- Good news? What good news?

735
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,748
Your son has decided to get married.

736
01:34:59,293 --> 01:35:00,226
It's Nisha, Uncle.

737
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:09,097
Hear this? Nisha and Raj
have approved each other!

738
01:35:09,303 --> 01:35:13,137
Really...? This is wonderful news!

739
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:14,273
What say, lndu?

740
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:17,671
What happened?

741
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:21,041
Do you guys know?
Nisha's getting married to Raj.

742
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:25,446
How did you get to know?
- My parents were at the club last night.

743
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:27,985
They're the ones who told me.
- But how's that possible?

744
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:32,217
Nisha is Rohifs girlfriend.
Let's go and tell him. - C'mon.

745
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:12,894
Why did you lie?
When did I agree?

746
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:16,092
You didn't disagree either. And that's
what our parents want too.

747
01:36:16,303 --> 01:36:18,203
It isn't about our parents.
It's about telling lies.

748
01:36:18,405 --> 01:36:19,668
Where have I spoken a lie?

749
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,443
That we like each other doesn't mean
we get married, Raj.

750
01:36:25,646 --> 01:36:28,581
In any case, it's necessary to get to
know each other before getting married.

751
01:36:30,518 --> 01:36:34,751
As things stand today, we won't get
to know each other all our lives.

752
01:36:34,989 --> 01:36:38,448
What do you mean?
- Do you think I'm blind?

753
01:36:38,659 --> 01:36:40,184
Can't I see you and Rohit
are having an affair?

754
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:45,454
What did you say?
Rohit and |...? An affair?

755
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:50,727
Even if we are having an affair,
what is it to you?

756
01:36:50,938 --> 01:36:52,770
Whom I see is entirely my business.

757
01:36:52,973 --> 01:36:55,442
You have no right to interfere
in my personal life.

758
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:59,079
Do you get that?
- You're insulting me for that fool?

759
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:00,443
He is not a fool.

760
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:04,210
Looks like you've got to
know him very well!

761
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:08,719
Yes. Very well.
Him... and you, too.

762
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:22,734
What's going on over here...?

763
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:26,731
What happened, Rohit?

764
01:37:31,078 --> 01:37:33,911
Nisha's getting married, Ma.
With Raj.

765
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:39,787
So why are you upset?
Every girl gets married some day.

766
01:37:39,987 --> 01:37:41,921
But Nisha's my girlfriend, Ma!

767
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:47,859
What"? Nisham?
Your girlfriend? - Yes!

768
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:56,092
Because she spoke lovingly to you,
does that make her your girlfriend?

769
01:37:56,303 --> 01:37:58,169
She herself told me that
she's my girlfriend!

770
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:02,502
And that I'm her boyfriend.
- She mustn't have meant it.

771
01:38:03,777 --> 01:38:06,542
Nisha is an educated
and sensible girl.

772
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:15,285
She can be your friend...
not a companion for life. - Why not?

773
01:38:17,558 --> 01:38:25,558
Rohit, although you have grown up...
you're still a child.

774
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:32,732
You're not like boys of your age.
- Why not?

775
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,374
Why am I not like the other boys?

776
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:38,011
I haven't done anything wrong...
so why's Nisha also leaving me?

777
01:38:45,386 --> 01:38:46,820
Everything would have been fine...

778
01:38:49,123 --> 01:38:51,251
had only we not seen that spaceship.

779
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:58,330
Your father would have been
alive today and you...

780
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,827
you wouldn't have been like this.

781
01:39:03,203 --> 01:39:08,334
A spaceship? Papa...?
What happened, Ma?

782
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,073
We met with an accident.

783
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,053
What are you doing here?!

784
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:07,291
Get ready quickly.
I'll serve the breakfast.

785
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:12,128
Stop smiling and go back
to the outhouse.

786
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:15,832
Don't come out again,
you'll get caught. Go!

787
01:40:37,898 --> 01:40:41,334
Ma! I can't see anything!

788
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:45,000
Wash your eyes...
you'll be able to see.

789
01:41:05,125 --> 01:41:07,355
Ma! I can see everything!

790
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:11,293
You say you can't see anything and
then you say you can see everything!

791
01:41:11,498 --> 01:41:13,762
Hurry up, son.
You'll be late for school.

792
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:17,837
Time for computer classes.

793
01:41:18,038 --> 01:41:21,531
You mustn't come, Rohit.
The teacher will again scold you.

794
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:23,972
Why will he scold me now?
I'm already studying computers.

795
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:27,144
Rohit, where are your glasses?
Have you forgotten them at home?

796
01:41:27,347 --> 01:41:30,749
No, I left it them home. This morning,
I could see everything clearly.

797
01:41:30,951 --> 01:41:33,818
Really? - Oh yes.

798
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:37,324
In that case, read what Mr Chaturvedi
is writing on the blackboard.

799
01:41:49,703 --> 01:41:53,003
I want the answer to that, boys.

800
01:42:12,025 --> 01:42:13,220
Who gave that answer?

801
01:42:16,563 --> 01:42:21,524
Rohit, you orally solved a problem
meant for the tenth standard?

802
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:24,767
Come inside.

803
01:42:26,874 --> 01:42:32,244
Was that guess-work, or was it...?
- Was that the right answer, sir?

804
01:42:32,679 --> 01:42:35,876
Absolutely right.
But how did you solve it?

805
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:38,347
I don't know, sir.
It just came to me.

806
01:42:39,052 --> 01:42:43,489
Rohit...? I can't believe it.
- Neither can I, sir.

807
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:45,784
But this is a fact.
- Where is Rohit?

808
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:49,429
How many times have I told you
that you can't learn computers.

809
01:42:49,796 --> 01:42:51,389
You'd rather learn carpentry
or masonry!

810
01:42:52,099 --> 01:42:55,000
But you turn up every time and I have
to insult you and drive you out.

811
01:42:55,202 --> 01:42:59,764
Mr Mathur! ls that the way
you talk to your students?

812
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,567
Father, this boy has zero |.Q.

813
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:05,470
He needs a doctor, not a teacher.

814
01:43:05,746 --> 01:43:07,441
See for yourself.

815
01:43:08,048 --> 01:43:11,848
Tell me: without opening
a particular file...

816
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:15,380
how will you copy data from Windows
drive "A" to any other drive ?

817
01:43:16,623 --> 01:43:20,059
You are deliberately asking him a
difficult question to belittle him.

818
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:22,092
To begin with, go to programs...

819
01:43:22,296 --> 01:43:26,096
when the Windows Explorer has started,
right-click on the file.

820
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,291
And without releasing the button,
take the file to another drive...

821
01:43:28,502 --> 01:43:31,130
and release the button.
The file will be copied, sir.

822
01:43:37,644 --> 01:43:40,409
Didn't you tell me to learn it
from my father, sir?

823
01:43:41,348 --> 01:43:42,941
I've learnt it from my Papa.

824
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:48,420
You are a teacher, who's responsible
for thousands of students, sir.

825
01:43:48,622 --> 01:43:51,284
You ought to inspire them
to move ahead in life.

826
01:43:51,758 --> 01:43:55,092
Computer did not make man,
man made the computer.

827
01:43:55,295 --> 01:43:58,492
So what the brains can accomplish,
your computers never can, sir.

828
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:01,258
Do not ever consider anyone
to be small, sir.

829
01:44:01,602 --> 01:44:05,470
Because what is small
will become big some day, sir.

830
01:44:17,851 --> 01:44:20,445
Did you notice the look
on Mr Mathuﬁs face?

831
01:44:20,654 --> 01:44:23,419
But what makes you suddenly
so smart, Rohit?

832
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:27,324
There is a hitch. You will
forget about us now, won't you?

833
01:44:27,861 --> 01:44:30,660
You'll have grown up friends.
- Rubbish! That's not true.

834
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:33,166
You are my friends and
will always remain my friends.

835
01:44:35,702 --> 01:44:37,830
Rohit, pass the ball.

836
01:44:39,873 --> 01:44:42,501
Whom are you asking? This idiot, who's
still feeding on his mother's milk?

837
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:47,176
What are you staring at?

838
01:45:00,227 --> 01:45:04,357
Rohit! Look at the ball!

839
01:45:12,906 --> 01:45:17,036
You think you've become too tough?
Go check him out.

840
01:45:22,416 --> 01:45:23,383
What a punch!

841
01:45:24,584 --> 01:45:25,881
You've even got the strength!

842
01:45:32,759 --> 01:45:33,555
Goodness!

843
01:45:34,094 --> 01:45:40,397
Muscles! Take a look!

844
01:45:42,769 --> 01:45:48,230
Don't stare... c'mon!

845
01:45:54,614 --> 01:45:56,241
Looks like you guys haven't
had your mother's milk.

846
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:58,748
Make sure you have it next time.
We'll have a nice bout.

847
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:06,255
Why have you come here?

848
01:46:07,127 --> 01:46:09,596
Are you angry with me?
- Yes.

849
01:46:10,464 --> 01:46:12,432
Why?- Because you're
not my friend.

850
01:46:12,966 --> 01:46:13,762
You're going away with Raj.

851
01:46:15,635 --> 01:46:18,764
I'm not going with Raj. - No?

852
01:46:19,473 --> 01:46:23,273
I've turned him down.
- Great! I don't like him.

853
01:46:24,144 --> 01:46:27,603
I don't like him either.
- We share our likes, don't we?

854
01:46:28,982 --> 01:46:32,282
We share our likes and
understand each other too.

855
01:46:33,153 --> 01:46:34,951
Which is why I have come
to make you see reason.

856
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:42,292
Every girl has to get married some day.
She has to settle down.

857
01:46:42,829 --> 01:46:44,126
Oh yes, that is true.

858
01:46:44,664 --> 01:46:46,632
So tell me what kind of a boy
you would like.

859
01:46:46,833 --> 01:46:49,632
I'll find him for you.
- You will find him for me?

860
01:46:49,836 --> 01:46:51,304
Yes. We share our likes, after all.

861
01:46:51,505 --> 01:46:53,303
You will like what I like.

862
01:46:53,673 --> 01:46:55,641
Okay then, which boys do you like?

863
01:46:57,511 --> 01:46:59,809
There's Bunty, Bittu, Aslam...
several others too.

864
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:03,980
They're kids.- But I'm a grown up.

865
01:47:04,184 --> 01:47:05,811
It'll be great fun!
We'll always be together.

866
01:47:06,019 --> 01:47:08,647
We'll go out together and
drink Bournvita all the time!

867
01:47:09,689 --> 01:47:12,488
Marriage isn't just about
drinking Bournvita, Rohit.

868
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,328
It's a huge responsibility.

869
01:47:16,363 --> 01:47:19,333
A responsibility of giving
his wife lots of love, isn't it?

870
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,828
One can't live on love alone, Rohit.

871
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:29,172
Every girl seeks a companion
who's mentally and physically strong.

872
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:49,692
Am I not physically strong?

873
01:47:50,764 --> 01:47:58,764
Yes you are. - A bit raw mentally?
But I'll ripen.

874
01:48:04,578 --> 01:48:05,204
Just keep watching.

875
01:48:08,748 --> 01:48:10,876
I threw an amazing punch!

876
01:48:11,084 --> 01:48:13,382
And Nisha...! She was
stunned with my attitude!

877
01:48:13,587 --> 01:48:17,546
And that ball! One kick
and it kept flying and flying!

878
01:48:23,597 --> 01:48:27,056
You're the one who did
all this, isn't it?

879
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:42,748
No, Ma. Don't be afraid!
This is Jadoo, he's a friend.

880
01:48:43,283 --> 01:48:45,081
Get away from there!

881
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:47,082
How did this thing land here!

882
01:48:47,787 --> 01:48:51,087
Don't scream, Ma! Someone might
come here... listen to me, Ma!

883
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:55,250
Hear me out at least"!
- Keep away from it!

884
01:48:55,462 --> 01:48:56,088
What is it?

885
01:48:57,130 --> 01:48:59,428
He came in that spaceship
we saw recently.

886
01:48:59,633 --> 01:49:01,601
What? - I brought him
from the forest.

887
01:49:01,801 --> 01:49:03,769
He has been with me ever since.
He's very nice, Ma.

888
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:06,098
Very nice?
Are you out of your mind?

889
01:49:06,473 --> 01:49:08,441
He's not staying here another moment!

890
01:49:08,642 --> 01:49:09,768
I'm calling the police right now!

891
01:49:09,976 --> 01:49:14,436
Listen to me, Ma! - How dare you
hide that thing here!

892
01:49:14,648 --> 01:49:16,116
He has done us so many favours and

893
01:49:16,316 --> 01:49:17,112
You'll turn him over to the police?

894
01:49:17,317 --> 01:49:20,116
Favours! What favours?
- Take a look at me, Ma! Listen to me!

895
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,448
I'm not looking or
listening to anything!

896
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:28,958
Mrs Mehra? This is Father Rodericks.

897
01:49:29,496 --> 01:49:33,455
How have you managed this?
Rohit is a changed man.

898
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,130
The whole school is astonished
at his knowledge and intelligence.

899
01:49:41,174 --> 01:49:45,805
And we have decided to
promote Rohit to Class 10.

900
01:49:47,347 --> 01:49:48,143
Are you listening?

901
01:49:51,351 --> 01:49:53,319
What's the matter, Ma?
Who called?

902
01:49:53,853 --> 01:49:54,649
The Principal.

903
01:49:56,523 --> 01:50:00,653
They've promoted you
to Class 10, Rohit.

904
01:50:02,028 --> 01:50:03,996
That's because they don't have a
higher class than the tenth, Ma!

905
01:50:06,366 --> 01:50:08,664
But how did all this...?

906
01:50:09,035 --> 01:50:10,503
It's a miracle Jadoo has worked, Ma.

907
01:50:10,704 --> 01:50:12,502
Look, I'm not the same Rohit anymore.

908
01:50:13,873 --> 01:50:15,841
Your glasses"?

909
01:50:16,543 --> 01:50:18,671
I can see everything now, Ma.
And I can understand too.

910
01:50:18,878 --> 01:50:21,176
I have become worldly wise.

911
01:51:27,781 --> 01:51:32,082
From the photographs Inspector Khan
sent us, it is proved...

912
01:51:32,285 --> 01:51:33,912
that they are the footprints
of an alien.

913
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:35,918
We are here for further research.

914
01:51:36,956 --> 01:51:40,415
Which means your hunch
was right, Khan.

915
01:51:43,129 --> 01:51:47,760
Tell me something, doctor.
This creature from another planet...

916
01:51:48,134 --> 01:51:49,101
is it dangerous?

917
01:51:51,471 --> 01:51:55,430
Had it been dangerous, it would
surely have done something by now.

918
01:51:55,809 --> 01:51:58,437
But we haven't received
any such reports.

919
01:51:59,312 --> 01:52:02,942
Couldn't the silence also mean
that it's dead?

920
01:52:03,149 --> 01:52:06,608
Perhaps. But even its dead body
will be very precious to us, sir.

921
01:52:06,986 --> 01:52:10,923
To capture the alien dead or alive,
I'll have to comb the entire area, sir.

922
01:52:11,658 --> 01:52:13,285
I'll need extra forces for that.

923
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:22,462
Hey Jadoo, how do I look?

924
01:52:45,191 --> 01:52:48,650
Rohit! What's gotten into you?
- I don't talk to kids.

925
01:52:50,029 --> 01:52:51,497
It isn't my age to play
children's games anymore.

926
01:52:53,032 --> 01:52:54,830
It's time for me to sing and dance.
Tell that to everyone.

927
01:52:57,871 --> 01:53:01,171
What? Rohit's turned a hero?
- Yes, didi (sister)

928
01:53:01,374 --> 01:53:05,004
And he says, it's time for him
to sing and dance.

929
01:53:23,396 --> 01:53:25,865
Rohit! What are you doing?
- Practice!

930
01:53:26,065 --> 01:53:27,692
Practice? - Yes, look at them.

931
01:53:31,905 --> 01:53:34,203
I'm a bit raw.
Trying to ripen.

932
01:53:34,407 --> 01:53:37,707
Or else, people will laugh at you.
- Me? Why will they laugh at me?

933
01:53:38,244 --> 01:53:39,541
Because you're my girlfriend.

934
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:42,047
If I'm raw, won't they laugh at you?

935
01:53:53,593 --> 01:53:56,062
You're participating in the contest?
- Yes.

936
01:53:57,931 --> 01:54:00,229
Listen carefully to what I say, Rohit...
- No.

937
01:54:00,433 --> 01:54:01,901
Instead, watch what
I'm going to show you.

938
01:54:32,799 --> 01:54:35,427
Everyone's laughing at you, Rohit.
Let's go.

939
01:54:35,635 --> 01:54:38,263
No way! I'll give it another try.

940
01:54:39,973 --> 01:54:40,599
Move.

941
01:54:46,312 --> 01:54:49,441
Rohit, this is no child's play.
C'mon.

942
01:54:50,817 --> 01:54:52,285
All right. I'm leaving!

943
01:54:54,153 --> 01:54:54,779
One more try.

944
01:54:58,324 --> 01:55:06,324

972
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:19,942
Well? Ripened a bit, haven't I?
- You, I...

973
02:00:20,813 --> 02:00:21,439
all this...?

974
02:00:25,818 --> 02:00:28,617
This is only the beginning.
Just wait and watch.

975
02:00:52,511 --> 02:00:53,979
This isn't meant for kids.

976
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:56,808
If it bursts,
you run out of gas.

977
02:00:58,017 --> 02:01:00,645
We'll see who runs out of gas.
How about a match?

978
02:01:02,021 --> 02:01:04,820
All pepped up? - You'll know
after the match, sonny.

979
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:07,322
Really? So let's have a match.
- What's the bet?

980
02:01:08,361 --> 02:01:08,827
The Hero Cup!

981
02:01:09,528 --> 02:01:12,657
Alongwith the Cup, whoever wins,
gets a kiss from Nisha.

982
02:01:26,879 --> 02:01:28,506
The two of us are playing
a basketball match.

983
02:01:28,714 --> 02:01:30,842
You will kiss the one who wins.

984
02:01:31,884 --> 02:01:33,352
I'm not kissing Raj ever!

985
02:01:34,387 --> 02:01:37,015
You will kiss me, won't you?
- That is, if you win!

986
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:40,189
There's a huge difference between
dance and basketball, Rohit.

987
02:01:40,393 --> 02:01:41,519
You can't win it on your own!

988
02:01:42,061 --> 02:01:45,361
You've challenged him without a team
and invited trouble!

989
02:01:45,564 --> 02:01:48,033
Now you're going to lose and Raj
is going to give you a thrashing!

990
02:01:49,402 --> 02:01:50,870
Why? You guys are my team.

991
02:01:51,237 --> 02:01:55,037
We? They're so tall,
and we're so shod!

992
02:01:55,241 --> 02:01:57,039
We can't even manage a proper jump.

993
02:01:57,243 --> 02:01:57,709
Look here.

994
02:02:01,814 --> 02:02:02,713
WOW!

995
02:02:08,254 --> 02:02:11,224
Today's match is a
strange one indeed.

996
02:02:13,592 --> 02:02:16,391
have been challenged by
Rohit Mehra's team.

997
02:02:16,595 --> 02:02:18,563
His team is called the Pandavas.

998
02:02:23,269 --> 02:02:24,065
What do I see?

999
02:02:24,270 --> 02:02:26,739
ls this the team of the Pandavas
or is it their children?

1000
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:35,076
Don't move, okay?

1001
02:02:49,962 --> 02:02:51,589
There goes the referee's whistle
and the match begins.

1002
02:02:51,797 --> 02:02:53,697
Ball has been tossed up.

1003
02:02:53,899 --> 02:02:57,233
Raj Saxena, taking advantage of his
height, tosses the ball to a team mate.

1004
02:02:57,636 --> 02:03:00,799
The Kasauli Tigers pass the ball
to each other, across halfline...

1005
02:03:01,006 --> 02:03:04,670
here's another pass,
and another to Raj Saxena...

1006
02:03:04,877 --> 02:03:09,178
Raj Saxena advances, but Rohit Mehra,
takes the ball away from Raj Saxena...

1007
02:03:09,715 --> 02:03:10,682
maneouvres the ball
from between his legs...

1008
02:03:10,883 --> 02:03:15,184
advances towards the D, jumps up and...
it's a basket!

1009
02:03:21,660 --> 02:03:24,129
The match gets underway again
with the referee's whistle.

1010
02:03:24,497 --> 02:03:28,297
Monty passes the ball to Raj Saxena
who moves forward and this pass...

1011
02:03:28,501 --> 02:03:30,629
but Rohit Mehra snatches
the ball midway and...

1012
02:03:30,836 --> 02:03:36,639
Moves forward, eavdes,
jumps and basket.

1013
02:03:38,844 --> 02:03:41,211
The excitement is mounting,
the applause is getting louder...

1014
02:03:41,847 --> 02:03:43,178
and the scoreboard ticks on.

1015
02:03:46,685 --> 02:03:49,655
The match begins again. The ball
is with the Kasauli Tigers...

1016
02:03:49,855 --> 02:03:52,324
Raj Saxena gets hold
of the ball and...

1017
02:03:52,525 --> 02:03:56,257
Rohit Mehra knocks it out the danger area,
passes it to a team member...

1018
02:03:56,462 --> 02:03:59,090
he once again takes charge of the ball,
advances towards the basket...

1019
02:03:59,298 --> 02:04:02,996
he jumps up and this is
the third basket!

1020
02:04:11,777 --> 02:04:12,903
Let's surround Rohit.

1021
02:04:16,382 --> 02:04:18,476
The ball is with PCB and
the match begins.

1022
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:20,119
The ball is with Kasuali Tigers.

1023
02:04:20,319 --> 02:04:23,016
And Rohit Mehra is surrounded by
members of the Kasauli Tigers.

1024
02:04:23,222 --> 02:04:26,624
Jumping over the little boy,
Raj Saxena moves forward...

1025
02:04:26,826 --> 02:04:28,351
and this is a basket!

1026
02:04:28,561 --> 02:04:30,256
This is the first scoring point
from the Kasauli Tigers...

1027
02:04:30,496 --> 02:04:32,760
much to the delight
of their supporters.

1028
02:04:33,332 --> 02:04:36,029
The little boys pass the ball
to one another...

1029
02:04:36,235 --> 02:04:38,363
but Rohit Mehra's still surrounded,
not being able to do much...

1030
02:04:38,571 --> 02:04:39,367
and the kids are utterly helpless.

1031
02:04:39,572 --> 02:04:43,031
The hall's now with Raj Saxena and...
that's a basket!

1032
02:04:44,076 --> 02:04:46,875
Raj Saxena and his team rejoice.
The children are disappointed.

1033
02:04:47,079 --> 02:04:53,041
Rohit Mehra is still surrounded and
the hall's with Raj Saxena...

1034
02:04:53,252 --> 02:04:55,550
and what do I see...?
Rohit Mehra falls to the ground!

1035
02:04:55,754 --> 02:04:58,724
Whether he fell or was made to fall,
Raj Saxena takes advantage and...

1036
02:04:58,924 --> 02:05:00,653
that's a basket!

1037
02:05:00,860 --> 02:05:06,822
The children protest. They want a foul
called, but the referee's unmoved.

1038
02:05:07,199 --> 02:05:09,725
The scores are now even.

1039
02:05:10,603 --> 02:05:15,404
The ball is now with the little boys,
with Rohit Mehra...

1040
02:05:15,608 --> 02:05:19,169
he makes a pass which takes the ball
to another member of his team...

1041
02:05:19,378 --> 02:05:20,573
who's trying to jump high...

1042
02:05:20,779 --> 02:05:22,338
surrounded by the tall
Kasauli Tigers players...

1043
02:05:22,548 --> 02:05:25,279
there's little the boys can do.
The ball is with the Kasauli Tigers...

1044
02:05:25,484 --> 02:05:27,646
and here's another basket!

1045
02:05:30,055 --> 02:05:34,253
Why aren't you guys jumping?
- We're trying, but we can't jump.

1046
02:05:36,328 --> 02:05:40,595
The Kasauli Tigers are getting
more and more aggressive...

1047
02:05:40,799 --> 02:05:44,360
and Raj Saxena moves forward
to score another basket!

1048
02:05:44,870 --> 02:05:46,668
The score is increasing.

1049
02:05:47,373 --> 02:05:50,365
One basket after another...
and here's another!

1050
02:05:51,110 --> 02:05:55,707
Raj Saxena and his players now
seem to be toying with the kids.

1051
02:05:55,915 --> 02:05:58,441
The kids are all jumping around...

1052
02:05:58,651 --> 02:06:01,677
but Raj Saxena is scoring baskets
from where he stands!

1053
02:06:01,887 --> 02:06:05,289
It appears as if it isn't a match,
as if the Pandavas...

1054
02:06:05,491 --> 02:06:06,549
have been invited for
a practise session!

1055
02:06:06,759 --> 02:06:08,693
Here's another basket!

1056
02:06:12,998 --> 02:06:15,296
That whistle signals the half-time.

1057
02:06:18,938 --> 02:06:23,136
Jadoo... what's happening?
Why aren't we being able to jump?

1058
02:06:23,342 --> 02:06:24,309
Sunlight.

1059
02:06:25,344 --> 02:06:25,810
Sunlight?

1060
02:06:31,016 --> 02:06:32,484
Jadoo gets his energy from sunlight.

1061
02:06:33,352 --> 02:06:36,322
Unless he gets sunlight,
he can do nothing.

1062
02:06:39,191 --> 02:06:41,819
You mean, if there is no sunlight,
Jadoo can do nothing?

1063
02:06:42,361 --> 02:06:43,157
So what are we going to do?

1064
02:06:46,532 --> 02:06:49,832
Lord Krishna, please do something.

1065
02:06:53,205 --> 02:06:57,506
With the referee's whistle, play in
the second half has begun again.

1066
02:06:57,710 --> 02:07:00,008
The ball's in the air, going once again
to a player of the Kasauli Tigers.

1067
02:07:00,212 --> 02:07:06,345
He moves forward, passes the ball
...once again comes into Raj Saxena.

1068
02:07:17,129 --> 02:07:20,360
Kasauli Tigers continue the game
without bothering about Rohit.

1069
02:07:20,566 --> 02:07:21,863
Children's team are making a sincere
effort to give them a competition.

1070
02:07:22,067 --> 02:07:25,093
But they're unable to manage
the tall Players.

1071
02:07:25,304 --> 02:07:26,931
Kasauli Tigers are surging
ahead in the game...

1072
02:07:27,172 --> 02:07:31,040
But Rohit snatches the ball mid-way and
passes it to young team mate.

1073
02:07:31,243 --> 02:07:36,875
This child flies into the air,
passes the ball to another boy...

1074
02:07:37,082 --> 02:07:39,312
One child flies high into the air
and grabs the ball...

1075
02:07:40,285 --> 02:07:42,049
...Is this a twist in the match or
am I getting unwell?

1076
02:07:42,254 --> 02:07:44,382
Whatever happening here is amazing,
ladies & gentleman.

1077
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:46,786
Spectators are stunned.

1078
02:07:49,161 --> 02:07:50,720
Jadoo...Didi... Jadoo!

1079
02:07:52,431 --> 02:07:54,490
Match resumes once again and
the ball us with Kasauli Tigers...

1080
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:55,997
Raj Sexena is moving forward
with the ball...

1081
02:07:56,935 --> 02:08:00,166
Three Kids fly high into the air
and pass the ball...

1082
02:08:00,372 --> 02:08:05,435
...to Rohit Mehra who flies high
into the air and baskets it.

1083
02:08:12,084 --> 02:08:14,416
Blessed is the one who sings
glories of the Lord.

1084
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:16,748
Praise the Lord!

1085
02:08:17,289 --> 02:08:21,749
The spectators are ecstatic.
The match moves on.

1086
02:08:22,127 --> 02:08:24,596
The Kasauli Tigers move forward,
passing the ball to each other...

1087
02:08:24,797 --> 02:08:26,265
they are surrounding the opponents...

1088
02:08:26,465 --> 02:08:33,371
but this boy flies ahead, picks up the
ball & passes it to Rohit Mehra...

1089
02:08:33,572 --> 02:08:34,767
and Rohit Mehra scores another basket!

1090
02:08:39,445 --> 02:08:44,281
I'm not having to look down much,
I can see it happening right up here

1091
02:08:44,483 --> 02:08:48,613
The Kasauli Tigers are falling apart
and the children refuse to come down.

1092
02:08:48,821 --> 02:08:52,621
They're scoring the baskets
right up there in the air...

1093
02:08:52,958 --> 02:08:55,791
teasing the grown ups
all the way.

1094
02:08:57,996 --> 02:09:00,624
Match is getting existing. I couldn't
imagine this match would take this cause.

1095
02:09:14,179 --> 02:09:16,079
This match sure is
getting exciting.

1096
02:09:16,381 --> 02:09:22,218
Looks like the little kids are going
to wear out the Kasauli Tigers.

1097
02:09:22,855 --> 02:09:26,655
Raj Saxena is exhausted and the kids
help themselves to another basket

1098
02:09:27,259 --> 02:09:29,694
They're no kids, they've turned
out to be everyone's fathers.

1099
02:09:29,895 --> 02:09:34,662
They're scoring at will and
the score is way ahead.

1100
02:09:35,868 --> 02:09:37,836
25 seconds to go and we must see
which team clinches the match.

1101
02:09:38,036 --> 02:09:41,006
The scores are 48 and 49 points.

1102
02:09:41,206 --> 02:09:44,938
Now we've to see which
teams wins the hero cup.

1103
02:09:46,678 --> 02:09:48,976
Match resumes and the ball is
once again with the Kasauli Tigers.

1104
02:09:49,181 --> 02:09:51,912
...They're holding the ball firmly &
pressing it cautiously to team-mates.

1105
02:09:52,117 --> 02:09:52,845
..And appear determined... not
let the ball reach the opponent.

1106
02:09:53,218 --> 02:09:57,177
...Ba|| reaches Raj Saxena an
experienced player.

1107
02:09:57,389 --> 02:10:00,017
...Moving forward he throws
the ball into the basket.

1108
02:10:00,225 --> 02:10:01,852
...But Rohit Mehra once again
gets hold of the ball...

1109
02:10:03,128 --> 02:10:05,426
Spectators excitment is running high,
just 10 seconds move to the final whistle.

1110
02:10:15,007 --> 02:10:16,406
Final scores is 50:49.

1111
02:10:40,032 --> 02:10:43,730
I see the Kasauli Tigers,
dejected, heads hanging...

1112
02:10:44,102 --> 02:10:48,403
And the little are moving forward in
g|ory...to receive the Hero Cup.

1113
02:10:48,674 --> 02:10:52,076
Rohit is being presenting the with
Hero Cup. Give them a big hand.

1114
02:10:53,412 --> 02:10:55,039
Ladies & Gentleman little Pandavas
have won the Hero Cup...

1115
02:10:55,247 --> 02:10:58,444
There's another reward with the Cup.
The Hero Honda motorbike!

1116
02:11:02,721 --> 02:11:05,156
Not time for the kiss yet.
One more victory to achieve.

1117
02:11:07,092 --> 02:11:07,684
Get the Hero his Honda!

1118
02:11:12,531 --> 02:11:15,000
How did the kids start flying?

1119
02:11:15,934 --> 02:11:16,730
Something is surely fishy.

1120
02:11:17,603 --> 02:11:19,093
We must find out from the kids.

1121
02:11:19,771 --> 02:11:22,240
What are you talking about, Harbans?
- It's true.

1122
02:11:22,674 --> 02:11:25,143
My son is the butt of jokes
among his friends.

1123
02:11:28,881 --> 02:11:30,747
And it's all happening
because of your daughter.

1124
02:11:31,116 --> 02:11:34,575
I understand that, Harbans. I did my best
to make Nisha see reason. But...

1125
02:11:36,955 --> 02:11:40,084
Are you telling me that if Nisha
decides to marry Rohit...

1126
02:11:40,459 --> 02:11:45,420
you will give her hand in Rohifs,
despite knowing he's mad?

1127
02:11:46,632 --> 02:11:48,259
Just calling someone mad won't do!

1128
02:11:49,801 --> 02:11:52,600
The word "mad" doesn't make it clear
what kind of a madman someone is...

1129
02:11:52,804 --> 02:11:55,603
and what category of madnes
she belongs to

1130
02:11:55,841 --> 02:12:00,278
For example, schizophrenia is madness.
So are megalomania, obsession...

1131
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:04,780
psychopathy and mental imbalance.
And there's also plain madness itself

1132
02:12:04,983 --> 02:12:06,451
And madness has no limits.

1133
02:12:06,652 --> 02:12:08,279
Mad, idiot, crazy...
are names for the mad.

1134
02:12:08,487 --> 02:12:09,784
So are crack, cuckoo and dimwit.

1135
02:12:09,988 --> 02:12:13,947
There are people who the world thinks
are mad, but they aren't really mad.

1136
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:17,618
And there are those whose madness is
not obvious, although they are mad!

1137
02:12:17,829 --> 02:12:20,799
In shod, this is a small
summary on... madness!

1138
02:12:23,669 --> 02:12:26,969
Why have you stood up?
Please remain seated.

1139
02:12:32,844 --> 02:12:35,643
As I was saying, there are
several signs of madness.

1140
02:12:37,082 --> 02:12:39,642
To shake your legs in a state of
nervousness is also a sign of madness.

1141
02:12:41,687 --> 02:12:43,815
And you folks think I'm mad!

1142
02:12:46,692 --> 02:12:48,820
That's because I'm madly in love
with your daughter.

1143
02:12:52,898 --> 02:13:00,898

Why've you stopped? You were jumping

1183
02:18:05,343 --> 02:18:07,311
Jump over us again.

1184
02:18:10,081 --> 02:18:12,812
What are you looking down at?
What's in that bag?

1185
02:18:13,685 --> 02:18:17,315
Run! There's no sunlight!
Jadoo needs to be saved!

1186
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:44,738
Sir, I've seen it with my own eyes.

1187
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:03,646
Check what's in the bag.

1188
02:21:22,874 --> 02:21:23,340
Come and take a look.

1189
02:23:15,820 --> 02:23:18,448
Go... go home.

1190
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:24,287
But how did you escape, Jadoo?

1191
02:23:36,007 --> 02:23:39,136
It was a narrow escape!
- You were amazing, I say.

1192
02:23:44,849 --> 02:23:45,975
What happened?

1193
02:23:46,684 --> 02:23:48,311
ls Jadoo here, Ma ?
- Yes, he's inside.

1194
02:23:54,025 --> 02:23:56,494
Rohit... what happened?

1195
02:23:57,428 --> 02:23:59,328
The way Inspector Khan
was looking at me...

1196
02:24:00,531 --> 02:24:01,999
I'm sure he suspects me.

1197
02:24:03,701 --> 02:24:05,328
We'll have to hide Jadoo
somewhere else.

1198
02:24:05,536 --> 02:24:08,164
Let's hide him in my house.
My parents are away.

1199
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:12,840
No, my house should be right.
No one will ever imagine...

1200
02:24:13,044 --> 02:24:15,172
that Jadoo could be in District
magistrate's friend's house.

1201
02:24:15,446 --> 02:24:17,676
For how long will you keep
hiding him like this?

1202
02:24:17,915 --> 02:24:20,179
He's bound to be discovered some day.
- No.

1203
02:24:21,452 --> 02:24:24,683
I'll take Jadoo away
to some other town.

1204
02:24:25,556 --> 02:24:27,684
Once the police start
looking for him...

1205
02:24:27,892 --> 02:24:31,692
you won't be able to hide Jadoo
anywhere in the world.

1206
02:24:32,063 --> 02:24:33,189
So what are we to do, Ma?

1207
02:24:35,266 --> 02:24:38,861
There's only one way of
saving his life, Rohit.

1208
02:24:40,938 --> 02:24:46,707
Send him back to where
he has come from.

1209
02:24:46,911 --> 02:24:50,040
No, Ma! No one can
separate Jadoo from me.

1210
02:24:51,082 --> 02:24:54,052
As long as I live, no one can
even touch him.

1211
02:24:54,252 --> 02:24:58,553
Rohit, auntie is right.

1212
02:24:59,757 --> 02:25:02,385
You can't take on the world
on your own.

1213
02:25:06,431 --> 02:25:09,560
Jadoo will not go.

1214
02:25:18,509 --> 02:25:22,070
Everyone's going to feel sad
at the paﬂing, Jadoo.

1215
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:26,581
But it's in your interests to return.

1216
02:25:27,785 --> 02:25:33,588
If Jadoo goes...
all powers will also go away.

1217
02:25:39,797 --> 02:25:40,593
What does that mean?

1218
02:25:45,536 --> 02:25:46,594
It means...

1219
02:25:46,804 --> 02:25:53,267
all the powers that he has given me
will go away with him.

1220
02:26:15,166 --> 02:26:16,292
Don't worry about me, Jadoo.

1221
02:26:17,568 --> 02:26:21,471
I'll live the way I used to.

1222
02:26:28,679 --> 02:26:36,143
Go, Rohit. Before it's too late.

1223
02:26:43,928 --> 02:26:45,327
We're going to miss you, Jadoo.

1224
02:26:58,543 --> 02:26:59,840
What's the matter, Rohit?

1225
02:27:02,046 --> 02:27:03,013
There's no response, Ma.

1226
02:27:10,221 --> 02:27:13,851
We know, the alien from another planet
is with you.

1227
02:27:16,894 --> 02:27:18,862
Hand it over to us.

1228
02:27:25,403 --> 02:27:28,202
We have surrounded your house
from all sides.

1229
02:27:32,076 --> 02:27:36,536
Till the count often, if you do not
turn it over to us...

1230
02:27:37,081 --> 02:27:39,550
we'll launch an attack on your house.

1231
02:27:43,754 --> 02:27:44,721
One.

1232
02:27:47,425 --> 02:27:48,551
Two .

1233
02:27:49,427 --> 02:27:51,054
Jadoo, do something!

1234
02:27:52,597 --> 02:27:53,723
Sunlight.

1235
02:27:53,931 --> 02:27:55,228
Three.

1236
02:27:58,669 --> 02:27:59,898
Four.

1237
02:28:03,608 --> 02:28:04,575
They're responding, Ma!

1238
02:28:08,613 --> 02:28:09,409
Five.

1239
02:28:13,117 --> 02:28:13,913
Six.

1240
02:29:24,188 --> 02:29:28,147
<i>Rah“!</i>

1241
02:29:28,759 --> 02:29:32,662
Rohit, hand it over to us.
- Never!

1242
02:29:32,863 --> 02:29:36,493
Do not compel us! Else, we'll have
to use force against you.

1243
02:29:38,035 --> 02:29:41,665
Do anything you want to!
I'm not handing him over to you!

1244
02:29:41,872 --> 02:29:42,668
Snatch it from him!

1245
02:29:58,222 --> 02:29:59,348
Leave my son alone!

1246
02:30:07,064 --> 02:30:07,860
Leave him.

1247
02:31:51,735 --> 02:31:54,204
Khan speaking.
We shall be there very soon.

1248
02:31:58,976 --> 02:32:03,573
I will not let Jadoo go.
I will not, let Jadoo go.

1249
02:32:06,517 --> 02:32:08,485
Ma, where's Jadoo?

1250
02:32:09,019 --> 02:32:10,817
They've taken him away.

1251
02:32:11,021 --> 02:32:12,648
Where to? - I'll tell you.

1252
02:32:13,524 --> 02:32:14,821
Yes, me.

1253
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:18,488
I have never seen so much
love for a friend.

1254
02:32:19,363 --> 02:32:21,832
They're taking your friend to Delhi,
and from there to America.

1255
02:32:23,033 --> 02:32:29,666
Rohit, this is the time
to repay Jadods favours.

1256
02:32:29,874 --> 02:32:37,179
Go, save him and prove it that humanity
still exists in the world.

1257
02:32:37,948 --> 02:32:39,416
Go Rohit.

1258
02:35:08,532 --> 02:35:09,829
Hurry up! Follow him!

1259
02:35:26,050 --> 02:35:26,846
YOU people?

1260
02:35:29,053 --> 02:35:29,849
Jadoo?

1261
02:35:36,060 --> 02:35:36,856
Go fast, man.

1262
02:35:43,067 --> 02:35:43,693
C'mon!

1263
02:36:10,594 --> 02:36:13,222
You? Where's Rohit?

1264
02:36:13,430 --> 02:36:16,730
You won't find him.

1265
02:38:26,296 --> 02:38:30,358
Go, Jadoo.
They're waiting for you.

1266
02:38:57,427 --> 02:39:00,397
Thank you.

1267
02:40:32,689 --> 02:40:35,488
"Rohit Mehra in police custody"

1268
02:40:37,861 --> 02:40:39,989
“Special Court to deliver verdict
on Rohit Mehra's fate today“

1269
02:40:47,037 --> 02:40:51,167
This is Zee news correspondent
reporting from Kasauli...

1270
02:40:51,375 --> 02:40:54,504
where the special court yesterday
acquitted Rohit Mehra...

1271
02:40:54,711 --> 02:40:57,681
on the grounds that
he is mentally abnormal...

1272
02:40:57,881 --> 02:41:02,182
and today, the citizens of Kasauli
are felicitating Rohit Mehra...

1273
02:41:02,552 --> 02:41:06,011
for setting a rare example
of humanity and friendship...

1274
02:41:06,223 --> 02:41:11,821
in helping an alien, whom he considered
his friend, go back to his own world.

1275
02:41:12,062 --> 02:41:15,191
Let's all felicitate Rohit Mehra.

1276
02:41:34,084 --> 02:41:37,213
See, auntie? Rohit said
he'd make it big some day.

1277
02:41:37,421 --> 02:41:38,889
And he's become such a big man today.

1278
02:42:10,120 --> 02:42:12,088
I know what you're thinking about.

1279
02:42:14,124 --> 02:42:16,593
Jadoo has taken away the powers
he had given you.

1280
02:42:18,795 --> 02:42:20,593
Not my love.

1281
02:42:26,536 --> 02:42:27,765
You had become one hell of a hero.

1282
02:42:30,307 --> 02:42:31,433
Whafre you looking at?

1283
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:35,267
He's gone, because of whom
you had changed.

1284
02:42:35,479 --> 02:42:37,277
Now kick the ball and show.

1285
02:42:41,151 --> 02:42:42,277
Let's go.

1286
02:42:44,654 --> 02:42:47,783
Yes, yes, take him and make him
wear your bangles.

1287
02:43:03,707 --> 02:43:05,471
Rohit, look! The ball is
flying in the air!

1288
02:43:08,512 --> 02:43:09,479
I can't see.

1289
02:43:19,856 --> 02:43:24,987
Now I can see clearly!

1290
02:43:25,195 --> 02:43:27,163
Looks like Jadoo has given
your powers back to you.

1291
02:43:29,699 --> 02:43:30,325
Look there...

1292
02:43:38,275 --> 02:43:39,970
Thank you, Jadoo.
