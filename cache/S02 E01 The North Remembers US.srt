1
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,386
Well struck. Well struck, dog!

2
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,561
-Did you like that?
-It was well struck, Your Grace.

3
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,271
I already said it was well struck.

4
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,232
Yes, Your Grace.

5
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,909
-Who's next?
-Lothor Brune,

6
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,704
free rider in the service of Lord Baelish.

7
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,457
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

8
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,255
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

9
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,924
Here I am! Here I am!

10
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,683
Sorry, Your Grace.

11
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,060
My deepest apologies.

12
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:10,607
-Are you drunk?
-No. No, Your Grace.

13
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,568
-I had two cups of wine.
-Two cups?

14
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,361
That's not much at all.

15
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,239
Please, have another cup.

16
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,368
-Are you sure, Your Grace?
-Yes. To celebrate my name day.

17
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,454
Have two. Have as much as you like.

18
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,749
I'll be honored, Your Grace.

19
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,669
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

20
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,589
See that he drinks his fill.

21
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,359
You can't.

22
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,694
What did you say?

23
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,739
Did you say I can't?

24
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:04,535
I only meant it would be bad luck
to kill a man on your name day.

25
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,705
What kind of stupid,
peasant superstition--

26
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,831
The girl is right.

27
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:12,126
What a man sows on his name day,
he reaps all year.

28
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,467
Take him away.
I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.

29
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,015
He is a fool, you're so clever to see it.

30
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,977
He'll make a much better fool
than a knight.

31
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,437
He doesn't deserve
the mercy of a quick death.

32
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,192
Did you hear my lady, Ser Dontos?

33
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,696
From this day, you'll be my new fool.

34
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,614
Thank you, Your Grace.

35
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,784
And you, my lady, thank you.

36
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,161
Beloved nephew!

37
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,838
We looked for you on the battlefield.

38
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,676
You were nowhere to be found.

39
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,807
-I've been here ruling the kingdoms.
-And what a fine job you've done.

40
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,476
Look at you.

41
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,730
More beautiful than ever.

42
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,523
And you!

43
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:20,028
You're going to be bigger than the Hound,
but much better looking.

44
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,196
This one doesn't like me.

45
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,408
-Can't imagine why.
-We heard you were dead.

46
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,201
I'm glad you're not dead.

47
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,580
Me too, dear. Death is so boring,

48
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,041
especially now with so much
excitement in the world.

49
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,253
My lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

50
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,630
Her loss?

51
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,925
-Her father was a confessed traitor!
-But still her father.

52
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,595
Surely having so recently lost
your own beloved father,

53
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,721
you can sympathize.

54
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:55,313
My father was a traitor.
My mother and brother were traitors, too.

55
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,774
I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

56
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,902
Of course you are.

57
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,366
Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace.

58
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:12,705
I wish I could stay and celebrate,
but there is work to be done.

59
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,706
What work?

60
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,750
Why are you here?

61
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,884
The raven arrived from the Citadel
this morning, Your Grace.

62
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,930
The Conclave has met,
considered the reports

63
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,015
from maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms,

64
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,311
and declared this great summer done...

65
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,774
at last. The longest summer
in living memory.

66
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,028
The peasants say a long summer
means an even longer winter.

67
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,530
A common superstition.

68
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,573
We'll have enough wheat
for a five-year winter.

69
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,492
If it lasts any longer...

70
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,286
we have fewer peasants.

71
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,374
The city's drowning
in refugees, Your Grace. Fleeing the war.

72
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,417
We have nowhere to house them
and with winter coming,

73
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,460
it'll only get worse.

74
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,088
You command the city watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?

75
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,508
I do, Your Grace.

76
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,177
And are you not a lord at my command?

77
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,764
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.

78
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,267
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

79
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,686
They belong in the field, not our capital.

80
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,521
Yes, Your Grace.

81
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,071
Don't get up.

82
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,159
More ravishing than ever, big sister.

83
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,745
War agrees with you.

84
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,624
Forgive the interruption. Carry on.

85
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,419
What are you doing here?

86
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,131
It's been a remarkable journey.

87
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,759
I pissed off the edge of The Wall.

88
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,472
I slept in a sky cell.
I fought with the hill tribes.

89
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,474
So many adventures.

90
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,020
So much to be thankful for.

91
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,107
What are you doing here?
This is the Small Council.

92
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,568
Yes, well I do believe

93
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,362
the Hand of the King is welcome
at all Small Council meetings.

94
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:12,700
-Our father is the Hand of the King.
-Yes, but in his absence...

95
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:25,463
Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve
as Hand in his stead while he fights.

96
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,923
Out! All of you, out!

97
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,473
I would like to know
how you tricked father into this.

98
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:39,310
If I were capable of tricking father,
I'd be emperor of the world by now.

99
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,229
You brought this on yourself.

100
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,982
-I've done nothing.
-Quite right. You did nothing

101
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,276
when your son called for Ned Stark's head.

102
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,487
Now, the entire North
has risen up against us.

103
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,906
-I tried to stop it.
-Did you? You failed.

104
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,117
That bit of theater will haunt
our family for a generation.

105
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,996
-Robb Stark is a child.
-Who's won every battle he's fought.

106
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,291
Do you understand we're losing the war?

107
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,210
-What do you know about warfare?
-Nothing.

108
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,839
But I know people and I know
that our enemies hate each other,

109
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,633
almost as much as they hate us.

110
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,599
-Joffrey is King.
-Joffrey is King.

111
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,728
-You are here to advise him.
-I'm only here to advise him.

112
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,564
And if the King listens to what I say,

113
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,693
the King might just get
his Uncle Jaime back.

114
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,322
-How?
-You love your children.

115
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,492
It's your one redeeming quality.
That, and your cheekbones.

116
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,121
Stark's love their children as well...

117
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,416
-and we have two of them.
-One.

118
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,003
-One?
-Arya.

119
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,923
-That little animal. She disappeared.
-Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?

120
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,095
We had three Starks to trade.

121
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,348
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

122
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,434
Father will be furious.

123
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,812
Must be hard for you...

124
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,066
to be the disappointing child.

125
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,953
My Lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother

126
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,205
and all our northern sons.

127
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,460
The walls of my holdfast
will not stand the winter.

128
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,464
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys

129
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,050
and I'm afraid the masons today

130
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,844
are not fit to carry
their fathers' hammers.

131
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,016
When I was a boy, I remember
seeing them put up a new tower

132
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:46,479
at Torrhen's Square in a summer.
Men worked back then.

133
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,442
Today, my holdfast looks like
it was built by drunk children.

134
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,447
At night, you could hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

135
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,158
Gods forbid it rains.

136
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,827
Why, I might as well sleep
beneath her waterfall.

137
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,163
Maintenance of a holdfast

138
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,624
generally falls
to the lord of that holdfast.

139
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,336
Well, generally, yes,
but I've sent all the young men off

140
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,507
-to fight Robb Stark's war.
-King Robb. And it's not his war.

141
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,759
He didn't choose it.

142
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,805
Maybe not, my Lord, but he called in
his banners and took the men.

143
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,139
Joffrey killed my father.

144
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,266
Your liege lord.

145
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,061
Do you remember your vows, ser?

146
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,563
Of course I remember.

147
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,316
We can spare formations
for a week, my Lord.

148
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,819
Will that be sufficient
to repair your walls?

149
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,405
I believe it will.

150
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,454
We didn't want him here all day, did we?

151
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,458
I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.

152
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,752
Nor did I.

153
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,800
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

154
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,719
is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.

155
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,183
Lord Portan.

156
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:11,272
My Lord, may the old gods watch over
your brother and all the northern sons.

157
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,824
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.

158
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,827
It makes all your pain go away.

159
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,165
-I don't have any pain.
-Lucky for you.

160
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,001
That way.

161
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,423
You've been having those dreams again.

162
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,801
-I don't dream.
-Everyone dreams.

163
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,595
I don't.

164
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,098
I heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

165
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,059
They said it's an omen.

166
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,312
They say it means Robb will win
a great victory in the south.

167
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:34,980
Did they?

168
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,611
I heard some other fools say
it's Lannister red.

169
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,989
Means the Lannisters will rule
all Seven Kingdoms before long.

170
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,368
I heard a stableboy say
it's the color of blood

171
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,411
to mark the death of your father.

172
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,252
The stars don't fall for men.

173
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,380
The red comet means one thing, boy.

174
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,675
Dragons.

175
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,886
Dragons are all dead.

176
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,681
They've been dead for centuries.

177
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,477
What did your brother say
about them, Khaleesi?

178
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,356
-He said they ate meat.
-He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

179
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,360
My brother didn't know anything
about dragons.

180
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,447
He didn't know anything about anything.

181
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,329
Here.

182
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,941
She was Drogo's first gift to me.

183
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,444
I remember.

184
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,199
I promised to protect them.

185
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,243
I promised them
their enemies would die screaming.

186
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,953
How do I make starvation scream?

187
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:57,790
A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

188
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,710
Does it ever end?

189
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,215
It's further east
than I've ever been, but yes, Khaleesi.

190
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,802
-Everything ends, even the Red Waste.
-You're sure there's no other way?

191
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,888
If we go south
to the land of the Lazarheen,

192
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,599
the Lamb Men will kill us
and take your dragons.

193
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,393
If we go west to the Dothraki Sea,

194
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:21,188
the first khalasar we meet
will kill us and take your dragons.

195
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,315
No one will take my dragons.

196
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,193
They are too weak to fight.

197
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,071
As are your people.

198
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,365
You must be their strength.

199
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,076
As you are mine.

200
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:39,915
Zhey qoy qóyi.

201
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,031
It will be done. Let's go.

202
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,417
Rakaro.

203
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,635
You never have.

204
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,186
This is a bad time to start.

205
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,496
-Having a rough time of it?
-Nothing's killed me yet.

206
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,415
-Your ass killed the sledge.
-You offered me a ride.

207
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,668
Just wanted you to shut up
about your damn blisters.

208
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,309
I was born in a place like this.

209
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,729
Later, I fell on hard times.

210
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,358
Are those girls?

211
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,402
Craster's daughters.

212
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,864
I haven't seen a girl in six months.

213
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,825
I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

214
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,744
What, he don't like people
messing with his daughters?

215
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,205
He don't like people
messing with his wives.

216
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,503
He marries his daughters
and they give him more daughters,

217
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,380
and on and on it goes.

218
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,550
-That's foul.
-That's beyond foul.

219
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,303
All the other wildlings
for a hundred leagues disappeared.

220
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,722
Craster's still here.

221
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,308
He must be doing something right.

222
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,061
What happens to the boys?

223
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,189
He marries his daughters.

224
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,692
What does he do with his sons?

225
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,657
He said he planned to stop here
on his way to the Frostfangs.

226
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,868
People make all sorts of plans.

227
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,079
I haven't seen Benjen Stark
in three years.

228
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,666
Haven't missed him.
Always treated me like scum.

229
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,046
Haven't had any good wine for a long time.

230
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,256
You southerners make good wine.

231
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,300
-I'll give you that.
-We're not southerners.

232
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,802
Who's this little girl?

233
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,057
You're prettier than half my daughters.

234
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,101
You got a nice, wet twat
between your legs?

235
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,853
What's your name?

236
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,314
-Jon Snow.
-Snow.

237
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,775
Well listen to me, bastard.

238
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,987
All you lot from south of The Wall,
you're southerners.

239
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,283
But now, you're in the north,
the real north.

240
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,035
The lad meant no harm.

241
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,998
I catch that pretty, little bastard
talking to my daughters--

242
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,460
No one will talk to your daughters.
You have my word.

243
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,964
Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

244
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,387
-You bring any of that good wine with you?
-We did.

245
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,932
We passed through six villages
on the way here.

246
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,017
All six were abandoned.

247
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:14,231
-Where have all the wildlings gone?
-I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

248
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,527
There's a barrel of Dornish wine
on the sledge. Bring it in here.

249
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:19,987
Yes, commander.

250
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,991
You want to know
where they've all gone? North.

251
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,119
Join up with Mance Rayder.

252
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,163
Your old friend.

253
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,582
He's no friend of mine.

254
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,545
He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.

255
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,257
Oh, aye. But once,
he was just a poor, black crow.

256
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,135
And now, he's the King Beyond The Wall.

257
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,096
He's been calling himself that for years.

258
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,516
What's he a king of?
A frozen lake somewhere?

259
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,771
That's a good looking axe. Fresh forged?

260
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:58,942
Give it here.

261
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,071
You can have another one
made back at the Castle Black. Here.

262
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:07,868
That's some lovely steel.

263
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,291
You want to know
what Mance Rayder is doing?

264
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,668
Gathering an army.

265
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:21,006
What I hear, he's already got more men
than any of your southern kings.

266
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,759
And where does he plan
on marching his army?

267
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,220
When you're all the way north,
there's only one direction to go.

268
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,268
These are bad times
to be living alone in the wild.

269
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,979
The cold winds are rising.

270
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,400
Let them come. My roots are sunk deep.

271
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,612
Wife...

272
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:48,325
tell the Lord Crow how content we are.

273
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,913
This is our place.
Our husband keeps us safe.

274
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,290
Better to live free than to die a slave.

275
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,670
Don't it make you jealous, old man?

276
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,384
To see me with all these young wives,
and you with no one to warm your bed?

277
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,805
-We've chosen different paths.
-Oh, aye.

278
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,849
And you've chosen the path
with no one but boys on it.

279
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,938
You'll be wanting
to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose,

280
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:21,775
-and eat me out of pigs.
-Your roof would be a welcome.

281
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,485
It's been hard riding.

282
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,613
We've brought our own food,
and we've got good steel for you.

283
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,619
If any man lays a hand
on one of my wives,

284
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,996
he loses the hand.

285
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:43,130
And I see this one staring too long,
I might just gouge his eyes out.

286
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,967
Your roof, your rules.

287
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,773
Who am I?

288
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,276
Who am I?

289
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,612
-Lord Commander.
-And who are you?

290
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,949
-Jon Snow.
-Who are you?

291
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,037
-Your steward.
-You want to lead one day?

292
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,334
Well, learn how to follow.

293
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,273
Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness.

294
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:50,488
We offer you these false gods.
Take them and cast your light upon us.

295
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,911
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

296
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,956
The night is dark and full of terrors.

297
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:07,047
After the long summer,
darkness will fall heavy on the world.

298
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,174
Stars will bleed.

299
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,427
We need to stop her.

300
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,431
The cold breath of winter
will freeze the seas.

301
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,101
-Not now.
-And the dead shall rise in the north.

302
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,565
All you men were named
in the light of the Seven.

303
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,277
Is this how you treat
the gods of your fathers?

304
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:33,615
Are you so eager
to spit on your ancestors?

305
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,209
You smell of fear.

306
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,797
Fear and piss and old bones.

307
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,925
Do you want to stop me?

308
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:57,931
Stop me.

309
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,698
In the ancient books,
it's written that a warrior will draw

310
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,574
a burning sword from the fire.

311
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,787
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.

312
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,420
Stannis Baratheon...

313
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,506
Warrior of Light.

314
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:33,883
Your sword awaits you.

315
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,709
Lord cast your light upon us!

316
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,756
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

317
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,428
For the night is dark and full of terror.

318
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,876
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

319
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,960
Stannis is our king.

320
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,631
We follow where he leads,
even if we don't like the path.

321
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:59,886
King. Since that boar killed his brother,
every lord wants a coronation.

322
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,263
I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.

323
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:07,811
As do I, but loyal service
means telling hard truths.

324
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,398
He's surrounded by fools and fanatics.

325
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,943
But he trusts you, Davos.

326
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,821
If you tell him the truth...

327
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,533
What's the truth?

328
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,673
"And I declare upon the honor of my house

329
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,384
-that my beloved brother, Robert, left--"
-He wasn't my beloved brother.

330
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,594
I didn't love him.

331
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,889
-He didn't love me.
-A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.

332
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,015
A lie. Take it out.

333
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,396
"That my brother, Robert,
left no trueborn heirs.

334
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,274
The boy, Joffrey, the boy, Tommen,
and the girl, Myrcella,

335
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,776
being born of incest
between Cersei Lannister

336
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,403
and her brother, Jaime Lannister.

337
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,614
-By right of birth--"
-Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

338
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,657
Call him what he is.

339
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,078
"And her brother,
Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

340
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,999
By right of birth and blood,
I do this day lay claim--"

341
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,209
Make it Ser Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer.

342
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,545
Whatever else he is,
the man is still a knight.

343
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:20,091
"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
By right of birth and blood,

344
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,219
I do this day lay claim
to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

345
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,930
Let all true men declare their loyalty."

346
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,017
When Eddard Stark learned
the truth, he told only me.

347
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,101
I will not make the same mistake.

348
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,606
Send copies of that letter to every corner
of the realm, from the Arbor to The Wall.

349
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,983
The time has come to choose.

350
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,987
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

351
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,531
Your Grace, the Lannisters
are the true enemy.

352
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,575
If, for the time being, you could
make peace with your brother--

353
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,827
I will not make peace with Renly
while he calls himself King.

354
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,414
But many have already declared for him.
There's Tyrell, Ronald Tarly.

355
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:55,293
Stannis does not need to beg
this lord or that lord for support.

356
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,836
The Lord of Light stands behind him.

357
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,631
And how many ships
has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

358
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,300
-He has no need for ships.
-I'm sure he doesn't,

359
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,093
but we do if we're going to war.

360
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,347
If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

361
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,474
Who'd steal
the northern half of my kingdom.

362
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:11,601
I have always served thieves
according to their deserts,

363
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:12,769
as you well know, Ser Davos.

364
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,563
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark,
they're all thieves.

365
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,982
They'll bend the knee,
or I'll destroy them.

366
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,362
I owe you an apology, my King.

367
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,031
My duty is to serve.

368
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:29,118
You have chosen
the new god over the old gods.

369
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,288
May the Lord of Light watch over us all.

370
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,376
-Shall we drink together?
-Don't.

371
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:41,464
A cup of wine to honor the one true god.

372
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,055
The night is dark and full
of terrors, old man.

373
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,100
But the fire burns them all away.

374
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,512
The King of the North.

375
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,186
I keep expecting you to leave me
in one castle or another for safe keeping,

376
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,938
but you drag me along from camp to camp.

377
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,860
Have you grown fond of me, Stark?
Is that it?

378
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,446
I've never seen you with a girl.

379
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,783
If I left you with one of my bannerman,

380
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,452
your father would know
within the fortnight.

381
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:38,331
My bannerman would receive
a raven with a message,

382
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,543
"Release my son.
You'll be rich beyond your dreams.

383
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,713
Refuse, and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

384
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:50,259
You don't trust the loyalty
of the men following you to battle?

385
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,387
I trust them with my life.

386
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,308
-Just not with yours.
-Smart boy.

387
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,688
What's wrong?
Don't like being called a boy?

388
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,898
Insulted?

389
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,991
You insult yourself, Kingslayer.

390
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,454
You've been defeated by a boy.

391
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,208
You're held captive by a boy.

392
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,838
Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.

393
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:37,348
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens
to all the high lords of Westeros.

394
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:44,188
King Joffrey Baratheon is neither
a true king, nor a true Baratheon.

395
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,400
He's your bastard son.

396
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,111
If that's true,
Stannis is the rightful king.

397
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,362
How convenient for him.

398
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,031
My father...

399
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,244
learned the truth.
That's why you had him executed.

400
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,872
I was your prisoner
when Ned Stark lost his head.

401
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:05,126
Your son killed him so the world
wouldn't know who fathered him, and you...

402
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,006
you pushed my brother from a window
because he saw you with the Queen.

403
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,387
You have proof?

404
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,892
Do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fish wives?

405
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,353
I'm sending one of your cousins down
to King's Landing with my peace terms.

406
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,981
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

407
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,985
-You don't know him very well.
-No.

408
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,613
But he's starting to know me.

409
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,700
Three victories
don't make you a conqueror.

410
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,496
It's better than three defeats.

411
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,193
This city stinks.

412
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,367
-Like dead bodies.
-A bit corpsey, yes.

413
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:23,454
-And shit.
-I thought you wanted to come here?

414
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,709
I love it.

415
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,296
You love the smell
of dead bodies and shit?

416
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:36,342
And cum and garlic and rum.

417
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,427
You can smell cum from the balcony?

418
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,557
I love the stink. I love the noise.

419
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,017
Cities make me want to fuck.

420
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,104
And so did the country.

421
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,570
-This is where I belong.
-Yes, well, you need to be careful.

422
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,865
-No one can know you're here.
-No one will know.

423
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,159
You can't trust anyone in King's Landing.
They're all liars.

424
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,997
Good liars, bad liars.
One or two great liars.

425
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,750
-What about you?
-Me? I'm not from here.

426
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,460
I'm a slave to the truth.

427
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,839
Truth?

428
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,634
You're the biggest
little liar I have ever met.

429
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,053
Why do you think I am so little?

430
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:25,266
I'm being crushed beneath
the weight of all that truth.

431
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,648
Ned Stark actually slept on this.

432
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,860
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

433
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,240
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

434
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,337
Lord Baelish.

435
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,925
-Your Grace.
-I wonder if I might ask you for a favor?

436
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,760
Of course, Your Grace.

437
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:04,347
Ned Stark's youngest daughter, Arya.
We can't seem to locate her.

438
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:09,602
If she's escaped the capital,
Winterfell seems the logical destination.

439
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,938
And yet my friends in the north
report no sign of her.

440
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,522
Curious.

441
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,860
If we choose to negotiate
with the Starks, the girl has some value.

442
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,320
Whoever finds her, well,
you know what they say

443
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:23,032
-about the Lannisters and debts.
-Well, you could ask Varys where she is.

444
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:26,786
He'll have an answer for you,
whether you believe it.

445
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,164
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

446
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,333
Who knows what they want?

447
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,127
A mockingbird.

448
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,173
-You created your own sigil, didn't you?
-Yes.

449
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,053
Appropriate. For a self-made man
with so many songs to sing.

450
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,513
I'm glad you like it.

451
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,517
Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.

452
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,894
Others have to find their own way.

453
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:57,733
I heard a song once
about a boy of modest means.

454
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,278
He found his way into the home
of a very prominent family.

455
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:06,325
He loved the eldest daughter.
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

456
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,622
When boys and girls live in the same home,
awkward situations can arise.

457
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,961
Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers
and sisters develop certain affections.

458
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,922
And when those affections
become common knowledge,

459
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,676
well, that is an awkward situation indeed.

460
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,636
Especially in a prominent family.

461
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,764
Prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

462
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,850
I found.

463
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,686
And which truth is that?

464
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,731
Knowledge is power.

465
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,235
Seize him.

466
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,698
Cut his throat.

467
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,035
Stop. Wait.

468
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,038
I've changed my mind. Let him go.

469
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:56,584
Step back three paces.

470
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,670
Turn around.

471
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,048
Close your eyes.

472
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,637
Power is power.

473
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:14,268
Do see if you could take some time
away from your coins and your whores

474
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:18,439
to locate the Stark girl for me.
I would very much appreciate it.

475
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,452
You are Ser Alton Lannister?

476
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:33,913
I am, Your Grace.

477
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,792
I offer your cousins peace
if they meet my terms.

478
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:42,046
First, your family
must release my sisters.

479
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:46,967
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us so he may rest

480
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,887
beside his brother and sister
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

481
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,308
And the remains of all those who died
in the service must also be returned.

482
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,770
Their families can honor them
with proper funerals.

483
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,481
-An honorable request, Your Grace.
-Third.

484
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,068
Joffrey and the Queen Regent

485
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,362
must renounce all claim
to dominion of the North.

486
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:12,034
From this time to the end of time,
we are a free and independent kingdom.

487
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,120
The King in the North.

488
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,664
-King in the North.
-King in the North.

489
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,501
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.

490
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,795
If he disregards this command,

491
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,548
then he shall suffer
the same fate as my father.

492
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,633
Only...

493
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,011
I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

494
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,471
These are, Your Grace...

495
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,474
-these are--
-These are my terms.

496
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,896
If the Queen Regent and her son
meet them, I'll give them peace. If not...

497
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,359
I will litter the South
with Lannister dirt.

498
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,280
-King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.
-Is he?

499
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,325
You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

500
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,870
That will be all for tonight.

501
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,429
A word, Your Grace?

502
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,601
You don't have to call me
"Your Grace" when no one's around.

503
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,478
It's not so bad, once you get used to it.

504
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,772
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

505
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,026
The Lannisters are going to reject
your terms, you know?

506
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,110
Of course they are.

507
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,654
You can fight them in the fields
as long as you like.

508
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,490
We won't beat them
until you take King's Landing.

509
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,537
We can't take King's Landing
without ships.

510
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,291
My father has ships and men
who know how to sail them.

511
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,876
Men who fought my father.

512
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,378
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

513
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,340
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

514
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,052
I'm his only living son.

515
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,181
He'll listen to me. I know he will.

516
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,936
I'm not a Stark. I know that.

517
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,190
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

518
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,818
We can avenge him together.

519
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:17,326
-You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
-I need his ships. They say he has 200.

520
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:21,080
They say a million rats live
in the sewers of King's Landing.

521
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,831
Shall we rally them to fight for us?

522
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,708
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.

523
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:28,128
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.

524
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,049
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

525
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:35,386
Yes. And now, I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

526
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,513
And before me, it was Father.

527
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,099
You married one rebel
and mothered another.

528
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,268
I mothered more than just rebels.

529
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,853
A fact you seem to have forgotten.

530
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:49,692
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls,
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

531
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:53,696
You want to leave Sansa
in the Queen's hands? And Arya?

532
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,824
I haven't heard a word about Arya.

533
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,952
What are we fighting for if not for them?

534
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,121
It's more complicated than that!
You know it is!

535
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,555
It's time for me to go home.

536
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,934
I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.

537
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,104
You can't go to Winterfell.

538
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,401
-I beg your pardon?
-I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys.

539
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:37,156
Because tomorrow,
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

540
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:40,284
Why in the name
of all the gods would you--

541
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,786
Because I need you to negotiate
with Renly Baratheon.

542
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,083
Now, he's rallied an army of 100,000.
You know him. You know his family.

543
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,377
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

544
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,754
You have a hundred other lords--

545
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,048
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

546
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,426
If Renly sides with us...

547
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,137
we'll outnumber them two to one.

548
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,849
When they feel the jaws
beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace.

549
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,643
We'll get the girls back.

550
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,563
And we'll all go home, for good.

551
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,074
I will ride at first light.

552
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,877
We will all be together
again soon, I promise.

553
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,426
You've done so well.

554
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,264
Your father would be proud.

555
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,651
-Give Lord Renly my regards.
-King Renly.

556
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,405
There's a king in every corner now.

557
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,545
What is all this?

558
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,923
Turning this room
to its proper appearance.

559
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,968
Say what you will about the Targaryens.
They were conquerors.

560
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,387
That is a seat for a conqueror.

561
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,932
I need a room to match it.
Not vines and flowers.

562
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,351
We can't find Arya Stark.

563
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,187
Well, with luck,
she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

564
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,647
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

565
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,608
They'll never give Jaime
back to us for Sansa alone.

566
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,610
I think they might. They're weak.

567
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,863
They put too much value on their women.

568
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,950
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

569
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,535
Send out as many men as we can.

570
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,289
-I'm sure if you asked grandfather--
-A king does not ask.

571
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,790
He commands.

572
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,544
My grandfather's stupidity
in the field of battle

573
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:58,172
is the reason Robb Stark
has Uncle Jaime in the first place.

574
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,174
His life is in danger.

575
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,553
We're at war. All our lives are in danger.

576
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,018
I heard a disgusting lie
about Uncle Jaime.

577
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:13,937
And you.

578
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,317
Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.

579
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,861
It's not a claim. The throne is mine.

580
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:23,864
Of course it is.

581
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,952
-No one believes this fowl gossip.
-Someone believes it.

582
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:33,290
Father had other children?

583
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,376
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

584
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,672
What are you asking?

585
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,676
I'm asking if he fucked other women
when he grew tired of you?

586
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,470
How many bastards does he have running--

587
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,570
What you just did...

588
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:05,989
is punishable by death.

589
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,161
You will never do it again.

590
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,039
Never.

591
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:21,922
That will be all, Mother.

592
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,265
No, no, no, no.

593
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,976
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

594
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,397
Ease into it, slowly, with passion.

595
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,362
Go wash yourselves.

596
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,532
Put some clothes on.
Both of you are working tonight.

597
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,247
We do things differently here, Daisy.

598
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:59,251
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Halls.

599
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,169
-Haystack Hall.
-Wherever you're from.

600
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:05,382
Our establishment doesn't cater
to ploughmen and goat herders.

601
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:07,634
Lord Olsen.

602
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:12,264
-Taste is everything here.
-Littlefinger's a fancy man.

603
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:15,017
Don't call him Littlefinger.
He doesn't like it.

604
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,977
Lord Baelish.

605
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,694
She pretends she doesn't speak
the common tongue

606
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,487
so that people will think she's exotic.

607
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,616
She grew up just down
the road in Flea Bottom.

608
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,201
She's beautiful.

609
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:37,205
She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.

610
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:43,629
Lord Commander.

611
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,757
Good to see you again.

612
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:05,359
You do realize this establishment
is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish?

613
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,656
The King's Master of Coin.
Coin which goes in many pockets.

614
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,991
-Orders.
-Who's orders?

615
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,744
Someone who doesn't care
what Littlefinger thinks.

616
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,932
No! You can't! No! Please!

617
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:43,772
-No! Not my Barra! Please, please!
-Enough. Get it done!

618
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,150
-Kill the bastard!
-No, no! Please!

619
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,487
-Give it here.
-No! Please!

620
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:05,293
-Spread out. Search every house.
-Every room. Look in every room.

621
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:34,322
-Gendry! His name is Gendry!
-Where is the bastard?

622
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:38,076
-The Night's Watch! Please, stop!
-Where?

623
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,788
They took him over
to King's Road! Heading north!

624
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,624
-How will we know him?
-He's got a bull's head helmet!

625
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,170
-He made it himself!
-Find him.
