1
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:08,759
This is a fucking mess, son,
but don't you worry.

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,304
Daddy's home.

3
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,061
What's up, shit birds?

4
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,606
You have five minutes
to make your opening st...

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,108
You guys fucking ready?

6
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,609
<i>So...</i>

7
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:27,820
<i>Noir's a vegetable.</i>

8
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:28,946
And you didn't do this.

9
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:32,241
Look, there was no terrorist.

10
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,993
<i>It was Vought.
It's a fucking coup.</i>

11
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,828
<i>Victoria Neuman's making a team</i>

12
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,747
that can keep tabs on the Supes.

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,665
If you're interested.

14
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:40,875
I still want to fight Vought.

15
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:43,252
I just... I want
to do it the right way.

16
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,171
Not covered in
quite as many guts.

17
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,674
- Maeve!
- I'm sorry.

18
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,469
You're gonna leave me
and Elena alone.

19
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,346
<i>You're gonna stop
hunting Starlight,</i>

20
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,724
- or I release this.
- Becca's alive.

21
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,477
<i>She had a little boy, Ryan,
spitting image of Homelander.</i>

22
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,189
I do not want my son
to have to go

23
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,440
<i>through what I went through.</i>

24
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:05,775
Ryan, no!

25
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:08,068
Promise me that you will
save him no matter what

26
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:09,695
and you will get him back to me.

27
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,282
<i>People love what I have to say.</i>

28
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,825
<i>They believe in it.</i>

29
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,827
They just don't like
the word "Nazi."

30
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:18,454
<i>That's all.</i>

31
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,540
Becca!

32
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,543
Where... is my son?!

33
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,423
Storm front.

34
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,300
I knew you'd be here.

35
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,562
How could you do this?

36
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,024
I loved you.

37
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,360
You'll always be in my heart.

38
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,489
But the Fourth Reich is
in my soul.

39
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,827
Join me,
and we can reign together

40
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,371
for a thousand years.

41
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,290
- Never.
- You and I are the same.

42
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,835
Perfect genetic specimens.

43
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,629
Think of how beautiful
our children could be.

44
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:53,382
They would be
the best of both of us.

45
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:59,305
Flawless Aryan <i>Kindersoldaten.</i>

46
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,307
No.

47
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,726
They'd be monsters.

48
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,895
Like you.

49
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,355
Your choice, <i>Liebchen.</i>

50
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,651
But not even you
could stop me alone.

51
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,945
He's not alone.

52
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,038
What?

53
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,956
Can't let you guys have
all the fun.

54
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,254
Guess this means
we're breaking up.

55
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,633
Nazi bitch.

56
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,933
Die, <i>Untermensch.</i>

57
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,442
<i>Grab the flash drive!</i>

58
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,152
<i>She's too strong!</i>

59
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,695
<i>How can we beat her?</i>

60
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:58,447
<i>As a team.</i>

61
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,346
Homelander!

62
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,847
Over here. This way.

63
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,517
Maeve,
right here. Look to your right.

64
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,646
Maeve!
To your left! Left!

65
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,107
Maeve, over here!

66
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,566
Here with Adam Bourke,

67
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,568
- the director of <i>Dawn of The Seven.</i>
- Yes.

68
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,862
- That's right.
- It seems like all those reshoots paid off, my friend.

69
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,280
Right, well,
after the, you know,

70
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,741
"Stormfront's a Nazi" thing,
we had real talks about

71
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,494
shelving the movie or just
dumping it on Vought Plus.

72
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,413
But, uh, the fans spoke
with those

73
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,789
"Release the Bourke Cut"
hashtags.

74
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,124
You guys, I love you!

75
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,334
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

76
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:55,045
- How do I... look?
- You look perfect.

77
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,882
Okay.

78
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,467
Oh!
Starlight, Starlight!

79
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,345
- Starlight!
- Starlight, to the right, to the right!

80
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,181
Starlight, over here!

81
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,892
Starlight, this way!
Starlight, look this way!

82
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,687
Singles, please.
Singles, please.

83
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,147
- Starlight!
- One second.

84
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,315
- Move over, other guy!
- Okay.

85
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,610
No, no, no. Over here.
Singles, please.

86
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,487
Over here, to the left!
To the left!

87
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,156
Just a couple more shots!

88
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,326
It's quite the star
you've got there.

89
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,329
And thanks to Congresswoman
Neuman for joining us tonight.

90
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,041
I hope it demonstrates
Vought welcomes the oversight

91
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,168
from the Bureau
of Superhuman Affairs.

92
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,463
We've been able to root out
a few bad apples together.

93
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,048
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

94
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,091
If I could just steal him away.

95
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,718
Do me a favor and kill me.

96
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,636
- Only if it's murder-suicide.
- Okay.

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,430
Nadia! Nadia!

98
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,974
Hey! Nadia!

99
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,102
- Another picture, please.
- Hey, Nadia!

100
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,854
A-Train, it's been over a year
since you've raced.

101
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,856
When are we gonna see you
on the track again?

102
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,232
Real soon.

103
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:59,359
You know, but we had reshoots,
I've been training.

104
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,694
But that race is coming,

105
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,738
full speed ahead
for the A-Train.

106
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,948
But it's been over a year,
and the people are wondering...

107
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,408
Only questions about the movie.

108
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,243
- Thank you so much.
- Okay, thank you.

109
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,996
- Um, we have Black Noir here for you.
- Black Noir.

110
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,790
Hughie, my man.

111
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,625
I love the big dick energy, bro.

112
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,835
- Who you wearing?
- A-Train, right here!

113
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,045
I have no idea.

114
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,130
Good. I didn't give a fuck.

115
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,632
Guys!

116
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,176
Pic!

117
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,386
Who'd have thought, after
everything we've been through,

118
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,680
- that we'd be here together?
- Okay, one more time.

119
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:29,932
Right in the camera.

120
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,059
Yeah.

121
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,144
Who'd have thought?

122
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,230
How could you not know all along

123
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,607
that Storm front was a Nazi?

124
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,902
Well, I am just a man
who fell for the wrong woman.

125
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,403
- Uh, but, uh...
- Fell for the wrong woman.

126
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:44,905
But out of crisis comes change.

127
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,367
- Out of crisis comes change.
- So I spent the last year

128
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,328
really slowing down
and reconnecting with myself.

129
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,540
And I am very excited for
everyone to meet the real me.

130
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,877
You shitty fucking director!

131
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,629
Tony Gilroy had
to reshoot all your shit!

132
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,422
I know I'm a fraud, babe!
I'm a fraud!

133
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:03,882
- Oh, fuck!
- Pull my hair!

134
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,342
- Fuck yeah!
- Yeah, pull my hair!

135
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,468
- Yeah, I'm pulling it, baby!
- No, pull it out!

136
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,636
Yeah, yeah!

137
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,352
Mr. Campbell.

138
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,688
Uh...

139
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,441
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

140
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,917
Jesus Christ!

141
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,670
Not quite.

142
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,548
You look sharp.

143
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,925
French blue.

144
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,927
That suits you.

145
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,929
What are you doing here?

146
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:53,682
I found that little asshole
we've been on all month.

147
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,268
He's having a knees-up
at a penthouse tonight.

148
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,811
Okay. Who's your source?

149
00:07:57,895 --> 00:08:00,898
My source is
none of your fucking business.

150
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,983
Look, me and the Boys,
we're all set up.

151
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,402
We just need you to, uh...

152
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,112
give us a green light.

153
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,697
Okay.

154
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,157
Um, I'll talk to Neuman.

155
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,118
Or you could take
your tongue out of her ass,

156
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:16,413
slap on your big-boy pants

157
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,373
and make a fucking decision.

158
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,046
You got something
you want to say to me?

159
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,215
I think
I just fucking said it, son.

160
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,135
Just photos.

161
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,304
No violence or maiming

162
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,389
or-or-or-or torture

163
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,225

00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,192
She was a clever one.

327
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,112
I had another nightmare.

328
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,157
Same one? Your Dad?

329
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,368
This time, he...

330
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,331
...burns everything down
and then kills me.

331
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,209
One day, you'll be tough enough.

332
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,879
And then he can't hurt you.

333
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,798
But till then,

334
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,466
you're safe here
with the colonel.

335
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,344
Honest.

336
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,226
Connect Four.

337
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,687
Oh, you...

338
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,647
you cheeky little blighter.

339
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,943
You could stay if you want.

340
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,653
Well, that's
a generous offer, Grace,

341
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,197
but I ain't banged
a blue hair since I was a lad.

342
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,283
You know, calling you an asshole
is an insult to assholes.

343
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,247
My point is, Marvin got out.

344
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,791
Maybe there's hope for you, too.

345
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,505
I shouldn't get
too close to him.

346
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,382
I would just fuck it up.

347
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,010
I hear you've been on the
straight and narrow all year.

348
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,512
No drinking, no killing Supes.

349
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,849
You even follow Hugh Campbell's
orders without strangling him.

350
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,809
Now you're just being cruel.

351
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,270
I know you're not doing
all that for yourself.

352
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,481
So then who?

353
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,445
Exactly.

354
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:03,823
That alone makes you a better
man than your father ever was.

355
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,161
Maybe you're not
such an asshole.

356
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,458
Get the kid a fucking burger
now and then, would you?

357
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,640
There he is!

358
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,476
Bro!

359
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,352
Bro, come here.

360
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,937
Hey.

361
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,564
It's great to see you.

362
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,066
Did you just have
the slot before me?

363
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,610
Yeah, I'm just stumping
for my book <i>Deeper.</i>

364
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:41,903
Went awesome.

365
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,780
I sent you a copy.
Did you not get it?

366
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,323
Don't worry, I got,
like, hundreds of them.

367
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,533
I'll send you more. It's about
how me and my wife Cassandra

368
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,827
escaped that fucking cult.

369
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,913
You remember my wife
Cassandra, right?

370
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,833
Oh, did you see that profile
that Malcolm Glad well

371
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,376
did on me in <i>The New Yorker?</i>

372
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,879
He called me "the next
Leah Remini." No big deal.

373
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,215
I mean, my numbers are
going up, Coach.

374
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,800
Put me back in the game.

375
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,635
How?

376
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,931
How did you get
the slot before me?

377
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,308
Uh...

378
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,143
It was a fucked-up mistake.

379
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,437
- That talent booker is so fucking fired.
- I'm asking him.

380
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,272
I'm asking you.

381
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,191
I don't... I, uh...

382
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:23,069
I don't know. I don't know.

383
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,612
But it's...

384
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,531
fucking ridiculous.

385
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,658
I-I should never go before you.

386
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,078
Obviously.
I'm a nobody compared to you.

387
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,287
You want to know a secret?

388
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,705
I didn't even write
the fucking book.

389
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,124
Shia LaBeouf's ghostwriter did.

390
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,169
Uh, it's crazy.

391
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,672
It's stupid. Sorry.

392
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:51,222
That's very sweet of you
to say, Deep.

393
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,060
Good to see you.

394
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,437
You, too, sir.

395
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,150
- Hey.
- Hey.

396
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,985
What was that?

397
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:05,820
I actually think
that went pretty well.

398
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,491
Let's get to the elephant
in the room.

399
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,160
The mainstream media
won't leave it alone.

400
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,245
- Mm.
- How could you not know

401
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,830
that Storm front was a Nazi?

402
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,707
Well, okay.

403
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,792
So let me say it again, Cam.

404
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,377
Um, I may be a superhero,

405
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,503
but I'm also just a man

406
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:23,796
who fell in love
with the wrong woman.

407
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,214
Well, we all know
what that's like.

408
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,465
Right, yeah.

409
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,092
Look, I-I'm not perfect,
Cameron.

410
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,594
Far from it. Uh...

411
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:32,221
I know I'm bulletproof
on the outside.

412
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,640
But in here, this?

413
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,392
It isn't.

414
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,854
I'm just as human
as all the rest of you.

415
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,106
More with Homelander...

416
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,192
after this.

417
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,570
And we're clear!

418
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,869
That sounded really good.

419
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,377
Who's the birthday girl? Hey!

420
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,046
Want to see what I got you?

421
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,632
- Yeah.
- Ooh, you're gonna love this.

422
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,426
Yeah, boy!

423
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,553
- See how it fits.
- All right, all right, all right.

424
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,431
- That looks great.
- Birthday photos.

425
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,892
- Oh, Jackie, can you take this?
- Oh. Sure.

426
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,894
Thank you.

427
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,439
Oh, Todd, Todd! Over here.

428
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,523
Photos!

429
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,359
Photos, photos.

430
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,527
- Okay, with Jackie? Okay.
- You know what?

431
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,489
- It's okay. All right.
- Let's all say, um, "Happy birthday, Janine!"

432
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,866
Happy birthday, Janine!

433
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,412
Oh, silly face, silly face.

434
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,539
Now superhero!
Give us a superhero.

435
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,548
You don't have to do that.

436
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:52,093
- Oh, I don't mind.
- Marvin?

437
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,638
You taking your Lexapro?

438
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,682
I'm fine, Monique.

439
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,768
This is just me helping out
at my daughter's birthday party.

440
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,186
Great party, by the way.

441
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,230
Yeah, she's...

442
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,607
She's having fun.

443
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:09,819
I'm sorry about
all the superhero stuff.

444
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,654
- She insisted, and...
- It's all good.

445
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,698
It's behind me now. I'm over it.

446
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,741
You've seen me
in the last 12 months, right?

447
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:17,827
I'm straight.

448
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,912
It's ancient history.

449
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,999
- I know.
- Hey.

450
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,376
You got a couple of hours
on Friday night?

451
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:29,005
I was thinking maybe we could
meet over at Cafe Delfini's,

452
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,590
have some tilapia, go over
some co-parenting things.

453
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,009
Mm, co-parenting things?

454
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,011
- Yeah.
- Really?

455
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,554
Where we had our first date?

456
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,557
Strictly business.

457
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,685
Scheduling things, like soccer
practice, dance recital...

458
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,854
You got to move on, Marvin.

459
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,732
The way you moved on
with Todd or...

460
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,444
Sorry.

461
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,587
Happy birthday, baby!

462
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:25,186
V24, huh?

463
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,813
Marketing is
still testing the name.

464
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,316
But it's the future, Bob.

465
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,860
One dose of this temporary V

466
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,237
gives a soldier
24 hours of powers.

467
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,781
Give or take.

468
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,367
And then they return
right back to normal.

469
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,701
How stable is it?

470
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:43,162
Still ironing out the kinks.

471
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,247
And if it's temporary,

472
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,959
that means the DoD
has to keep buying doses.

473
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:50,961
At how much a hit?

474
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,838
Two million, roughly.

475
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,341
So over the course
of a month-long operation,

476
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,426
that's 60 million per soldier.

477
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,804
600 million per squad.

478
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:02,932
Campaign going well, is it?

479
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:06,727
I appreciate your contribution
to my super PAC.

480
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,854
People do love
a cowboy in the White House.

481
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,190
I hear they're even
calling you Dakota Bob.

482
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,193
So how would it look
if you pass up

483
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,196
the opportunity to give
our brave soldiers superpowers?

484
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,534
Supes in the Army are
an unmitigated shits how.

485
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:25,496
What Black Noir did
to that Hard Rock Cafe in Lagos?

486
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,082
Should be brought up
on war crimes.

487
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,182
You're right.

488
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,268
I'm sorry?

489
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,186
You are absolutely right.

490
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,523
The problem, of course, was
making the super into heroes.

491
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,358
I don't follow.

492
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,569
Making them figures
to be worshipped.

493
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,320
The fame, the movies,

494
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:01,157
the depraved sex...
it ruined them.

495
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,533
Cone of silence?

496
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,160
In five years, I hope to be out

497
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,619
of the superhero business
entirely.

498
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:07,121
Bullshit.

499
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,664
This should be
a serious company.

500
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,833
A defense
and pharmaceutical company.

501
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,626
Not a day care

502
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,379
dealing with spoiled children
and dead prostitutes.

503
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,006
But the point is,

504
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,175
you won't have to worry
about any of that.

505
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:22,219
Because your soldiers will
only be super...

506
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,805
temporarily.

507
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:26,849
The product...

508
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,185
finally perfected.

509
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,064
Stan...

510
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:36,108
when you say Compound V...

511
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,944
- V24.
- ...do you know what the public hears?

512
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:40,821
Gestapo.

513
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,490
Swastika.

514
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,200
And that's your fault.

515
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:47,328
You used a Nazi to sell it.

516
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,830
Compound V is
radio-fucking-active.

517
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:52,541
It's not gonna fly in Congress.

518
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:56,795
I still have a few strings
that I can pull in Congress.

519
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,090
No, no, no, no, no, no.

520
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,675
Come on, really?

521
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,469
I got good news and bad news.

522
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,096
- What do you want to hear first?
- The, uh, good news.

523
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,806
There's no good news.

524
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,559
Bad news is,
Termite's off the table.

525
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,228
- What?
- Vought just closed

526
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,729
a big endorsement
for him with Terminex.

527
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,814
We've been chasing Termite
for months!

528
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,192
I know, but after Butcher
force-fed him a metric Belushi

529
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,444
of coke, I didn't have
much leverage, did I?

530
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:23,614
It was just a little coke
'cause he was...

531
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,533
- small.
- Anyway...

532
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,910
he's going to the Global
Wellness Retreat in Malibu,

533
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,704
and in return we're getting
Cold Snap, Stacker and Air burst.

534
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,373
Fucking B-listers! Really?

535
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,333
Three B-listers, real assholes.

536
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,085
Cold Snap for domestic battery.

537
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,836
It's not a bad trade.

538
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,799
How much is Supe collateral
down this year?

539
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,886
- Sixty percent.
- Sixty percent.

540
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,763
That's 60% more people at home

541
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,223
with their kids,
and we did that.

542
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:51,433
Hughie, you and I built
this place.

543
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,977
And we did it the right way

544
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,229
without being covered
in blood and guts.

545
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,773
Right?

546
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,776
Y-You're irritating, but...

547
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,195
- but yes.
- Okay.

548
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,739
So, please, just...

549
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:08,033
trust me.

550
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:13,539
<i>You must be having
a fucking laugh.</i>

551
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,583
That little cunt crawled up

552
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,668
a guy's cock
and blew him to bits.

553
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,878
He almost killed Frenchie,
and you're just gonna

554
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,714
let him go
'cause Stan Edgar asked nice?

555
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:25,050
Supe collateral damage
is down 60%.

556
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:28,053
Oh, come off it.
That's that twat Neuman talking.

557
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:29,888
She has locked up
more Supes this year

558
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:31,932
- than every other year combined.
- Then you're a fucking twat.

559
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,726
Hughie, you're working
with Vought!

560
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,478
I'm...

561
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,817
Fuck me. I should've done
Termite when I had the chance.

562
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,361
Look, look, look,
things are good.

563
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,864
We're actually winning.

564
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,783
Winning, are we?

565
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,827
Yeah.

566
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,121
Locking up a couple of nobodies
ain't winning.

567
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,165
They got all the money
and all the power,

568
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,000
and they want us dead.

569
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,668
We're outmanned and outgunned,

570
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,462
and we got to put
them cunts in a box

571
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,130
before they do it to us.

572
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,257
If you would just
compromise a little bit...

573
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:08,135
"Compromise"? Fuck you.
Your whole life's a compromise.

574
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,512
Hey, at least
I have a fucking life!

575
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:13,849
I didn't mean that.

576
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,812
Look. Look.

577
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,731
Can we just stop dancing
around this?

578
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,066
I'm sorry.

579
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,859
I'm sorry that I left.

580
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,903
- You think I give a shite?
- Yeah, I think you do.

581
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,780
I think you're pissed
that M.M. and I both left.

582
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,281
M.M. was a bit of a loss.

583
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:30,741
You not so much.

584
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:36,747
Butcher...

585
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,832
it's been a year.

586
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,211
You can stop all this.

587
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,338
It's okay to stop.

588
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,964
To move on.

589
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,051
She would've wanted you to.

590
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,719
Oi, Stevie fucking Wonder!

591
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,805
Will you knock it off?

592
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,181
You're doing me fucking head in!

593
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,183
Jesus fucking Christ.

594
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,019
Everyone's losing
their fucking minds.

595
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,562
Hey.

596
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,064
Forget it.

597
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,653
Or maybe they're just
trying to be happy.

598
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,537
I thought it sounded great.

599
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:45,065
<i>Homelander and Queen Maeve.</i>

600
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,067
<i>- Oh, my God, they're leaving us!
- Take these two!</i>

601
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,902
<i>- Whoa, no.
- Just these two, please!</i>

602
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,571
<i>No. What?
So they can tell the world</i>

603
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,281
<i>that we left the rest of them
to fucking die?</i>

604
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,741
<i>No. You stay back!</i>

605
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,118
<i>All of you, stay back!</i>

606
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,704
<i>You stay the fuck back,
or I'll laser you, goddamn it!</i>

607
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,330
<i>I'll laser
every fucking one of you!</i>

608
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,546
Excuse me, Starlight.

609
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,339
I need the room.
I got a meeting with Stan.

610
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:10,758
Actually, I invited you both.

611
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,427
Have a seat.

612
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,512
- Great.
- Oh, uh...

613
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,862
I remember when you first
arrived, Starlight.

614
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,947
A farm girl from Kansas.

615
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,617
Bright-eyed like Dorothy in Oz.

616
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,285
Iowa. And not a farm.

617
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,828
Oh, well, look
how far you've come.

618
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:43,123
Polling at 96,
a new Vought record.

619
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:46,043
I don't have to tell you
that our brand has been a bit...

620
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:49,171
tarnished since that
nasty business last year.

621
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,299
But you have restored
a wholesome,

622
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,385
trustworthy image to the company
when we needed it the most.

623
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,806
Which is why
the board wants to make you

624
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:00,891
cocaptain of The Seven.

625
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:01,975
What?

626
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,811
Co...

627
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,312
Cocaptain?

628
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,818
But-but...

629
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:13,946
Homelander is captain.
I mean, you're-you're captain.

630
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,656
This will be
beneficial to you both.

631
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,492
Your numbers are down,
what, uh, double digits?

632
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,119
The public still associates you
with Storm front.

633
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:23,539
This would be a real bump.

634
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,583
A rising tide lifts all boats.

635
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,877
That's very thoughtful
of you, Stan.

636
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,337
Um...

637
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,591
- When does the board vote?
- They already did this morning.

638
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,844
All that's left is for
Starlight to say yes.

639
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,848
No. I mean, I mean,
I'm flattered,

640
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,850
thank you, but no, thank you.

641
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,644
If anybody, it should be Maeve.

642
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,188
- Maeve doesn't have a 96.
- Nobody does.

643
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:50,858
Except you, apparently.

644
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,613
Homelander?

645
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:58,574
Could you give us a moment?

646
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,909
Look, I'd really like
to keep discussing this.

647
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:02,077
Absolutely.

648
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,787
Set a time with Samantha,
and we'll get you in.

649
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:11,587
Mm, great.

650
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,423
- No problem.
- Excellent.

651
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,926
My schedule is pretty full, but
I'll try and find you a window.

652
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,726
Okay, sir, there is no way.
I mean, you saw him. He's...

653
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,936
He can get as pissy as he wants.

654
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,813
As long as I'm CEO of Vought,

655
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:31,982
he's under control,
and we both know why.

656
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:35,027
Y-You know that he can,
he can probably hear you.

657
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,321
Good. I hope he does.

658
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,489
Starlight.

659
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:42,159
Real power...

660
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:44,578
isn't this.

661
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,873
It's the ability to bend
the world to your will.

662
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,834
You would decide
what The Seven do.

663
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:53,170
What causes they support.

664
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,632
Full authority

665
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,134
to fill the team's empty slots.

666
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:04,181
I'm offering you

667
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,809
real power.

668
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,437
You should think about it.

669
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,507
It's been almost a year since
Church Chairman Alastair Adana

670
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,425
has been seen in public.

671
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:43,220
Yeah, well, they say he's on,
uh, sabbatical, but who knows?

672
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,181
What I do know is that there are

673
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,433
literally thousands
of tortured souls

674
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,102
who are trapped
in that church right now

675
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,312
who want to escape
just like me and my wife did.

676
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:54,231
- That's very brave.
- Thank you.

677
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,775
Your book <i>Deeper</i> has been
a game changer.

678
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,320
Obviously, you've had
your past troubles,

679
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,989
but I think people are surprised

680
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,574
at how sensitive
and insightful you really are.

681

Oh, my God. Come on.

706
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:18,648
- Hi. Hey. Hi.
- Hi!

707
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:19,900
Hughie, what's up, my man?

708
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,193
How's it going, guys?
What are you guys doing?

709
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,819
We're running lines, actually.

710
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,780
For a reality show?

711
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,990
Right?
The reality behind the reality.

712
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:29,117
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, um... oh, man,

713
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,495
I was in the, uh, control room,
and they had this, like,

714
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,164
- bio thing on you.
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.

715
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,792
Yeah, that boy band shit is
so embarrassing.

716
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,460
You know what, I really like

717
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,087
- "Rock My Kiss."
- Really?

718
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,297
- I do.
- Did you? I... I actually...

719
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,092
Wait, I thought
it made you puke.

720
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,388
- Shut up. Shut up!
- It's true.

721
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,349
What are you guys, what are
you, what are you talking about?

722
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,392
Okay, be careful. I can still
kick you off the show.

723
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,936
He has a right to know.

724
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,479
Come on, we were, what, 19?

725
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,148
- Eighteen.
- Okay, so 18, the band

726
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:02,400
was performing at the opening
of Voughtland St. Louis.

727
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:05,070
But before the show, Annie
and I snuck into a cant in a.

728
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:08,824
And they had those... I mean,
those yards of margarita...

729
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,534
I must have drank
a quarter mile.

730
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:11,785
So, middle of the show,

731
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,995
we bring out Starlight
to do a number.

732
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,956
And Little Orphan Alky

733
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,251
steps onto the stage,
and she just pukes

734
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,086
in front of a festival crowd.

735
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:23,130
I mean, the tweens,

736
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,589
they lost their shit.

737
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:26,007
Humiliating.

738
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:28,260
Wow, that's... I-I had
no idea you drank back then.

739
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:30,387
Oh, yeah, Miss Goody Two-Shoes,

740
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,889
she had a fun side, big time.

741
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,518
<i>And-and really great
you guys are still...</i>

742
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,937
so close, just really,
really great.

743
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,314
You have nothing to worry about.

744
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,817
No. No, no, no, totally.
He's gross.

745
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,777
And you've known him
your whole life.

746
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:47,612
And he, you know, took your
virginity, so why would I worry?

747
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:50,157
Okay, it was a mutual
taking of virginities.

748
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,617
And you know what,
it happened so long ago,

749
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,452
and only a couple of times.

750
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,830
- Wait, really?
- Yeah, you know, we were really religious,

751
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:00,333
and we weren't married,
so it felt weird having sex.

752
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,836
I mean, sex-sex.

753
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:05,213
We did a ton of butt stuff.

754
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,009
I'm fucking with you.

755
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,011
Okay.

756
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,638
- Come on.
- Yeah, never do that again.

757
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,141
Wow, uh...

758
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,687
Cocaptain, huh?
Wow, that's, uh...

759
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,272
- Is it crazy?
- I mean,

760
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,773
Vought's the worst thing
that's ever happened to us,

761
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,275
and now you want
to be their Ronald McDonald?

762
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,651
So, yeah, a little crazy.

763
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:31,615
Yeah, but first female cocaptain
of any super team.

764
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,742
Ever. I mean...

765
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,203
think about what that would mean
to millions of girls.

766
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,746
I'm sorry, I-I'm just...

767
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,289
surprised, I guess.

768
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,041
I mean, is this
your mom talking or you?

769
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,710
I'm the one whose feet bled

770
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,670
at all of those pageants.

771
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:48,465
Okay? I've paid a lot.

772
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,843
And, finally, finally,
I could have some real power

773
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:54,846
that I could use, and I
could make trouble at Vought.

774
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,640
Do some real good.

775
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,183
Or Homelander can murder you.

776
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,185
Someone needs
to stand up to this guy.

777
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,811
- And that has to be you?
- Not just me.

778
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,188
I mean,
I could bring good people

779
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,648
into The Seven
who could help me.

780
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,942
What, you mean
like your boyfriend?

781
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,405
It's not a good look, Hughie.

782
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:15,492
No one even bats an eye
when a man climbs the ladder.

783
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:16,868
Okay, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

784
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:19,246
Look, I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

785
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,122
So I'll...

786
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,124
see you later tonight?

787
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:25,460
Don't bother with the Aquafresh.

788
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,572
Hey, Homelander.

789
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,244
What are you drinking?

790
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,916
- Shake Shack.
- Oh.

791
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,960
You want one?
I'll go grab a P.A. for...

792
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,254
Oh, no, no. Thank you, though.

793
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:10,714
Yeah.

794
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,008
I see you got the extra
whipped cream in there, huh?

795
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,426
Yeah.

796
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,386
Yummers.

797
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,221
I guess you wanted to cram in

798
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:20,598
as much "fat fuck"
as possible, huh?

799
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,519
- Did I do something wrong?
- You think I haven't seen you?

800
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,315
Shoving back two dozen cupcakes
in the break room?

801
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:31,234
Nine servings on Miro's
truffle risotto night?

802
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:33,445
- Hmm?
- Hey, man.

803
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,156
You know I need
30,000 calories a day.

804
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,283
Maybe when you actually ran,
you did.

805
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,452
But now you're
just eating your feelings.

806
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,412
Making us look ridiculous.

807
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,791
"The Fastest Man Alive."
What a fucking joke.

808
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,503
- Fuck you, man.
- What did you say?

809
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:54,424
Nothing. Nothing.

810
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,469
- What did you say to me?!
- I'm sorry.

811
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,012
I'm sorry. Shit!

812
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,348
I'm so sorry.
I-I didn't mean it.

813
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:03,600
- Say it.
- I'm s...

814
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:06,227
- Say it!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

815
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,927
<i>But not everyone
rejects Storm front.</i>

816
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,929
<i>A group called the Storm chasers</i>

817
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,680
<i>still celebrate
her racist dogma.</i>

818
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,141
<i>After finding
each other on 4chan,</i>

819
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:48,686
<i>the Storm chasers rallied online
in the days and weeks after...</i>

820
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,105
How are you?

821
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,192
Wonderful now that you're here.

822
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,488
Is something wrong, my love?

823
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,990
You know, I'm just...

824
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:04,577
skulking around
like a frightened schoolgirl.

825
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:07,414
Apologizing
when I've done nothing wrong.

826
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:16,089
Today, uh, they made
Starlight cocaptain.

827
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,341
No.

828
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:20,468
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

829
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:22,595
My poor baby.

830
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:25,390
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

831
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:29,102
No one suffers like you suffer.

832
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,895
Let me help.

833
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,856
Honestly...

834
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:35,567
I have to put up
with these fucking people.

835
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:40,822
They hold that video
over my head month after month.

836
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,533
They took my son from me.

837
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,578
They want me... Here you go.

838
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,581
See, they want me
weak, castrated.

839
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,624
They should be worshipping me.

840
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,334
Tremble at my feet.

841
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,879
Put a knife
to their children's throat

842
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:58,965
like Abraham to Isaac,
if I say so.

843
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,925
Oh, they will.

844
00:46:01,009 --> 00:46:04,053
When you lead an army
of Aryan <i>Ubermensch</i>

845
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:05,388
to their victory.

846
00:46:05,472 --> 00:46:07,348
What? No.

847
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,100
- Yes. Yes.
- No.

848
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:11,811
No, no! How many times
do I have to tell you?

849
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:13,313
We don't need
a fucking master race.

850
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,940
I'm the master race.
That's the point.

851
00:46:16,024 --> 00:46:17,984
That's the whole point.

852
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,945
No, you have to.

853
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:23,531
It took a hundred years,
but we finally found you.

854
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:25,116
- No, no.
- It's your destiny.

855
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,784
Oh, my God. Whatever.

856
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:31,164
Just, uh...

857
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,374
- rest.
- What?!

858
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:35,668
No. Please.

859
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,380
Please!

860
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,396
I heard Termite walked.

861
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:59,108
My lead was good. What happened?

862
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,405
Don't ask.

863
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,450
Well, we got to talk.

864
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,580
I think I have something.

865
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:21,339
Soldier Boy. So what?

866
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:22,674
Remember how he died?

867
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,134
Stopping a nuclear meltdown
in Ohio.

868
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:28,012
'83, '84, I think,
got buried beneath a reactor.

869
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:30,014
Always thought it was bollocks.

870
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:32,016
Yeah, you thought right.

871
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,435
Read.

872
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,605
- What's B.C.L. RED?
- If you believe

873
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,358
the rumors, it's the thing
that killed Soldier Boy.

874
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,694
Some kind of gun or weapon
or something.

875
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,404
Had to have been
a fucking H-bomb.

876
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,614
He was nearly as strong as...

877
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,577
Ah.

878
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,329
If we can find this... weapon

879
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:55,540
or whatever it is,

880
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,584
maybe we can use it

881
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,587
to blow Homelander's
fucking brains out.

882
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,550
If it is real,
not some fucking fable.

883
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:15,310
Payback.

884
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:18,146
- What a bunch of fucking wankers.
- I'll say.

885
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,940
When The Seven passed them
as the number one super team,

886
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:24,277
Crimson Countess sent me
a box of cat shit.

887
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,946
She was fucking Soldier Boy.

888
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,324
And, uh, Gunpowder was
his sidekick.

889
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:32,827
If anyone knows
what happened to him, they do.

890
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,246
Your mate Noir was in Payback.

891
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,748
Why don't you ask him?

892
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,125
Even if that walking tumor
could talk,

893
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,628
it wouldn't be to me. Here.

894
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:47,342
What's this?

895
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,885
It's Temp V.

896
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:52,096
One shot makes you
a Supe for 24 hours.

897
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,767
I mean, they think.

898
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,602
It's still in R&D.

899
00:48:57,685 --> 00:49:00,063
Oh, great, so powers, maybe.

900
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:02,190
Maybe my bollocks swell up
like footballs.

901
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,525
- Yeah?
- Payback may be a bunch of fuck holes,

902
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,027
but they're strong.

903
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,279
And they're dangerous.

904
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:10,657
If you're going against them,
you're gonna need it.

905
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:18,081
And what makes you think
that me,

906
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:21,167
of all people, would want
to turn into one of you?

907
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,253
This is our best chance
to kill Homelander.

908
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:26,381
Don't fuck it up.

909
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,854
If you want
to watch me have a wank,

910
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,647
it'll cost you a tenner.

911
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,651
May I come in?

912
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:38,995
Where's Ryan?

913
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:46,085
He's at 673
Nosh My Bollocks Ave.

914
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:48,045
You want a pen and paper?

915
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:50,798
You know
I could just pull you apart

916
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:53,050
limb by limb.

917
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,510
Make you tell me.

918
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:56,053
Nah, that'd be worthless.

919
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,055
Victim always goes into shock.

920
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,641
You got to start small.
Fingers, toenails, ears.

921
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,435
He's my son, William.

922
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,479
My family.

923
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,063
I'm gonna find him

924
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,274
sooner or later.

925
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:15,156
Look, uh...

926
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,825
I don't mean to be rude,

927
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,660
but can we just skip to the part

928
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,496
where you laser
my fucking brains out?

929
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,164
Oh, for Christ sakes.

930
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,458
Where's the sport in that?

931
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,752
No, look at you.

932
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:30,963
It'd be like putting down
a wounded dog.

933
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:32,757
You're the one
with your tail between your legs

934
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,467
on all them fucking talk shows.

935
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:38,304
And then they go
and make Starlight cocaptain.

936
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,724
That's got to sting.

937
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,646
Touché, William.

938
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:49,565
Touché.

939
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,068
What are you doing here?

940
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,077
Vought and the fucking bureau.

941
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,412
The wheeling and dealing.

942
00:52:03,496 --> 00:52:05,456
And-and-and-and giving
and taking.

943
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,835
Just to keep everything
exactly the same.

944
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:11,754
And you and me?

945
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:13,381
Well, they treat us
like old playthings

946
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,299
and put us up
on the fucking shelf?

947
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:16,926
Hmm?

948
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:18,970
Treat us like we're obsolete.

949
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,599
Doesn't that make you angry?

950
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,398
Yeah.

951
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,191
It does.

952
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,278
What if...

953
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,905
what if it doesn't
have to be that way?

954
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,579
What if...

955
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,415
you and I...

956
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:55,047
Well, what if we share
a different destiny?

957
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,760
Something... a little more...

958
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:03,014
scorched earth,

959
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,600
shock and awe,

960
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,560
blood and bone.

961
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:11,355
And in the end,

962
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:13,816
only one of us left standing.

963
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,907
Isn't that what you want?

964
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:27,914
Too fucking right.

965
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:30,625
More than anything.

966
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,585
Mm-hmm.

967
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,629
I look forward to it.

968
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:31,811
See you tomorrow.

969
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,896
Yeah.

970
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:43,739
Nadia! Hey, Nadia!

971
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,362
Hey, Tony.

972
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:26,532
How you been?

973
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:28,034
Not as good as you.

974
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:30,327
I see you on TV
all the time, Nadia.

975
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:32,788
I'm not Nadia anymore.

976
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:35,291
You can't come around
the office calling me that.

977
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:36,792
We were best friends.

978
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:38,836
That was a long time ago, Tony.

979
00:55:40,463 --> 00:55:42,339
We should tell everyone.

980
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,341
You have a platform now.

981
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:45,676
We should tell everyone
about Red River.

982
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,803
It's not that easy, Tony.

983
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:49,722
I need people to know
what happened to me.

984
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:52,516
Tony, I can't.

985
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,769
Please.

986
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,856
Okay.

987
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,984
Yeah?

988
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:04,070
Yeah.

989
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:01,127
Oh, Tony.

990
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,798
Why'd you have to come
looking for me?

991
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:42,126
It's me.

992
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:44,003
I'm in trouble.

993
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:46,714
Fuck! Um...

994
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,300
I need...

995
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,969
I need a team.

996
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,722
