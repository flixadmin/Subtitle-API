00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,584
[Oliver]<i>Previously on</i>Arrow...

2
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,753
Star City needs the Green Arrow.

3
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,338
So I'd like it to be you.

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:09,050
[John]<i>The nerve damage in my arm
spread to my back.</i>

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:12,053
<i>And because of the steroid use,
I caused permanent damage.</i>

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:14,973
As soon as you're healed up,
I want you to put that hood back on.

7
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,350
I've been good
for the past two months, good,

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,768
but instead of
giving me back the hood,

9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,186
you've had Cisco make me a new suit.

10
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,147
Ricardo Diaz is pushing Vertigo.

11
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,940
I checked for any Vertigo-related cases.

12
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,984
They've all been kicked by Captain Hill.

13
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,318
She did it for Diaz?

14
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,536
The Orchid Bay night market

15
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,955
runs three blocks,
east, west, along R-U-L-O.

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,623
About midway down there's an alley.

17
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,042
And that's where Anatoly Knyazev
has been making his drop.

18
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,252
He is not a physical threat,

19
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,670
but the two men who will be with him are.

20
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,922
I've been to this market.
Lot of civilians there.

21
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,299
Hopefully not in the alley.

22
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,135
We're going to pin him in,
take him out, clean and fast.

23
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,428
Any questions?

24
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,722
This group's a little light
to take on three Bratvas.

25
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,141
Well, Diaz has God knows how much
of the force under his control,

26
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,476
including Captain Hill.

27
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,437
Only cops I'm sure I can trust
are here in this van.

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,856
Still, it'd be nice to have some backup.

29
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,983
We're covered. Trust me.

30
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:09,903
All right. Two minutes out.

31
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,488
Let's get ready.

32
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,709
Tango's heading into the alley.

33
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,794
[Dinah]<i>Move in.</i>

34
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,634
[John] Looks clean, so far.

35
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,260
Overwatch, any surprises?

36
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,429
Ha. Tricky, tricky, Anatoly.

37
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,515
Thermal reads four bogeys, east alley.

38
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,391
-I'll flank left.
-I'll take right.

39
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,728
Okay, good. Now that we are alone,

40
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,980
I know this might not
exactly be the right time...

41
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,732
You understand that
I'm gonna be punching people

42
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,109
in about 60 seconds, right?

43
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,902
Yes, but it's been about a week
since you decided

44
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,153
that you're not giving John the hood back,

45
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,238
and I was just wondering
when you were planning

46
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,322
on talking to him about that?

47
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,242
I'm waiting for the right moment.
That moment is not now.

48
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,202
That's a fair point.

49
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,041
Should try apples. It's good season.

50
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,880
SCPD.

51
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,799
Easy.

52
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,513
[grunting]

53
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,268
You are under arrest for possession
and attempt to distribute.

54
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,769
Miss Drake.

55
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,354
Cuff him.

56
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:27,856
[groans]

57
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,651
I see your face.

58
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,862
Maybe not so good for you.

59
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:34,946
Load him up.

60
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,670
{\an8}Toss the three stooges
into lockup for processing.

61
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,672
{\an8}I want Knyazev in interrogation.

62
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,257
[Captain Hill] What's goin' on here?

63
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,844
We just got Diaz's
right-hand man. Incredible, huh?

64
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,221
Why wasn't I informed?

65
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,890
{\an8}That was my fault, Captain.

66
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,224
{\an8}I authorized the operation.

67
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,976
{\an8}I figured you wouldn't mind
given the stakes.

68
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,645
{\an8}And we also took the liberty
of calling in DA Armand

69
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,855
{\an8}to expedite the charges.

70
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,107
{\an8}There's no sense in waiting, right?

71
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,319
{\an8}Guess not.

72
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,446
{\an8}Good work, Lieutenant.

73
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,493
{\an8}Thank you for letting John and I
backstock you tonight.

74
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,121
{\an8}'Cause you think we couldn't have
stopped Anatoly otherwise?

75
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,873
{\an8}Because I appreciate the trust.

76
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,333
{\an8}Well, try necessity.

77

{\an8}while Rene is in the hospital
nursing the wounds you gave him.

79
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,546
{\an8}Yeah, I told him to stay down.

80
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,006
{\an8}Matter of fact, I gave him every chance.

81
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,383
{\an8}You guys made a move
on our team in the field.

82

{\an8}These things are in the past, all right.
Tonight is a good night.

{\an8}We got a problem.

106

I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor,

107
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,451
but Mr. Knyazev wasn't arrested
pursuant to an arrest warrant.

108
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,996
That's crap. You know it.

109
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,498
You're really gonna kick this case
on a technicality?

110
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,667
{\an8}I'm not bringing charges
that will only get dismissed

{\an8}You have made exceptions before, Sam.

{\an8}You're gonna draw the line now?

114
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,217
{\an8}On this case?

115
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,261
{\an8}You're under indictment, Mr. Mayor.

116
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,138
{\an8}Do you really wanna add a civil suit

117
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,889
{\an8}for wrongful imprisonment on top of that?

118
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,767
{\an8}Cut Knyazev and his friends loose.

119
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,520
{\an8}Sorry, Mr. Mayor.

120

{\an8}What the hell just happened here?

121
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,691
{\an8}Ugh. It seems pretty obvious to me.

122

{\an8}It's not just Hill who's working for Diaz.

{\an8}He's got Armand too.

124
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,034
{\an8}So Diaz has the police captain,
the DA and...

125

{\an8}Other members
of the city's infrastructure.

{\an8}Anatoly wasn't specific,

{\an8}he just said that Diaz
has people everywhere.

128
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,083
{\an8}I'll run background checks
on all the city officials.

{\an8}But, Oliver,
why split yourself in two, man?

And that's not me anymore.

the appropriate moment to tell you.

I'm not giving up the hood.

143
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,743
I guess I should have taken the hint

144
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,952
the way you kept putting me off, right?

145
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,246
You know, John, this team,

It's all of us.

You helped build it.

That's the moment
you were waiting for. That one?

00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,457
I heard about you.

161
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,709
You're real brash.

162
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,004
You gotta show everybody
how tough you are, huh?

163
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,090
Poking around where you don't belong.

164
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,884
Get your hands up.

165
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,636
Funny thing about that, though,

166
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,598
you always end up
pissing off the wrong guy.

167
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,228
You didn't want to torture him a bit?

168
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,105
You know, maybe slit his throat.

169
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,817
What happened to all that Russian
vengeance I heard so much about?

170
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,652
Is new suit.

171
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,365
His dead body will send
good message to other police.

172
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,034
That's right.

173
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,412
We're all on borrowed time.

174
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,253
{\an8}<i>Still no suspects
in the death of Officer Hurst,</i>

175
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,630
{\an8}<i>a six-year veteran with the SCPD</i>

176
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,800
<i>found dead last night
under mysterious circumstances.</i>

177
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,386
Not so mysterious if you're Ricardo Diaz.

178
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,637
I need to contact Dinah

179
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,307
and have her sequester the other officers
involved in arresting Anatoly.

180
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,268
What about your DA friend?
Any idea how Diaz flipped him?

181
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,811
I'm guessing cold, hard cash.

182
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,104
[Oliver] Cash he took from the city?

183
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,731
Should all be dried up by now.

184
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,899
So he has another source.

185
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,025
Well, according to Curtis,

186
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,027
Diaz is involved
in an extensive Vertigo operation

187
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,945
and if my math is right,
and it definitely is,

188
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,239
he'll be pulling in
at least a million a day.

189
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,784
So we take out his Vertigo stash,
we kill his cash supply.

190
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,870
Unless he's got a rich aunt somewhere,
yeah, that'll work.

191
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,164
Right. I'll just go check in with Lyla.

192
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,082
See if A.R.G.U.S.
can give us any information

193
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,335
on this Vertigo operation
that can help us.

194
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,213
Yeah. That'd be great. Thanks, John.

195
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,424
That was unbearable.

196
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,634
He was fine.

197
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,470
The fuming, the standing
in the corner, that was fine?

198
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,806
John is not going to get bent
out of shape over a uniform.

199
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,850
He's a soldier, Oliver.

200
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,187
Look, I get what you're saying.
That this is not like John.

201
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,648
But you have to see
what he's not saying. He's upset.

202
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,525
Then he's gonna have to get over it.

203
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,735
This is not our first fight.

204
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,320
Well, if you don't want it
to be your last,

205
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,446
you should probably say something.

206
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,782
-Like what?
-Something to ease the pain.

207
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,534
[deep breath]

208
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,287
We need to know more
about Diaz's Vertigo operation.

209
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,747
I need to get to City Hall

210
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,832
and talk some sense into Hill and Armand

211
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,584
before somebody else gets killed.

212
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,087
Yeah.

213
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,720
I think I found a secure location.

214
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,556
To sequester the clean cops?
I'll come with.

215
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,640
No, Curtis. I'm the one

216
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,475
who brought these guys
into the fight against Diaz.

217
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,435
I'm the reason
he's retaliating against them.

218
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,520
This is all on me.

219
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,022
Well, don't be all Oliver Queen on me now.

220
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,234
If we have to take out Diaz,
there's going to be casualties.

221
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,986
And they're not going
to be your fault, Dinah.

222
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,571
No, they're not,

223
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,031
because I'm going to make sure
there are no more casualties.

224
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,116
We're going to make sure.

225
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,159
I'm gonna bring cops to a secure location

226
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,161
nobody knows about
except my good friend Curtis.

227
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,621
I'll be your tech guy.

228
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,959
Look, I don't like the idea of you
doing this without backup.

229
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,670
That, or you want to spend some
quality time with your new boyfriend.

230
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,130
We've only been on three dates.

231
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,173
But, yeah, he's cute,
and I don't want him to get murdered,

232
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,550
so sue me.

233
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,136
Let's go, lover boy.

234
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,013
Yes!

235
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,225
This is everything A.R.G.U.S. could find
on the Vertigo trade in Star City.

236
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,604
Yeah, thanks.

237
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,440
Uh-uh-uh.

238
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,066
It's not free.

239
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,485
I need intel in return.

240
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,195
What kind of intel?

241
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,448
The kind where you tell me
what's going on with you.

242
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,371
Lyla, you know what's going on.

243
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,960
[sighs] I'm frustrated that Oliver
strung me along for so long.

244
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,339
Being the Green Arrow,

245
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,259
you know what that meant to me.

246
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,180
But you save this city
every night as Spartan.

247
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:43,476
It's not like you to care this much
about a title or a hood.

248
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,186
Oliver made a similar point.

249
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,896
-But...
-I don't know.

250
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,525
I just don't know.

251
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,780
This is bothering me
way more than I expected.

252
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,659
I think you owe it to yourself

253
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,952
and to your partnership with Oliver

254
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,954
to figure out why.

255
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,254
Thank you both for coming.

256
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,423
I have to say, Mr. Mayor,
I'm more than a little uncomfortable

257
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,050
meeting with you
without your attorney present.

258
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,885
Well, it's not about the case, Sam.

259
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,346
It's about the two
of you working for Ricardo Diaz.

260
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,182
Who? I'm not sure
I've ever heard that name before.

261
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,226
You're smarter than this.

262
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,229
You're better than this.

263
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,648
Both of you are better than this.

264
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,485
Talk to me.

265
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,450
Less than 24 hours after you promoted me

266
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,077
to take over Pike's command,

267
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,245
I got an email.

268
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,582
Surveillance photos of my niece,
my father and my sister.

269
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,210
-So he found a way to apply pressure.
-Yeah.

270
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,545
Okay.

271
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,548
My boy has cancer.

272
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,217
Leukemia. Stage four.

273
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:02,054
Even with the city's insurance,
we couldn't afford the treatments.

274
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,473
I needed Diaz's money.

275
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,725
All right. We can protect your family.

276
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,229
We can pay
for your son's treatments. This city...

277
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,480
Is bankrupt.

278
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,525
The idea of you
protecting anyone is a joke.

279
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,194
The whole force is under Diaz's thumb.

280
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,407
Or were you offering your protection
as the Green Arrow?

281
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,742
If I was the Green Arrow,

282
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,831
I don't think you'd wanna
be in this room right now.

283
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,751
I don't think either of you would.

284
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,462
Are we done here?

285
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,844
You are.

286
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,431
You're both fired. Effective immediately.

287
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,892
-You can't do that.
-If you work for him...

288
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,728
Then you don't work for me.

289
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,523
Get out.

290
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,491
I know you're the Green Arrow,

291
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,328
but this is unlike anything
you've ever gone up against.

292
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,080
Diaz has already beaten you
and you don't even know it.

293
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,836
{\an8}<i>Still no suspects
in the death of Officer Hurst,</i>

294
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,589
{\an8}<i>a six-year veteran with the SCPD found...</i>

295
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,382
Looks like you've had an exciting day.

296
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,552
I wouldn't call the death
of a respected SCPD officer exciting.

297
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,347
It is when you've been
sitting on the couch all day.

298
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,057
Well, no one's holding you prisoner.
Why don't you get out?

299
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,141
Go get some sun, maybe.

300
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,601
No. Sounds boring.

301
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,937
Helping you with your Diaz situation,

302
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,897
now that sounds interesting to me.

303
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:39,527
I'm guessing the death of that cop
wasn't exactly random though, was it?

304
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,904
You know something about that?

305
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,033
I know Diaz and he's not
gonna stop at one officer.

306
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,493
Yeah, we figured that.

307
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,037
We sequestered the rest. They're safe.

308
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,163
Safe where, though?

309
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,414
[chuckles]

310
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,709
How do you expect me to be like Laurel

311
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,294
when you won't let me act like her?

312
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,629
You want to act like Laurel?

313
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,757
Why don't you do something good, huh?
Get a job, help this city.

314
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,134
I've never had a real job
in my whole life.

315
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,470
I don't even think
I know how to write a resume.

316
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,223
You don't need to write a resume.
You're Laurel Lance, remember?

317
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,976
How well did I do in law school?

318
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,811
Wait here.

319
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,113
I kept all of Laurel's old law books.

320
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,577
Look at that.
Maybe you could start right here.

321
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,412
You wanna home-law-school me?

322
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,913
Beats sitting around
on a couch, doesn't it?

323
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,498
I mean, who knows?
You could give it a shot,

324
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,960
you might just enjoy
doing something good for a change.

325
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,843
[grunting]

326
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,848
Hey, how did it... Oh!

327
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,017
I can tell by the look on your face,
won't even ask.

328
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,102
Would you please give me some good news.

329
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,314
Lyla clued us in on one of
Diaz's suppliers. Marshall Katz.

330
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,690
I'm running location on him now.

331
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,358
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

332
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,571
[sighs]

333
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,531
-I'll be right back.
-Mmm-hmm.

334
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,786
Thanks for grabbing that intel from Lyla.

335
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,205
No problem.

336
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,792
About the hood.

337
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,211
-I'd like to apologize.
-Oliver...

338
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,214
It's just a piece of cloth.

339
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,717
Just like you said.

340
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,471
-You were right.
-I was wrong about a few things.

341
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,057
It's very important that you know this.

342
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,393
When I asked you to take over for me,
I meant it.

343
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,520
When I put the hood back on and said,

344
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,356
"It's just until
you get back on your feet."

345
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,192
I meant it, but I did
put the hood back on and...

346
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,611
It's a part of me.

347
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,405
It makes me feel

348
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,242
like I'm being
the best version of myself and...

349
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,745
I feel whole.

350
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,538
And I feel complete.

351
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:00,834
And I really, really hope
that this is making sense.

352
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,712
Yeah.

353
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,590
The hood is part of you now.

354
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,384
I should have been upfront with you.

355
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:12,888
And I avoided having what I thought
might be a tough conversation.

356
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,724
Well...

357
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,560
I appreciate you telling me this, Oliver.

358
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,728
[computer beeps]

359
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,355
Thank you.

360
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,856
[Felicity] Got a location on Katz.

361
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,238
Yeah, let's move.

362
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,661
Baby.

363
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,955
I want some V.

364
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,500
I told you before...

365
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,252
Can't do it.

366
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,630
Only top-grade for my lady.

367
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,801
[chuckles] Well, don't you know
how to make a girl feel special.

368
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,219
Hmm.

369
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,974
We got a problem.

370
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,101
Moore downstairs spotted one of the masks.

371
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,728
-He's on his way up.
-Go! Do something!

372
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,813
-Get behind us.
-Yeah, no kidding.

373
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,905
Sit.

374
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,409
You're gonna tell us
where you make your Vertigo shipment.

375
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,910
And turn on the Dragon?

376
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:18,954
You'll have to shoot me, man.

377
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,581
I don't want to waste my arrows.

378
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,915
[Spartan] I think you should.

379
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,626
This punk deserves it.

380
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,255
I'm not nearly as stingy with my bullets.

381
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,798
[groans]

382
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,258
Where do you ship the V from?

383
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,053
[stammering]
I'm too high to die man, please.

384
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,971
Spartan, stand down.

385
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,598
When he tells us what we need to know.

386
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,767
[stammering] You wouldn't kill me
in front of my lady.

387
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,685
Last chance. Where's the Vertigo?

388
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,145
Spartan!

389
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,688
Stand down!

390
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,023
And what?

391
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,441
Do this your way?

392
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,942
-He'll fold.
-[gun clicks]

393
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,736
-Talk.
-Fine.

394
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,073
But you gotta send me
to, like, Mexico, man.

395
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,492
-Diaz will find me.
-[gun fires]

396
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,997
My loyalty is to Diaz, not him.

397
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,165
[grunts]

398
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,925
That was a bust. Get it?

399
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,468
'Cause it's drugs.
It's like a play on words

400
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,011
and it's almost a little fun.

401
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,931
Never mind. Tough crowd. What happened?

402
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,307
We lost Katz.

403
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,894
[sighs] Oliver, he was gonna talk.

404
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,855
If you had just let me
keep the pressure on him

405
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,065
for one minute longer,

406
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,527
we would be at the location right now
instead of back at square one.

407
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,362
No. He still would have gotten shot

408
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,780
because you picked a fight.

409
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,867
You pulled our focus and you
allowed our target to get killed.

410
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,912
Because you know everything
and I just need to keep my mouth shut.

411
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,373
I'm sorry. What?

412
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,209
Look, guys, we're all just whipped-up

413
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,128
with adrenaline from the field.

414
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,755
And we're gonna catch Diaz.
We always catch the bad guys.

415
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,175
So we're just going to breathe together.

416
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,301
Inhale...

417
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,054
John, what's going on with you?

418
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,976
First, you were mad at me
because you're not the Green Arrow.

419
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,352
That is...

420
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,064
That is way
out of character for you, my friend.

421
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,984
But I explained myself.

422
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,944
I apologized.

423
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,113
You accepted.

424
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,783
And now you're going to
take a shot at me like that?

425
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,494
I was getting someplace with Katz.

426
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,246
And you

427
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,747
didn't back my play.

428
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,082
'Cause it wasn't working.

429
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,333
No, Oliver!

430
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,586
Because it wasn't your play.

431
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,513
Let me know when you find the Vertigo.

432
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,515
I need some air.

433
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,580
I already told you. I don't know
where they sequestered the cops.

434
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,874
And if you're here
to put pressure on Lance,

435
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,459
don't.

436
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,544
Because I'm all healed up now.

437
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,630
You want to calm down?

438
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,257
I brought you dinner.

439
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,719
I'm not hungry.

440
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,931
What are you doing here?

441
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,976
Just checking up on things.

442
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,854
Looks like some light reading.

443
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,440
Just trying to maintain my cover.

444
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,568
Don't waste your time.
People like us don't learn the law.

445
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,695
People like us...

446
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,530
We are the law.

447
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,993
You trying to make your daddy proud?

448
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,745
Why would I ever want to do that?

449
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,124
'Cause I used to be like that
with my old man.

450
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,170
Before he died.

451
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,676
It's exhausting trying
to be something you're not.

452
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,135
Oh, so what?

453
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,723
You're gonna tell me
what I'm supposed to be,

454
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,849
is that it?

455
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,017
No.

456
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,021
I see what I like.

457
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,066
I know you're pretending
to be the real Laurel,

458
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,612
but the one standing
in front of me right now...

459
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,117
She don't need changing.

460
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,580
Your fries are getting cold.

461
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,583
[knocks] Hey.

462
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,751
[typing]

463
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,461
Hi.

464
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,424
-Everything all right?
-Fine.

465
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,426
I've been out of town for so long,
I just found the gift

466
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,219
you left for me back in December.

467
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,721
I wanted to say thank you.

468
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,848
-You're welcome.
-Funny though,

469
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,310
the same day you delivered it
I also found a security breach

470
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,686
on my computer.

471
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,564
I guess I now know how Cayden James

472
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,233
got a hold
of our nano aluminum amplifier.

473
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,736
I was gonna tell you about that,
Lyla, but, um...

474
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,238
City was at stake.

475
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,240
Yeah, well, the city is always at stake.

476
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,826
You don't have to lie to your wife
in order to save it.

477
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,953
You're absolutely right.

478
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,497
I'm sorry.

479
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,707
I know.

480
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,335
What brings you by?

481
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,797
Well, Oliver apologized for
stringing me along about the hood.

482
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,633
It was actually a good apology.

483
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,843
Wow.

484
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,095
That's not exactly Oliver's strong suit.

485
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,430
No, it's not.

486
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,683
But?

487
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,435
[sighs deeply]

488
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,730
I don't know.

489
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,148
I thought we cleared the air.

490
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:41,026
We go out into the field,
we come back and then I...

491
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,781
I just take a piece right out of him.

492
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:47,991
Over nothing.

493
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,994
It was over nothing.

494
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,750
You're right, there's something wrong.

495
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,878
And I'm worried that
when I find out what it is,

496
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,046
I'm not gonna like it.

497
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,839
Well, from everything you've told me,

498
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,925
there's not a lot to like these days.

499
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,760
The team breaking up,

500
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,513
Rene's in the hospital,
Diaz is running rampant.

501
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:15,310
Maybe the reason Oliver holding on
to the hood bothered you so much,

502
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,479
is because you think none of these things

503
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,773
would've happened if you had
been the one still wearing it.

504
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,279
Seriously, thanks for helping us out here.

505
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,781
I mean, anything for Dinah.

506
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,574
Maybe I was a little
worried about you too.

507
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,909
I'll be fine.

508
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,161
Just hate leaving the city
to be overrun by a bunch

509
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,288
of corrupt cops and vigilantes.

510
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,208
Don't you think there's a little bit
of a difference between

511
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,626
bent cops and vigilantes.

512
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,545
None that I can see.

513
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,296
They're both criminals, right?

514
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,799
Yeah.

515
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,512
Hey.

516
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,640
Listen, do you think, uh,
we could have the room?

517
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,392
[Felicity] Uh...

518
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,353
Yeah, yeah, of course.

519
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,528
-Get some air?
-Yeah, I did.

520
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,447
And with it, some clarity.

521
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,500
Oliver, it's totally within your rights.

522
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,587
To keep the hood, it's yours.

523
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,757
You're right, my frustration
was never with the uniform.

524
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,429
It was with the man underneath it.

525
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,725
I don't understand.

526
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,810
I didn't either, not at first.

527
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,855
[sighs]

528
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,857
I so appreciated your apology.

529
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,485
But something about it gnawed at me.

530
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,700
That you needed to be the Green Arrow,

531
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,912
that it completed you.

532
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,289
This was supposed to be about

533
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,374
saving the city.

534
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,710
Helping the people.

535
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,462
Not ourselves.

536
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,005
I know that.

537
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,051
It's a little too dangerous.

538
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,889
And I've lost just a little too much
along the way for it

539
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,016
-to be about that.
-But yet here you are.

540
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,770
You've gotten married, raising a son,

541
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,355
-you've become the mayor.
-So what?

542
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,942
So, Oliver, you were never
supposed to stretch yourself so thin.

543
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,402
And in so many different directions,

544
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,905
that the people suffer.

545
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,407
We have been in tough spots before.

546
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,452
We have with a team.

547
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:42,123
Even before Curtis, Rene and Dinah,
there was Roy, there was Thea,

548
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,167
but, Oliver, the way you lead

549
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:48,421
alienates everyone and everything
around you, look.

550
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,843
Putting the team under surveillance
was a mistake.

551
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,181
We had an opportunity
to save the Vigilante.

552
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,016
You made a different call.

553
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,893
The same with Laurel and the money.

554
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,647
When did all of these
just magically become my decisions?

555
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:10,485
I seem to remember
you right there next to me.

556
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:14,364
Begging you to exercise restraint,
caution, Oliver.

557
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,867
But that's not you, you have changed,
you have grown so much

558
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,079
and it's been my honor,
it's been my privilege to watch you.

559
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,248
But Oliver, you're still you

560
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,125
and if you're just doing this for you,

561
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,127
-like you just admitted...
-I didn't say I was doing it

562
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,379
-just for myself.
-If this isn't 100%

563
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,839
for our city,

564
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,258
then you are not the hero

565
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,718
that it deserves.

566
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,638
And you never will be.

567
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,809
Ricardo Diaz

568
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,769
has...

569
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:50,025
God knows,
how much of our city in his grip,

570
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:55,363
and you're picking now
to lecture me or to whine

571
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,115
about not getting a promotion?

572
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,617
Promotion, this isn't about
a promotion, man.

573
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,746
This is about you and Diaz,
you still can't see it.

574
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,457
-See what?
-He's already won, Oliver,

575
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,209
he has the city wired
and it happened under your watch.

576
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,129
He showed up
while you were the Green Arrow!

577
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,214
You bought drugs from him, John.

578
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,551
You funded what he is doing right now!

579
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,304
The entire time I put you in that hood

580
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,556
and you hid having a drug problem.

581
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,933
And I was putting my body through hell

582
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:29,105
-for the sake of our city.
-No, you put the team at risk

583
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,440
by lying!

584
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:33,234
I had to dive off a bridge
to save Rene's life,

585
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,154
because you were in the field,
you weren't 100%,

586
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,364
and nobody knew it.

587
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,699
You really wanna bring up Rene right now

588
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,535
when he is still hospitalized
for the beating that you put on him?

589
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,245
We were in the field against

590
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,791
Dinah, Curtis and Rene,
he pulls a gun on me.

591
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,752
-You think he gave me a choice?
-I think that you leave

592
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,961
a trail of bodies

593
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,214
every damn place that you go.

594
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,718
Sure, you've changed.

595
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,013
But what comfort is that to William?

596
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,850
Whose mother is dead because
of the bad decisions

597
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,060
that you've made.

598
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,825
My trail of bodies

599
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,246
doesn't include my own brother.

600
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,053
[both grunting and yelling]

601
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,685
[both grunting]

602
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,070
[Felicity] Stop!

603
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,406
What are you two doing? That's enough.

604
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,743
Have you two gone
completely over the edge?

605
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,416
Diaz is running through the city
like a cancer

606
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:16,504
and you two are in here
doing what exactly?

607
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,759
Okay.

608
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,595
This is what's going to happen.

609
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,513
I am gonna go back to work,

610
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,808
looking for the needle
that is Diaz's Vertigo operation

611
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,935
in the city's haystack, and the two of you

612
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,146
are gonna pull your heads
out of your asses!

613
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,034
-She's right.
-She usually is.

614
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,044
Sorry I punched you, Oliver.

615
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,256
Sorry I punched you back.

616
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,175
For what it's worth,

617
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,260
I know you've done a lot of good.

618
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,556
I know lately it seems like everyone's
been questioning your leadership.

619
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,892
Me included.

620
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,938
Found the location of Diaz's
Vertigo operation,

621
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,232
have you two found any shred of sanity?

622
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,608
Perhaps?

623
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,404
Let's go.

624
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,833
So he just drops it casually,

625
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,126
"I hate vigilantes."
Not "hate" but "hate,"

626
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,838
like capital letters, "hates vigilantes."

627
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,673
This is Paul all over again.

628
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,967
Well, that's kind of a leap.

629
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,594
Paul divorced me
because I was a vigilante.

630
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,096
Curtis, you're getting ahead of yourself.

631
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,848
Yeah, you're right,
he's not gonna break up with me.

632
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,808
-That's the spirit.
-He's going to arrest me.

633
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,476
I know I'm the last person
who should be giving you

634
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,644
relationship advice.

635
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,979
Yet you're about to give me some.

636
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,772
It's more of a life philosophy.

637
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,566
Just live in the moment.

638
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,359
Because you can only see
the step that's ahead of you,

639
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,319
you don't know what's
at the end of the road.

640
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,114
[beeps]

641
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,325
Someone just set off
one of my proximity alerts,

642
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,952
make that some-many.

643
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,453
All headed toward the front door.

644
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,663
-How did they find us?
-Who?

645
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,415
Diaz's men, they're about
to hit us from the west,

646
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,791
the north, the south,
they're about to hit us

647
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,585
-from every angle.
-I know.

648
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,463
I'm sorry, but we can't defeat Diaz.

649
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,008
We tried and we failed.

650
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,260
No!

651
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,263
You stay with Curtis.

652
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,558
Curtis.

653
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,452
I count 13 bogies in this den alone,
heavily armed.

654
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,329
[Oliver] No Diaz.

655
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,206
Got at least 20 million
of Vertigo here. He's gonna miss it.

656
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,125
The only way that we'll make it
out of here

657
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,501
is if we trust each other.

658
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,547
We've been through worse, Oliver.

659
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,633
I'm not sure that we have, John.

660
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,676
You're quarterback.

661
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,678
Call it.

662
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,765
Let's move.

663
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,191
[crackling]

664
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,652
[shouting] We're under fire,
get the product out of here now.

665
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,487
[machine guns firing]

666
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,332
[men grunting]

667
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,794
[beeping]

668
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,421
[grunting]

669
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,692
Hold on, Curtis,
we're gonna get you to a hospital.

670
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,859
Okay? Hold on.

671
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,319
[coughs and cries out in pain]

672
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,738
[groans] I'm okay.

673
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,657
Actually that's a lie,
I think my ribs are broken.

674
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,409
-You were shot point blank.
-No!

675
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,328
-You're...
-It's not what it looks like.

676
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,167
Okay, it is what it looks like.

677
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,335
Okay, go.

678
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,717
Place is bigger than expected,
how many more explosives do we have?

679
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,221
-[John]<i>I'm all out.</i>
-Then we improvise.

680
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,098
Vertigo's flammable in its liquid state.

681
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,434
-Headed there now.
-You won't make it.

682
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,685
Not alone I won't.

683
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,212
It's just like John Wayne,

684
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,339
"It's better to have loved and lost
than to never have loved at all."

685
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,133
Are we getting out of here or not?

686
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,137
Okay. There's an opening
on the east side of the building.

687
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,139
You know there is no opening
on the east side of the building!

688
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,432
Well then, make one.

689
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,476
[guns firing]

690
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,859
[Canary cry]

691
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,238
All right, let's go!
Move, move, move, move!

692
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,699
Let's go, everybody come on. Move!

693
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,034
Do it.

694
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,422
Thanks for having my back.

695
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,473
Judging by the burn radius
of the warehouse,

696
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,850
looks like we got all of Diaz's stash.

697
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,688
Oliver, I'm really sorry
about what I said.

698
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,109
You apologized already, John, so did I.

699
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,401
I know.

700
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,113
I know.

701
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,452
But what I said
about the calls you've made.

702
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,830
Where you've brought us.

703
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,541
The team, the city...
I just can't shake them.

704
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,252
What, you can't shake that you said it?

705
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,962
I can't shake that it's true.

706
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,340
Oliver, for six years,

707
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,343
I have followed the chain of command
without question,

708
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,929
even when my heart told me
there was a better way.

709
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,806
I trusted it, I trusted you.

710
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,270
But the inescapable truth
is that people have lost faith

711
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,563
in your leadership.

712
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,612
Truth is, Oliver,
you have become a better man.

713
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,699
But with your focus split...

714
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,243
A worse leader.

715
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,039
The Green Arrow allows you
to become the best version

716
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,457
of yourself and I respect that.

717
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,876
I respect you.

718
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,046
But if I'm gonna be
the best version of myself,

719
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,091
Oliver,

720
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,180
it can't be with you.

721
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,021
I hope you find what you're looking for.

722
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,486
John.

723
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:41,866
Don't do this.

724
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,961
Thank you so much for helping me get Zoe

725
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,130
-up for school.
-Yeah, sure.

726
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,759
Just don't understand how a girl so small
generates this much mess.

727
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,596
You know,
I actually don't mind tidying up.

728
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,972
Kind of like it.

729
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,766
Keeps my mind off of things

730
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,268
like the fact that my boyfriend
is going to break up with me,

731
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,229
because he found out I'm a vigilante,

732
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,231
and he hates vigilantes.

733
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,524
So he is your boyfriend.

734
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,319
My mind works in hyperbole.

735
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,488
[sighs]

736
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,073
Ignoring for a second

737
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:26,911
the operational risk of having
a cop know your identity.

738
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,205
Do you regret him knowing the truth?

739
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,041
[knocking at door]

740
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,544
Besides the fact that it means
ending our relationship,

741
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,380
-I don't.
-Well...

742
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,216
Then it was worth it.

743
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:46,639
Speak of the devil.

744
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,516
-It's Nick.
-Wait, what?

745
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,188
-Lieutenant Drake.
-Not looking for me,

746
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,314
I assume?

747
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,775
No, but I'm glad you're here.

748
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,777
Hill just canned me.

749
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,445
And you.

750
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,990
And the rest of us,
anyone who wasn't dirty.

751
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,450
Last thing she did
before clearing out her desk.

752
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,452
We're gonna fight this, Nick, okay?
Don't worry.

753
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,579
Come in.

754
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,961
I should probably find a reason to leave.

755
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,255
See you later.

756
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,427
-Hey.
-Hey.

757
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,762
-You go first.
-Okay.

758
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,014
[chuckles]

759
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,558
Listen.

760
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,601
I know

761
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,770
you're not a fan of vigilantes.

762
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,898
So, I get it, if you wanna...

763
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,942
Step away from this.

764
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,945
Curtis, I just lost my job
for being a clean cop.

765
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,196
I know.

766
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,657
With the department compromised,
maybe vigilantism is the only way

767
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,659
to take back the city, I don't know.

768
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,203
To be honest,

769
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,497
I don't know how I feel about vigilantes.

770
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,503
But I do know how I feel about you.

771
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,512
You okay?

772
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,019
I know it had to be done.

773
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,731
[sighs]

774
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,696
You had to do this your way.

775
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,243
I wish I knew what this was,

776
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,787
Lyla.

777
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,167
I know I wanna keep fighting for the city.

778
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,297
I just don't know
what that looks like on my own.

779
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,595
Maybe you don't do it alone.

780
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,265
Maybe you do it with me.

781
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,726
Here.

782
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,649
A.R.G.U.S.?

783
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,403
I've got people breaking into my office,

784
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,321
stealing stuff.

785
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,325
And really...

786
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,744
I could use an extra pair of hands.

787
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,008
Hey.

788
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,930
I know it's rough.

789
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,474
But you'll always have me.

790
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,810
I'm not going anywhere.

791
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,818
What's up, Quentin?

792
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,028
<i>Turn on the TV, any channel.</i>

793
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,871
{\an8}<i>Obviously the Mayor terminated us
to impede the prosecution</i>

794
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,372
{\an8}<i>of his activities as the Green Arrow.</i>

795
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,500
{\an8}<i>What Oliver Queen did
is an impeachable offense.</i>

796
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,003
{\an8}<i>It was a gross overstep of power.</i>

797
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,214
{\an8}<i>Our Mayor should be held
accountable for his actions.</i>

798
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,299
{\an8}<i>Thank you.</i>

799
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,259
{\an8}Armand said that was your idea.

800
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,014
Looks like reading those law books
really paid off.

801
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,310
Guess I was wrong.

802
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,063
You were right about
something else though.

803
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,108
I'm not changing who I really am.

804
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:31,238
I have one last surprise for you.

805
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,828
There is one left.

806
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,457
And I know just how to use it.
