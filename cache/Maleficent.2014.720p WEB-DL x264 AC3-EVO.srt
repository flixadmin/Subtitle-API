2
00:00:30,787 --> 00:00:33,767
Let us tell an old story a new.

3
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:37,494
And we will see
how well you know it.

4
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:41,108
Once upon a time
there were two kingdoms

5
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,110
that were the worst of neighbors.

6
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:46,139
So vast the discord between them

7
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:48,759
that is was said only a great hero

8
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:51,941
or a terrible villain might
bring them together.

9
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,405
In one kingdom lived folk
like you and me

10
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:59,093
with a vain and greedy king
to rule over them.

11
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:02,566
They were forever discontent
and envious

12
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:05,468
of the wealth and beauty
of their neighbors.

13
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:08,145
For in the other kingdom, the Moors

14
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:12,604
lived every manner of strange
and wonderful creature.

15
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:15,939
And they needed neither
king nor queen

16
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,200
but trusted in one another.

17
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:23,978
In a great tree
on a great cliff in the Moors

18
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:26,081
lived one such spirit.

19
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,193
You might take her for a girl.

20
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:33,009
But she was not just any girl.

21
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:35,962
She was a fairy.

22
00:02:03,684 --> 00:02:05,568
There you go.

23
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:10,246
And her name was Maleficent.

24
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:23,411
Good morning, Mr. Shantuwell.
I love your car.

25
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:31,249
No! No! Don't do it!

26
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:38,316
Ha, you missed me!

27
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:40,388
Good morning.
- Good morning.

28
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,497
Love your walk, girls.

29
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:09,198
What's all the fuss about?
- The border guards...

30
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:11,502
Why'd you get to tell her?
I want to tell her!

31
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:14,467
There are rules, Flittle.
I tell this time, you tell next time.

32
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:16,453
The border guards...
- No, you told last time.

33
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:18,678
So I should tell this time
and Thistletwit next time.

34
00:03:18,788 --> 00:03:20,180
Tell me what?

35
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:23,047
Fine!
- Ah, thank you.

36
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:24,739
Maleficent, the border guards...

37
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:28,469
The border guards have found
a human thief at the Pool of Jewels!

38
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:31,343
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:38,762
She's always in a hurry
with her big wings.

40
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:42,599
Humans, here.
I hope this isn't another war.

41
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:55,773
I'm not afraid.

42
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,045
Besides, I've never seen
a human up close.

43
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:01,883
Come out!

44
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:04,752
No! They mean to kill me.

45
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:07,899
And besides, they're hideous
to look at.

46
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:10,800
That's extremely rude!

47
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:14,974
Don't listen to him, Balthazar.
You're classically handsome.

48
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:20,944
It's not right to steal,
but we don't kill people for it.

49
00:04:21,356 --> 00:04:25,234
Come out! Come out
this instant!

50
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:38,686
Are you fully grown?

51
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:40,570
No.

52
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,856
I believe he's just a boy.

53
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:47,837
And you're just a girl, I think.

54
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,377
Who are you?

55
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,959
I'm called Stefan.
Who are you?

56
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:54,967
I'm Maleficent.

57
00:04:57,994 --> 00:04:59,990
Yes, right.

58
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,403
You have to give it back.

59
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:04,435
Give what back?

60
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,794
If I knew you would throw it away,
I would have kept it.

61
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:30,566
I didn't throw it away.

62
00:05:30,573 --> 00:05:34,220
I delivered it home,
as I'm going to do for you.

63
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:42,218
Someday, you know, I'll live there.
In the castle.

64
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,019
Where do you live now?

65
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,062
In a barn.

66
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,234
So, your parents are farmers then?

67
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,081
My parents are dead.

68
00:05:58,268 --> 00:06:00,138
Mine too.

69
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:05,621
We'll see each other again.

70
00:06:05,634 --> 00:06:08,271
You really shouldn't come back here,
you know.

71
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:10,152
It's not safe.

72
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:17,274
And If I made that choice?
if I came back, would you be here?

73
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,962
Perhaps.

74
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,416
What's wrong?

75
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:27,655
Your ring! Iron burns fairies.

76
00:06:27,702 --> 00:06:29,535
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:38,348
I like your wings.

78
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:43,498
Maleficent thought of how Stefan
cast away his ring.

79
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,345
He, who had so little in the world

80
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:49,364
so that their hands
might touch again.

81
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,144
And her heart was moved.

82
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,121
Thus did the young thief who
had hoped to steal a jewel

83
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:59,510
steal something far more precious.

84
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:01,417
Maleficent!

85
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:05,470
Maleficent!

86
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:13,640
After all these weeks,
look who came back.

87
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:17,102
I thought it worth the risk.

88
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:20,607
So, what do you do for fun?

89
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,688
Stefan and Maleficent became
the most unlikely of friends.

90
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:38,008
And for a time,
it seemed as if - in them at least

91
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:42,476
the old hatred between man
and fairy had been forgotten.

92
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:47,753
As it will friendship slowly
turned into something else.

93
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,184
And on her 16th birthday

94
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:59,763
Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.

95
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:04,868
He told her it was true love's kiss.

96
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:09,624
But it was not to be.

97
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,209
As the years passed

98
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:16,338
Stefan's ambition called him away
from Maleficent

99
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:20,568
and towards the temptations
of the human kingdom.

100
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:23,930
While Maleficent, the strongest
of the fairies

101
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:27,633
rose to become the protector of the Moors.

102
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:16,573
Maleficent often wandered
alone

103
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:19,912
and sometimes wondered
where Stefan might be.

104
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:24,122
For she had never understood
the greed and envy of men.

105
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:27,038
But she was to learn.

106
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,517
For the human king had heard
of a growing power in the Moors.

107
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:34,791
And he sought to strike it down.

108
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:57,311
Guards, hold!

109
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,568
Guards, hold!

110
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:13,236
There they are!

111
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,751
The mysterious Moors
and no one dares to venture

112
00:10:17,802 --> 00:10:21,706
for fear of the magical creatures
that lurk within.

113
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:24,186
Well, I say:
Crush them!

114
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:46,233
Go no further!

115
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,234
A king does not take orders

116
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:53,538
from a winged elf.

117
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,323
You are no king to me!

118
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:06,970
Bring me her head.

119
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:08,617
Battalion!

120
00:11:12,564 --> 00:11:14,164
Attack!

121
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:21,678
Arise and stand with me!

122
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,885
Hold the line!

123
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:43,098
It's the dark creatures!

124
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:07,214
Charge!

125
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,406
You!

126
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:11,379
To the king!

127
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:22,206
You will not have the Moors.
Not now, nor ever!

128
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:23,868
You...

129
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:05,523
When I ascended to the throne

130
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:10,763
I promised the people
one day

131
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:15,669
we would take the Moors
and it's treasures.

132
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:20,033
Each of you swore

133
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:24,532
allegiance to me
and to that cause...

134
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,965
Your Majesty.

135
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,713
Defeated in battle.

136
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:41,353
Is this to be my legacy?

137
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:45,429
I see you're waiting
for me to die.

138
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:49,507
It won't be long,
but what then?

139
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,183
I will choose a successor

140
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,186
to take the throne and
care for my daughter.

141
00:14:57,048 --> 00:15:00,359
Who among you is worthy?

142
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:04,582
Kill the winged creature!

143
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,811
Avenge me!

144
00:15:07,464 --> 00:15:10,864
And upon my death
you will take the crown.

145
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:40,128
Maleficent.

146
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,038
Maleficent!

147
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:54,111
So, how is life
with the humans?

148
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:59,459
Maleficent, I've come
to warn you.

149
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,266
They mean to kill you.

150
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,766
King Henry will stop
at nothing.

151
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:11,615
Please, you have to trust me.

152
00:16:14,803 --> 00:16:17,047
They spoke of many things

153
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:19,889
and the years faded away.

154
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:24,604
And she forgave Stefan,
his folly and his ambition.

155
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:29,274
And all was as it happened
long ago.

156
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,279
Are you thirsty?

157
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:09,608
Maleficent?

158
00:19:25,105 --> 00:19:26,688
What is this?

159
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:32,057
I have avenged you, Sire.

160
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:35,599
She is vanquished?

161
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:40,551
Ah, you have done well,
my son.

162
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:43,453
You have done
what others failed to do.

163
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:46,417
You will be rewarded.

164
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:50,509
I shall do my best

165
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:53,404
to be a worthy successor.

166
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:55,252
Your Majesty.

167
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:08,584
I got you!

168
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,700
Wicked bird!
- Into a man.

169
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:30,779
It's a demon!

170
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:46,546
What have you done
to my beautiful south?

171
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,256
Would you rather I let them
beat you to death?

172
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:53,887
I'm not certain.
- Stop complaining.

173
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:56,071
I saved your life.

174
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:00,787
Forgive me.

175
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:03,740
What do I call?
- Diaval.

176
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,798
And in return for saving my life
I am your servant.

177
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:10,876
Whatever you need.

178
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,741
Wings.

179
00:23:14,898 --> 00:23:17,704
I need you to be my wings.

180
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:39,754
I present to you
the first of his line:

181
00:23:39,857 --> 00:23:42,557
His Royal Highness,
King Stefan.

182
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:08,865
He did this to me

183
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:11,002
so he would be king.

184
00:24:30,364 --> 00:24:32,531
Now what, mistress?

185
00:25:08,164 --> 00:25:09,764
She!

186
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:12,666
Her wings!

187
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:01,909
It's a girl!

188
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:06,610
O, my God, it's a girl!
- It's a girl!

189
00:26:26,872 --> 00:26:30,567
Well?
- Well, I saw nothing.

190
00:26:30,948 --> 00:26:35,086
But there's been a...
- What?

191
00:26:37,056 --> 00:26:38,872
child.

192
00:26:40,284 --> 00:26:43,318
King Stefan and the Queen
have had a child.

193
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:49,956
There'll be a christening.

194
00:26:50,937 --> 00:26:53,812
They say it's to be
a grand celebration.

195
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:59,278
A grand celebration...
for a baby.

196
00:27:00,351 --> 00:27:03,328
How wonderful!

197
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:22,185
All manner of folk
came to the christening.

198
00:27:22,213 --> 00:27:24,273
Even three of the fairies
who sought

199
00:27:24,348 --> 00:27:27,313
to foster peace and
good will.

200
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:30,320
Look, there's the baby!
- Love baby!

201
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:33,343
Concentrate, please!
I'm not telling you again.

202
00:27:40,564 --> 00:27:43,221
Greetings, Your Majesty.

203
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,114
I am Knotgrass
of the Moorland fair folk.

204
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:48,180
I am Flittle, Your Kingship.

205
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:51,176
And I am Thistletwit, Your Royals...

206
00:27:52,274 --> 00:27:54,521
They bring gifts for our daughter.

207
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,272
These are not just any old gifts.

208
00:27:57,404 --> 00:28:00,233
For you see, we are magic!

209
00:28:00,294 --> 00:28:02,272
And very good with children.

210
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:07,208
Very well.

211
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:13,304
Sweet Aurora.

212
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:17,471
I wish for you
the gift of beauty.

213
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:26,372
My wish is that you'll
never be blue.

214
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:30,334
Only happy,
all the days of your life.

215
00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:38,003
Sweet baby.

216
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:41,601
My wish for you is that
you'll find...

217
00:29:02,622 --> 00:29:04,670
Maleficent!

218
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,901
Well, well.

219
00:29:22,773 --> 00:29:26,601
What a glittering assemblage,
King Stefan.

220
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:34,158
Royalty, nobility

221
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:36,461
the gentry and...

222
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,742
How quaint.

223
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:44,273
Even the rabble.

224
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:55,712
I must say I really felt
quite distressed.

225
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:58,588
of not receiving an invitation.

226
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:00,977
You're not welcome here.

227
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,552
Oh, dear.

228
00:30:11,753 --> 00:30:14,153
What an awkward situation.

229
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:15,906
You're not offended?

230
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,118
Why no.

231
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:25,707
And to show I bear
no ill-will

232
00:30:25,978 --> 00:30:30,449
I too shall bestow
a gift on the child.

233
00:30:30,553 --> 00:30:32,644
No! We don't want your gift!

234
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:39,382
Stay away from the princess!
- Yes, stay away!

235
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,560
Listen well, all of you.

236
00:31:01,837 --> 00:31:05,205
The princess shall indeed

237
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:07,808
grow in grace and beauty.

238
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,733
Beloved by all
who meet her.

239
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,905
That's a lovely gift.

240
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:19,412
Don't do this.

241
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,991
But...

242
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:42,481
Before the sun sets on
her 16th birthday

243
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:47,242
she will prick her finger on
the spindle of a spinning wheel

244
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:50,256
and fall into a sleep
like death!

245
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,296
A sleep from which
she will never awaken!

246
00:31:55,854 --> 00:31:58,485
Maleficent, please don't do this.
I'm begging you.

247
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:02,867
I like you begging.

248
00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:06,618
Do it again.

249
00:32:24,814 --> 00:32:26,317
I beg you.

250
00:32:27,783 --> 00:32:29,317
Alright.

251
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:36,616
The princess can

252
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:39,119
be woken from her
death sleep.

253
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,054
But only by...

254
00:32:43,098 --> 00:32:45,691
true love's kiss.

255
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:50,310
This curse will last
until the end of time!

256
00:32:50,816 --> 00:32:53,810
No power on earth
can change it!

257
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:11,335
King Stefan ordered his men

258
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:14,268
to seize every spinning wheel
in the kingdom.

259
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,992
The wheels were broken
and burned

260
00:33:17,107 --> 00:33:18,848
that they might never be used

261
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:22,436
and thrown in the deepest dungeon
in the castle.

262
00:33:23,646 --> 00:33:27,131
Secretly he entrusted
the safety of the child

263
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:29,234
to the magic of the pixies

264
00:33:29,336 --> 00:33:31,831
who would take her to
a remote hideaway

265
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:34,933
for sixteen years and a day.

266
00:33:38,797 --> 00:33:42,750
Stefan shut himself behind
the walls of his castle

267
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:46,347
while his soldiers rode
far and wide

268
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,550
to hunt Maleficent down.

269
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:52,502
But she made walls
of her own

270
00:33:52,704 --> 00:33:55,194
that the Moors might
never again

271
00:33:55,297 --> 00:33:58,197
suffered the touch
of any human.

272
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:03,509
And she revelled
in the sorrow

273
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:06,012
that her curse
had brought.

274
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,114
The fairies began their charge

275
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:16,130
to raise Aurora in a snug
little cottage in the woods.

276
00:34:17,162 --> 00:34:19,828
Oh, no! What is it?

277
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:21,916
Looks dreadful.

278
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:23,534
Come on.

279
00:34:25,009 --> 00:34:27,792
We need a smaller baby.

280
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:29,477
Or a bigger body.

281
00:34:29,578 --> 00:34:33,051
No, what we need is
a proper disguise.

282
00:34:33,142 --> 00:34:34,711
What do you mean?

283
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:36,966
Well, we have to blend in,
don't we?

284
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:39,068
We have to be big enough
to look after this baby.

285
00:34:39,188 --> 00:34:41,671
So, gather around, ladies.

286
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:44,415
Get ready.

287
00:34:44,492 --> 00:34:46,609
One, two, three.
Grow!

288
00:34:50,332 --> 00:34:52,973
Oh, that went quite well.
That's very nice.

289
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:57,266
Now, there'll be no questions asked.
We are no longer fairies.

290
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,816
We are three peasant women,
raising our orphan child

291
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,986
in the woods.
So, no more flying.

292
00:35:03,158 --> 00:35:05,307
No flying?
- No, no.

293
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,663
And no magic.
- No magic?

294
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:10,099
Yes, you've heard.
- But we in the middle of nowhere.

295
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:12,315
No one is going to find
us here.

296
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:22,336
There you are.
Why are you always hiding?

297
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,736
Come on. Here you go.

298
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:47,060
It's so ugly you could almost
feel sorry for it.

299
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,775
I hate you.
Beastie.

300
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:08,819
The fairies were perhaps
unequal to their task.

301
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,885
Why is she crying?

302
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:13,970
Maybe she might be hungry.

303
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:16,425
Then feed her!

304
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:39,849
It's gonna to starve with
those three looking after it.

305
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:24,764
What?
- You're cheating.

306
00:37:24,805 --> 00:37:27,232
I saw that.
- We're starting again.

307
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:28,779
Suit yourself.

308
00:37:28,823 --> 00:37:31,629
Greedy, bloated goat!

309
00:37:33,758 --> 00:37:35,823
Bloated goat!

310
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:41,014
Stop doing that.

311
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,566
I'm not doing anything.

312
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:47,889
Well, someone is.
- It's not me.

313
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:52,007
You two are having a go at me
and I will not tolerate...

314
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:54,959
Stop it!

315
00:38:13,887 --> 00:38:15,840
This is all your fault!

316
00:38:26,656 --> 00:38:28,927
Oh, come on! That's funny!

317
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:34,039
As the days went on,
Stefan darkened...

318
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:37,960
further consumed by
paranoia and vengeance.

319
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,576
Pull down!
- The torch!

320
00:38:40,678 --> 00:38:42,378
Flame!

321
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,380
Make ready!

322
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,539
Release!

323
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:36,317
You failed me.

324
00:39:37,357 --> 00:39:39,705
The wall cannot be burned.

325
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:42,224
It is indestructible.

326
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:49,436
Nothing is indestructible!

327
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,392
Not a wall, not Maleficent!

328
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:54,530
Not even her curse!

329
00:40:12,528 --> 00:40:14,875
Bring me the iron workers.

330
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:57,101
Oh, look! The little beast is about
to fall off the cliff.

331
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:24,531
What?

332
00:41:43,143 --> 00:41:44,705
Hello.

333
00:41:56,652 --> 00:41:59,486
Go away.
Go.

334
00:42:00,512 --> 00:42:02,079
Go away.

335
00:42:03,874 --> 00:42:05,971
I don't like children.

336
00:42:08,075 --> 00:42:10,075
Up, up.

337
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,276
Go on. Go, go, go.

338
00:42:43,026 --> 00:42:44,975
As Maleficent had said

339
00:42:45,077 --> 00:42:48,977
Aurora did grow
in grace and beauty.

340
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,629
Pretty bird.

341
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:59,277
Far away from the lofty palace
that she remembered not.

342
00:43:02,094 --> 00:43:04,843
And as the seasons changed

343
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:07,145
and the flowers grew

344
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:09,476
so did she.

345
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,034
Hello.

346
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:25,836
That's it.

347
00:43:32,471 --> 00:43:35,738
She wondered at the world
about her

348
00:43:39,806 --> 00:43:44,157
and at what lay beyond
the fearsome wall of thorns.

349
00:43:54,179 --> 00:43:56,417
Curious little beastie.

350
00:43:57,347 --> 00:44:01,019
She was not the only one
who wished to get through.

351
00:44:07,218 --> 00:44:09,749
Is that her?
Is that Maleficent?

352
00:44:09,919 --> 00:44:11,540
I don't know.

353
00:44:14,806 --> 00:44:16,822
Bring her to me.

354
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,403
Ah, it's just
a silly peasant girl.

355
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,250
It's her!
- It's her!

356
00:46:22,904 --> 00:46:26,494
How could you do that to me?
- You said, anything I need!

357
00:46:26,663 --> 00:46:28,339
Yeah, but not a dog!

358
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,882
It was a wolf, not a dog.
- It's the same thing!

359
00:46:32,085 --> 00:46:35,722
They are dirty, vicious
and they hunt birds!

360
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:39,263
Fine, next time I'll turn you
into a mealy worm.

361
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:43,073
Well, I'll be a mealy worm gladly!
Anything but a filthy, stinking...

362
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:54,437
I wonder...

363
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:37,642
I know you're there.

364
00:48:37,744 --> 00:48:39,557
Don't be afraid.

365
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:44,552
I'm not afraid.

366
00:48:45,366 --> 00:48:47,214
Then come out.

367
00:48:47,998 --> 00:48:49,907
Then you will be afraid.

368
00:48:50,447 --> 00:48:52,196
No, I won't.

369
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:10,606
I know who you are.

370
00:49:11,895 --> 00:49:13,476
Do you?

371
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:17,539
You're my fairy godmother.

372
00:49:20,281 --> 00:49:22,914
What?
- Fairy godmother.

373
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:26,111
You've been watching over me
my whole life.

374
00:49:26,343 --> 00:49:28,442
I've always known
you were close by.

375
00:49:30,016 --> 00:49:31,577
How?

376
00:49:31,678 --> 00:49:35,214
Your shadow. It's been following me
ever since I was small.

377
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:38,697
Wherever I went,
your shadow is always with me.

378
00:49:41,658 --> 00:49:45,116
I remember you...
pretty bird.

379
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,874
This is Diaval.

380
00:49:53,374 --> 00:49:54,956
Hello, Aurora.

381
00:49:56,923 --> 00:49:59,709
I've known you
since you were a little one.

382
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,816
It's everything I imagined
it would be.

383
00:50:09,624 --> 00:50:11,326
Oh, it's just so beautiful!

384
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:13,197
I've always wanted to come...

385
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,322
Goodnight, beastie.

386
00:51:15,221 --> 00:51:17,051
You mock me.

387
00:51:17,568 --> 00:51:19,479
I know what you're doing.

388
00:51:20,513 --> 00:51:23,971
I know exactly...
what you're doing.

389
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:27,188
Sire, your presence has been
requested by the Queen.

390
00:51:27,941 --> 00:51:29,721
Leave me.

391
00:51:29,765 --> 00:51:31,548
Sire, she is not well.

392
00:51:31,649 --> 00:51:35,349
The nurses are fearful that
she won't make it through the night.

393
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:42,548
Can you not see
we're having a conversation?

394
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,727
When the curse fails,
Maleficent will come for me.

395
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:57,574
And on that day...
I will be ready.

396
00:52:11,788 --> 00:52:14,120
They're so beautiful.

397
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,558
I revoke the curse.

398
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,881
Let it be no more.

399
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:39,070
I revoke the curse.

400
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:41,718
Let it be no more.

401
00:53:43,628 --> 00:53:46,404
I revoke my curse!

402
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,796
Let it be no more!

403
00:53:49,524 --> 00:53:52,120
I revoke my curse!

404
00:53:52,331 --> 00:53:55,007
Let it be no more!

405
00:53:57,529 --> 00:54:00,736
Let it be no more!

406
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:12,446
This curse will last
until the end of times

407
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:17,049
No power on earth
can change it.

408
00:54:37,303 --> 00:54:39,718
Do all the fair people have wings?

409
00:54:42,378 --> 00:54:44,137
Most do.

410
00:54:44,537 --> 00:54:46,621
Then, why don't you?

411
00:54:47,053 --> 00:54:49,376
All the other fairies fly.

412
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:54,295
I had wings once.
They were stolen from me.

413
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:56,685
That's all I wish
to say about it.

414
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:58,627
What color were they?

415
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:01,195
Were they big?

416
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:07,438
So big they dragged behind me
when I walked.

417
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:10,976
And they were strong.

418
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:14,605
They could carry me above the clouds
and into the headwinds.

419
00:55:15,157 --> 00:55:17,554
And they never faltered.

420
00:55:17,953 --> 00:55:19,919
Not even once.

421
00:55:20,064 --> 00:55:22,045
I could trust them.

422
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,173
She's coming.

423
00:55:56,405 --> 00:55:58,403
Where are your workers?

424
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:01,173
In their beds, Majesty.

425
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:03,144
Get them back to work
without delay.

426
00:56:03,408 --> 00:56:05,272
They're exhausted, Sire.

427
00:56:05,322 --> 00:56:07,909
But I'll have them back
to work at first light.

428
00:56:10,173 --> 00:56:12,271
I need them back to work now.

429
00:56:12,316 --> 00:56:14,313
It's the wee hours.

430
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,415
Aye.

431
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:22,318
Aye.

432
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:25,207
It is... the wee hours.

433
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,355
So, wake them up.

434
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:30,023
Sire?

435
00:56:30,809 --> 00:56:32,603
So, wake them up!

436
00:56:32,703 --> 00:56:34,348
And get them back
to work now!

437
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,391
We're running out of time!
Go on!

438
00:57:07,217 --> 00:57:08,780
Aurora!

439
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,070
Come here.

440
00:57:20,115 --> 00:57:21,663
Sit.

441
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,076
There is something
I need to tell you.

442
00:57:28,252 --> 00:57:29,940
What is it?

443
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:34,685
There is an evil in this world.

444
00:57:35,635 --> 00:57:38,272
And I cannot keep
you from it.

445
00:57:39,257 --> 00:57:41,397
I'm almost 16, godmother.

446
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,762
I can take care of myself.

447
00:57:43,925 --> 00:57:45,774
I understand.

448
00:57:47,988 --> 00:57:51,208
That's not what I have to say to you..
- I have a plan.

449
00:57:51,681 --> 00:57:55,720
When I grow up, I'm going
to live here in the Moors with you.

450
00:57:56,214 --> 00:57:58,219
Then we can look after each other.

451
00:58:04,126 --> 00:58:06,332
You don't have to wait
until you're older.

452
00:58:07,064 --> 00:58:08,997
You could live here now.

453
00:58:10,234 --> 00:58:11,846
Then I will!

454
00:58:12,814 --> 00:58:15,961
I'll sleep in a tree and
eat berries and black nuts.

455
00:58:16,224 --> 00:58:18,836
And all the fair people
will be my friends.

456
00:58:21,138 --> 00:58:23,887
I'll be happy here
for the rest of my life.

457
00:58:24,197 --> 00:58:26,759
I'm going to tell
my aunties tomorrow.

458
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:31,482
Until tomorrow.

459
00:58:32,452 --> 00:58:34,331
Oh, I'm so excited!

460
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:51,429
Aunties.

461
00:58:51,622 --> 00:58:54,744
I'm almost 16.
I need a life of my own.

462
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:58,154
No, I love you very much.

463
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,688
But it's time to say goodbye.

464
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:02,924
You've been very good to me.

465
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:06,093
Except the time
you accidentally fed me spiders.

466
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:12,217
Hello.

467
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:16,677
I'm sorry to bother you

468
00:59:16,836 --> 00:59:18,742
but I'm on my way to King Stefan's
castle

469
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:21,389
and I've become... hopelessly lost.

470
00:59:21,435 --> 00:59:23,170
Can you help me?

471
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:26,393
I'm sorry, that was my fault.
I rushed into...

472
00:59:32,688 --> 00:59:34,387
Forgive me.

473
00:59:37,415 --> 00:59:39,190
It's that way.

474
00:59:43,448 --> 00:59:45,247
The castle.

475
00:59:50,784 --> 00:59:53,579
What's your name?
- It's Phillip.

476
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:57,595
Hello, Phillip.

477
00:59:58,267 --> 01:00:02,335
What's yours?
- Aurora.

478
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,516
Hello, Aurora.

479
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:13,967
Well, it was nice meeting you
and once again my apologies

480
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,269
for being such a clumsy fool.

481
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:21,019
You're forgiven.
- That's good.

482
01:00:24,194 --> 01:00:26,003
Well, I'll best be off then.

483
01:00:26,734 --> 01:00:28,398
Goodbye.

484
01:00:40,005 --> 01:00:42,089
Will you be back this way?

485
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,752
Nothing could stop me.

486
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:51,127
Then I'll see you soon.
- Very soon.

487
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,971
Goodbye, Phillip.

488
01:00:53,073 --> 01:00:55,881
Goodbye... for now.

489
01:01:04,543 --> 01:01:06,312
Stop doing that.

490
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,513
Well?

491
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:15,931
That boy is the answer!

492
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:19,460
No, Diaval.
- Yes!

493
01:01:19,562 --> 01:01:22,321
True love's kiss, remember?
It can break the spell.

494
01:01:22,425 --> 01:01:24,430
True love's kiss?

495
01:01:24,691 --> 01:01:27,050
Have you not
worked it out yet?

496
01:01:28,104 --> 01:01:31,331
I cursed her that way,
because there is no such thing.

497
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:37,288
Well, that might be how you feel.
But... what about Aurora?

498
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,601
That boy could be her only chance.

499
01:01:41,628 --> 01:01:44,104
It's her fate, anyway.

500
01:01:46,134 --> 01:01:49,829
Go ahead.
Turn me into whatever you want.

501
01:01:49,932 --> 01:01:53,526
A bird, a worm.
I don't care anymore.

502
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,647
I'm so happy
we're leaving tomorrow.

503
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,739
You're not leaving tomorrow.

504
01:02:05,776 --> 01:02:08,159
Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday.

505
01:02:08,196 --> 01:02:12,041
And Stefan told us to take her back
the day after her birthday.

506
01:02:12,143 --> 01:02:15,305
No, he said,
on her birthday.

507
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:17,622
No, after her birthday.

508
01:02:17,729 --> 01:02:19,638
On.
- After.

509
01:02:19,794 --> 01:02:21,870
On.
- After.

510
01:02:22,036 --> 01:02:23,607
On, on, on!
- After, after!

511
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:25,255
On, on!
- After, after!

512
01:02:25,337 --> 01:02:27,033
Stop it!

513
01:02:32,156 --> 01:02:33,751
What?

514
01:02:35,574 --> 01:02:37,518
How could you?

515
01:02:40,775 --> 01:02:43,029
I need to talk to you
about something.

516
01:02:43,211 --> 01:02:45,319
O yes, sweetie, what is it?

517
01:02:51,736 --> 01:02:54,262
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this.

518
01:02:54,465 --> 01:02:56,214
But I'll be 16 tomorrow.

519
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,374
Oh, yes, quick,
put it here.

520
01:03:06,973 --> 01:03:08,715
I'm leaving home.

521
01:03:13,127 --> 01:03:14,853
See here, young lady.

522
01:03:14,928 --> 01:03:18,568
I did not spend 16 years
in this miserable hovel

523
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,618
with these two imbeciles... Hush!

524
01:03:20,685 --> 01:03:23,007
So that you could ruin it
on the last day!

525
01:03:23,141 --> 01:03:25,768
We are taking you back
to your father without...

526
01:03:26,418 --> 01:03:28,160
My father?

527
01:03:29,479 --> 01:03:31,993
You told me
my parents were dead.

528
01:03:34,613 --> 01:03:37,337
I think you better come
and sit down.

529
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:52,460
Fairy godmother!

530
01:03:53,877 --> 01:03:55,602
I'm here.

531
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,650
When were you going to tell me
that I'm cursed?

532
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,197
Is it true?

533
01:04:08,953 --> 01:04:10,525
It is.

534
01:04:12,441 --> 01:04:15,502
My aunts said
it was an evil fairy.

535
01:04:15,998 --> 01:04:18,927
I... I can't remember her name.

536
01:04:19,297 --> 01:04:22,953
They said...
that is was...

537
01:04:23,212 --> 01:04:24,853
Maleficent.

538
01:04:36,504 --> 01:04:38,096
Is that you?

539
01:04:41,847 --> 01:04:43,885
Are you Maleficent?

540
01:04:47,421 --> 01:04:50,350
No! Don't touch me.

541
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:53,598
You're the evilest in the world.

542
01:04:54,273 --> 01:04:56,092
it's you!

543
01:05:04,894 --> 01:05:06,497
Find the boy!

544
01:05:24,013 --> 01:05:27,013
...all the men to the east wing now!

545
01:05:27,116 --> 01:05:30,216
There should be no guards at the gate.
I want her to walk in...

546
01:05:30,253 --> 01:05:32,204
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty.

547
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:36,413
We found this girl at the gate.

548
01:05:36,615 --> 01:05:38,743
She claims to be the princess.

549
01:05:44,728 --> 01:05:47,690
Father, it's me, Aurora!

550
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:00,828
You look just like your mother.

551
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:07,392
They brought you back a day too soon.
I told those three idiots!

552
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:10,150
Lock her up in her room.

553
01:06:10,274 --> 01:06:11,866
Go.

554
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,973
Prepare the net.
Maleficent is coming.

555
01:06:15,395 --> 01:06:18,780
It's so good to be small again!

556
01:06:18,983 --> 01:06:23,452
Look at my feet!
I love my tiny little feet!

557
01:06:23,538 --> 01:06:26,412
Pay attention!
We have to find Aurora!

558
01:06:26,785 --> 01:06:28,993
Oh, the king will have our heads!

559
01:07:10,872 --> 01:07:12,375
Wait!

560
01:07:14,433 --> 01:07:16,207
Princess.

561
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:27,079
I'm looking for a girl.
- Of course you are.

562
01:07:32,138 --> 01:07:34,016
I need a horse.

563
01:08:05,442 --> 01:08:06,972
Come on, Diaval!

564
01:08:54,929 --> 01:08:57,129
Faster, Diaval!
Faster!

565
01:09:34,072 --> 01:09:36,366
It's done.

566
01:10:05,825 --> 01:10:09,249
They pulled the guards.
He's waiting for you in there.

567
01:10:09,716 --> 01:10:12,879
If we go inside those walls,
we'll never come out alive.

568
01:10:14,968 --> 01:10:17,013
Then don't come.

569
01:10:17,361 --> 01:10:19,446
It's not your fight.

570
01:10:22,193 --> 01:10:24,382
Well, thank you very much.

571
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,575
I need you, Diaval.

572
01:10:26,677 --> 01:10:29,226
I can't do this
without you, Diaval.

573
01:10:30,185 --> 01:10:31,927
I can hear you.

574
01:10:39,996 --> 01:10:41,844
Look at her.

575
01:10:42,846 --> 01:10:45,280
Look at what you've done.

576
01:10:46,815 --> 01:10:48,838
She's only sleeping.

577
01:10:52,038 --> 01:10:54,716
She's only sleeping, you say?

578
01:10:58,546 --> 01:11:00,762
She's only sleeping.

579
01:11:02,005 --> 01:11:05,204
She's only sleeping forever!

580
01:11:05,582 --> 01:11:07,103
What about the kiss?

581
01:11:07,172 --> 01:11:09,202
Yes, true love's kiss.

582
01:11:12,304 --> 01:11:14,894
True love does not exist.

583
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:17,970
But it's her only chance,
Your Majesty.

584
01:11:31,775 --> 01:11:33,346
Mistress.

585
01:12:37,529 --> 01:12:39,244
What are we going to do?

586
01:12:39,346 --> 01:12:41,965
Well, we can't give up, can we?
Come on, girls!

587
01:12:42,076 --> 01:12:44,188
But we don't even know
where to start!

588
01:12:44,252 --> 01:12:47,193
True love doesn't just
fall from trees, you know.

589
01:12:59,065 --> 01:13:00,626
Pardon me.

590
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,721
I'm embarrassed to say
that I don't know where I am.

591
01:13:03,803 --> 01:13:06,165
In King Stefan's castle.

592
01:13:09,616 --> 01:13:11,651
This is where I was meant to be.

593
01:13:12,062 --> 01:13:14,036
Although I can't recall
how I got here.

594
01:13:14,073 --> 01:13:17,117
Why have you come?
- My father sent me to see the king.

595
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:20,097
Who is your father?
- King John of Ofsted.

596
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,100
A prince!

597
01:13:32,924 --> 01:13:34,525
Aurora.

598
01:13:35,575 --> 01:13:37,575
He knows her.

599
01:13:38,825 --> 01:13:40,588
Why is she sleeping?

600
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:42,938
She's trapped in an enchantment.

601
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:45,474
Isn't she beautiful?

602
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:49,137
The most beautiful girl
I have ever seen.

603
01:13:50,381 --> 01:13:52,420
Do you want to kiss her?

604
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:55,295
Very much.

605
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:57,311
Just go on then.

606
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:02,204
I'm not sure about it. I barely know her.
We've only met once.

607
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:06,786
Haven't you ever heard of love
at first sight? Kiss her! Go on.

608
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,160
An enchantment, you say?

609
01:14:14,402 --> 01:14:16,072
Kiss her!

610
01:15:08,274 --> 01:15:10,190
You didn't do it properly!

611
01:15:10,243 --> 01:15:12,515
It's supposed to be true love's kiss!

612
01:15:12,619 --> 01:15:15,268
I was certain he was the one!
- What are you doing?

613
01:15:15,351 --> 01:15:17,141
We have to keep looking.

614
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,839
I told you.

615
01:15:50,148 --> 01:15:52,501
I will not ask your forgiveness.

616
01:15:53,654 --> 01:15:56,978
Because what I have done to you
is unforgivable.

617
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:01,859
I was so lost

618
01:16:01,961 --> 01:16:04,661
in hatred and revenge.

619
01:16:07,591 --> 01:16:09,599
Sweet Aurora.

620
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,649
You stole what was left of my heart.

621
01:16:15,256 --> 01:16:17,839
And now I have lost you forever.

622
01:16:29,134 --> 01:16:32,663
I swear, no harm will come
to you

623
01:16:32,767 --> 01:16:35,067
as long as I live.

624
01:16:36,197 --> 01:16:38,767
And not a day shall pass

625
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:41,370
that I don't miss your smile.

626
01:17:09,798 --> 01:17:12,146
Hello, godmother.

627
01:17:17,456 --> 01:17:19,470
Hello, beastie.

628
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,626
No true love.

629
01:17:47,252 --> 01:17:49,164
She's here, Sire.

630
01:18:03,244 --> 01:18:05,561
Are we going back
to the Moors now?

631
01:18:07,594 --> 01:18:09,619
If that is what you wish.

632
01:18:42,618 --> 01:18:44,456
Stop!
- Get back!

633
01:19:11,754 --> 01:19:13,633
Into a dragon.

634
01:19:49,983 --> 01:19:51,717
Run, Aurora!

635
01:21:59,955 --> 01:22:01,629
Enough!

636
01:22:07,082 --> 01:22:09,018
How does it feel?

637
01:22:10,073 --> 01:22:13,256
To be a fairy creature
without wings?

638
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:18,816
In a world
where you don't belong!

639
01:23:07,868 --> 01:23:09,399
Kill her!

640
01:23:09,601 --> 01:23:11,201
Kill her!

641
01:23:44,941 --> 01:23:46,699
Shoot her!

642
01:24:50,497 --> 01:24:52,175
It's over.

643
01:26:11,585 --> 01:26:14,603
Maleficent brought down
her wall of thorns

644
01:26:14,631 --> 01:26:16,490
and took off her crown

645
01:26:18,074 --> 01:26:21,876
And she invited Aurora to see
how the Moors had been once.

646
01:26:22,065 --> 01:26:25,446
Long ago when Maleficent was
but a child

647
01:26:25,617 --> 01:26:27,531
and her heart was bright.

648
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:30,684
For now, it was again.

649
01:26:34,218 --> 01:26:36,638
But that was not all.

650
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,735
Over there she is.
Hurry up, they're waiting!

651
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:52,366
Wait for me!

652
01:26:53,178 --> 01:26:55,683
We present this crown
to our little Aurora

653
01:26:55,785 --> 01:26:58,842
for whom we have sacrificed
the best years of our...

654
01:26:59,274 --> 01:27:01,015
Never mind.

655
01:27:05,834 --> 01:27:08,778
Our kingdoms have been unified.

656
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:13,326
You have your Queen!

657
01:27:14,978 --> 01:27:19,441
So you see, the story is not quite
as you were told.

658
01:27:19,545 --> 01:27:21,551
And I should know.

659
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:25,853
For I was the one
they called Sleeping Beauty.

660
01:27:59,266 --> 01:28:01,775
In the end,
my kingdom was united.

661
01:28:01,802 --> 01:28:04,288
Not by a hero or a villain

662
01:28:04,316 --> 01:28:06,381
as legend had predicted.

663
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:10,374
But one who was both
hero and villain.

664
01:28:11,558 --> 01:28:13,994
And her name was

665
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:15,727
Maleficent.

666
01:28:15,751 --> 01:30:16,751
