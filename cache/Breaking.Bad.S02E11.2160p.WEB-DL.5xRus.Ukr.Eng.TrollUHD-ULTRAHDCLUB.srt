1
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:33,756
- What's up?
- How's it going?

2
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,180
All right.

3
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:06,623
What you need?

4
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,212
You buying or you just stopping to envy?

5
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:18,968
Yeah. Punk bitches.

6
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:05,849
<i>Please leave your message
for 505-127-5223.</i>

7
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:09,057
<i>Record your message after the tone.
To send a numeric page...</i>

8
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:10,353
Bounce, little man.

9
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:14,065
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
getting eyeballed hard.

10
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:16,526
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

11
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:19,028
Get your ass up here now.

12
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:25,874
- What's that thing in your ear?
- What did I say? Get out of here!

13
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,038
What are you waiting for? Go!

14
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:38,608
Well, Walt, we've made such headway
with your treatments

15
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:42,028
that now it's time we talked about
sealing the deal.

16
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:43,488
Absolutely.

17
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:45,073
As you know

18
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:48,284
my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

19
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,247
That may no longer be the case.

20
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:56,960
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

21
00:03:57,168 --> 00:03:58,962
Maybe a pretty good option.

22
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,964
Dr. Bravenec is one of
the few surgeons in the country

23
00:04:02,048 --> 00:04:04,698
performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

24
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:07,178
He's got a good track record.

25
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:08,972
Pretty good.

26
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:11,724
It sounds

27
00:04:13,017 --> 00:04:14,144
aggressive.

28
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:16,479
Yes. Very much so.

29
00:04:16,688 --> 00:04:19,482
Understand that
if you don't have this surgery

30
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:22,041
you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

31
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:24,320
And it will.

32
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:28,199
Through the treatment you've had,
we've bought you some time.

33
00:04:28,408 --> 00:04:31,494
Maybe a lot, probably a little,

34
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,164
but that's all.

35
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:36,166
In my opinion

36
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:38,668
if you're willing to take some risk

37
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:41,004
then this offers the best chance.

38
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:51,598
How much would it cost?
I mean, I'm not on your insurance.

39
00:04:51,806 --> 00:04:54,601
I'd say between 170,

40
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,228
and 200,000, all in.

41
00:04:57,437 --> 00:05:01,024
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can,

42
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:04,027
but mine isn't even the biggest expense.

43
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:09,699
This is obviously a big decision,

44
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:13,203
and you folks are gonna wanna
take some time to discuss it.

45
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,622
No.

46
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:18,082
I'll do it.

47
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:28,051
Walt, don't you think we should
at least talk this through first?

48
00:05:29,385 --> 00:05:32,347
I just think it's the way to go.

49
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:39,729
I have to say,
I think it's the right choice.

50
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,030
I recommend
that we let the pneumonitis heal,

51
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,026
for another couple of weeks,

52
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:47,529
and then we'll have at it.

53
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,990
That's tricky.

54
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:57,247
- When's the due date?
- It's the 21st.

55
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:58,790
So two weeks and change?

56
00:05:58,998 --> 00:06:01,248
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

57
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:04,667
That way Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

58
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:08,091
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

59
00:06:09,676 --> 00:06:11,094
Yeah.

60
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:30,780
Fourteen messages...

61
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:32,866
God.

62
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,412
<i>- Yeah.
- It's me.</i>

63
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,040
<i>Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.</i>

64
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:42,625
Working.

65
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,169
What is it?

66
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:48,923
Combo's dead.

67
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:51,134
<i>Shot.</i>

68
00:06:52,844 --> 00:06:53,970
Which one is he?

69
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,821
You did not just say that to me.

70
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:59,476
<i>- Jesse, listen...
- That figures.</i>

71
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:13,782
What's the word on the street?

72
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:16,618
No one's dropping no names.

73
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:20,121
Combo rang me before it went down,
said dudes were mad-dogging him

74
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:24,000
trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

75
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:29,506
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean

76
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,508
what'd you expect?

77
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:34,052
I don't know.

78
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,929
You don't know?

79
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:38,973
Is that all you got?

80
00:07:40,225 --> 00:07:43,019
I'll do right by Combo's people.

81
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:49,484
But make sure you bust up your cell and
toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.

82
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:54,364
I appreciate what you're saying and all,

83
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:58,993
but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali...

84
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:01,454
I'm on probation, man.

85
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:04,541
Fast track to Los Lunas.

86
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,128
We're on the verge

87
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:12,549
of making some serious coin, Skinny.

88
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:15,218
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

89
00:08:17,053 --> 00:08:21,057
This game we playing? We don't got
the street cred to survive it.

90
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:24,024
Back when everyone thought
you killed Spooge

91
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:27,105
maybe we were doing okay, but that whole

92
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,608
- thing to the head thing, the ATM?
- Yeah?

93
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:32,569
His junkie bitch copped to it.

94
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:35,738
Whole town knows it wasn't you.

95
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,245
Everyone knows?

96
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:48,084
- Why didn't you say something?
- I don't know, man.

97
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:49,752
Because we like you and all.

98
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:53,089
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

99
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:55,258
We'll get by.

100
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:59,262
- All right? We'll make it.
- Sorry, Jesse.

101
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:01,598
I'm out.

102
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:15,487
We have had a bit of a setback.

103
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:19,699
That's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

104
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:22,708
- How about "your fault"?
- No, no, don't lay that on me.

105
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:26,205
- You are in charge of distribution.
- You said expand the territory.

106
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,833
- Doesn't mean you become careless.
- Guys, guys! Hey!

107
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,919
Do I look like Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counsellor.

108
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:34,631
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

109
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,883
Now, setback. Go.

110
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:41,179
One of our dealers was murdered.

111
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,309
It was some kind of turf dispute,

112
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,645
and apparently we lost.

113
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,563
And then everyone quit on us.

114
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:54,651
I mean,
we have absolutely no distribution.

115
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:57,445
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

116
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:59,572
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

117
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,327
Well, there's your silver lining.

118
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:07,330
How about you?
How's the health situation?

119
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,834
It's better. Do you mind?

120
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,502
Better?

121
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:15,880
Yeah, it's...

122
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:22,137
looking a little more positive.

123
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:24,145
I may have more time than I thought.

124
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:26,141
Outstanding.

125
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,643
Now, as to your dead guy:

126
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:30,645
Occupational hazard.

127
00:10:30,854 --> 00:10:32,105
Drug dealer getting shot?

128
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:36,359
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

129
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,654
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

130
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:44,033
Thirty-eight and change.

131
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:46,119
Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?

132
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:47,537
Pounds.

133
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:53,001
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

134
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,295
Guys!

135
00:10:55,503 --> 00:10:57,380
Why the long faces here?

136
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,716
You're sitting on a gold mine.

137
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:02,010
A gold mine we can't sell.

138
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:04,512
We need a proper infrastructure.

139
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,056
We need foot soldiers and we need dealers

140
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:09,225
on a street level that are rock solid.

141
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:12,395
We need muscle and we need enforcers.

142
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:14,564
Payback. That's what we need.

143
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:21,237
God.

144
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:26,367
I mean, this entire process
has just been so...

145
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:33,416
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

146
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,127
We need your help.

147
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:40,423
Look, let's start with
some tough love, all right?

148
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:42,300
Ready for this? Here goes.

149
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:46,429
You two suck at peddling meth.
Period.

150
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:49,099
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

151
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,726
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

152
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,356
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

153
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:58,775
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

154
00:11:58,983 --> 00:12:01,611
What, some tattooed speed freak?

155
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,240
No. What you two need
is an honest-to-God businessman.

156
00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:07,242
Somebody who treats your product

157
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,829
like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

158
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:14,249
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

159
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:18,795
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

160
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:22,632
You know someone like that?

161
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:26,803
Let's just say I know a guy
who knows a guy.

162
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:28,888
Who knows another guy.

163
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:32,934
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

164
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:36,980
Well, what's his name?

165
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:39,774
I have no idea.

166
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,446
He's very low profile.
He's careful like that.

167
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:47,782
You know, from what I do hear about him

168
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:49,993
he sounds a little like you.

169
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:57,792
<i>And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.</i>

170
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:00,651
<i>He's coming to the end
and he's got the big fist pump.</i>

171
00:13:00,795 --> 00:13:03,840
<i>Now Mueller's coming.
Oh, a double! Here he comes.</i>

172
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:07,594
<i>And he's coming to the end
and he takes second.</i>

173
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:09,846
I need you to leave.

174
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:20,815
Look, there's

175
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:24,903
some stuff about me you don't know and...

176
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:30,450
Like you're a drug dealer?

177
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,787
I kind of got that.

178
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:39,125
You pay in cash
and you use an alias, so...

179
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:47,884
One of my guys

180
00:13:48,635 --> 00:13:51,471
a friend who worked for me

181
00:13:52,597 --> 00:13:53,848
got murdered.

182
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:57,977
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

183
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:03,900
I'm gonna smoke some crystal
and I just think you should go

184
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:08,154
being that you're in a programme
and all and...

185
00:14:11,324 --> 00:14:13,201
You could come with me to a meeting.

186
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,830
No.

187
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:19,541
No meetings.

188
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:24,003
We could just get out of here.

189
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:30,677
- It won't help.
- Yeah, it will.

190
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:33,346
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

191
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:35,098
I just...

192
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:39,060
All right, I really just need you to go.

193
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:43,387
Sir? Enjoy your meal.

194
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:45,181
Thank you.

195
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:18,130
You're late.

196
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:20,925
Yeah.

197
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,928
We're in the big time now.

198
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,848
So where's the kingpin?

199
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,268
Your guess is as good as mine.

200
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:36,440
So you get the dude's name?

201
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:38,276
Nope.

202
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:41,737
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names

203
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:45,032
what we look like,
but not the other way around?

204
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:50,621
Why don't you get yourself some food?

205
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,207
So we won't both sit here
with our Happy Meals

206
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,959
looking like a couple chumps?

207
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,962
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

208
00:16:58,462 --> 00:16:59,714
Fine, thanks.

209
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:04,927
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

210
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:07,221
I don't get you, man.

211
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,225
A week ago you talked like
you were all ready to hang it up.

212
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:15,771
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

213
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,732
Yeah, what about after?

214
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,319
After you gonna make up
some new magic number?

215
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:24,077
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

216
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:26,324
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

217
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:30,119
- Things have changed.
- Oh, I know.

218
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:32,747
We got a guy killed.

219
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,085
You know what?

220
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:40,796
This is bullshit.

221
00:17:41,714 --> 00:17:43,841
- I'm out of here.
- Hey.

222
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:56,854
I think she's waking up from a nap.

223
00:17:57,063 --> 00:18:00,483
She is certainly gonna wanna get out
and stretch those legs soon.

224
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:06,822
We have to keep an eye on your fluids.

225
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:08,574
You're on the low side of normal.

226
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:11,369
What? How low?

227
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:14,827
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

228
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:18,464
We'll have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

229
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:21,379
Hey.

230
00:18:21,587 --> 00:18:23,714
Oh, man,
you would not believe the traffic.

231
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:25,883
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

232
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:28,094
- Sorry. Hi.
- Hi.

233
00:18:28,302 --> 00:18:30,721
- What did I miss?
- For your refrigerator.

234
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,015
Oh, my God.

235
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:34,433
Look at her.

236
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:36,060
- Look.
- Yeah.

237
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:38,896
God. It's like she's here already.

238
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:42,692
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

239
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,235
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

240
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,238
It's time to make a decision.

241
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:50,575
- You know what I'm gonna say.
- The C-section?

242
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:53,035
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

243
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:59,167
Well, my last labour
was pretty tough, so...

244
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,295
For the baby, I say yes.

245
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:05,353
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

246
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:09,760
It's best we take her a little early.
So why don't we schedule it for

247
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:11,429
a week from Friday?

248
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:16,100
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

249
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:22,648
We have a birthday.

250
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:24,692
The 16th.

251
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:27,028
- I like it.
- Yeah.

252
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:30,531
You know, speaking of birthdays

253
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,285
I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

254
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:37,288
It's an hour before closing.

255
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:39,540
You're supposed to be taking it easy.

256
00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:42,084
We're having a get-together
for Ted's birthday,

257
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:43,918
and I've gotta pick up the cake.

258
00:19:44,295 --> 00:19:45,546
Why you?

259
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:50,259
Because I said I would...?

260
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:53,054
It is the least I can do.

261
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:56,182
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay. Yeah.

262
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,767
- Bye.
- Bye.

263
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:48,359
Let's get out of here.

264
00:20:48,568 --> 00:20:50,778
You know, go do something.

265
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,073
Seriously.

266
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:57,702
You know that museum in Santa Fe
you talked about?

267
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:00,246
Let's take a drive.

268
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:05,877
Sure.

269
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:27,481
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's been drilled, it's been cut.

270
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:29,484
We're halfway through the job.

271
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:34,572
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.
Mr. Beneke to the shop.</i>

272
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:38,367
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

273
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:39,827
I gotta go.

274
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:42,038
Dean, I gotta go.

275
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:44,415
Okay, all right.

276
00:21:47,418 --> 00:21:50,254
Happy birthday!

277
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,423
Happy birthday!

278
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:55,843
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

279
00:21:56,052 --> 00:21:58,763
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

280
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:02,600
Wait a minute. You making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

281
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:06,687
Okay. Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

282
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:10,107
China's undercutting us at every turn.
I'm at a loss.

283
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:14,946
- Wait. Skyler?
- Yes?

284
00:22:15,154 --> 00:22:16,739
I wanna hear it first.

285
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:19,200
Absolutely not. No way.

286
00:22:19,408 --> 00:22:21,758
You cannot deny your employer
his birthday wish.

287
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:24,622
- Yes, I can. Watch me.
- Please!

288
00:22:24,831 --> 00:22:28,626
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

289
00:22:28,835 --> 00:22:32,296
- Come on. It was so good last time.
- It was ages ago.

290
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:35,383
And I'm enormous now.

291
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,802
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

292
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,304
Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.

293
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:42,932
These candles are getting wax
all over the place.

294
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:44,892
- Seriously.
- Yes, come on, Skyler.

295
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:49,814
<i>- Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...
- It's obscene.</i>

296
00:22:50,022 --> 00:22:52,984
<i>Skyler, Skyler, Skyler...</i>

297
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:08,666
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

298
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:15,506
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

299
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:23,264
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President</i>

300
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:27,768
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>

301
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:32,356
<i>Happy birthday</i>

302
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,028
<i>To you</i>

303
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:42,700
That was fantastic.

304
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:44,744
Isn't she great, huh?

305
00:23:45,495 --> 00:23:47,330
Okay, here we go.

306
00:23:57,822 --> 00:24:00,533
<i>- He wasn't there.
- Oh, he was there, all right.</i>

307
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:03,391
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours.

308
00:24:03,494 --> 00:24:04,620
Nobody came.

309
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:07,456
<i>All I know is my contact
said he was there.</i>

310
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:09,917
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

311
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:11,961
<i>Yes, I'm positive.</i>

312
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:13,671
<i>- Where was he?
- Who knows?</i>

313
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:16,549
Maybe he checked you out
with a telephoto lens

314
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:18,551
didn't like the cut of your jib.

315
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,139
Anyway, it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no-go.

316
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,808
What? What do you mean?

317
00:24:26,017 --> 00:24:27,393
No deal. No dice.

318
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:29,562
Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.

319
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:31,022
Wait a minute.

320
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,857
How can he make that decision
without even meeting me?

321
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:37,291
<i>I told you, he's very cautious
who he does business with, all right?</i>

322
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:41,741
He's skittish, like a deer.

323
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:44,994
Call him back.

324
00:24:45,202 --> 00:24:47,246
<i>I'm sorry. I can't do that.</i>

325
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:50,082
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.

326
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,543
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

327
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:55,128
I called a guy who called a guy
who called a guy.

328
00:24:55,212 --> 00:24:56,881
Second of all, it's over.

329
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:59,550
<i>Understand?
With this particular individual</i>

330
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,136
<i>all you get is the one shot.</i>

331
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:04,597
Look

332
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:07,455
I'll see if I can scrape
something else together,

333
00:25:07,642 --> 00:25:09,393
but don't get your hopes up.

334
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:12,355
<i>No one else handles that kind of bulk.</i>

335
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:14,106
Damn it.

336
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:57,832
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

337
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:06,719
Can I help you, sir?

338
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:10,848
Diet Coke, please.

339
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:15,811
And five minutes of your time.

340
00:27:26,364 --> 00:27:29,075
- What can I do for you?
- Have a seat.

341
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:32,411
Please.

342
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:48,135
I would like to know why you wouldn't
meet with me yesterday.

343
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:52,223
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

344
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:56,978
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

345
00:27:57,728 --> 00:28:00,189
I believe that person was you.

346
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:03,943
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

347
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:06,696
I don't think I am.

348
00:28:10,825 --> 00:28:12,660
Sir, if you have a complaint

349
00:28:12,868 --> 00:28:15,245
I suggest you submit it
through our e-mail system.

350
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,790
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

351
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:22,253
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with

352
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:24,755
is very careful.

353
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:26,966
A cautious man.

354
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:30,678
I believe we're alike in that way.

355
00:28:32,763 --> 00:28:36,434
If you are who I think you are

356
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:39,061
you should give me another chance.

357
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,986
I don't think we're alike at all,
Mr. White.

358
00:28:48,821 --> 00:28:51,616
You are not a cautious man at all.

359
00:28:51,824 --> 00:28:54,827
Your partner was late and he was high.

360
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:58,748
Yes. Yes, he was.

361
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,752
He's high often, isn't he?

362
00:29:06,339 --> 00:29:08,132
You have poor judgment.

363
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,718
I can't work with someone
with poor judgment.

364
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:14,930
Are you familiar with my product?

365
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:19,143
- I've been told it's excellent.
- It is impeccable.

366
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:21,812
It is the purest

367
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:25,483
most chemically sound product
on the market anywhere.

368
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:28,027
That is not the only factor.

369
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:32,198
You could charge twice the current rate
for what I provide,

370
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:34,867
and your customers would pay it.

371
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,161
Hands down.

372
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:44,335
Now, who I choose to do business with
on my end is not your problem.

373
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:46,545
You won't see him.

374
00:29:46,754 --> 00:29:49,507
You won't interact with him.

375
00:29:50,091 --> 00:29:51,717
Forget he exists.

376
00:29:53,177 --> 00:29:55,554
I have to ask.

377
00:29:57,306 --> 00:29:58,391
Why?

378
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,393
Why him?

379
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,606
Because he does what I say.

380
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:09,485
Because I can trust him.

381
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:13,239
How much product do you have on hand?

382
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:15,908
Thirty-eight pounds.

383
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:18,744
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

384
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:26,836
Will I hear from you?

385
00:30:29,505 --> 00:30:30,881
I have your numbers.

386
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:39,056
You can never trust a drug addict.

387
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:56,905
Look, I mean, it's all kind of
little dribs and drabs,

388
00:30:56,991 --> 00:31:00,161
but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

389
00:31:00,369 --> 00:31:03,914
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

390
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:05,666
Dribs and drabs.

391
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,085
Once you add it all up, though,
with Keller

392
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:11,631
the revenues are almost 10 percent
less than was actually received.

393
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,927
And this is every quarter
for the last two years.

394
00:31:19,847 --> 00:31:23,601
When I saw that, I got worried
so I checked Accounts Receivable.

395
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:26,812
I found six other instances

396
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,524
of revenues being under-reported.

397
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:34,236
And I've only just started
to look into it.

398
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:37,823
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

399
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:40,409
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

400
00:31:40,493 --> 00:31:42,370
Most of the time, they overestimate.

401
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:45,122
I let them roll their overages
into the next order,

402
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:47,333
and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.

403
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,168
Obviously, we forgot,

404
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:53,381
or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

405
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:56,967
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see

406
00:31:57,051 --> 00:32:00,680
the money's coming in eventually,
as you can see.

407
00:32:01,764 --> 00:32:03,140
Right.

408
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:04,934
Right,

409
00:32:05,142 --> 00:32:09,772
but I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage

410
00:32:09,981 --> 00:32:12,358
to try and sort this out.

411
00:32:13,484 --> 00:32:17,530
Most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

412
00:32:18,948 --> 00:32:21,033
In a few cases

413
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:25,705
I found xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

414
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:30,459
Ted.

415
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:42,263
All right.

416
00:32:44,015 --> 00:32:45,641
You got me.

417
00:32:46,183 --> 00:32:51,063
We're talking nearly a million dollars
of undocumented revenue.

418
00:32:51,522 --> 00:32:54,650
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking

419
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:57,028
about saving a company.

420
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:59,030
I'm thinking about people's jobs

421
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:01,156
about their mortgages and pensions,

422
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,535
and their college funds for their kids.

423
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:06,579
Not to mention my own.

424
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:09,373
It doesn't mean that you have to
break the law.

425
00:33:09,582 --> 00:33:11,250
Yes, it does, Skyler.

426
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:13,409
It's in the books.
Business is terrible.

427
00:33:13,586 --> 00:33:16,881
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

428
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:18,549
- If I don't keep up...
- Ted.

429
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:21,594
People go to prison for this.

430
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,686
My dad built this company from nothing.

431
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:34,023
We make things here.

432
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:37,276
The people who work here are like family.

433
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:41,572
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

434
00:33:46,202 --> 00:33:47,244
Sky...

435
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:52,041
don't report this.

436
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:54,627
Please.

437
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:59,507
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.

438
00:34:04,345 --> 00:34:06,806
But I can't be a part of it.

439
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,352
I know.

440
00:34:11,978 --> 00:34:14,230
I know. I just wish...

441
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:17,066
I'm sorry.

442
00:34:19,193 --> 00:34:21,028
I don't want you to go.

443
00:34:38,754 --> 00:34:41,841
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

444
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:44,802
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.</i>

445
00:34:45,011 --> 00:34:46,846
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>

446
00:34:47,054 --> 00:34:48,639
<i>The whole crew was representing.</i>

447
00:34:48,723 --> 00:34:50,773
<i>Even Badger came all the way from Fresno.</i>

448
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:52,991
<i>Combo's people, his ma, grandma, cousins</i>

449
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:55,146
<i>everyone was all choked up and shit.</i>

450
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:58,024
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>

451
00:34:58,232 --> 00:35:00,192
<i>And you should have seen the coffin.</i>

452
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:02,278
<i>It was this shiny white pearlescent.</i>

453
00:35:02,486 --> 00:35:05,573
<i>I'm sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>

454
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:08,743
<i>So we're definitely talking high-end.</i>

455
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:12,163
<i>Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.</i>

456
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:15,458
<i>Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.</i>

457
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,919
I like to mix some ice with it.

458
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:50,136
Hold that.

459
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:53,973
What's it feel like?

460
00:36:57,643 --> 00:36:59,437
There's a chill.

461
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:02,898
Don't freak out. It passes.

462
00:37:03,357 --> 00:37:04,650
And then...

463
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:05,985
You'll see.

464
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,408
I'll meet you there.

465
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,796
Take that off.

466
00:39:53,772 --> 00:39:56,233
Phones off, please.

467
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:16,378
Pipes, I guess.

468
00:40:16,586 --> 00:40:19,381
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

469
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:22,050
Eyes on your paper.

470
00:40:37,149 --> 00:40:38,483
Yes.

471
00:40:52,873 --> 00:40:54,423
Excuse me, where's the manager?

472
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:56,877
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

473
00:40:57,085 --> 00:41:00,505
No, no, no.
I met a man here last week.

474
00:41:00,714 --> 00:41:03,592
He's a black gentleman.
He's thin. Glasses.

475
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,343
Yes, sir. That's the owner.

476
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:07,387
Oh, owner. Okay.

477
00:41:07,596 --> 00:41:10,473
He owns 14 Los Polios restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

478
00:41:10,557 --> 00:41:12,851
He could be at any one of them.

479
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:17,606
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...?

480
00:41:17,814 --> 00:41:20,525
I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.

481
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:23,945
Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy
to refer you to our website.

482
00:41:24,029 --> 00:41:25,864
No, no.

483
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:28,033
- What's his name?
- Gustavo.

484
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:29,743
Gus.

485
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:30,952
Thank you.

486
00:41:35,248 --> 00:41:37,667
Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.

487
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:41,338
Truck stop,
two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.

488
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:42,881
- One hour.
- What?

489
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,466
One hour. You in or out?

490
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:48,261
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

491
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,472
One hour. If you miss it

492
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,391
don't ever show your face in here again.

493
00:41:59,356 --> 00:42:02,234
Exit 13 off the 25 South, to a truck...

494
00:42:02,442 --> 00:42:05,570
<i>- Come on! Come on!
- Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

495
00:42:05,779 --> 00:42:08,573
Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.

496
00:42:08,782 --> 00:42:10,617
Pick up the phone.

497
00:42:11,284 --> 00:42:14,162
I'm coming by. I need the product.

498
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:16,164
I need the product now.

499
00:43:03,587 --> 00:43:06,047
Oh, God.

500
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:18,977
Jesse.

501
00:43:22,397 --> 00:43:24,024
Jesse!

502
00:43:24,649 --> 00:43:26,276
Jesse.

503
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,820
Jesse.

504
00:43:48,715 --> 00:43:51,426
Jesse. Jesse.

505
00:43:52,594 --> 00:43:54,387
Jesse.

506
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:18,370
Jesse.

507
00:44:18,578 --> 00:44:20,163
Jesse. Jesse, wake up.

508
00:44:20,372 --> 00:44:22,040
Jesse.

509
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:25,377
Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.

510
00:44:25,585 --> 00:44:26,711
Wake up!

511
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,505
Come on, damn it.

512
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:30,006
Wake up.

513
00:44:31,383 --> 00:44:32,384
Where'd you put it?

514
00:44:32,592 --> 00:44:34,469
- Where's the product?
- Get off of me.

515
00:44:34,553 --> 00:44:37,431
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

516
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:39,391
- In the kitchen.
- Where?

517
00:44:40,225 --> 00:44:42,227
Under the sink.

518
00:45:44,664 --> 00:45:49,628
No. No, no, no.
Not now, not now. Not now!
