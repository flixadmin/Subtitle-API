1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,880
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,520
Well, you really have
buggered everything up this time.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,160
<i>Guys... I think we broke time.</i>

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,200
As you can see,
my agents are hard at work,

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,440
dealing with these anachronisms
that you created.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,520
Anachronisms?

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,240
People, places, and things displaced
from their native time periods.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,680
I am Gaius Julius Caesar of Rome.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,200
I told you, I was leaving
to create an organization

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
to replace the Time Masters.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,640
Rip doesn't think
he needs us now that

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,720
he's got the Time Bureau.

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,320
'Cause the Time Bureau
is capable of getting

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,400
the job done without the mess.

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,720
We're the ones who broke history.

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,920
We should be the ones that fix it.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,720
- Problem solved.
- I got to say, Ms. Lance.

18
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,880
Now that I've seen your team
in action with my own eyes...

19
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,080
Howdy.

20
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,360
You are even worse than I imagined.

21
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,320
Don't look!

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,640
What are you doing here?

23
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,800
I live here.

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
What's all this?

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,080
What part of "I'm making
your birthday surprise.

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,120
Stay out of the apartment"
did you not understand?

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,800
I thought you meant

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,560
lingerie and, you know, sex.

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,560
Not whatever this is.

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,880
I'm making donuts...

31
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,800
chocolate-covered donuts...

32
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,200
'cause you said
they were your favorite

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,320
when you were little.

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,680
You're making them from scratch?

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,960
How else would I make them?

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,040
You do what my mom
did. You go to the corner store

37
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,440
and you get them for two bucks a box.

38
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,240
Nobody makes anything
from scratch anymore.

39
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,000
So all this was for nothing?

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,120
No. Donuts are never for nothing...

41
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,480
and I'm being creative.

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
I'm sure I can figure out a way
to use that chocolate sauce.

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
I got it. Don't worry.

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
No, got it.

45
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
All right.

46
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,240
Five-second rule.
We're good. We're good.

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
I'll make some more.

48
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,240
No, no, no. You are done.

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,440
You can't do anything else.

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,720
We are doing
the rest of this, 2017-style.

51
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,840
Where are you going?

52
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,200
I'm going to the corner store

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,840
to get us chocolate-covered donuts

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,160
the way my mom used to buy them.

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,080
<i>Tonight's breaking news</i>

56
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,800
<i>Vixen caught on camera.</i>

57
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,920
<i>This video is rare footage of Vixen,</i>

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,320
<i>Detroit's own super-heroine,

59
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,000

and corrupt cops alike</i>

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
{\an5}<i>since she first appeared
in the city three years ago.</i>

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,560
All right.
I got all my mom's favorites.

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,160
I got chocolate donuts...

63
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,320
crème cake...

64
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Hello?

65
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Amaya.

66
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,880
<i>Hello?</i>

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,200
{\an5}Hello? Anybody home? McFly?

68
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,240
Sorry, guys. I was just...

69
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,280
I was just thinking about donuts.

70
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,160
Okay, so, where are we?

71
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,080
I was saying, I reverse-engineered

72
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,440
the Time Bureau tech
that Mick stole from Rip.

73
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,320
Now, we can locate anachronisms too.

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,680
- Nice work, man.
- Also, check this out.

75
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,840
Our run-in with
Caesar got me thinking.

76
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,440
What if there was a way

77
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,840
to contain the anachronisms
that we pick up

78
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,360
and not have them causing
trouble on the ship

79
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,800
or taking things they shouldn't?

80
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,160
Yeah, that's what
we got the brig for.

81
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,280
Well, what if we have another
LA situation?

82
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,320
Try putting a dinosaur in the brig.

83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,240
- Not going to happen.
- No.

84
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Unless it's an <i>Aquilops.</i>

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,320
- Or a Compsognathus.
- Or a cute little <i>Oviraptor.</i>

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,520
Okay, so just...
how do we contain them?

87
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
We make it smaller.

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,440
You built a shrink ray.

89
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,200
I'm not particularly
fond of that name.

90
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,880
I'm calling
it the hyper-molecular compressor.

91
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,040
It's a more powerful and portable
version of the tech from my suit.

92
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
So a shrink ray?

93
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,880
Essentially.

94
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,040
I perfected the work

95
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,520
I was moonlighting on at Upswips.

96
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,520
Nice.

97
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,720
It'll return to normal size
in 24 hours.

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,800
Or, if you don't want to wait...

99
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,960
Oh, ho, ho, you are on fire, dude.

100
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,280
All right.
Let's gather the rest of the team

101
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,920
and check out
the new anachronism map.

102
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,160
We really messed up time.

103
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,320
Looks like we gave time acne.

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,840
Each of these dots

105
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,960
represents an anachronism
we created by breaking time.

106
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,720
Rip's Bureau rates them
on a scale of one to ten

107
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,880
according to their magnitude
of impact and potential difficulty.

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,840
Gideon, can you analyze this data?

109
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,360
<i>Certainly, Dr. Palmer.</i>

110
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,280
Look at all these.
It's going to take a lifetime

111
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,480
to clean up this mess.

112
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,720
Maybe several.

113
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Where should we start?

114
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,200
What about Great Wall of China,
level six?

115
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,120
I had Chinese last night.

116
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,400
Where can I get a steak?

117
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,080
How about the North Atlantic Ocean?

118
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,360
April 1912?

119
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,160
I hear the Titanic had amazing food.

120
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,680
Absolutely not.

121
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,600
I refuse to set foot on the Titanic.

122
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
Whoever built that ship
ought to be shot.

123
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,440
Anyways...

124
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,480
I'm sure Little Miss Time Bureau

125
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
would love to see us mess this up.

126
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,560
So let's find something easy.

127
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,760
A nice slam dunk.

128
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,680
Oh. Wisconsin, 1870.

129
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
It's a level one.

130
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,440
<i>Oh, I do hope you choose that one.</i>

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,960
{\an5}<i>The anachronism is located
at the grounds</i>

132
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,160
{\an5}<i>of a P.T. Barnum's Roving
Museum of Freaks</i>

133
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,600
<i>and Hypnotic Hippodrome.</i>

134
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,880
<i>Although he is erroneously credited
with the phrase</i>

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,320
<i>"There's a sucker born
every minute"...</i>

136
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,080
<i>in truth, Mr. Barnum would
have never</i>

137
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,640
<i>belittled paying customers.</i>

138
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,960
Perfect.

139
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,840
We're bringing the circus
to the circus.

140
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,480
This is a classic slice of Americana.

141
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
The air is thick with the smell

142
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,560
of popcorn, candy, and wonder.

143
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,160
If I see a clown, I'm out of here.

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,600
What? You afraid of clowns?

145
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,920
No. I...

146
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,760
just don't like their stupid faces

147
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,240
and funny shoes and...

148
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,800
razor-sharp teeth.

149
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,920
Their what?

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,160
All right, guys.
If you were an anachronism

151
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,000
hiding in the circus,
where would you be?

152
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,960
How about in there?

153
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,240
King Tut's tomb? No way.

154
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
No way indeed.

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,760
They covered it in flour
to make it look old.

156
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,320
Bearded lady, hormone imbalance.

157
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,640
Mr. Rory would make

158
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
a far more convincing Cro-Magnon.

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,440
{\an5}Marty, you can't look
behind the curtain.

160
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,840
{\an5}- Spoils the fun.
- Fun?

161
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,200
Tricks and humbug are all I see.

162
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,120
And these uneducated rubes

163
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
come here in droves...

164
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
begging to be fooled.

165
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,200
No. People want to live in a world

166
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,680
where anything's possible.

167
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
They wanna be amazed.

168
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,200
{\an5}Yes, and amazing as this is,
we're wasting time.

169
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
Let's split up.

170
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,200
Ladies and gentlemen!

171
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,000
Welcome, one and all,

172
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,840
to the Best Show On Earth!

173
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,480
That is a working title.

174
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,520
My roving show of wonders

175
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,240
has the most remarkable of oddities

176
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,160
in store for you today.

177
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,880
Is it beautiful?

178
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,840
The very definition.

179
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,600
Is it deadly?

180
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,960
{\an5}It can take your head
from your shoulders

181
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,080
in a single bite.

182
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,240
{\an5}What makes this creature
such a marvel

183
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,160
is that it has been extinct

184
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,720
for the last 10,000 years.

185
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
Are you guys hearing this?

186
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,040
Could be our anachronism.

187
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Or another humbug.

188
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,520
Check it out, just to be safe.

189
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,880
This exclusive,

190
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

191
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,400
could be yours...

192
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,680
for only a nickel.

193
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,320
Yo, what's that smell?

194
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,000
Where there's poop...

195
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
There's a prize.

196
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Check it out.

197
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,960
Well, do we have to?

198
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,520
This is definitely feline feces...

199
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,560
but unlike any I've ever seen.

200
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,080
You've studied
a lot of poop, big guy?

201
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,280
As an Eagle Scout, I can interpret
175 different droppings.

202
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,720
The color and viscosity

203
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,480
indicate a carnivorous diet.

204
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,400
{\an5}But this movement took
a long time to pass.

205
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,080
The meat looks like it was tough...

206
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,800
like a rhinoceros or elephant hide.

207
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,280
I speak of a creature

208
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
that comes to you...

209
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,520
from the distant past!

210
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,960
I know what our anachronism is.

211
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,520
Contain it, quick.

212
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,200
<i>We can't let these people
see the anachronism.</i>

213
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,920
<i>We don't want this
to get any worse.</i>

214
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,160
Bingo.

215
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,320
Gentlemen...

216
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,680
may I present to you...

217
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,480
the saber-toothed tiger!

218
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Did I mention that...

219
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm allergic to cats?

220
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,360
Please tell me you brought
your shrink ray.

221
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,040
"Molecular hyper-compressor."

222
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,160
And yes.

223
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,360
Ray...

224
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Shrinking a vase

225
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,320
is very different
from shrinking an extinct tiger.

226
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,280
Okay? I have to account
for speed, lifespan...

227
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,960
gender... you think
it's a male or female?

228
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,160
I think it's awake.

229
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,720
Ray, shoot it! Shoot it!

230
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
- A few more adjustments...
- Shoot it!

231
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,880
Oh, no.

232
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,760
Are you guys okay?

233
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
I heard a roar.

234
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,160
{\an5}Looks like our problem
got a whole lot bigger.

235
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,080
Let me get this straight.

236
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,160
You three released a giant

237
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,440
saber-toothed tiger.

238
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,960
"Release" isn't the word I'd use.

239
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,680
Yeah, more like...

240
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
"didn't contain".

241
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,920
Gideon, what's the status
of the anachronism?

242
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,280
<i>The anachronism has elevated</i>

243
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,560
<i>- from level one to level four.</i>
- What?

244
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
How is that even a thing?

245
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,360
We made it worse, that's how.

246
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,760
Okay, so we just get Ray

247
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,440
{\an5}some allergy medicine
and go back out there.

248
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,840
{\an5}None of us even have
experience with animals.

249
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
Stay on the ship.

250
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
Stay out of trouble.

251
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,680
Where the hell's she going?

252
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Hey, girl.

253
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,360
How 'bout one final mission

254
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,680
for old times' sake?

255
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,040
I can't go with you, Sara.

256
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,920
{\an5}Look, I'm not asking you
to join back up.

257
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,080
Just one, easy mission.

258
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,320
{\an5}Trapping a giant
saber-toothed tiger is easy?

259
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,040
For you. Your powers

260
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,880
are the quickest way to handle this.

261
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,080
Look. Amaya, I can't

262
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,840
give the Time Bureau an excuse
to take the Waverider again.

263
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,200
I want to help you...

264
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,360
but my life's a little complicated
right now.

265
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,000
Amaya, Amaya! Amaya!

266
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,320
Foyinsola, this is Sara.

267
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,800
Hey. What you got there?

268
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,440
I found it in an acacia tree.

269
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,640
No, please! No!

270
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,760
You should be asleep, little one.

271
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,200
Now run along to bed...

272
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
before I have to summon

273
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,160
the ashe of a cobra to scare you!

274
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,280
Normal life. It suits you.

275
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,240
You seem at peace here.

276
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Good-bye, Amaya.

277
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,640
It was good to see you.

278
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Wait.

279
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,120
Does Nathaniel know
that I'd be returning?

280
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Yeah.

281
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
He's thrilled.

282
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,400
<i>I raise the pot one...</i>

283
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
dishes duty.

284
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
All right, Professor.

285
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,240
You sly fox, I will raise you one...

286
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Amaya.

287
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,280
Can't bet what
you've already lost, pretty.

288
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,600
Hello, Nathaniel.

289
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,520
Amaya!

290
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,080
Hey, what's good, girl?

291
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,360
Come on. How you been?

292
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,160
I missed you.

293
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,720
- Hello.
- Professor Stein.

294
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,800
Ship's not the same without you.

295
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,760
But we're fine without you.
Everything is running smoothly.

296
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,000
Is that right?

297
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,120
Haircut here

298
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,680
"embiggened" an extinct tiger.

299
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,600
Which Amaya and I
are going to catch.

300
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,120
And then I have to return to Zambesi.

301
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,400
We're going to need your
shrink ray, Ray.

302
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,800
Well, I... I thought we talked
about... not calling it that.

303
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,480
And don't you need the rest of us?

304
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,960
- We can handle it.
- Really?

305
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,880
You don't want us to come along
and mess things up?

306
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
Enjoy your night.

307
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,960
You didn't tell Nathaniel, did you?

308
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
It's cool.

309
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,040
This is so not cool.

310
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,240
First, Amaya ghosts on me
on my birthday.

311
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,400
No heads-up.

312
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,000
Then she shows back up
on the ship

313
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,040
again, no heads-up.

314
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,560
Bro... she's from 1942.

315
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,360
Did you really think
that was going to work?

316
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,120
Nah, but we were happy.

317
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
What happened?

318
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,960
I don't know,
but instead of drinking,

319
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
maybe you should go find out.

320
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
No.

321
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
She didn't want to talk then.

322
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,840
Why would she want to talk now?
And look...

323
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,200
I don't want to sound like a jerk...

324
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,160
but she kind of let herself go.

325
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,800
Yeah, you keep telling
yourself that, buddy.

326
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,760
The tiger's heading east.

327
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,240
It looks like he stopped here
to sharpen his claws.

328
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,680
Don't tell me the infamous Sara Lance

329
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,000
is scared of a big cat.

330
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,160
Giant tiger.

331
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,400
Don't worry.

332
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,600
To animals, humans are the predators.

333
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,840
Even to other humans.

334
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,520
Whatever you do, don't run.

335
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,280
I spent my last greenback
on that feline oddity.

336
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,600
Circus is shutting down.

337
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,440
You know I'd rather die

338
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,280
before going back to Salem, Phineas.

339
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,920
There's some small-minded
folk back there.

340
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,080
Small-minded folk everywhere.

341
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,280
Even the most retrograde ingrate

342
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,800
wants to be entertained.

343
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,920
The human spirit, it longs
for edification and delight.

344
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,000
We just need a show-stopper

345
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,120
to edify and delight them.

346
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,160
- Are you on Upswips?
- Yeah.

347
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,480
Connected through the Waverider.

348
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
This is Cindy.

349
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,680
- 5'9". Profession: weather reporter.
- Okay.

350
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,960
Loves kale.

351
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Says she wants to meet up.
That's nice.

352
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,640
"Do... you...

353
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,280
Have a time machine?"

354
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,120
Just talk to Amaya.

355
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,840
That's what Jax said. Wait.

356
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,560
Are you two conspi...

357
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,160
Are you conspiring against me?

358
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,360
Hey, hey, hey!

359
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,760
Hey! You owe the lady an apology.

360
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,560
That's not a lady.

361
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,840
That's a freak.

362
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,720
Are you trying to
pick a fight with me?

363
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,120
Because I would love
to get into a fight right now.

364
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
If she's a freak, what am I?

365
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,640
That was marvelous!

366
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,400
A round of drinks, on me!

367
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,680
It's... actually,
it's time for us to be going.

368
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,960
No, no, come on,
hey, we just met. Please.

369
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,120
Oh, you got to tell me.

370
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,480
Where did you learn
a humbug like that?

371
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,520
Well, that's no humbug,
P to the T.

372
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,640
You see, people like us,
we got to stick together.

373
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,440
And by the way,
your beard... it's beautiful.

374
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,720
- You're so sweet.
- She said I'm sweet.

375
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm sorry, "people like us"?

376
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,920
Yeah. My friend Jax here
turns to fire and flies.

377
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,280
No, no, that's...

378
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,760
that's just the whiskey talking.
Right, buddy?

379
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,320
No, it's true. And my friend Ray
here turns teeny-weeny.

380
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,880
Teeny-weeny.

381
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
That's very funny, Nate.

382
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,760
Also, they're both capable of flight.

383
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,520
Yeah. But if you want to know
a real freak, P.T.,

384
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,400
it's my ex-girlfriend.

385
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,080
She can summon the power
of any animal.

386
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,400
Is that right?

387
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,840
I have an idea, fellas.

388
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,480
How 'bout we meet...

389
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,640
retire back to the circus...

390
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,480
for a little private show

391
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,760
where I guarantee I've got

392
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,800
the most beautiful and flexible
acrobats you've ever seen?

393
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,440
P.T. Barnum, you're on.

394
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,600
You had me at "circus".

395
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,840
Shouldn't you ashe up?

396
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,840
No, no, that'll just provoke him.

397
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Move downwind.

398
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,880
I'll distract and you shrink.

399
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
Easy.

400
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,720
I'm not here to hurt you.

401
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
It's kind of cute.

402
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,320
Well, I'm glad Nate
finally took our advice

403
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,520
and went to talk to Amaya.

404
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Yeah, true. But man,
he is about to miss out.

405
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,280
I thought we needed the tin man.

406
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,040
In due time.

407
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,080
We have his friends.

408
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,120
Oh, smile, Hildy.

409
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,640
We just might save the circus yet.

410
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,800
Hey, sunshine!

411
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,280
What are you doing in my room?

412
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,880
Oh, this is not my room.

413
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,040
Where are Jax and Ray?

414
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yelling.

415
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,360
I'm going to die. I don't remember.

416
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,120
What's the last thing
that you do remember?

417
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Oh. Whiskey.

418
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
So...

419
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
So what's...

420
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,240
It's all...

421
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,560
it's all coming back to me.

422
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,440
We were headed to a circus

423
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,520
for a private show.

424
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,360
And then what?
You decided to peel off

425
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,640
and sleep in the cargo bay?

426
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,280
How could you abandon
your own team?

427
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,040
Oh, you... you're one to talk.

428
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,880
All right, let's stop wasting time.

429
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Let's go.

430
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,680
The loss of my saber-toothed tiger

431
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,920
was indeed a blow.

432
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,280
But the fates have smiled
on me again.

433
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,800
Because the "God of Fire"

434
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,640
and "The Incredible Shrinking Man"

435
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,560
have joined my troupe.

436
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,520
I think we've had a...
slight misunderstanding.

437
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,720
And I am truly grateful

438
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,600
that you have not used
your special abilities

439
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,880
to try to escape.

440
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,840
"Special abilities"? Man...

441
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,360
like I told you before...

442
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,520
that was just the liquor talking.

443
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,680
He's right. Okay?
My friend and I, we're just regular

444
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,640
plain, old folk from 1870.

445
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,080
Dishonesty is not
your strong suit, my good man.

446
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,520
I saw what your friend did.

447
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,480
That was no trick.

448
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,280
And he says you two...

449
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,160
are capable of wonders

450
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,560
just as marvelous.

451
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
So...

452
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,800
chop-chop.

453
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,920
Don't be shy.

454
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,040
We can't.

455
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,680
- Oh, poppycock.
- But he's right.

456
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,800
He can't fire up without his partner,

457
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,920
who's not here.

458
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,080
And I can't shrink
without my exo-suit.

459
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Also not here.

460
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,640
So you might as well just let us go

461
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,680
'cause we are obviously useless.

462
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,840
Totally useless.

463
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Don't worry.

464
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,720
I'll make marvels out of you yet.

465
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,520
You said Ray and Jax
would be here.

466
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,280
They're probably eating
breakfast sandwiches

467
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,040
and eating a handful of aspirin.

468
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,880
Or, maybe they're in trouble.

469
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Here?

470
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,240
This place is harmless.

471
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,000
Then why are we being watched?

472
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,040
Guy in the hat, 6.00 o'clock?

473
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
That guy?

474
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Gary?

475
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,880
Nice work, Nathaniel.

476
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,240
What, you think I spooked him?

477
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,280
The smell of your breath
alone would be enough.

478
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
You know what?

479
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,200
You don't get to criticize me.
And you know why?

480
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,480
Because you're no longer
a member of this team.

481
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,120
You're right.

482
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
I am?

483
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,760
I don't blame you for going out

484
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,480
and getting pie-eyed last night.

485
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,800
That's cool. I don't blame you
for saying "pie-eyed".

486
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,960
My point is...

487
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,080
Sara should have told you

488
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,280
that she was bringing me back
from Zambesi.

489
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
It must have been upsetting
when I just...

490
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,880
Whoa, whoa, hang on.

491
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,320
You think last night
was because of you?

492
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,320
Oh, my God. Amaya,
you are so conceited.

493
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,520
Last night wasn't
even remotely about you.

494
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,120
- At all.
- What was it about?

495
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,600
It was about me and the boys
doing what we do.

496
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,520
Hanging out. Sharing a few laughs.

497
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,920
Having a few drinks.

498
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,560
Ending up in a freak show.

499
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,200
You like meat, huh?

500
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,160
Yeah, all right.

501
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,040
There we go.

502
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,240
Come back here,
you little rat bastard!

503
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,880
I don't understand.

504
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,040
Who is this man and why
have we taken him prisoner?

505
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,040
Professor Stein, meet Gary.

506
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
Please don't kill me.

507
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,040
I won't, if you tell us

508
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,280
why you were tailing us.

509
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
- You two know each other?
- Gary here

510
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,880
works for Rip's Time Bureau.

511
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,600
And I'm guessing Agent Sharpe

512
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,200
had her little stooge spying on us.

513
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,560
Isn't that right, Gary?

514
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,960
Well, I'm not at liberty

515
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,520
to discuss the nature of my...

516
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
All right, yes!

517
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,080
Oh, she sent me to spy on you.

518
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,560
Good thing, too.
Since you arrived here,

519
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
the anachronism has jumped

520
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,760
from a level one to a level six.

521
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,480
We found the saber-tooth

522
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,840
and it is safe and sound in its cage.

523
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,480
So, I don't know how we could have

524
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,680
made the anachronism worse.

525
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,920
My guess is we can thank

526
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,560
our two missing teammates for that.

527
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Nate, Amaya.

528
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,720
Please tell me
you found the Hardy Boys.

529
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,080
Let's just hope
they had the good sense

530
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
to stick together.

531
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,880
Oh, they're stuck together,
all right.

532
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,080
P.T. Barnum has them dressed
as conjoined twins.

533
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,640
Guys, get us out of here.

534
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,120
Man, I thought I had a rough night.

535
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,920
- Not funny, Nate.
- Yeah, come on.

536
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,280
This harness is really uncomfortable.

537
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
Okay. I got this.

538
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,120
I must be dehydrated, man.

539
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,920
This never happened
to me before, I swear.

540
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,120
Where have I heard that one before?

541
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,240
Not from me.
She never heard that from me.

542
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,080
Amaya, an elephant actually would

543
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,440
come in really handy right now.

544
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Well.

545
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,920
Look who joined the circus.

546
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,000
We're gonna need a bigger tent.

547
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,160
I take it you're still too dehydrated

548
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
to get us out of here.

549
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,680
Oh, God...

550
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,640
Just stop judging me

551
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,040
and just summon your animal powers.

552
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,400
Believe me, you do not

553
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,400
want me using this totem right now.

554
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,520
What does that mean?

555
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,800
I'm sorry, Nathaniel.

556
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,720
For what? For not using your powers
or ditching me on my birthday

557
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,480
to hitch a ride back to Zambesi?

558
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,120
I didn't go to Zambesi.

559
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,280
Not right away.

560
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,920
First, I went to Detroit.

561
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,680
Detroit.

562
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,320
I had to see her in person.

563
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,320
Mari. My granddaughter.

564
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,200
I had to see if she was

565
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,400
as incredible as people said she was.

566
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,680
I watched her save
five people in one night.

567
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,800
She never knew I was there.

568
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,360
But, I knew that she was perfect.

569
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,040
I know it doesn't help...

570
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,200
but, my decision to leave
had nothing to do with you.

571
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,960
You're right. It doesn't.

572
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,520
'Cause if your badass granddaughter

573
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,040
was in 2017, why'd you
have to go back to 1942?

574
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,760
I asked Rip the same question.

575
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,520
He said that time
hadn't yet solidified.

576
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,000
But if I stayed too long in 2017...

577
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,440
then Mari would disappear.

578
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,520
Why didn't you say anything?

579
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,080
I hated you for what you did.

580
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,680
I needed you to hate me...

581
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,360
so that you would move on.

582
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,600
If you knew how much it hurt me...

583
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
I would've found you.

584
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,000
I wanted to protect
my granddaughter.

585
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,920
And I wanted to protect you.

586
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,800
Well, no offense, Amaya.

587
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,400
But considering we're both
stuck in a rhino cage,

588
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,160
I say your plan backfired.

589
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,560
This is agent 1-0-6-6.

590
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,720
<i>You failed to turn in
your status report, Gary.</i>

591
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,560
<i>And then, you ignored
my attempts to contact you.</i>

592
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,880
<i>And somehow, during all of that,
the level one has escalated.</i>

593
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,800
<i>To a level eight.</i>

594
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,560
<i>And where the hell are you?</i>

595
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,280
<i>Is that the Waverider?</i>

596
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,960
<i>I told you
to keep an eye on the Legends,</i>

597
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
<i>not to join them.</i>

598
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
Turns out...

599
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,240
the Legends had things under control.

600
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,120
Oh, it was my interference

601
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,320
with their, to be honest, expert

602
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,600
handling of the situation

603
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,120
which caused things to, well...

604
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
escalate.

605
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,760
<i>Gary, if you are in over your head,</i>

606
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,800
<i>I can send backup immediately.</i>

607
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,720
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no backup.

608
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,160
Oh, like I said...

609
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,520
the Legends
have things under control.

610
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,400
Oh, nice chatting.

611
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,240
- Got to go.
<i>- Gar...</i>

612
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,960
- How'd I do?
- You were great.

613
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,840
I sense that Jefferson
is extremely nervous.

614
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,240
Don't worry.

615
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,720
We just have to rescue the team

616
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
and get back on the ship

617
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,120
before that saber-tooth "embiggens".

618
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,240
At least we know why
the scale of the anachronism

619
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
keeps climbing...

620
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,880
P.T. Barnum with real superheroes.

621
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,160
He'll expose Nate and Amaya
to the entire world.

622
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,000
<i>I'm detecting increased
chronometric interference, Captain.</i>

623
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,960
<i>Agent Sharpe has boarded
the Waverider.</i>

624
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,480
Get Rory.
You two have to save the others.

625
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,640
Wait, wait. The two of us?

626
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,880
Are you mad?

627
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,120
You can do this.

628
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,680
- I have faith in you.
- Why?

629
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,920
Oh, just go!

630
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,240
I'll hold her off as long as I can.

631
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,800
Sara Lance.

632
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,080
On behalf of the Time Bureau,

633
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,320
I am placing you and your team
under arrest.

634
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,440
Took you long enough.

635
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,680
I've been expecting you for hours.

636
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,680
Pursuant to title 16, section 3053,

637
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,080
of the Global Treaty on Time Travel,

638
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,440
I have the authority
to bring you and your team in.

639
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,960
Which arm?

640
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,440
The Global Treaty was negotiated

641
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,400
between Director Hunter
and the United Nations.

642
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,760
No, I mean...

643
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,920
if you try to bring me
in to the Bureau...

644
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,080
I'll break your arm.

645
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,160
It's up to you. Right or left?

646
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,800
Your threats may work on
Confederate zombies,

647
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,040
Quentin Turnbull's cronies,

648
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,720
and speedsters,
but you don't scare me.

649
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,960
I've spent the last five years

650
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
watching your screw-ups.

651
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
I know everything about you.

652
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,840
Now, where is the member of my team

653
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,160
- that you've taken hostage?
- You mean Gary?

654
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,160
This ship is probably like a vacation

655
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,800
after having to answer to you.

656
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Last chance.

657
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,920
Come quietly, and I'll make sure

658
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,840
you get your job back
at Sink, Shower, & Stuff.

659
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,280
When did a Legend ever go quietly?

660
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
What are you looking at?

661
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,800
Clowns...

662
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,320
Get a grip, man!

663
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,280
We're already down
four members of our team.

664
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

665
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,880
welcome to the Greatest
Show On The Planet!

666
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,480
My roving museum of freaks
and hypnotic hippodrome

667
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,240
has traveled this great nation.

668
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,760
And, I must say, I have never seen

669
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,920
quite a good-looking and, dare I say,

670
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,360
astute audience

671
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,040
as the one gathered
before me here today.

672
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,120
But a word of warning
before we begin.

673
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,480
For the jaw-dropping spectacle
that you are about to see

674
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,920
is not for the faint of heart.

675
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,440
May I now present you

676
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,680
Yin and Yang.

677
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,240
The wondrous and world-renowned

678
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,480
Siamese twins.

679
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,200
Oh, my God.

680
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,720
A miracle of Biblical proportions.

681
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,920
One mother, two fathers.

682
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm not judging.

683
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,840
Both sons capable
of amazing strength,

684
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,080
intelligence, and coordination.

685
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
So juggle.

686
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,560
You need to create a diversion

687
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,400
so we can get past those thugs

688
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,160
and merge with Jefferson.

689
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,040
You're on your own,
Professor. Clowns.

690
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
Don't leave...

691
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Now what?

692
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,920
So, you ready for your debut?

693
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,280
Kiss my ass.

694
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,320
Don't have time to convince you

695
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,960
of the creative joys
and lucrative appeal

696
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,160
of being my show-stopper.

697
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,920
Those hayseeds out there

698
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,360
are going to burn my circus down

699
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,360
if we don't give them
their money's worth.

700
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,400
Let me make it very simple for you.

701
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,120
Become the "Man of Steel"...

702
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,760
that is very catchy,
make a note of that...

703
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,240
or get shot.

704
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
I don't respond well to threats.

705
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,360
- Nathaniel...
- No.

706
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,320
I'm not one of your freaks.

707
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,840
Would you steel up for her?

708
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,760
Fine. I'll do it.

709
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,920
Rip should have recruited you
to the Time Bureau.

710
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,760
Rip knows I'd never leave the team.

711
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Your mistake.

712
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,720
You want to take a break?

713
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,240
- I could use some water.
- Yeah.

714
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,320
Hope that thing's potty-trained.

715
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,080
Probably not. Cats are jerks.

716
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,720
Let me guess.
You're a dog person.

717
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,680
I like them dumb and loyal.

718
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,120
Speaking of, we should
probably check on Gary.

719
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,320
Whatever you do...

720
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
don't...

721
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Run.

722
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,000
Where did you get a Time Courier?

723
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,480
Oh, would someone mind untying me?

724
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,000
That is stolen government property.

725
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,240
It's just that I have
really bad circulation.

726
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,520
You're just mad

727
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,280
'cause I saved your life, again.

728
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,840
<i>Captain Lance. I hate to interrupt.</i>

729
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,920
<i>But I thought you'd like to know
that the anachronism</i>

730
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,200
<i>has reached a level nine.</i>

731
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
My team's on it.

732
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,720
And if they fail,
maybe Rip will finally give up

733
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,000
on the ridiculous belief

734
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,640
that your team
could actually defeat...

735
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,920
You know what?

736
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,080
He's going to take your ship
away, Ms. Lance.

737
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Again.

738
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,760
Oh, no.

739
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,640
Son of a gun, it worked.

740
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,280
You really are quite marvelous.

741
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
No more.

742
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,920
- No more.
- Oh, come on. One more.

743
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Take care of that.

744
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,080
Gordy!

745
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Hey!

746
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,440
Die, clown!

747
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,400
Mr. Rory, a little help here.

748
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,240
Balloon animals, Grey? Really?

749
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,840
The applause
might have gone to my head.

750
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,960
This is amazing!

751
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,760
Guys, Amaya looks like
she's going to kill him.

752
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Wow.

753
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
Stop her, Jefferson!

754
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
Amaya, no!

755
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,760
Amaya, no, no, no.
No, no, hey, hey,

756
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,280
hey, you can fight whatever this is.

757
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,600
You're Amaya Jiwe.

758
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,240
You're a member of the
Justice Society of America.

759
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,560
You're the most courageous
person I know.

760
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
That totem

761
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,040
makes you a protector, not a killer.

762
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Amaya.

763
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Come back to me.

764
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,600
Sorry.

765
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,680
Sorry.

766
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,320
- Nate.
- I'm right here.

767
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,200
I'm right here.

768
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
I got you.

769
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,600
And that's a grand finale, folks.

770
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,200
I told you it wasn't
for the faint of heart.

771
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,960
We had it all.

772
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,480
We had action.

773
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,960
We... we have romance.

774
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,880
We had flaming things in the sky.

775
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,840
You wait until next week's show.

776
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,840
Well, Mr. Sneezums

777
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,480
is now a more manageable size.

778
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,480
- Mr. Sneezums?
- Yeah. You like it?

779
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,960
The most important thing
is we put on one hell of a show

780
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,600
and Grey now loves the circus.

781
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,440
- I don't believe you.
- Oh, it's true.

782
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,080
He now thinks
that without the circus,

783
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,760
the world has lost one
of its last true places of wonder.

784
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,200
I mean, I don't believe that

785
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,600
the anachronism has been dealt with.

786
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,160
<i>Believe it, Agent Sharpe.</i>

787
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,520
<i>As I've already communicated</i>

788
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,640
<i>to Director Bennett,</i>

789
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,240
<i>1870 Wisconsin is anachronism- free.</i>

790
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,760
Oh, even our AI doesn't like you.

791
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,040
Yep. My foot is definitely asleep.

792
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,280
- Gary...
- And my leg.

793
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,360
- Could be permanent.
- Wait. Who is this guy?

794
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,360
That's Gary. Can you give him a hand?

795
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,000
I need to speak with you.

796
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,080
In private.

797
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,280
Your sister, I presume?

798
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,400
And our friend Oliver.

799
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
So.

800
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,560
I suppose congratulations
are in order.

801
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
You get to keep your ship,
for now, but...

802
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,800
You will be watching us. Yes, yes.

803
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,120
I've heard this before,
so why don't you cut the crap

804
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,640
and tell me what we're facing here?

805
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,920
I don't know
what you're talking about.

806
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,080
You said,

807
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,920
"that Rip will finally give up

808
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,320
"his ridiculous belief

809
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,280
that your team could actually..."

810
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,920
and then you stopped yourself.

811
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,240
So let's have it.

812
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,440
Who are we facing?

813
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,160
That information is need-to-know.

814
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,960
And all you need to know is that you

815
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,600
and your "ridiculous" team
could never handle it.

816
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,800
Aren't you forgetting something?

817
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Gary.

818
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,960
Hey.

819
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,960
Do you want to talk
about what happened back there?

820
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,480
Not especially.

821
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
Look, it might help.

822
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,640
I'm glad you and I talked
about why you left me and...

823
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,520
- it made me feel better.
- It did?

824
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,920
A little.

825
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,600
In that case, I think the whole team
deserves to hear this.

826
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,760
It... it started a month ago.

827
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,560
Whenever I would tap into my powers,

828
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,640
I could feel myself losing control.

829
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,600
as if the animal was
in charge, not me.

830
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,720
One day,

831
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,080
Belgian soldiers came to my village.

832
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,720
I told them that Zambesi
was under my protection.

833
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,320
And when they attacked,
I killed them all.

834
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,280
Well, sounds like
you didn't have a choice.

835
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,080
No, you don't understand.

836
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,880
These soldiers were just boys.

837
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,120
When they tried to run,

838
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,840
I hunted them down

839
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,760
one by one by one
and I ripped them to shreds.

840
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,560
That's the real reason
you came back.

841
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,440
I needed a place to think.

842
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
This...

843
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,800
this totem is my birthright
and my sacred duty.

844
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,600
Something's terribly wrong.

845
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,520
What if I lose control
around my village?

846
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,720
I'm sorry. I...

847
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,600
I wanted to tell you...

848
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,320
all of you but, I was too ashamed.

849
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,840
Well, we've all done things
we're not proud of.

850
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,280
Except Haircut.

851
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,200
Well, no, actually...

852
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,400
I'm actually really bad
at returning library books.

853
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,240
I can't go home.

854
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,200
Not yet, but I'm not sure
that I can stay here either.

855
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,680
You saw me earlier.
You could all be in danger.

856
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,360
You are one of us.

857
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,160
Maybe now more than ever.

858
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,720
We'd be crazy to let you go.

859
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,960
Besides, we're really going
to need your help now.

860
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,480
We got a new problem.

861
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,800
Rip has been hiding something
from us.

862
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,800
There's a greater evil coming.

863
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,120
Something even the Time Bureau
is afraid of.

864
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,760
What can be worse

865
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,680
than an immortal Egyptian demigod?

866
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,480
Or an evil speedster?

867
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,720
Well, I'm afraid
of the time boogeyman.

868
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,120
I'm literally crying.

869
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,160
Welcome back, Kuasa.

870
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,240
Who are you?

871
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,040
A follower of Mallus.

872
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,560
And we have work to do.
