1
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,880
...salute you.

2
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,890
Be gentle, Hanno.

3
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,320
We invoke you
by your great names

4
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,150
to come to our aid.

5
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,930
Defeat the Romans.

6
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,590
Destroy their ships,

7
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,280
their engines of war,

8
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,240
and their soldiers.

9
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,330
We will prevail.

10
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,170
Ozalsces.

11
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,300
Arishat.

12
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,970
Hanno.

13
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,320
You did not make
an offering today.

14
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,800
I prefer to sacrifice a Roman.

15
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,040
Where you are,

16
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,170
I am, too.

17
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,740
And where you are,

18
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,740
I am, too, forever.

19
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,350
My wife.

20
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,650
The wind is too strong.
Furl sail and strike water.

21
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,090
Furl sail,
strike water!

22
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,180
Furl sail
and strike water!

23
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,540
Strike water!

24
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,830
They have no lands
but the ones they've stolen.

25
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,610
Wherever they go,
they leave destruction

26
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,400
and call it peace.

27
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,060
This is the last free city
in Africa Nova.

28
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,280
Today, we go into battle.

29
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,150
Pray that your god
is with you.
If he is not, he is no god.

30
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,510
We've nothing to fear.

31
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,510
Where death is, we are not.

32
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,950
Where we are,

33
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,770
death is not.

34
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,000
Stay together and listen
for my commands.

35
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,440
Your eyes up
and your head out.

36
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,870
Fire!

37
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,050
[man] Ready your weapons!

38
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,350
Again!

39
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,270
We're ablaze on the right!

40
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,360
Keep formation!

41
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,670
Pull!

42
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,640
Archers ready.

43
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,340
Release!

44
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,560
Nock!

45
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,960
Draw!

46
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,350
Loose!

47
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,570
Archers!

48
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,320
Fire!

49
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,820
- Raise the tower!
- Raise the tower!

50
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,180
- Back astern!
- Back astern!

51
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,190
Keep cranking.

52
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,900
Drop drawbridge!

53
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,550
The drawbridge is stuck!

54
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,650
Sir!

55
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,310
Loose!

56
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,670
Back.

57
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,820
Archers!

58
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,040
There!

59
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,470
Kill her!

60
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,650
Arishat!

61
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,680
Arishat.

62
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,130
Arishat!

63
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,220
I'll wait for you.

64
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,050
Check all the bodies!

65
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,010
Leave nothing!

66
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,600
I claim this city...

67
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,300
for the glory of Rome.

68
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,910
Vae victis.

69
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,390
Woe to the conquered.

70
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Next!

71
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,370
Move it!

72
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,310
- Down the stairs!
- Downstairs!

73
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,490
Hey.

74
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,750
What damage have they
done you, eh?

75
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,550
Lift it up. Easy, easy.

76
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,940
Hold that.

77
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,210
Arishat?

78
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,950
I am sorry, my son.

79
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,130
I have not long.

80
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,480
This galley

81
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,960
is sailing us to something
I cannot endure.

82
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,180
I am ready... to be taken
to another place.

83
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Stay here a while longer.

84
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,370
I remember well
when you first
were brought to us.

85
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,550
A lonely boy
from the desert.
Guileless.

86
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,890
Afraid.

87
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,160
You embraced everything
we taught you.

88
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,510
You found Arishat's love.
Your soul was replenished.

89
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,040
When I die,

90
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,000
my ancestors will meet me
in the next world.

91
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,350
Who will meet you?

92
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,660
Hanno,

93
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,660
I am done.

94
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,100
Do not let them change
what you are.

95
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,830
Have you seen this boy?

96
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,440
Eama! Eama!

97
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,280
You must
go alone now, Hanno.

98
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,850
Never let them find you.

99
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,420
Go. Go.

100
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,710
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

101
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,100
Emperor Geta.

102
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,060
Emperor Caracalla.

103
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,240
General Acacius.

104
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,330
I have taken Numidia
in your names

105
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,240
that your dominion
may eclipse that

106
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,510
of every emperor
that came before you.

107
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,120
Crown him with laurels, brother.

108
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,220
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

109
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,700
In honor
of your conquest,

110
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,790
there will be games
in the Colosseum.

111
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,580
I require no games
in my honor.

112
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,190
Serving the Senate
and the people of Rome

113
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,020
is honor enough for me.

114
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,890
You are too modest,
Acacius.

115
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,160
It does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

116
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,160
The glory is yours,
not mine.

117
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,340
I only ask for
some respite from war

118
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,950
to spend time
with my wife.

119
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,470
Your wife, yes.

120
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,210
Remember the privileges
we have granted her?

121
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,870
Where is she now
to ignore such an occasion?

122
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,700
There are victories
yet still to come.

123
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,880
Persia.

124
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,140
India.

125
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,010
Both... must be conquered.

126
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,450
Rome has so many subjects.

127
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,500
She must feed them.

128
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,980
They can eat war.

129
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,990
Your triumphs
will be celebrated

130
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,250
as a tribute
to the greatness

131
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,340
of the Roman people.

132
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,750
Go to hell!

133
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,340
Macrinus of Thysdrus,

134
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,600
master of gladiators!

135
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,020
Stay close.

136
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,210
Aediles
and the town councilors,

137
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,520
distinguished guests,

138
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,480
citizens of Antium,

139
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,570
behold the fate

140
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,530
of the conquered enemies
of Rome:

141
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:14,630
The barbarian Numidians
and their chieftain,

142
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,280
Jugurtha!

143
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,890
This one is interesting.

144
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,130
I'll buy him.

145
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,370
Halt! Who goes there?

146
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,160
General.

147
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,240
My lady.

148
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,820
I thank the gods
that brought you back home safe.

149
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,990
Thank the Army.
They protected me.

150
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,910
Mm.

151
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,650
Let me feed you.

152
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,380
Go.

153
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,460
To the wall.

154
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,560
The arena
is a sacred temple.

155
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,310
For the bravest of you,

156
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,260
the road to glory
runs through the arena.

157
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,400
The arena turns slaves
into gladiators

158
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,400
and gladiators into free men.

159
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,230
You have worms.

160
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,500
I know this one.
He eats monkeys.

161
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,040
Go. Sit. Eat.

162
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,750
You.

163
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,540
Hanno, get up.

164
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:12,590
What is
your native language?
I speak them all.

165
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,380
You don't answer because
you can't or because you won't?

166
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,730
Mm, all right.

167
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,610
Violence...
is the universal language.

168
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,390
Viggo,
put him through his paces.

169
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,350
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he
can fight a man.

170
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,340
Enough!

171
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,080
Very good.

172
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,960
Very good.

173
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,350
Hose him down.

174
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,570
Bring him to me.

175
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,890
Ah!

176
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,540
A strong jaw.

177
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,720
Good arms.

178
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,590
Better smell.

179
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,210
You will do well.

180
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,820
It is an art,

181
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,820
choosing gladiators.

182
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,470
Some choose entertainers.

183
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,610
Some choose brute force.

184
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,220
I choose rage.

185
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,220
Crowd loves blood.

186
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,050
And they love those who
love blood as much as they do.

187
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,620
And you, my friend, rage

188
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,580
pours out of you like...

189
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,580
like milk...

190
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,500
from a whore's tit.

191
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,240
You will be
quite the fighter.

192
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,890
Not for you.

193
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,070
You're right,
you do not fight for me.

194
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,510
I put you in the ring,
you fight or you die.

195
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,770
The choice is yours.

196
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,810
But whose head
could I give you

197
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,510
that would satisfy this fury?

198
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,520
The entire Roman Army's.

199
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,130
Too much.

200
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,830
Mm.

201
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
The general will do.

202
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,090
General?

203
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,440
- General Acacius?
- Mm.

204
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,320
Use your rage
in my service,

205
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:37,230
and you will have his head
ready for your sword.

206
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,540
Serve me and I will serve you.
Deny me...

207
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,420
and you will die.

208
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,160
There are times I wished
you'd abandoned me

209
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,030
rather than
fight their wars.

210
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,160
I've made my choice.

211
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,080
I can live with it.

212
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,130
But my patience with those two
is at an end.

213
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,090
Leta?

214
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,700
You may go
to your quarters now.
We need nothing more.

215
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,450
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead

216
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,280
on that beach at Numidia...

217
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,460
Lucilla.

218
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,070
No more.

219
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,560
I will not waste

220
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,210
another generation
of young men for their vanity.

221
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,960
If I fight another campaign,
it must be to depose them.

222
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,960
When will your troops
arrive?

223
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,090
They land at Ostia
in ten days.

224
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:00,190
How many of them will be
loyal to you alone?

225
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,230
All of them.

226
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,890
The emperors do not have
the support of the people.

227
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,720
The people are weary
of the madness, the tyranny.

228
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,860
What is the dream of Rome
if her people are not free?

229
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,710
Enjoy yourself,
everyone,

230
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,800
to excess!

231
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,850
Thank you. Thank you.

232
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,120
Oh!

233
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,910
Please, drink.

234
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,870
Ah! Excuse me. Macrinus!

235
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,830
I knew the provinces
were not enough for you.

236
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,090
I'm just here
- for the games.
- Ah, well,

237
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,790
you won't be disappointed.

238
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,090
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

239
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,450
Men like me, Thraex?
Men like us.

240
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,010
I know nothing happens
in Rome unless you've
tasted it first.

241
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,160
What is my purpose here?

242
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,690
You'll find out soon enough.

243
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,480
What's this we hear
about you being interested

244
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,260
in standing for election
to the Senate, Macrinus?

245
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,870
Me? No, I'm, uh...

246
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,440
I don't even know how
to use an abacus.

247
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,310
But I do understand that

248
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,840
it's customary
for your guests

249
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,530
to make wagers
at these affairs?

250
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,880
How large a sum
did you have in mind?

251
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,930
A thousand gold denarii?

252
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,410
Two.

253
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,540
Two?

254
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,770
Denarii.

255
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,440
Stand back! Stand back!

256
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,530
My emperors.

257
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,660
Lords, ladies and gentlemen,
and senators.

258
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,100
For your entertainment,

259
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,100
the art of combat!

260
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,930
May I present

261
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,110
the barbarian versus,

262
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,330
from my own stable,
the mighty Vichek!

263
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,210
- This is your gladiator?
- It is.

264
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,170
Three rounds,
hand to hand.

265
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,910
Swords!

266
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,310
We want swords.
A fight to the death.

267
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,570
No quarter to be offered...
or given.

268
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,790
Fight now!

269
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,410
Brother,

270
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,240
let's not kill each other
for their amusement.

271
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,170
Remarkable!

272
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,220
Remarkable!

273
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,440
Thraex,
he looked expensive.

274
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,970
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

275
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,320
Remarkable.

276
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,410
From where do you hail?

277
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,420
Speak.

278
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,250
I said speak.

279
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,030
He is from the colonies,
Your Majesty.

280
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,510
His native tongue
is all he understands.

281
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,000
"The gates of hell
are open night and day.

282
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:43,620
Smooth is the descent,
and easy is the way.

283
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,660
But...

284
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,840
to come back from hell

285
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,760
and view the cheerful skies,

286
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:59,460
in this the task
and mighty labor lies."

287
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,340
Virgil, Your Majesty.

288
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,380
Poetry!

289
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,430
- Very clever, Macrinus.
- Thank you.

290
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,040
I've grown so bored,
but you surprise me.

291
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,180
To amuse you is my only wish.

292
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,090
We are amused,
we are amused.

293
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,440
We are amused.

294
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,970
And we all look forward
to seeing your poet

295
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,360
perform in the arena.

296
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,410
As do I, Your Majesties.

297
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
Thank you.

298
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:40,720
Viggo?

299
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,550
Come with me.

300
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,130
You fought well today,
but you were lucky, too.

301
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,010
The lines you recited.

302
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,620
You didn't learn that
in Africa, I know that.

303
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,710
- A good verse travels far.
- Mm.

304
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,750
Who taught you poetry?

305
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,060
A captured Roman officer.

306
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:22,370
I was posted guard over him
and he used to tell us tales

307
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,370
to pass the time.

308
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,500
And what became
of this prisoner?

309
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,110
Oh, we ate him.

310
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,510
As barbarians do.

311
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,940
As barbarians do.

312
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,030
And where were you born?

313
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,430
Why does my past matter
if it is my future

314
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,730
to die for you in the arena?

315
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,610
Tell me what use have I
for Roman money.

316
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,400
A gladiator

317
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,050
can buy his own freedom.

318
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,930
His liberty.

319
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,580
The Roman dream.

320
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:03,670
No, the slave dreams
not of freedom

321
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,240
but of a slave
to call his own.

322
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,590
Cicero.

323
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,160
Is that what you were
raised on, Macrinus?

324
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,420
What did you have to do
for Roman money?

325
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,250
You promised me a head.

326
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,170
Earn your keep
and you can have
anyone's head.

327
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,190
Father,

328
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,800
protect us and guide us.

329
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:06,040
Senators.

330
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:07,860
My lady.

331
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,440
My lady, I wish we were
meeting in better times.

332
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,310
Better times will come.

333
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,920
And why are we here?

334
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,930
To take back the city.

335
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,370
And restore Rome
to where she should be.

336
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,670
An exciting venture.

337
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,370
- When?
- On the final day
of the games.

338
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:42,070
My army waits for my command
at Ostia.

339
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,900
Five thousand soldiers
loyal to me...

340
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,770
will enter Rome
and then the Colosseum,

341
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,780
where they will
arrest the emperors

342
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,520
for their crimes
against the Senate

343
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:54,950
and their people.

344
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,870
Uh, this plan
is ambitious and risky.

345
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,700
Rome will be yours
to administer and to--

346
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,450
Marcus Aurelius talked
of restoring power
to the Senate,

347
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:12,840
but that was a generation ago.
Much has changed.

348
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,850
The people
have not seen hope

349
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,330
for many years.

350
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,070
But with time...
and guidance...

351
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:27,120
Lucilla, you are the daughter
of Marcus Aurelius.

352
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,290
He had my loyalty.

353
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,990
And so do you.

354
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,780
Senator Thraex?

355
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,910
Politics follows power,
my lady.

356
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,050
Take back
what is rightfully yours...

357
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,100
and the Senate
will support you.

358
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,400
Thank you.

359
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,940
Food! Food!

360
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,900
When I was told of this place,

361
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,210
they never mentioned
the stink.

362
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,340
That would be Hanno.

363
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,480
Well, you'll have to
put up with me as I am.

364
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:35,840
And what's that up there?
A wolf?

365
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,760
The twins there,
they were outcasts.

366
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,580
Left in the hills to die.

367
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:47,720
That wolf found them
and she suckled them
on her milk.

368
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,290
Raised by an animal.
It's in their blood.

369
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,250
How do you know this place?

370
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:57,420
I know the chaos
they brought.

371
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,430
This city infects
everything it touches.

372
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,600
I never dreamt
it would be so big.

373
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,430
Don't fall for it.

374
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,560
This city is diseased.

375
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:11,000
Food! Food!

376
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:37,200
You! Barbarian scum!

377
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,120
Help me.
Please, help me!

378
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,160
- Ah!
- Thraex.

379
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,990
About our wager.

380
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,860
Ah. The barbarian.

381
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,260
Yes, I haven't forgotten,
I always repay my debts.

382
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,220
I was merely
going to suggest

383
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,260
that perhaps your luck
might change.

384
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,790
Shall we say
double or quits?

385
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,440
- Ah.
- Ah.

386
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,150
Get back!

387
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:12,990
Fresh meat.

388
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,910
Line up! Line up!

389
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:52,120
Play! Play!

390
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,620
Emperor Caracalla.

391
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,180
Emperor Geta.

392
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,880
Citizens of Rome!

393
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,930
These sacred games

394
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,240
are held to honor
the victory of Rome

395
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,420
over the barbarians of Numidia.

396
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,290
Go! Go!

397
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:36,640
And to honor
Rome's legionary commander,

398
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,950
General Justus Acacius!

399
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,690
[man] Long live Acacius!

400
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:43,260
And with him

401
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:48,000
Lucilla, the daughter
of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

402
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,360
Lucilla![man] Mother of Rome!

403
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,660
Acacius.

404
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,360
General.

405
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:08,330
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

406
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:13,510
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

407
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:15,460
Speak to them.

408
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,030
Speak to us!

409
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,000
I am not an orator

410
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,700
or a politician.

411
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,610
I am a soldier.

412
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:41,320
I have seen bravery
in men and women during war.

413
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,840
And even once in this arena.

414
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,100
So if you ask anything
of the gods...

415
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,370
ask for that same bravery.

416
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,810
Because Rome needs it now.

417
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:02,730
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

418
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,080
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

419
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,180
From the South Gate,

420
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:26,320
fighters from the stable
of Macrinus of Thysdrus!

421
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,850
From the stables

422
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:44,510
of Emperors Caracalla
and Geta themselves,

423
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,160
the undefeated champion:

424
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:50,910
Glyceo the Destroyer!

425
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:58,480
Hold.

426
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,240
Hold.

427
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,160
Hail Caesars!

428
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:31,120
Glyceo! Glyceo! Glyceo!

429
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,010
Hold together
and when it charges,
break for the wall.

430
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,010
Why should I?

431
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:52,140
Hold!

432
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,360
Hold!

433
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,410
Break!

434
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,760
Cowards!

435
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,900
To the wall!

436
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,830
Come on!

437
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,150
Brother, it's that poet,
is it not?

438
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,900
I can't remember.

439
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:17,720
That night was a blur.

440
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,730
"The gates of hell
are open night and day.

441
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,900
Smooth the desc--"
I forget.

442
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,780
"Smooth the descent..."

443
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,690
"Smooth is the descent,

444
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,910
easy is the way."

445
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,620
Shield!

446
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:20,350
Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

447
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,400
Blood.

448
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,580
Lucilla,

449
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:29,490
shall we show mercy?

450
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,270
Mercy.

451
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,600
No mercy!

452
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,550
Your life has been
spared by the gods--

453
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,690
I would sooner face your blade
than accept Roman mercy!

454
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,190
Kill! Kill! Kill!

455
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,490
Kill! Kill! Kill!

456
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:33,950
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

457
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,720
The road to freedom
doesn't run
through the arena.

458
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,070
It leads to this.

459
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:13,510
Go to your cells.

460
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,910
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

461
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,190
Come on, let's go.

462
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:55,680
"Gates of hell
are open night and day.

463
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,290
Smooth is the descent...

464
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,340
...easy is the way."

465
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:06,780
There, there, there, there.

466
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,210
And I've got you.

467
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,960
I'm Maximus,
the savior of Rome!

468
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,590
Scatto and Argento.

469
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:47,690
Lucius is safe?

470
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:06,580
Lucius!

471
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,110
Lucius,

472
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,200
you're the sole heir
to the throne now.

473
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,250
There are men
who want to kill you

474
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:28,860
so they can take power.

475
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,730
I promise I'll bring you back
as soon as it's safe.

476
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:37,430
Mother, why can't you
come with me?

477
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,960
I... I have to
stay here for your sake.

478
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:42,050
And for the sake of Rome.

479
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,610
Remember who you are.

480
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,660
And that I love you.

481
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,750
I love you.

482
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:50,710
Come.

483
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:55,320
Give me your leg.

484
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:58,850
Go. Go!

485
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:07,070
So...

486
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,860
What's your name?

487
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:17,210
I'm Ravi. I'm a doctor.

488
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:21,910
Because... more men die
of infected wounds

489
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,610
than out there, in the arena.

490
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,830
This needs to be cleaned,
it needs to be stitched and

491
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:31,570
it is going to hurt.

492
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:32,880
Mm.

493
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:36,060
This is Devil's Breath
and opium.

494
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:38,190
It's for the pain.

495
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:40,890
You should breathe in.

496
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:48,330
I've been here
so long now,

497
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,900
I don't even notice anymore.

498
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:53,770
I've done more amputations
than I can count.

499
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:57,510
Where'd you
- learn your trade?
- Why do you ask?

500
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:59,300
You've got a heavy hand.

501
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:02,130
I used to be
a gladiator myself.

502
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,610
Ah.

503
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,780
And would you have bested me?

504
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,440
In your prime, of course.

505
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,270
In your current state,
I could best you now.

506
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:16,270
Luckily for you,
I have put down my sword.

507
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,580
So now I spend my days

508
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:21,230
saving lives
instead of taking them.

509
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,280
And why such a change
so late in life?

510
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:28,330
What we do in life

511
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,850
echoes in eternity.

512
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,160
I feel like
I know those words.

513
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,820
I can't take credit.

514
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:41,470
It's written on
one of the tombs.

515
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,260
Over the bones of a gladiator.

516
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:45,650
[Macrinus] My champion!

517
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,910
I smell Devil's Breath!

518
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,790
My... champion.

519
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:56,490
Did you hear that crowd?

520
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,710
- Did you hear that crowd?
- Mm-hm.

521
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,800
You have something.
I knew it from the start.

522
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:09,800
- Did you now?
- Yes. The Greeks call it...

523
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:12,070
thymos.

524
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,550
Smoke.

525
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,640
Rage.

526
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,680
That rage is your gift.

527
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:22,120
Like the great Achilles.

528
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:24,560
Never let it go.

529
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:27,470
It will carry you
to greatness,

530
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:29,430
my champion.

531
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:50,890
Thank you

532
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:52,930
for inviting me.

533
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,070
This is truly an honor.

534
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,030
I hear you are
the talk of the court.

535
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,420
Yes.

536
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,770
We've met before.

537
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:10,520
- Have we?
- Long ago.

538
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,520
Where?

539
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,520
I was in the service
of your father's army

540
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:17,700
on his African campaign.

541
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,960
You served
with my father?

542
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,790
Mm.

543
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:28,490
I had the privilege

544
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,060
of reading
his "Meditations."

545
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:32,450
Mm.

546
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,370
"The best revenge

547
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:41,760
is to be unlike him
who performed the injury."

548
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:46,550
I hear you've been
arming half the legions

549
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:51,730
in the entire empire,
and here, now, in Rome...

550
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,950
you're gaining influence
by sponsoring gladiators.

551
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:58,130
I do it for the love
of the sport.

552
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,260
And where did you find
these gladiators?

553
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:05,010
They're usually
prisoners of war.

554
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,360
Or vagrants.
Why do you ask?

555
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:12,230
A man can choose to fight...

556
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,760
and stay alive.

557
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:19,020
It's the same in life as it is
in the arena, is it not?

558
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,070
Who is this?

559
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,590
That is my father
as a youth.

560
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:29,990
She had a child?

561
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:31,860
Mm.

562
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:34,340
It's common knowledge.
When Commodus was killed,

563
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,250
- the boy disappeared.
- Mm.

564
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:38,390
- But who would care?
- Lucilla would care.

565
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,170
- More wine!
- More wine!

566
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,050
He was of the royal bloodline,
after all.

567
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,050
And his father?

568
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:53,880
Ostensibly,
Lucius Verus.

569
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:55,710
See, it was
an arranged marriage.

570
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:56,930
She was 14.

571
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,370
- Mm.
- Females were not his taste.

572
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:01,800
- Nor mine, some days.
- Nor yours!

573
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:07,720
No, no, no.
By rumor, you see,
she took lovers.

574
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:12,030
And by rumor,
the real father...
was Commodus.

575
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:15,380
Brotherly love,
- you see?
- Yeah.

576
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,210
If he died,

577
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,600
- there has to be remains.
- Mm.

578
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:24,040
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

579
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,220
Um, well,
let's work it out.

580
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:29,700
He was about 12
- when he died?
- Yes.

581
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:34,140
So that would make him...

582
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:10,610
My lady.

583
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:12,130
Gracchus.

584
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,140
- Please come.
- Thank you.

585
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:35,290
Gladiator...

586
01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:37,810
do you know me?

587
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,560
Do you have a family?

588
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:53,300
A wife. Arishat.

589
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,260
Arishat.

590
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,610
She was killed
under your husband's command.

591
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,490
Rome drowns
in its own blood.

592
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:06,930
And yet you enjoy
the pleasures of the Colosseum.

593
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,100
There is much
you do not understand.

594
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:18,980
Lucius.

595
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,160
I do not know
who you think I am.

596
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:25,380
My name is Hanno,

597
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,950
and I have no mother,
or none that I can remember.

598
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,650
I'm so sorry.

599
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:38,830
If your son were here,
I feel sure he would tell you

600
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,830
not to grieve him.

601
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,660
For he would not be the boy
that you sent away.

602
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:44,790
That boy is dead.

603
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:49,320
You may think
I have little worth.

604
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,970
You may think
I betrayed you.

605
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,720
But I need you to know...

606
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:01,070
if you will not have
your mother's love,

607
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:04,070
then take
your father's strength.

608
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:06,640
You need it.

609
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:13,170
His name was
Maximus Decimus Meridius.

610
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,950
And I see him in you.

611
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,480
Get out.

612
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:22,090
My lady, we must go at once!

613
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,920
Lucius, you were loved

614
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:31,140
by myself
and by your father.

615
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,800
Your name
was on his lips--

616
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:35,750
Get out!

617
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,700
Lucius is alive.

618
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:07,790
Are you certain?

619
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,270
Yes.

620
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,530
I know my son.

621
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,450
I spoke to him
tonight.

622
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,930
He may be lost to me
for what I did,

623
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,850
but he lives.

624
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:29,630
The third day of the games
is tomorrow.

625
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:31,290
Most fighters won't survive.

626
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:32,810
Acacius,

627
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,680
you must help him.

628
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,430
Help him?[crying] Yes.

629
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:43,430
I failed him then.

630
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,480
I know I did.

631
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,440
I cannot fail him now.

632
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:53,440
The army is in Ostia.

633
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:56,310
If we wait a few days...

634
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:58,490
He could be dead
by then.

635
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,840
Acacius,

636
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:05,580
I would willingly
give my life for Rome,

637
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,200
but I will not
give my son's.

638
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,640
And one.

639
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:20,250
And two.

640
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,040
And one.

641
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:26,040
Together.
Timing, timing, timing!

642
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:30,390
And one. And two.

643
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,960
And one.

644
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:35,000
Pause, pause!

645
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,050
We won't get far
like this.

646
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:43,140
Just him. You go.

647
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,010
Go!

648
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:48,580
Let's see how far you can go
on your own without your team.

649
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,760
Ready?

650
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:53,150
One!

651
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:54,940
And two!

652
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:57,160
Timing, timing!

653
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,250
Come on, more!

654
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,080
More!

655
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:24,140
Leave him.

656
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,510
It's just vinegar,
my friend.

657
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,990
There will be
no more opium for you.

658
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:56,000
There is plenty of pain waiting
for you in the next life.

659
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:59,480
I don't know why
you are so greedy for it
in this one.

660
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,570
Are you a free man, Ravi?

661
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,570
"Free."

662
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:11,620
I am. Mm.

663
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,280
I laid down my sword

664
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:15,360
and I swore never
to pick it up again.

665
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,980
And yet
you choose this hell?

666
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:18,720
Mm-hm.

667
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:20,200
What was your home before?

668
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:22,810
Varanasi.

669
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:25,160
And why don't you go back?

670
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:26,720
I wish I could.

671
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,600
But...

672
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,170
I met a woman.
Ah.

673
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,430
- It's always a woman.
- Always.

674
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,430
She is from Londinium.
Britannia. You know.

675
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:42,390
So now...

676
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:45,440
our sons,
they speak only Latin.

677
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:47,920
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

678
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,230
We are Romans now.

679
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:56,010
I grew up hearing stories
at my grandfather's knee.

680
01:17:57,230 --> 01:18:00,540
He used to talk
of the dream that was Rome.

681
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:06,760
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it...

682
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:10,860
or it would vanish.

683
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,210
So,

684
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:14,990
what was this dream?

685
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,650
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

686
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,480
A Rome of the Senate.

687
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:25,650
A Rome of hope.

688
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:33,010
Your grandfather,
he sounds like
a dangerous man.

689
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,400
Hm.

690
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,270
The odds are against you.

691
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:43,670
The odds
are always against me.

692
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:45,760
Don't worry, old man.

693
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,670
Eh?

694
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,380
You should
- get some rest. Hm?
- Mm.

695
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:56,900
Your men will need you
to lead them tomorrow.

696
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:14,960
This is about survival.

697
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,400
Survive!

698
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:21,270
In the name of Poseidon,

699
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:25,540
we celebrate the glory
of naval war.

700
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:27,370
They have archers.

701
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,890
Be ready.
Listen for my commands.

702
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,720
Stay together
and pull as one, yes?

703
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:33,680
Yes!

704
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:36,160
- Yes?
- Yes!

705
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:45,690
Today we relive

706
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:49,300
the Battle of Salamis!

707
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:55,220
The Trojans
versus the Persians!

708
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:01,360
Oars out![all] Oars!

709
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,190
And... pull!

710
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:25,820
Archers!

711
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:26,860
Archers!

712
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,040
Pull!

713
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,610
Pull!

714
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,440
Pull!

715
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,070
Pull! To my time!

716
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:02,110
And... now!

717
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:07,070
Left side! Ready, and

718
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,120
ship oars now!

719
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:11,340
Oars in! Oars in!

720
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:13,730
Get down!

721
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,800
And pull! And pull!

722
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:38,760
Don't stop!

723
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:42,280
Pull!

724
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,330
And right!

725
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,380
Ready to ram!

726
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,130
And brace! Brace!

727
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:39,600
Everyone regroup!

728
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,900
Praetorians!

729
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:21,640
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

730
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:22,690
Move, move.

731
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,790
In the name of the emperors...

732
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,530
the victor is Hanno!

733
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,110
Who did this?

734
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:56,110
Who did this?!

735
01:23:56,810 --> 01:23:58,940
- It was me!
- I did it!

736
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,940
- I did it! I did it! I did it!
- It was me!

737
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:07,600
Geta will want retribution
for all of you.

738
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:09,870
Did you learn to shoot
in the same place

739
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,430
you learned to recite poetry?

740
01:24:11,610 --> 01:24:12,690
Be glad it wasn't me,

741
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:14,130
or that arrow
would have found you.

742
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:31,450
Be seated.

743
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:35,370
I have news for you.

744
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,330
He's here, sir.

745
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:46,470
Oh, still here.

746
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,990
Macrinus.

747
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:52,260
Welcome.

748
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:56,090
Yes, I'm listening.

749
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:58,780
You know
this is my house now.

750
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,180
Your debt to me is
over 10,000 denarii.

751
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:02,660
You know that.

752
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:05,360
I have other things. Uh...

753
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:07,230
Cattle. Art!

754
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,920
Truth, then.

755
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,620
What do you... want?

756
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,410
Truth.
That's what I want.

757
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:17,980
Nothing happens in Rome
without your knowledge.

758
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:21,150
You have
the senators' trust.

759
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:24,160
You have
Lucilla's trust.

760
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:26,990
More importantly,
you have my trust.

761
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:32,910
You wish my... loyalty?

762
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,730
I own...

763
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:37,950
your house.

764
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:40,740
I want your loyalty.

765
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:45,920
I...

766
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,830
- Tell me.
- I have heard...

767
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:51,660
of a plot...

768
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:55,190
- to dethrone the emperors.
- Yes.

769
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,760
But the plan
has been delayed, uh...

770
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:00,980
A gladiator is to be rescued
from the arena.

771
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:02,500
- Tonight.
- Mm.

772
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:05,760
- I don't know why.
- I know why. I know who.

773
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:09,200
Pack.

774
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,380
Quickly.

775
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,410
[man] Open up!

776
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,520
Open for
the emperors' guard!

777
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:36,510
My Lady, come with us.

778
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,080
Thanks to the civic virtue

779
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:26,820
of men like Thraex
and Macrinus,

780
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,820
your insurrection

781
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,480
has been revealed.

782
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:35,700
The honor,

783
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:40,660
the dignitas that Rome
has bestowed upon you...

784
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:46,140
all this you have forfeited
by your treachery.

785
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,270
Please, Emperor Geta.

786
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:50,800
Torture me if you want,

787
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,060
but do not lecture me.

788
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:56,630
Your name
will be forgotten!

789
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,770
Lost... to history.

790
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:04,070
You are damned,
General.

791
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:08,820
- You laugh.
- You damn me?

792
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:11,650
I don't care.

793
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:15,210
Everything is forgotten in time.
Empires fall. So do emperors.

794
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,040
Why wait?

795
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:20,310
- I will gut him right now!
- No, no, no!

796
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,700
Let them be. Come! Come!

797
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,620
His death must be public.

798
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:27,230
Public?

799
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:30,140
Hang his entrails
from the city gates!

800
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,880
And crucify her!

801
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,020
Crucify her!

802
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:36,060
Take them away!

803
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:39,540
[Geta] Shh! Shh! Shh!

804
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:53,860
Thank you, Macrinus.

805
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:01,520
Come on.

806
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,790
In these last days,

807
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,100
I have come to think of you
not as a subject

808
01:30:10,270 --> 01:30:12,400
but as a true friend.

809
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:14,190
Thank you.

810
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,930
Thank you so much.
But as a friend,

811
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,760
I must counsel caution.

812
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:22,890
Acacius is a hero of Rome.

813
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,160
Crucifixion
is for thieves.

814
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:28,460
Christians.

815
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:32,510
- It's too common.
- He is a traitor.
He must die.

816
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:33,990
I agree.

817
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:39,860
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

818
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:47,870
Let the gods decide.

819
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:54,710
You know, last night I woke,
dreaming of a dark river.

820
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,140
This time,
for the first time,

821
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,800
I was crossing it.

822
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:02,230
Hm.

823
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:04,800
Well, you know,
where I come from,

824
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:07,890
crossing a river,
it represents forgiveness.

825
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:10,980
Represents... salvation.

826
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:14,120
Where I come from,
it means
you're already dead.

827
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:25,000
But as I saw it,
I was not afraid.

828
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,350
For...

829
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:31,350
For someone was waiting
for me on the other side.

830
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,700
There.

831
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:46,500
Who is this man?

832
01:31:47,890 --> 01:31:49,320
Scratched out?

833
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,280
Maximus.

834
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:57,030
I saw him fight once.

835
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:59,640
- He was magnificent.
- Mm.

836
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:02,690
Yeah. My time in the arena,
it was after his,

837
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:06,990
but many still talked of him
in whispers, you know?

838
01:32:07,170 --> 01:32:09,390
Spoke of him.

839
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:11,830
What he did.

840
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,870
I met him once.

841
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,220
He was kind.

842
01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:21,400
He bowed to no one.

843
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,450
Come with me.

844
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:29,630
- Hmm?
- Come. With me.

845
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:52,870
When a rebel gladiator dies,
we bury them here.

846
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:57,440
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

847
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:16,930
This is Argento.

848
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:18,590
This is Scatto.

849
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:00,630
Cheers.

850
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:02,720
And stop.

851
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:08,420
For his treason
against the lives

852
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:12,550
of the emperors
and the Roman state,

853
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:16,080
General Justus Acacius,

854
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,430
an enemy of the people!

855
01:34:20,610 --> 01:34:23,000
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

856
01:34:23,170 --> 01:34:25,520
-  We love you, Acacius!
- You are a hero!

857
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:29,830
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

858
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:03,950
Vae victis.[soldiers] General.

859
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,980
Acacius!

860
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:33,370
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

861
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:43,430
From the vanquished city
of Numidia,

862
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:49,780
the victor of two conquests
in the Colosseum...

863
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:52,480
Go now. Vae victis.

864
01:35:56,830 --> 01:35:59,570
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

865
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:02,010
Hanno!

866
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:04,930
Oh, Lord, any honor I have,

867
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:06,710
- I will give it to you!
- It's too late.

868
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:10,060
The Roman traitor or

869
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,500
the barbarian hero.

870
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,980
Let the gods decide.

871
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,810
Lucius... wait.

872
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:19,460
Wait! Wait!

873
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,260
I am a vessel.

874
01:36:33,610 --> 01:36:35,830
Fill me with vengeance

875
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:39,050
and vanquish the betrayer.

876
01:36:56,890 --> 01:36:59,160
- We love you, Acacius!
- Move it!

877
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:04,860
Pick it up!

878
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:07,340
Bravo, Hanno!

879
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:08,860
We love you, Acacius!

880
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:09,950
What are you waiting for?

881
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:11,080
You will die!

882
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,420
I know who you are.

883
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:47,250
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

884
01:38:00,610 --> 01:38:02,570
Acacius
has raised his hand!

885
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:05,830
He has surrendered.

886
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:15,450
Let the gods decide.

887
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,910
The gods have rendered
their judgment.

888
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,520
Do what you must.

889
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:44,000
But on my death,
you have to know...

890
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,830
I love your mother,
Lucilla.

891
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:50,660
And your father...

892
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:54,450
Maximus.

893
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:57,840
I would have died
for him.

894
01:38:58,010 --> 01:38:59,800
Kill him!

895
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:02,670
Let him live!
Please!

896
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:06,850
Live! Live! Live! Live!

897
01:39:13,810 --> 01:39:15,510
Kill him!

898
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:18,340
[Geta] Kill him!

899
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:19,690
Archers!

900
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,650
No![Geta] Kill him!

901
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:24,260
Acacius! Acacius!

902
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:26,040
Kill him!

903
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:27,570
Kill him!

904
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:29,090
Kill him! Kill him!

905
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:32,660
Acacius!

906
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,800
No!

907
01:39:44,410 --> 01:39:45,840
No!

908
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:47,630
Acacius!

909
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,110
Damn you!

910
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:55,990
Death will be
too good for you!

911
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:04,690
Is this how Rome
treats its heroes?

912
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:10,170
Tell me!

913
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:16,790
If his life has no value,
what are yours worth?

914
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:21,920
The gods have spoken!

915
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:39,590
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

916
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:58,050
For our own safety,
we should return to the palace.

917
01:41:06,450 --> 01:41:09,620
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

918
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:21,720
Stay back! Stay back!

919
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:14,340
Arishat!

920
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,450
We had a bargain.

921
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:40,320
I gave him to you.
You let him live.

922
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,110
And you got
what you wanted.

923
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:44,810
I always get what I want.
Why did you let him live?

924
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:47,810
You bought a gladiator,
not a slave.

925
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:51,290
My will is my own.

926
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:54,860
Ah...

927
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:57,640
How blue is your blood?

928
01:42:57,820 --> 01:43:00,300
Perhaps the heart of a Roman

929
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:02,690
beats in that chest.

930
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:11,180
The greatest temple
Rome ever built.

931
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:12,830
The Colosseum.

932
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:15,230
Because this is
what they believe in.

933
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:16,970
Power.

934
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:19,750
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down the weak.

935
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:21,710
There has to be
- something else.
- There is nothing else.

936
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:24,630
There has to be
- another Rome.
- There is no other Rome.

937
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:27,670
- The "dream"?
- Mm.

938
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:29,680
The dream of Rome?

939
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:31,330
It's an old man's fantasy.

940
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,510
Who are you?

941
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:40,600
What was your name
before you traded it
for a Roman one?

942
01:43:41,690 --> 01:43:43,120
You'll never know.

943
01:43:45,950 --> 01:43:47,520
I have a destiny.

944
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:53,350
The gods delivered you to me.

945
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,050
You will be my instrument.

946
01:43:58,230 --> 01:44:01,490
I will never be
your instrument,
in this life or the next.

947
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:12,980
That will not be my destiny.

948
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:16,590
But I will see your end.

949
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:39,490
What else could I do?

950
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:41,400
He and his bitch
were plotting to kill us.

951
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:44,140
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads!

952
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,280
The Praetorians
will put down this crowd.

953
01:44:46,450 --> 01:44:48,100
- Like they have every other.
- You brought this on us.

954
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:50,670
Filthy ape!

955
01:44:54,370 --> 01:44:57,020
Perhaps you should, uh,

956
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:01,510
take Dondus elsewhere
to comfort him?

957
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:13,350
Forgive
my brother's outburst.

958
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:16,740
The disease
that infects his loins

959
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:18,790
has spread to his brain.

960
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,960
- Every day he gets worse.
- I will reason with him.

961
01:45:38,330 --> 01:45:41,370
I see you.

962
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:43,550
I see you.

963
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:47,070
Caracalla, Caracalla!

964
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:48,820
Come on, stand up.

965
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:50,990
Get up, get up.
Not you.

966
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:52,910
All right,
there you go.

967
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:56,910
Now, listen to me.

968
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:58,560
What's the matter?

969
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:01,310
Nothing's ever mine.

970
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,740
Everything is ours, always.

971
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:07,090
Even in the womb...
he tried...

972
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:11,230
to cut my umbilicus

973
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,140
so that I couldn't have
any more air.

974
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:15,490
You remember that,
- do you?
- Certainly.

975
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:17,930
- Come, sit.
- One cannot forget.

976
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:20,240
My conscience compels me.

977
01:46:20,410 --> 01:46:21,760
What?

978
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:23,070
Sit.

979
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,590
Your brother

980
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,980
means to blame you

981
01:46:28,030 --> 01:46:30,340
in front of
the entire Senate...

982
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:31,820
But I did not do it!

983
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:33,470
...for what's happening
in the streets.

984
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:35,950
- The chaos!
- He's lying!

985
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,860
No testimony
can be more damning

986
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:41,390
than one brother
against another.

987
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:44,130
That's a lie!
He always lies!

988
01:46:44,310 --> 01:46:46,700
He can be very persuasive.

989
01:46:46,870 --> 01:46:49,530
So?
What will they do to me?

990
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:52,360
Oh, I don't dare imagine.
But imagine this:

991
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:54,530
What will they do to Dondus?

992
01:46:57,710 --> 01:47:00,450
What will they do

993
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,930
to Dondus?

994
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:05,630
It's your decision.

995
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:44,370
Brother.

996
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:49,720
Put down the blade.

997
01:47:49,890 --> 01:47:50,940
You lie.

998
01:47:51,110 --> 01:47:52,810
- Give it to me.
- You always lie!

999
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:53,850
Give it--

1000
01:47:57,860 --> 01:48:00,030
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1001
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:02,510
- Lie!
- Listen to me.
Break the spell.

1002
01:48:02,690 --> 01:48:04,650
- Lie!
- Break the spell!

1003
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:07,910
I've always protected you.
Because I love you.

1004
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:10,610
Come back. Help me.

1005
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,630
Lucius.

1006
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:58,960
Never could have imagined
the fates would lead us here.

1007
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:02,920
And yet here we are.

1008
01:49:04,660 --> 01:49:06,320
Everything has
brought us full circle.

1009
01:49:06,490 --> 01:49:09,490
You sent me away
and yet fate

1010
01:49:09,670 --> 01:49:12,110
brought me back
to the very ground
where he died.

1011
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:16,110
This ring...

1012
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:19,680
belonged to my father.

1013
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:26,770
He gave it
to your father,
Maximus,

1014
01:49:26,950 --> 01:49:28,770
as a token of trust.

1015
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:33,170
I gave it to Acacius
for his valor.

1016
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:39,870
This ring belonged to my wife.

1017
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,360
I shall wear it next to yours.

1018
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:01,070
I am truly sorry for Acacius.

1019
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:05,070
I could not see the man.

1020
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:09,250
He was a soldier of Rome.

1021
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:12,600
There was a plan.

1022
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:15,210
He was readying troops
at Ostia

1023
01:50:15,390 --> 01:50:18,350
under the command
of Darius Sextus.

1024
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,520
Troops he was to lead
against the emperors.

1025
01:50:23,610 --> 01:50:27,920
Acacius. Maximus.
Marcus Aurelius.

1026
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,450
They lived and died
for Rome.

1027
01:50:32,190 --> 01:50:33,620
We all do.

1028
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:38,020
Is it true
they intend to kill you?

1029
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:42,980
One man or another
has had a sword
against my neck

1030
01:50:43,150 --> 01:50:45,460
since the day
my father died.

1031
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,640
But now
that I've found you,

1032
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:53,290
it doesn't matter.

1033
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:56,380
I am not afraid.

1034
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,600
I've become well versed
in losing the things
that I love.

1035
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:03,650
But now that I've found you,

1036
01:51:03,830 --> 01:51:05,480
I have no desire
to lose you again.

1037
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:10,830
- You stand like him.
- Mm.

1038
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:12,970
Alert.

1039
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:14,970
Proud.

1040
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:19,760
I do not have his strength.

1041
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:22,800
I wish that were true.

1042
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:27,280
I wish I were telling you
to flee this place.

1043
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:37,250
Go now.

1044
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:46,700
Strength and honor.

1045
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:50,870
Strength and honor.

1046
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:05,580
As Emperor,

1047
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,370
I have convened

1048
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:11,550
the Senate to appoint
my First Consul

1049
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,940
and bestow upon him the power
to administer the military

1050
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:18,340
and civic functions
of the Empire.

1051
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:23,560
I name...

1052
01:52:24,690 --> 01:52:27,080
Citizen Dondus!

1053
01:52:34,130 --> 01:52:35,740
Hail Dondus!

1054
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:40,710
Hail Dondus!

1055
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:45,320
- Hail Dondus.
- Hail Dondus!

1056
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:47,970
Hail Dondus!

1057
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:54,070
As Second Consul...

1058
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:57,500
I name...

1059
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:01,160
Citizen...

1060
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:04,860
Macrinus!

1061
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:08,910
Hail Macrinus!

1062
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,470
Hail Macrinus!

1063
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:12,560
Hail Macrinus!

1064
01:53:14,430 --> 01:53:16,920
There will be
a triumphal parade
to celebrate.

1065
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:18,610
There will be games

1066
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:21,270
and mass executions.

1067
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:27,190
Long live the Empire!

1068
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,490
Long live the Empire!

1069
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:32,280
Long live the Empire!

1070
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:39,850
Sit down.

1071
01:53:43,290 --> 01:53:45,940
I happen to have...

1072
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:53,210
with good fortune
and not a little skill...

1073
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:58,090
the remaining emperor's ear.

1074
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:07,570
I can speak logic to it...

1075
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:14,840
and tame the madness
in the street. But...

1076
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:19,410
to restore order...

1077
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,330
I must have power...

1078
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:29,070
and command

1079
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:31,770
over the Praetorian Army.

1080
01:54:37,650 --> 01:54:39,390
Ballot...

1081
01:54:41,570 --> 01:54:42,910
or hand?

1082
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:47,610
Aye![all] Aye!

1083
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:52,530
Your humble servant.

1084
01:54:56,670 --> 01:54:58,190
Put your hands down.

1085
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:02,370
You can sit down.

1086
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:17,560
Rome must fall.

1087
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:22,300
I need only
give it a push.

1088
01:55:25,390 --> 01:55:27,570
And after Rome falls...

1089
01:55:28,530 --> 01:55:30,920
...what then?

1090
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:35,050
You are
your father's child.

1091
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:40,490
His dream of Rome
was never a dream.

1092
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:42,580
It was a fiction.

1093
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:45,020
"The best revenge is

1094
01:55:45,190 --> 01:55:48,980
to become unlike the one
who did the injury."

1095
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:54,030
I have made myself
unlike your father.

1096
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:57,680
He spoke of dreams,
I speak of truth.

1097
01:55:57,860 --> 01:56:00,250
And the only truth
in my Rome

1098
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:03,860
is the law
of the strongest.

1099
01:56:06,170 --> 01:56:07,520
I was owned

1100
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,520
by an emperor.

1101
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:15,620
Now I control an empire.

1102
01:56:16,700 --> 01:56:19,970
Where else but in Rome
can a man do that?

1103
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:29,760
Do you recognize
your father's mark on me?

1104
01:56:34,590 --> 01:56:35,900
If there is anything

1105
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:37,990
you need...

1106
01:56:39,730 --> 01:56:41,380
in these last hours,

1107
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:44,040
we will provide.

1108
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:52,480
Your death will clear my path
to the throne.

1109
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:57,310
Tomorrow
there will be games.

1110
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,050
And at them...

1111
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:01,660
I will prevail.

1112
01:57:15,330 --> 01:57:16,810
Ravi!

1113
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:25,600
Can you get me a message
to Ostia by morning?

1114
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:27,430
What is in Ostia?

1115
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:29,040
There is an army.

1116
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:32,910
I'm asking you
to risk yourself, my friend,

1117
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:35,170
in the service
of something greater.

1118
01:57:38,090 --> 01:57:39,480
Ride to Ostia.

1119
01:57:40,790 --> 01:57:42,790
Take this ring
to General Darius Sextus.

1120
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,360
Are you listening?

1121
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:47,620
Darius Sextus.

1122
01:57:47,790 --> 01:57:49,800
He will know it
as Acacius's ring.

1123
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:54,890
And, uh,

1124
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,150
who shall I say has

1125
01:57:57,850 --> 01:57:59,500
sent me with this ring?

1126
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:05,200
I am Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1127
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:07,990
The Prince of Rome.

1128
01:58:09,210 --> 01:58:10,640
Tell him
I am summoning the army

1129
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:13,080
to the defense
of a new Republic.

1130
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:22,870
- Should I trust you?
- Yes.

1131
01:58:23,050 --> 01:58:25,090
Should I?Yes.

1132
01:58:32,010 --> 01:58:34,710
Ravi! I need your keys.

1133
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,500
Thank you.

1134
01:59:20,370 --> 01:59:22,800
Stop! Come back!

1135
01:59:53,570 --> 01:59:54,700
Who gave you this?

1136
01:59:55,710 --> 01:59:57,840
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

1137
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:00,280
The Prince of Rome.

1138
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:56,510
Must we kill Lucilla?

1139
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:01,900
Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

1140
02:01:03,770 --> 02:01:04,820
Ever.

1141
02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:18,270
The people love her.
Her death will incite the mob.

1142
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:20,920
If she dies and the streets
rise up in anger,

1143
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:22,490
I shall deliver them
Caracalla's head

1144
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:24,010
and the people
shall acclaim me.

1145
02:01:24,180 --> 02:01:27,750
That, my friend,
is politics.

1146
02:01:30,580 --> 02:01:32,410
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1147
02:01:47,690 --> 02:01:49,780
Today will be
your last fight, champion.

1148
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:52,520
And our master
has bestowed on you...

1149
02:01:54,910 --> 02:01:57,310
the wooden sword of freedom.

1150
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:03,270
But you have to
earn it first.

1151
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:05,750
Today, you're gonna
defend your mother.

1152
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:31,510
Wood or steel,
a point is still a point!

1153
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,320
Wait for me.

1154
02:03:19,130 --> 02:03:20,820
In honor

1155
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,260
of the acclamation
of Emperor Caracalla,

1156
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:31,310
First Consul Dondus
and Second Consul Macrinus,

1157
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:35,970
and as punishment
for her conspiracy
against the empire,

1158
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:40,500
for her calumnies against
the emperor's imperial bloodline

1159
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:42,850
and for fomenting
military mutiny

1160
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:44,410
along with her husband,

1161
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:48,200
the queen will face
divine justice

1162
02:03:48,370 --> 02:03:52,420
at the hands
of the Praetorian Guard.

1163
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:18,450
I am not a general.

1164
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:23,630
But we are all soldiers.

1165
02:04:25,630 --> 02:04:27,370
And up until now,

1166
02:04:27,540 --> 02:04:31,720
we have fought for nothing more
than another day's survival.

1167
02:04:31,890 --> 02:04:33,720
What will you
have us do?

1168
02:04:35,070 --> 02:04:36,250
Well, you can return
to your cells

1169
02:04:36,420 --> 02:04:38,340
if you do not wish
to fight this battle.

1170
02:04:38,510 --> 02:04:40,820
Or...

1171
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:43,910
you can join me.

1172
02:04:45,210 --> 02:04:47,520
And fight for a freedom
far beyond these walls.

1173
02:04:47,690 --> 02:04:49,220
Aye!

1174
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:53,520
There once was a time when
honor meant something in Rome.

1175
02:04:55,220 --> 02:04:56,750
In this Rome

1176
02:04:57,660 --> 02:04:59,750
I no longer believe
that exists.

1177
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:01,840
We must find it!

1178
02:05:04,190 --> 02:05:05,840
And know this:

1179
02:05:07,190 --> 02:05:10,930
Where death is, we are not.

1180
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:14,850
Where we are,

1181
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:17,330
death is not!

1182
02:05:20,330 --> 02:05:21,600
By my sword.

1183
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:25,210
Strength and honor.

1184
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:27,210
Strength and honor!

1185
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:28,990
Strength and honor!

1186
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:31,000
Strength and honor!

1187
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:57,760
Let it not be said

1188
02:05:57,940 --> 02:06:00,980
that the emperor
is not merciful.

1189
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:06,600
The queen will be granted
a single gladiator

1190
02:06:06,770 --> 02:06:10,430
to defend her against
the Praetorian Guard.

1191
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:24,400
The champion, Hanno!

1192
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:31,840
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

1193
02:07:37,470 --> 02:07:39,210
Yes!

1194
02:07:43,430 --> 02:07:45,260
Summon the cavalry.
Put this down at once.

1195
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:49,180
This is war! Real war!

1196
02:07:54,180 --> 02:07:57,530
The army of Acacius
is advancing
just outside of Rome, sir.

1197
02:08:00,190 --> 02:08:01,580
We can still
outflank them.

1198
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:04,060
They have only
5,000 troops, no more.

1199
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:06,850
How many are we?

1200
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:08,330
Six thousand.
Perhaps more.

1201
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:10,070
Ride to the gate
and hold them.

1202
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:02,950
Filthy scum!

1203
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:18,350
Lucius!

1204
02:09:20,140 --> 02:09:21,180
Give me the bow.

1205
02:09:44,990 --> 02:09:47,430
Go, my son. Lucius--

1206
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:48,650
Shh-sh-sh-sh...

1207
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:50,210
Horse!

1208
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,050
Will nothing
kill this barbarian?

1209
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:27,700
My name is
Lucius Verus Aurelius!

1210
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:30,140
A man does not become
emperor by bloodline alone.

1211
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:32,970
It must be taken by force
and kept by force.

1212
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:34,930
Are you such a man
as this?

1213
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:36,450
I don't fight for power.

1214
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:39,280
I fight to free Rome
from men like you

1215
02:11:39,450 --> 02:11:40,890
and to return it to them.

1216
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:43,800
The gods themselves
want Rome reborn.

1217
02:11:43,980 --> 02:11:46,850
They sent me...
to fulfill that task.

1218
02:11:47,020 --> 02:11:50,460
And what if your gods
sent me here to kill you?

1219
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:51,680
Huh?

1220
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:55,030
It's time to end this, Macrinus!

1221
02:12:31,110 --> 02:12:33,330
Hah!

1222
02:13:03,230 --> 02:13:04,710
Strength and honor,

1223
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:06,840
my son.

1224
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:41,940
You look to me to speak.

1225
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:45,770
I know not what
to say other than

1226
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:47,940
we have all known
too much death.

1227
02:14:49,210 --> 02:14:52,690
Let no more blood be spilt
in the name of tyranny.

1228
02:14:56,650 --> 02:14:59,130
My grandfather,
Marcus Aurelius,

1229
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:02,090
talked of a dream
that would be Rome.

1230
02:15:03,130 --> 02:15:05,050
A dream that my father,

1231
02:15:06,270 --> 02:15:09,010
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

1232
02:15:09,180 --> 02:15:10,710
died for.

1233
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:13,540
An ideal.

1234
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:20,590
A city for the many
and a refuge
for those in need.

1235
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:23,240
A home worth fighting for.

1236
02:15:24,370 --> 02:15:28,640
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

1237
02:15:30,730 --> 02:15:32,550
That dream is lost.

1238
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:40,130
But dare we...

1239
02:15:41,690 --> 02:15:44,310
rebuild that dream
together?

1240
02:15:56,230 --> 02:15:58,010
What say you?

1241
02:16:04,370 --> 02:16:06,200
Aye!

1242
02:16:07,370 --> 02:16:08,680
Aye!

1243
02:16:09,420 --> 02:16:10,590
Aye!

1244
02:16:10,770 --> 02:16:15,120
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

1245
02:17:19,790 --> 02:17:21,010
Mother.

1246
02:18:13,580 --> 02:18:15,760
Speak to me, Father.
