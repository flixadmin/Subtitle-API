1
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,370
Lord of this Universe. Sri Mahavishnu's
6th incarnation is Parasurama .

2
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:58,830
Parasurama circled earth 21 times in Treta Yug and
the land he won after finishing all the evil...

3
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,950
He donated that land to
Kashyapa Prajapathi.

4
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,620
Later, the holy serpents and Gods
requested for a land for them also to live.

5
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:16,580
Parasurama threw his axe presented
by Lord Shiva, into the ocean.

6
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,830
He then made the ocean pull backwards
and made a wonderful land evolve there.

7
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,700
Minerals from the ocean further
enhanced the fertility of that land.

8
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,450
Rare medicinal plants not available
anywhere else, evolved in this forest.

9
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,370
Parasurama, one of the seven holy persons to live
eternally, opted that land as his place for penance.

10
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,950
That land is Parasurama Kshetra.

11
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,700
Another wonder seen by this land, is
the evolution of most powerful temple of

12
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,750
Lord Shiva, who is worshipped
by Parasurama.

13
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,000
-Were you scared?
-Yes!

14
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,410
Grandpa, do spirits exist?

15
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,040
-Do you believe in God?
-Yes!

16
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,830
Then, you must believe
even in devil.

17
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,790
Then why did the ghost come to
a temple where God resides?

18
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,450
That is a wonder. Wonder can’t
be understood by thinking.

19
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,790
You know it, only by experiencing it.

20
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,580
Then why is such a wonderful
temple closed down?

21
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,160
This temple has a great history.

22
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:11,250
In the forest 3 yojanas(36-45 KM)
away from the roaring sea shore…

23
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,620
Power incarnation of Lord Shiva
has evolved to safeguard us.

24
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,830
Goddess Ganga herself showers her
waters continuously on Lord Shiva,

25
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,500
who loves to be decorated.

26
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,750
These walls once resounded with
the prayers, sound of Conch

27
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,290
and praises to the Lord.

28
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:41,080
When someone dies suddenly at
an early age, their soul still stays

29
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,450
in this world until their
10th day ritual is completed.

30
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,290
They can fulfil their last wish
by then.

31
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:55,370
But, that wish must be righteous.

32
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,700
Fulfilling that should be written
in their fate.

33
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,910
When someone from the family
wholeheartedly worships before

34
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,500
the final ritual of the dead, spirit
of the dead possesses over them.

35
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,830
It then fulfils its final wish.

36
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,830
A son five decades ago to fulfil
his dead father’s final wish,

37
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,870
requested that Lord Shiva.

38
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,000
Then his father’s spirit
possessed over him.

39
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,120
And killed the maternal uncle,
who poisoned him.

40
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,540
People who saw that had
a shiver in their backs.

41
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,330
Those officials how went to investigate
heinous act found it beyond their imagination.

42
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,120
Head priest argued that the person
who did the murder was not

43
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,370
this son but spirit of father.

44
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,790
As the strong trust from ages
can’t be ruled out…

45
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,000
Officials decided to close down
the temple until the case is solved.

46
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,870
Though offerings and worships are
not carried out from then till now…

47
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,450
Worship continues by flow water to Lord Shiva
hasn’t stopped in this holy place..

48
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,080
Trust of the devotees hasn’t
come down.

49
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,290
It’s been so long since we came.
Why did he bring us by force?

50
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,250
One should come home or take people
to Police station to do an enquiry.

51
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,500
What does he think of us?
Who the hell is he?

52
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
You can be enquired right in
the Police station.

53
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,790
But there is no guarantee that
you’d return home safe.

54
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,950
Sir, what did we do?
We are into petrol business legally.

55
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,580
Two tankers are loading
every time in the company.

56
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,290
Those two tankers are being
unloaded in your bunks.

57
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,080
But, how is a third tanker passing through
the check post with the same permit?

58
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,160
We are in no way linked to
that third tanker.

59
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,000
But if I tell about the person behind that,
I can never see my daughter again Sir.

60
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,620
Give me a written complaint. I’ll give
you a guarantee that you return home.

61
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,580
Come out!

62
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,290
-Bhavani!
-Sir!

63
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,750
-Brother, we did a mistake.
-Please forgive us, sir.

64
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,660
I’d have let this go if my smuggling,
business or something else was touched.

65
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,620
But those that tanker is my life.

66
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,870
I’ll not leave anyone who messes
with those.

67
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,330
When someone messes with my
father, only his son should kill them.

68
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,790
One must know about this Rudra behind
him, before messing up with Bhavani.

69
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,750
-Madam, one tea!
-Please sit, I’ll give.

70
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,700
I need one hour to go to
parlour, boss.

71
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,160
-Massage parlour?
-Boss!

72
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,200
Dear, can you please sit there?

73
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,500
Why does she look so cheap
at us?

74
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,330
-Will she give us tea?
-Let’s have coffee then.

75
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,040
-Oh no!
-No use!

76
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,790
Brother, what’s this?
Come, let’s leave.

77
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,370
She maybe cleaning since
we are coming.

78
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,330
Be positive, especially when
you are negative.

79
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,500
I see!

80
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,750
No…

81
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,080
-Shameless life!
-Aunty, one tea!

82
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,290
-No milk, dear!
-What?

83
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,450
Didn’t the milk vendor come or
didn’t the buffalo give milk?

84
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,790
You haven’t paid your debt,
dirty rascal.

85
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,500
You think this is your in law’s house
to come and have tea, biscuits and all

86
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,040
without paying for so long, dirty idiot?

87
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,200
-Did I ever say like that, dear?
-You just said it, idiot.

88
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,370
-There is really no milk.
-Oh!

89
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,870
Sir, tea with full milk!
Please have it.

90
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Why did she give to that old man?

91
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,080
-Here is hot samosa, have it.
-Thank you!

92
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,870
-Missing boy!
-That’s two months back paper, boss.

93
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,540
Your name shouldn’t have been
Swarna Kamalam, but crazy flower.

94
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,750
-Call that number.
-Ok!

95
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,500
-Hello!
-Did your son go missing?

96
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,790
-Yes madam, but we got him back.
-Damn, dirty rascal!

97
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,540
Boss, it seems they found the kid.

98
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,160
-Oh yeah! Get the amount ready,
I‘ll visit the city. -What?

99
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,410
-Hi, I’m one and only Satish.
-My name is also Satish.

100
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,160
But, he doesn’t have a son like this.

101
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,000
If not, you should be visiting some
sexologist. Why did you come to me?

102
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,330
We are the sincere citizen
searching for your son.

103
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,290
Oh thank you, but we found him
within a week after he went missing.

104
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,540
-Then, why didn’t you tell?
-For what?

105
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,620
You published it in paper when he went
missing and you should do the same

106
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,160
after finding him, right?
That is the basic ethics.

107
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,700
-What?
-What!

108
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,870
We are waking up early by 5 daily
and are searching for your son.

109
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
-Did you ask me and search?
-Oh, I see!

110
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,500
Many others are searching similar
to us. Shall I bring them all?

111
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,790
Oh, what should I do now?

112
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,500
-You know how much time and
money did our Boss invest? -Yes!

113
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,290
Forget time, it is not back once spent.
But, money comes back, right?

114
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,370
-Yes!
-It comes, right?

115
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,580
-Oh no!
-Don’t you need it?

116
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,250
No, cross the door front and give it sir.
Money makes many! -Oh my!

117
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,450
Please adjust with this
fifty thousand.

118
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,200
-Take it, that’s mine.
-Ok!

119
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,370
-I’ll publish it in paper tomorrow that
I found my son. -Ok!

120
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,950
Matter has reached very fast.

121
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,120
How do you get such ideas, Boss?

122
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,580
-From the bottom…
-Boss!

123
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,700
When there’s fire in the botton,
ideas come automatically.

124
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,620
SLN bus coming to Anantapur
from Mangalur met with

125
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,160
a dreaded accident at
Anantapur ghat road.

126
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,450
All the passengers in the bus died on
the spot along with the driver and cleaner.

127
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,450
Family members are weeping
at the unidentifiable dead bodies

128
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,870
of their relative's kin at Anantapur
Victoria memorial hospital.

129
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,080
Bus owner Muniappa is kind enough
and is distributing a compensation of

130
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,750
ten lakhs to the family members
of the deceased.

131
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,830
-Not here, do that there.
-Where?

132
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,580
-Search!
-What to search, brother?

133
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,910
Search for an orphan body.

134
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,540
-Why orphan body, Boss?
-For you to beg. -What?

135
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,830
Number 14 and 15 are both orphan bodies.

136
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,450
Ok, number 14!
Wait!

137
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,080
Relative of this body has been
for a tea or a smoke.

138
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,410
These idiots would even leave
the bodies, but not their bad habits.

139
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,500
-Give some time.
-Ok, brother!

140
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,370
-Your person?
-No -Go!

141
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,080
-He is your husband, cry.
-Oh no, husband! -Stop!

142
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,700
-Not like that, adjust the makeup!
-Husband!

143
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,620
-What did you do, husband?
-Oh no!

144
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,790
Did you lend him money?
Why are you weeping so much?

145
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,830
You continue.

146
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,370
We are in shock that
my brother died.

147
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,540
I too am on scotch. I had a quarter as
I was unable to bear this bad smell.

148
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,370
Do you have any doubt on me?
-No. -I have a doubt on you.

149
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,950
I mean, it is written ‘FRAUD’
on that T-shirt.

150
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,790
-This is ‘Ford’, idiot.
-It maybe ‘FORD’ or whatever.

151
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,080
If he is your brother, can you say
where is the mole on his waist?

152
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,500
Is my brother Anushka to show waist
by wearing a sari? He wore a lungi.

153
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,330
In such a case, how do I say he
is your relative when you don’t

154
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,450
say where are the moles?

155
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,080
It is not justified for you to talk
about moles when we are in

156
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,500
vain of my brother’s death.

157
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,620
-Hey!
-Jackson, give money for his drink.

158
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,580
Oh no! Sir, my sister in law
is down, please write fast.

159
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,120
Yes, I’ll write now and she’ll get up.
See, she’ll get up.

160
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,660
Yes, she is up.
You leave now.

161
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,750
Please take this ten lakhs
cheque, madam.

162
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
You can’t buy my brother’s life
with this dirty money, sir.

163
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,040
So, you don’t want this?

164
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,830
I don’t want, but my sister in law
needs it.

165
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,830
She’ll buy a sewing machine
and take care of us all.

166
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,330
-Leave me, no.
-My sister in law, sir.

167
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,330
-What?
-Promise! We’ll take leave, sir.

168
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,790
-Hey! -What?
-Who’ll take the body?

169
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,870
-Start it!
Oh no, husband!

170
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,580
-Hey, I need…
-Ten Lakhs, yay!

171
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,080
-Wow! -Pour, brother!
-Rascal!

172
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,120
Boss, kebab…

173
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,160
Brother, there’s some bonding
in between us.

174
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,080
Otherwise, why would you get
ten lakhs to this small batch?

175
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,660
I will do anytthing for you,
come what may.

176
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,540
But, I don’t know who you are.

177
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,660
I’m having drinks in a pain that I’m
unable to do anything for you.

178
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,700
I’d have done if I could.
I really would’ve done.

179
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,540
Mother promise, I’d have done.

180
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,700
Jackson, hey!

181
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,580
Will there be tigers here?

182
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,370
-Hey, who is it rascal?
-Hey Boss, shut up.

183
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,910
Hey Lord, a girl approaches
mother when she is angry.

184
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,450
She approaches her father
when she is in a trouble.

185
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,750
My husband is a loyal Police officer.

186
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,040
They say he died in an accident.

187
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,080
They said even his body is
not found.

188
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,700
Whenever I remember my husband’s
smile, my tears aren’t stopping.

189
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,250
You’ve taken away my only
companion.

190
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,410
Either you take an incarnation
or send your power,

191
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,450
you got to do justice to your child.

192
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,700
If your existence is true, you come
in some form to save the virtue.

193
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,330
One who comes, will come
for sure.

194
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,540
But the one coming even by
mocking the death…

195
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,120
The person cleansing the evil
and winning hearts…

196
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,410
He will come riding a bull like that
Lord Shiva descending from Kailasa.

197
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,870
He will definitely come.

198
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,660
Who is that guy coming like
Lord Shiva riding a bull?

199
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
He doesn’t look to me like Shiva.

200
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,120
I think a drama artist has come
wearing a khaki shirt.

201
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,410
Hey Shikari, give him some money
and send him away.

202
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,870
Here!

203
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,700
-Hail to Lord Shiva!
-Oh no!

204
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,040
Oh no!

205
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,910
This is the VIP darshan.
Did you see Lord Shiva, idiot?

206
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,950
Yes, my Lord!

207
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,080
Hey, will he be a God just by hitting
one fellow? Go guys, beat him up.

208
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,450
Oh no! No, I said you not to
hit me, right?

209
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,370
Not here.
Look there, rascal.

210
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,580
Not the God, but Police!

211
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
Correct answer!

212
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,410
A Police?

213
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,660
A gift voucher for you
from Kalamandir!

214
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,370
I’m not giving that.
But, I’m giving you an offer.

215
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,410
-An offer?
-An offer to hit the Police.

216
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,120
-I’ll hit!
-I’ll hit!

217
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,950
Hey guys, what’s that excitement
like stray pigs? There are rules.

218
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,620
-Rules?
-Yes!

219
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,660
-You can punch me as many times
the count of letters in your name. -Ok!

220
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,080
But if you miss…

221
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,330
I get the chance to punch you
for just once.

222
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,160
No case, no lockup!

223
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,080
Disappointment if you delay,
guy losing the chance is a fool.

224
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,080
He is Malli. Just two letters
and two punches.

225
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,700
Mandapeta Malli! There’s no goon
without his area name as prefix.

226
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,620
It is six letters, right?

227
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,250
Do you know it all, sir?

228
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,330
You shut up and you go on.

229
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,120
See, I will never miss.

230
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,750
Oh no, I will never miss.

231
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,200
Is this a hand or a 1000 Volt
transformer, sir?

232
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,700
Estimate the voltage based on
the damage.

233
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,870
He is Sri. He has no area name too.
Just one letter and one punch.

234
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,830
Srinivasa Ramanuja Parabrahma
Yadav, as per the ration card!

235
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,660
Lucky guy, he gets 15 punches.
Come!

236
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,290
-Oh no!
-Yuck! He’s there, rascal.

237
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,540
Wow! Underground water would’ve
pumped up if you pressed a bit more, sir.

238
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,750
My dear devotee, water pumped up
from his underground and that’s enough.

239
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,160
Bonitas!
Hey, that is not a cuss word.

240
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,000
Bonita in Spanish means
beautiful woman.

241
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,370
Oh, thank you!

242
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,040
-Tea please!
-Sugar…

243
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,830
Sugar exists right in the smile.
Why more?

244
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,080
Come on, dear.

245
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,660
-Sir!
-Yes!

246
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,950
You have great following in ladies.

247
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,370
No more names now and it is
the game directly. Hey…

248
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,750
Sir!

249
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,250
Where is that Bhavani idiot, who
feels like a macho in this village?

250
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,660
His boss is here, won’t he come
and meet?

251
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,120
-What’s that expression? Did I beat
him up already? -Yes!

252
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,250
-Beware in hide and seek,
where is the fool? -Here!

253
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,790
-Is he Bhavani?
-I swear. Mother promise!

254
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,750
Hey my devotee, is it you?

255
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,870
I expected you to be wild,
dominating in the forest.

256
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,540
But you look like a seedless raisin.
Tell me the truth.

257
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,870
-Are you Bhavani?
-Yes! -Yuck!

258
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,620
What’s this?
Should I smash you?

259
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,080
Your heart would slip into your
shorts if I just sneeze aloud.

260
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,790
-What do you know about my
problem, Sattipandu? -I’m Bhavani.

261
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,160
Sattipandu, why are you in a hurry
without listening to me completely?

262
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,870
Look Sattipandu, I am being transferred
from every place I’m posted

263
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,910
by finishing the game just with in
half or one day.

264
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,410
Thus when I requested the Commissioner,
he sent me here by giving a great hope

265
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,500
that you are a monster and
this case will take time.

266
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,910
But when I came down here,
game is over just within an hour.

267
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,160
If Commissioner gets to know about
this, he’ll immediately transfer me.

268
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,200
I haven’t even opened
the zip yet.

269
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,080
I mean, my bag zip.
You misunderstood, right? Naughty!

270
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,330
-Oh no! Sattipandu, give some idea
for me to stay back here. -Idea?

271
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,080
-Idea, idea….
-Tea!

272
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,790
-Yes, I got it.
-What?

273
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,660
-An idea! What if you get
a heart attack now? -Oh no…

274
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,080
-What if that comes after
one month? -Thank God!

275
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,290
-Cheers!
-Thank you.

276
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,910
See, impact comes down a bit
when you keep pain in buffering.

277
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,830
Sattipandu, I’ll give you an offer.

278
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,910
I won’t arrest you now. I’ll be in this
village for one month on vacation.

279
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,370
You watch daily soaps, go for
shopping, attend marriages or

280
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,580
functions with your family, or get
into telling fairy tales with

281
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,290
your grandchildren for this
one month.

282
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,250
But, a small change!

283
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,160
The Prince will not come
riding a horse now.

284
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,370
Say, he will come riding a bull.

285
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,540
If you disturb me while I’m on
vacation,

286
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,870
I’ll hit you irrespective of
the occasion you are at.

287
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,250
-Hey!
-Just shut up!

288
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,370
You must come voluntarily and
get into the lockup in one month.

289
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,500
You will come and rest.

290
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,370
-Bonita!
-Yes!

291
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,000
Thank you for your hospitality.

292
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
-Oh no!
-Aah!

293
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,000
Sir, why did you come here
instead of coming to the station?

294
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,080
Why did you come?

295
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,000
-I came to garland you.
-Then, go on!

296
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,410
We don’t get it, sir.

297
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,700
-Why are you here?
-To play the band.

298
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,660
Go on then.

299
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,620
-Don’t we have cheer girls?
-Cheer girls? -Yes!

300
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,120
Sir, your expectations are high
and our budget is low.

301
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,080
Adjust with Chintamani for now.

302
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,500
-Which Mani?
-The Mani behind!

303
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,330
Oh, you are that Mani?
Come, Mani!

304
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,200
Why did you stop?
Continue!

305
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,750
-Sir!
-Yes!

306
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,830
You beat us up after asking all our
names. Don’t you say your name?

307
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,620
I wrote a song myself about me,
to suit such situations.

308
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,250
As per the request of audience,
my title song!

309
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,830
All the rights are reserved by me.

310
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,370
“Play the band in the narrow
streets, dude”

311
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,370
“Boss, here comes
Mr cool, Bhimaa”

312
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,910
“Which type or you,
mass or temper?”

313
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,830
“This Bhimaa is the mix of
vigour and temper”

314
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,700
“Be silent, he’s the branding
for violence”

315
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,200
“He’s the burning rampage and
you’re finished if you trouble”

316
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,580
“Don't ask for his background,
he is in the fore ground”

317
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,040
“Bhimaa arrived here
by confusing that Lord Brahma”

318
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,910
Not a quarter, drink water.

319
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,370
“He’s the monster and
a fully loaded gun version”

320
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,950
“He’s the ferocious demon
being silent”

321
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:32,290
“He’ll pick and end all
the bad people”

322
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,200
“He is so super as a friend”

323
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,790
“Whatever is the danger,
he faces it from front”

324
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,500
“He’s with great mercy like
the God”

325
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:47,540
“Though so many states and
regions oppose”

326
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,250
“This stubborn man doesn’t
listen even when said no”

327
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,370
“Play the band in the narrow
streets, dude”

328
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,200
“Boss, here comes
Mr cool, Bhimaa”

329
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,080
“Which type or you,
mass or temper?”

330
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,830
“This Bhimaa is the mix of
vigour and temper”

331
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,950
“Be silent, he’s the branding
for violence”

332
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,870
“He’s the burning rampage and
you’re finished if you trouble”

333
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,910
“Don't ask for his background,
he is in the fore ground”

334
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,410
“Bhimaa arrived here
by confusing that Lord Brahma”

335
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,910
Sir...

336
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,750
Sir, what are you doing?

337
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,120
It is an illegal bunk, shut it.

338
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,580
Sir, are you a Police or a Rowdy?

339
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,120
No doubt, a Rowdy Police!

340
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,580
Daddy! It seems, some new SI idiot
came home and overacted.

341
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,870
I’ll break that rascal’s back and
make him salute you every day.

342
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,080
No!

343
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:01,000
You know how important is
that job you left for, right?

344
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,540
You first finish that and
then come home.

345
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:09,080
My revenge will burn fiercely
and turn into a rage by then.

346
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,410
Let’s burn him in that fire
once you are back.

347
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,250
You can use your influence and
get that Bhimaa transferred

348
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,450
in just one minute, right?

349
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:26,700
He himself said, he got used
to transfers.

350
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,910
What pain will he feel if I too
do the same?

351
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:38,500
Once my Rudra is back, I too will
insult him in front of everyone in

352
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:45,540
this village like he did to me and make
him fall on my feet asking me to forgive.

353
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,580
Let him overact till then.

354
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,700
Mike testing 1, 2, 3…

355
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,200
Will he start a singing
program now?

356
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,750
My dear brothers and sisters!

357
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,410
I think none would listen if you
say sisters, being so handsome sir.

358
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,040
Correct man, ok wait!

359
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,830
Old man sitting at the corner!

360
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,000
Quarter Pandu soon transforming
into a photo over the wall!

361
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,200
Beautiful Kanta and Kantarao
eying on her!

362
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,750
Please listen to me.
My name is Bhimaa.

363
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,450
Bhimaa?
Where is your mace?

364
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,750
Another idiot asked just like you and
I shoved it into his shorts.

365
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,620
-Say if you need it and I’ll bring it.
-Thanks!

366
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,830
-I’m giving an offer to you all.
-Oh no, offer?

367
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,750
If any of your items are stolen
from now on, come and give

368
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,160
a complaint in the Police station.

369
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,950
We’ll lose money again, if
we come to the Police station.

370
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,540
We will not believe in Police.

371
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,910
Fine, you don’t believe and
continue licking the lemon.

372
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,330
All the rest, come to Police station and
take the value of your stolen items in cash.

373
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,080
What?

374
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,620
-Will you pay in cash if we lose
any item? -Yes!

375
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,790
What? We pull money from the
customers who give us the complaint.

376
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,790
-Why does he say to pay in return?
-Yes!

377
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,200
Will you give money if anything is
lost, sir?

378
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,950
I can’t give back if your wife
has eloped, man.

379
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,200
-I, myself will not give a complaint
if she is gone. -This is correct.

380
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,750
Won’t I push you in lockup if
you give a complaint?

381
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:44,000
If any idiot gives a false complaint,
I’ll park a rusted rod in his cellar.

382
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,200
This offer will be on from today
until I’m here in your village.

383
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,910
Don’t be disappointed by delaying
and the guy losing this will be a fool.

384
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,370
Sir!

385
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,910
When we come here and give
a complaint saying something

386
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,830
is stolen, you pay money
it seems, sir?

387
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,450
-Mr Rao!
-Sir!

388
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,080
-Customer is here, come on.
-Why is he talking like us?

389
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,120
Please tell me, sir.

390
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:17,080
My purse is stolen in 12B bus
at Geetha Nagar road, sir.

391
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,330
-Pick pocket?
-Yes sir!

392
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,330
No mercy at all, to these
dirty thieves. Damn!

393
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,660
-It is for you.
-I understood!

394
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,330
-Mr old boy!
-Sir!

395
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,370
-How much was there in the purse?
-Ten thousand, sir.

396
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,290
-Just ten thousand?
-Yes sir!

397
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,450
-Mr Rao!
-Sir!

398
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,450
-Write ten thousand five hundred.
-Why?

399
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,540
-We got to buy a new purse for
old boy, right? -Thank you, sir.

400
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,370
-Please write, sir.
-I’m writing, sir.

401
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,750
Write a new purse also, sir.

402
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,080
-I’m writing that too, sir.
-Ok, sir.

403
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,660
-Sir!
-Yes!

404
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,910
Oh no, I forgot.

405
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,000
-Manju!
-Oh no!

406
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,700
Everyone is waiting for your entry.

407
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,370
I’ll beat you up if you come in
slow motion as I said entry.

408
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Say Boss!

409
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,080
Do the settlement to this old boy
with your golden hand.

410
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,200
Look old boy, you don’t worry
at all. Here, take this.

411
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,790
This is the profit.

412
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,500
-Rao sir, call all your people and ask
them to give an autograph. -Why?

413
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,040
Why? Boss, tell him once.

414
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,870
As a witness that settlement
is done, Mr Rao.

415
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,040
Oh, fine! Then, we will sign.

416
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:32,620
Mr Rao! Thanks for signing voluntarily
to pay 15,500 next week with interest

417
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:39,580
for the 10,500 you’ve taken
from me.

418
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,910
-Sir, why should we pay this?
-What is this, sir?

419
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,910
Will you pay if a mechanic
doesn’t repair?

420
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,830
Will you pay if a Doctor
doesn’t treat?

421
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,500
Then why should a Police not
doing his job, get his salary paid?

422
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,290
Don’t you have any shame?
Of course, you’d have let that gone.

423
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,000
You treat people coming to
give a complaint as customers?

424
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,910
We don’t need to favour them,
but we should do our job well.

425
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,040
It is after all a pick pocket
case, sir.

426
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,450
Pick pocket! Pick pocket!

427
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,700
When a middleclass person works
hard for the entire month and

428
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,040
takes his salary and if that is
lost in pickpocketing…

429
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,330
When he stands with empty pocket
unable to pay his milk bill,

430
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,910
current bill, medical bill and
water bill…

431
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,200
You know how that feels?

432
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,910
When he’s unable to pay the debt
taken and the lender is insulting

433
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,750
the ladies in his family,
his head is down in shame.

434
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,080
You know how it feels?

435
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,000
You say that is after all.

436
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,330
It is not a big case when the rich
or a bank gets looted and

437
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,450
petty case when the poor is robbed.

438
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,120
We shouldn’t provide them service
based on the crime size, Mr Rao.

439
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,700
Public service is a serious duty.

440
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,660
That too, police service is
a damn serious responsibility.

441
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,120
Middleclass man is half dead
right when he gets robbed.

442
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,830
Taking a bribe from such a guy is
like collecting coins over a corpse.

443
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,450
You get salaries only if you have
an interest in finding the lost items

444
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,700
and the guy stealing those.

445
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:22,080
Or else, I’ll make you pay
that value along with interest.

446
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,410
-Did you understand?
-Yes, we understood sir.

447
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,450
Rao Sir, robbery in B12 route
means it is by that Ranga idiot.

448
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,870
-I’ll go and bring him urgently. Hold this
old man here till then. -Ok!

449
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,200
Sir, please be right here and
I’m back soon.

450
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,160
Sir, you too be right here.
Please don’t go, sir.

451
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,620
Ranga!

452
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,540
-Ranga!
-Sir!

453
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,000
-Oh, are you here? -I said, will send
the commission in the evening, right?

454
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,160
Not the commission, rascal!
Our new SI has given us a mission impossible.

455
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,620
Where did you keep that purse
you stole from B12 bus?

456
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,620
It is in my shorts.

457
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,830
Oh no! Not this one, but the one
I put aside for washing.

458
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,950
Tell that first. I don’t understand what
I’m taking in this hurry. Go and get that.

459
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,200
-In how many busses did you loot
all these? -Just one bus!

460
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,580
-Just one bus?
-Yes!

461
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,540
You are no ordinary guy.
What’s this?

462
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,160
How did you steel this nose ring?

463
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:14,080
Middy babe and Bermuda boy were into
deep chatting and I stole it in that mess.

464
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,370
You are a great thief, man.
Where is my purse?

465
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,500
-This has money and it must be that.
-Yes, that is the one.

466
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,330
Thank God, I got it.

467
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,870
-Fine, I got it. Thanks, I’m leaving.
-Ok!

468
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,830
What if someone else comes
again to give a complaint?

469
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,290
Hey, I need this entire bunch.
Please, man!

470
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,330
-Just this one bunch, right?
-Just one?

471
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,950
How many more bunches
do you have?

472
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,950
-Sir! -What?
-My lungis!

473
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,950
I’ll get them cleanly washed
and starched, you rascal.

474
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:42,120
Sir, I’m back. I’m here, sir.
I’m here.

475
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,830
Entire Alibaba treasure opened up
with just one complaint, sir.

476
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,700
Oh no, purse!
Here is your purse, sir.

477
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,120
Sir, here is the ten thousand.

478
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,410
-Here, sir! Brother, paper!
-I heard. Here, I’m tearing it.

479
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,870
-Sir, I lost my slippers at the temple.
-One thousand or two?

480
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,750
You stop it, man. We’ll put in
our efforts for his slippers.

481
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,790
Hey, put that table outside.
If he says the amount, that man

482
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,660
will pull from our pockets.

483
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:18,250
-Stop! -If you wish to give
complaint, you don’t need to come in.

484
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,540
You can give it right here.
We’re always at your service.

485
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:27,660
Wow Sir, you set right everyone
with your brains. What a brain?

486
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,080
I haven’t yet used it, man.

487
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,290
-I'm in the vacation mood.
-Wow!

488
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,370
Brother, special tea for you.

489
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,830
-What are you studying, kiddo?
-Studies?

490
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,040
No facilities in the Government school
and I don’t have enough money

491
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,790
to study in private school.

492
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,080
I’m an orphan, brother. I got to
keep selling tea and lead my life.

493
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,950
-Hey Rama, get two teas.
-Coming, brother.

494
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,160
-Hey, what’s your name?
-Rama!

495
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,410
-See you, brother.
-Hey, wait!

496
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,290
-What did you say?
-See you, brother!

497
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,660
Hey, call me as brother
at least for once.

498
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,870
-Call me brother for once.
-Brother!

499
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,830
I know, you will not call me.

500
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:15,000
-Call once again.
-Brother!

501
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,080
You will call me as brother
someday, by yourself.

502
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,040
I will not call, even at my death.

503
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,450
-Rao Sir!
-Yes!

504
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,000
-Find it.
-What?

505
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,120
-Astrology!
-What?

506
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,080
Ok, sir! Oh no!

507
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,660
-What are you seeing?
-Grandpa, I need an information.

508
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,080
-Grandpa? -Hand is shaking
like a phone in vibration mode.

509
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,250
Are you young?

510
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,290
-Correct! What do you need?
-I need the best Rowdy in this city.

511
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:45,370
People come here to give complaints on
Rowdies and why are you here for Rowdies?

512
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,370
-I must give my complaint to a Rowdy.
-Why?

513
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,950
Rowdies fix a deal when we go on
any work to them.

514
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,330
Sincerity exists for sure in
their work.

515
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,540
But if we go to Police, we need to pay
some money while giving the complaint.

516
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,580
And we got to pay some more
while following it up.

517
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,410
There’s neither a clarity that
job is done and no fixed rate too.

518
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:10,200
You’ve pulled out all the strings
from the Khaki shirt. Super!

519
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,660
I’m like that.
There’s no filter to my mouth.

520
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,580
-I get that.
-Say, who is the best Rowdy here?

521
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,330
There’s just one Rowdy in this area.

522
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,620
Everyone has left taking voluntary
retirement after he arrived.

523
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,120
-Who is that?
-The one and only licensed Rowdy!

524
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,040
Bhimaa!

525
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,910
-My name is Vidya.
-It is so cute.

526
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,660
-What? -Oh no!
-The name!

527
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,200
I look very beautiful, right?

528
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,500
Hey, it is a compliment and
not a complaint.

529
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,290
No, a guy named Romeo is
following me by saying to marry me.

530
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,660
By mistake, did you say him ok?

531
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,540
-Damn, no way!
I have not said ok to him.

532
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,700
But that guy is threatening to pour
acid on me if I don’t accept.

533
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,330
Acid?
I’ll pour that in his pants.

534
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,540
Pour it, but I first need
a body guard.

535
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,410
You need a guard for your body?

536
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,660
-What? -He’s the macho
and God for this entire place.

537
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,080
Are you his personal orchestra?

538
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,120
You’ve been beating it from
so far in his support.

539
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,540
-That is our duty.
-Did you listen to it?

540
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,500
It is visible, right?

541
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,040
You got to say your rate.
You shouldn’t keep asking repeatedly.

542
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,580
-For what?
-She is asking to be a body guard, sir.

543
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,160
Oh, no need of any amount
for that.

544
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,120
Grandpa, didn’t I say there’ll be
no clarity with Police?

545
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:27,870
Sir, madam is already fixed.
Why do you hurt her feelings?

546
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,200
-Five thousand, madam!
-Oh no!

547
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,540
Five thousand, don’t I get
any discount?

548
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,870
This is not Kalamandir, madam.

549
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,410
-Here is 500 as advance.
-What is this, Mr Rao?

550
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,870
This is an advance for me, sir.
You advance now.

551
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,700
Sir, jeep is... not ready. Tire just got
punctured and you go on the bike, sir.

552
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,910
You’ve kept the orchestra
everywhere in your station, right?

553
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,250
-No, in the entire village.
-Fine, move now.

554
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,000
-Excuse me!
-Yes!

555
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,910
-Your number…
-I won’t give.

556
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,250
You are my security and
you must come only when I ask.

557
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,450
-I’ll call you myself.
-Oh, ok!

558
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,330
If you get a opportunity
you will advance.

559
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:54,200
I need to find that opportunity, right?
Look, how is she shaking?

560
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,910
-Babu Rao!
-No sir, Kutumba Rao.

561
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,410
-Ok, Babu Rao!
-Sir!

562
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,450
Oh, madam!

563
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,870
She’s working here as a
part time teacher.

564
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,540
She is also doing PhD in Botany
along with that.

565
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,700
She is a strict teacher and
a good student.

566
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,200
Oh no!

567
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,250
You should be going around
trees and bushes at this age.

568
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,870
Why is this PhD on trees at
this age, my cutie?

569
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,450
-Sir!
-What?

570
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,950
Ok sir!

571
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,500
Let’s see.

572
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:30,580
I’ve been waiting just for you.

573
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,040
You’re playing a ball game
with the world, sir.

574
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,000
-Orchestra is a bit loud, Mr Rao.
-Ok sir!

575
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,040
-Hello!
-Is security there?

576
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:49,080
-He is here. Security!
-Hey! -Sir!

577
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,540
-Madam’s phone.
-Oh!

578
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,410
-Hello!
-Hey security!

579
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:59,330
-Yes! -That Romeo is standing in side of
my school corridor holding the acid bottle.

580
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,500
Ask him to stay right there. I’ll see
his end. I’m coming right away.

581
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,370
-Come on boys!
-Boys, come on!

582
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,870
Oh no, Police!
I won’t leave you.

583
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,330
-I won’t get caught.
-Guys, catch him. He’s escaping.

584
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,000
-Hey, stop idiot.
-I won’t stop.

585
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,330
-True love, sir! Leave me.
-Hey, stop idiot.

586
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:26,370
Why are you overacting like adding spices
worth a hundred for a food worth ten?

587
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,790
Sorry Vidya, we missed him.

588
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,120
-I already knew you’d miss.
-How?

589
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,830
I got a doubt you can’t catch him,
when you stopped the Jeep and ran.

590
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,620
-Fine, shall I drop you?
-No need.

591
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,290
He went that way, right?
I’ll go this way.

592
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,700
You are trying to take advantage
by finding a chance.

593
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,750
When did you take advantage, sir?

594
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,750
-I didn’t take. She is trying to give it.
-Oh!

595
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:58,750
-Sir!
-Yes!

596
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:02,330
You caught Romeo and
why did you lie he escaped?

597
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,370
See now, dude!

598
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:11,580
Idiot, you can follow a girl.
Every man does that.

599
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:15,040
Even a male animal tries very hard
to impress the female,

600
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,540
but never threatens to kill it.

601
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,500
We got to threaten, sir.
Otherwise, they don’t listen.

602
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,080
This is also a part of true love.

603
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,040
Correct dude, we got to threaten.
Or else, they don’t listen.

604
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,410
Thank you sir, you understood
it very well. Love you, thank you!

605
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,950
-Hey, pour it on him.
-Oh no, what sir?

606
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,830
-Acid!
-Oh no, acid?

607
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,120
Come on, pour it!

608
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,870
Sir, I thought he’d pee in pants and
why does he say to pour it instead?

609
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,160
-Give it here, once.
-Here, sir. -Give it.

610
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:42,160
-You pour it, sir.
-What to pour, idiot?

611
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,330
-Why are you like this, idiot?
-Will you really pour it now?

612
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:49,830
-Sir, no please!
-No sir, he’ll die.

613
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,000
This idiot mixed drinking soda in
baking soda.

614
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,450
Oh no, this idiot looks
very cunning sir.

615
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,620
Give me his mobile.

616
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,370
-What did you save Vidya’s name as?
-Vidya, my love!

617
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,540
Vidya idiot, will you have
security round the clock?

618
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,040
I’ll come to your hostel tonight
and pour acid on you.

619
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,660
It’s wrong, sir. It’s a crime, sir.

620
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,870
-What’s wrong? We can cook,
only when the pan heats up right?

621
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,870
-Hello!
-Hey security!

622
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:21,830
-It’s heated up, sir.
-Oh, it is very fast.

623
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,330
-No, Vidya!
-Why is he screaming?

624
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:26,080
Hello!

625
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:30,250
Romeo messaged saying to come to
the hostel and pour acid. Come fast!

626
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:39,370
-From when are the Police so handsome?
-You idiot!

627
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,790
-I’m ready even to get arrested.
I think he is a virgin. -Oh no!

628
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:49,620
Sir, what is a virgin?

629
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,080
-Are you from Telugu medium?
-Yes, sir!

630
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:55,040
-It means a good person.
-Then, I too am a virgin sir.

631
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,290
-Hey, shut up! -If not as much
as I am, you too are a bit virgin, brother.

632
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:00,330
-Shut up! Soldiers!
-Lord!

633
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,040
-Enter the dragon!
-Yay!

634
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:03,500
Hey, not my side.
That side!

635
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,370
-Hey, will you directly come
into the room? -Yeah!

636
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:11,370
-This is a ladies hostel,
can’t you see? -Is it? Really?

637
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,200
-Who are you?
-Security!

638
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,290
-Where should you be?
-At the gate!

639
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:23,160
Mosquitoes might bite if he is out.
Poor guy will have to scratch.

640
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,120
-You’d scratch if he comes in.
-No, listen to me.

641
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:29,660
-Move now. Move!
-Oh no!

642
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,290
-My Lord, she is coming on to us.
-No,no... -Sir!

643
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:38,370
-Hey, don’t sleep. -How can
I sleep after watching all this?

644
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:39,950
Ok!

645
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,040
He takes advantage whenever
there is a chance.

646
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,500
I think pan is over heated and
the food got roasted.

647
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,290
Sir, when we are so virgin,
why is madam not at all virgin?

648
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,700
Idiot, do you know the meaning
of virgin or not?

649
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:17,580
-Madam, you go in and sir will be
in rounds right here. -Yes!

650
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,370
-Hey Bhattu!
-My Lord!

651
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,040
You will feel very happy if
they are sent in, right?

652
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:26,750
-Do you have any objection if I’m in
their room in five minutes? -Impossible!

653
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,160
-You know, what a great man said?
-What did he say?

654
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,790
-Impossible or my foot!
-Oh no!

655
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,870
Baking soda with drinking soda!

656
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:51,580
Oh no!
Sara, Acid! Run!

657
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,830
-Hey, what are you doing?
-I’m killing the mosquitoes.

658
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,580
He threw acid inside the room.
What are you sitting there and doing?

659
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,080
-Who am I?
-Security!

660
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:05,080
-Where should I be?
-At the gate!

661
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,500
That’s why I told, I’ll take
great care if I’m close by.

662
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,410
Ask him to come in.

663
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,250
Come!

664
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:18,450
-Bhattu!
-My Lord!

665
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,200
-What’s she saying?
-She’s asking you to come in, Lord.

666
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,160
-Oh no!
-You fools, pan isn’t over heated.

667
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,790
When tiger cooks the tiger rice,
it will be always nice.

668
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:29,950
What?

669
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,000
-He didn’t understand, explain.
-Ok!

670
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,790
“I’m flat thinking it is some magic”

671
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:54,120
“Was that a pleasure when
the Lord created you?”

672
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:59,790
“Maybe your colour is to be
asked to look beautiful”

673
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:05,040
“Are there comparisons in
any language to say about you?”

674
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:32,660
“I’m flat thinking it is some magic”

675
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:38,200
“Was that a pleasure when
the Lord created you?”

676
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:16,660
“Is it true I’m with you?
Is this a boon to me?”

677
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,290
“Ego, don't come for a while”

678
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:20,700
Hey Stop, Stop, Stop!
-Where are you going?

679
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,870
I’m going to see Ravindra Varma garu,
the great Ayurveda wizard.

680
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,080
I’m working on my research there.

681
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:30,540
-Oh, is he your Guru!
-He’s more than Guru, a father figure to me.

682
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,000
"You own my complete life"

683
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:43,500
"You changed my hesitation
into a song"

684
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:01,830
-Hey Rama!
-Brother?

685
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,200
-Take these new clothes.
-Why, brother?

686
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,870
-Tomorrow is my birthday. -Why new
clothes for me on your birthday, brother?

687
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,620
“I’m flat thinking it is some magic”
-It’s all right. -Thanks, brother.

688
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:17,160
“Was that a pleasure when
the Lord created you?”

689
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,950
When did they reopen
this school, grandpa?

690
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,750
A Police man came here like a God
to wipe out poor children's problems.

691
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,620
He is Bhimaa.

692
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,080
Yay!

693
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,500
Come fast, madam.

694
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,660
-Say something.
-You say it.

695
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,700
I love you!

696
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,250
No problem, it'll be down.

697
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,910
Will my baby’s fever come down
by taking this medicine, madam?

698
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,120
Why did you delay so much?

699
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:36,080
We came in the night, madam.
They said master wasn’t there.

700
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,660
Don’t you know? Master will not
meet anyone after Sunset.

701
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:43,040
-He doesn’t even give treatment.
-Why?

702
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:46,410
It is a great sin to cut the plants
after Sunset.

703
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:52,080
-No problem, take this.
It’ll be down. -Drink!

704
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:27,040
-Guru ji?
-Yes!

705
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,700
Very rare plant!

706
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,910
It has great medicinal values.

707
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:49,160
We can save many lives using
this plant.

708
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:57,540
Namaste Guruji!

709
00:57:57,950 --> 00:58:03,000
Medicine is equivalent to God!
May all be good!

710
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:06,200
You are the reason for us to be
so happy, master.

711
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:10,040
My baby’s health didn’t get better
though we visited so many hospitals

712
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:12,040
and spent lots of money.

713
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,250
My baby lived with your treatment.

714
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,120
You are a God to us.

715
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:21,910
This is not my greatness.
It is the greatness of this land.

716
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:27,410
Sanjivini medicine which can reward life to
the dead person is grown in this land of India.

717
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,660
Don’t we get a medicine for
these diseases?

718
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,620
Master, they say plants with great
medicinal values exist in Himalayas.

719
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,160
Do you bring these from there?

720
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,160
Not just the Himalayas! Even this
land you are standing on is great.

721
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:45,410
One among the seven eternal
beings is Parasurama.

722
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,410
This is the land where
Parasurama lived.

723
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:52,410
Plants growing here have great
medicinal values.

724
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:57,580
They have the power to cure
any disease.

725
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:03,120
We may even find Sanjivini, by
searching with a stubborn will power.

726
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,580
Is it true, master?

727
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,700
This is impossible for
the human beings.

728
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:15,410
A great person specially born for
this cause must come for this task.

729
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:31,000
-Namaste sir, my name is…
-Bhimaa!

730
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,750
You are the new SI coming to
this village.

731
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:37,370
I heard you are doing great works
immediately after arriving here.

732
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,540
-I wanted to see once.
-Oh!

733
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:46,330
You saw me, right?
Are you happy now?

734
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:55,160
Bhimaa, I have a small request.

735
00:59:56,410 --> 01:00:00,330
An ancient temple in our village
is closed down from five decades.

736
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:05,410
I’ve been waiting for you.

737
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:09,790
We’ve been trying from so many
years to get that opened.

738
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
They told, some cases are
pending in the court.

739
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:16,250
A temple without worship is like
the baby without mother’s lap.

740
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:21,870
We’re unable to witness the temple barren
like this, it instead had to glow in charm.

741
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:26,040
Will you help in getting it opened?

742
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,000
That Bhimaa is disturbing us
a lot, brother.

743
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:44,660
Bhimaa closed down all our business
just in few days after he arrived here.

744
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,700
If it goes the same way, I feel he’ll
get to know even about our tankers.

745
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,250
-Can we send tanker?
-Yes, you can.

746
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:10,950
If we bring in our batch from forest,
they’ll finish that Bhimaa.

747
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:16,250
You just say yes for once, brother.

748
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,500
-Give that register.
-Sir!

749
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:38,580
Give that.

750
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,500
Give me that phone.

751
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:25,750
Give that torch.

752
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,700
Brother, it seems Bhimaa came
to the check post.

753
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:41,540
Sir, permit for those two vehicles!

754
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,330
Sir, shall I let them go?

755
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:48,750
Hey, let them go.

756
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,120
Sir, you are silent even after
knowing Bhavani is doing all this.

757
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:11,830
Are you waiting for Rudra, sir?

758
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,330
There is some other person
behind these two.

759
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,450
Why did you ask me to stop
here, sir?

760
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,830
I’ve a small work. You go to
the station and I’ll come there.

761
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,040
Brother, Ravinder Varma asked for
Bhimaa's help in reopening the temple .

762
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,620
What?

763
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:48,910
-Dad!
-Ask Tandava to finish the work fast.

764
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,370
-Damn!
-What happened?

765
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:10,040
That truck driver is not answering
the phone, brother.

766
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:12,830
What are you talking, idiot?

767
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,830
Brother, he is not answering
the calls at all.

768
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:37,910
What happened to tanker, idiot?

769
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,580
Sir, accident it seems!

770
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:44,330
We got a call from the control room.
Ambulance driver is not answering the call.

771
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,660
I’ll go and bring him.
You both go with Sir.

772
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:25,950
Sir, both the driver and cleaner
are dead.

773
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,620
Chandra!

774
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:58,410
Oh no!

775
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:01,000
Sir!

776
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,910
(Child crying)

777
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:25,870
-(Child crying)
-Brother, come fast.

778
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,870
Hey, Ambulance driver fell down
after getting drunk.

779
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,540
Vehicle is struck in sand
at Sivaiah Jalar.

780
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,540
-Brother!
-Brother!

781
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:49,500
Sir, it seems Ambulance tire is
stuck in sand at Sivaiah Jalar.

782
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,000
These will not leave us.
Many more will come soon.

783
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:57,790
Sir, there is a shortcut to
beach road thorigh this forest.

784
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,540
But, how do we go taking
all these children with us, sir?

785
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:07,620
Brother, will we die?

786
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,290
Don’t be scared.

787
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:15,160
Even that death should fear today
by seeing your courage.

788
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:20,910
Even that God of death can’t touch
you when this Bhimaa is with you.

789
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,870
This is my word.

790
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,950
Brother, we cannot stop him
anymore. You have to enter now.

791
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Sir!

792
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:13,410
Brother!

793
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,700
Run!

794
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:37,080
(Hanuman chalisa)

795
01:16:50,830 --> 01:17:07,870
(Praises to Lord Shiva)

796
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:41,910
“Hey Lord Shiva, I just wish
to be in your shadow”

797
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:50,790
“Hey kind Lord Shiva,
we just need your protection”

798
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:55,620
“You just reside in the heart”

799
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:59,410
“Hey Lord, bless us”

800
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:06,200
"We seek your mercy, hey Lord"

801
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,000
“Holy is the Lord’s name”

802
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:17,080
“Holy is the Lord’s appearance”

803
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:21,660
“Holy is the Lord’s name”

804
01:18:21,950 --> 01:18:25,700
“Holy is the Lord’s appearance”

805
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:49,120
What about you, son?

806
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:52,660
God will give you himself.

807
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:55,870
Who knows what he gives?

808
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,500
Ask for once and see, that God
himself might come to you.

809
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,200
-What will he come tome?
-Hey, did you get what I asked?

810
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,040
Idiot, why did you bring
less coconuts?

811
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:12,200
Uncle, he always gave
six for a hundred, but gave just

812
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:13,450
five now by increasing the price.

813
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:14,830
Why couldn’t you ask him
stubbornly?

814
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,580
He looked angrily, when I
tried asking.

815
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:18,790
I felt my head is important than
the coconuts and

816
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,540
came back running from there.

817
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:25,290
Priest post you have support to get,
went to that idiotic Siddanthi

818
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:29,700
as you kept silent for everything.

819
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:33,370
Everyone would take advantage
of you, if you be cool like this.

820
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:36,580
They are breaking and eating even if we
are hard like the coconut, uncle.

821
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:40,500
Hey idiot, put those
50 coconuts in this bag.

822
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,200
There are just 5 coconuts,
right uncle?

823
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,790
Just 5, but I’ve written 50 here.

824
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,410
Oh God, are you swallowing God’s money
by chatting 45 and writing as 50 coconuts?

825
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:55,500
To hell with you! Is that God
any foody to swallow 50 coconuts?

826
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:57,910
We are writing it so, to fulfil
our hunger. That’s it.

827
01:19:58,120 --> 01:19:59,790
Do we need so many for our
hunger, uncle?

828
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:04,200
I’m saving all this for my huddle wife.

829
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:06,250
-Who is it, uncle?
-Mandaram!

830
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,580
Oh God!
She is mother of Pari, right?

831
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:11,410
You chicken head, what did
our Chanakya say?

832
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:14,200
It is not important if the girl is
first hand or second hand.

833
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:16,620
That great man said it is not important
first or second but

834
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:17,830
as long as she doesn’t betray us.

835
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,410
Did Chanakya say this really?

836
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,410
You fool! people will only believe if we say
Chanakya said it, for anything we want to say.

837
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:28,830
“This is the silence from
going speechless”

838
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:31,790
Why did the look turn that side?

839
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,950
“This is the silence from
going speechless”

840
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,250
Is she aware that you are in
love with her?

841
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:44,870
Why would she let go a handsome
man like me if she knows?

842
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:47,250
-I didn’t tell.
-Why, are you scared?

843
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:52,080
You fool, it is not enough just to get
a cow. We also need grass to feed it.

844
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:53,500
I’m accumulating the same.

845
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,160
There is no use now after your
age is over, uncle.

846
01:20:56,370 --> 01:21:00,370
Age doesn’t matter. Youth blossoms
when you are in love.

847
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:02,830
-Our time is over here.
-For what, love?

848
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,580
For the account! We need to
urgently go to the school.

849
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,830
Rama!
Children, silence!

850
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:18,330
Aren’t you frustrated when
children are making so much noise?

851
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:19,950
Why don’t you ask them to
stop that noise?

852
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:22,500
If not now when can children
make noise ?

853
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:25,910
Once they grow old, even their
faces will go frustrated like yours.

854
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,750
Thus, don’t try to control them.

855
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,950
They turn into donkeys if we
don’t control at all.

856
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:32,290
These aren’t donkeys.
But are Gods.

857
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,000
Thus elders say God exists
in children.

858
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,870
Sir, this God pinched me.

859
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,830
You too are a God, right?
You too pinch back.

860
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,160
What can I do in between, when
two Gods pinch each other?

861
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:45,950
Rama, oh no!
Oh God!

862
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:50,000
Hey Rama! What is this?

863
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,540
Don’t you have at least 10% liking on me,
from what you show on those kids?

864
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:59,580
I told ‘I love you’ so many times
to you.

865
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:01,660
Did you say ‘I love you’ to me
at least for once?

866
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:04,790
Oh no, Pari!

867
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:06,870
When will you pick me up?

868
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,330
Bring down your weight a bit
and I’ll try.

869
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:10,910
Oh my, Rama cracked a joke.

870
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,660
When will you take me away
from my home?

871
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,370
Are you really a man?

872
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,540
What are you talking, Pari? I was going into
men’s toilet as a kid. Why is that doubt?

873
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:22,330
A man shouldn’t pee himself, but
should make the opposite people pee.

874
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:26,620
Pari, our idiot is daily taking all
the students here to pee right?

875
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:28,290
Hey you, dirty idiot!

876
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:34,370
No Pari, don’t you talk to me like that. I'd have
been in the place of your father. I just missed it.

877
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:39,450
See, he is in love with my mother even
at this age of receiving pension.

878
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:41,790
Then, why can’t you love?

879
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,870
-Oh no Pari, how can I love
your mother? -Oh no, Rama!

880
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,750
Oh God, I can’t bear with his jokes.

881
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,370
Instead of loving a coward like you,
better myself elope you someday.

882
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:53,450
It is wrong Pari, you are engaged to
our priest’s son Bhattachari, right?

883
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:57,750
When my dad threatened to hang himself,
I put my finger in that ring being scared.

884
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,040
Only you have the right over me.

885
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:03,500
This fool doesn’t have right even
on his attire. He let goes when

886
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:06,540
someone snatches that with
a feeling not to get into a fight.

887
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:10,330
Is it so? Will you let go if someone
snatches me away?

888
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:12,450
I and your attire are the same
for you?

889
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:15,040
Oh no, Bhattachari is watching.

890
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:16,700
Hey Rama!

891
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,080
How many times do I tell you
not to mess with Pari?

892
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:24,290
Engagement means, she is
half married.

893
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,540
I’m half husband to Pari now.

894
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:29,450
Idiot, I feel like husband though
her mom is fully married.

895
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:30,620
-Sarangi!
-Ok!

896
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:32,290
-Rama!
-Oh no!

897
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:34,580
Hey Sarangi, look at him.

898
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:39,620
-You look like a bull and you fear about
these squirrels? -A squirrel?

899
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:44,580
Hey Pari, how did you fall in love
with such a coward?

900
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:47,950
Do I replay and show how I
fell in love with him?

901
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:51,410
-You’ll die in jealous.
-Did you go so far, Pari?

902
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:54,080
No, I went so close.

903
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:56,870
-Pari, how could you get so careless?
Come, idiot. -Get lost!

904
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,540
Hey Rama! I’ll see your end.

905
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:00,000
-Come, Pari!
-Rama!

906
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:04,580
Let anybody marry me.
But, I’ll come back to you.

907
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,120
I love you, Rama.

908
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:09,120
-Why is her mom not like her?
- I love you, Rama.

909
01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:15,370
Rama, we shouldn’t give so much
lenience to kids. We are after all…

910
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:19,290
I was posted there day before and
am again posted there. No idea what to do.

911
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,870
I too am posted there tomorrow.
Let's go together.

912
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:21,790
-Namaste, sir!
-Namaste!

913
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,330
To hell with these night duties!

914
01:24:24,290 --> 01:24:28,620
Why do you fear? It won’t happen
so every time. Come!

915
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:38,120
In! Out!
In! Out!

916
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:42,120
-Yeah! -Why is this priest
wining all the time at playing cards?

917
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:45,250
Is it written in constitution that
a priest’s son shouldn’t play cards?

918
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:47,870
No, but run now. Police is coming.
Run, guys.

919
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,870
When they’re all running away
seeing me, why didn’t you run?

920
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,200
Don’t you fear about me?

921
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:56,950
I make others run, but Bhimaa
doesn’t run by seeing someone.

922
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,540
How egoistic are you, rascal?

923
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:02,160
I don’t know how much, but a machine
to measure that isn’t invented yet.

924
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:04,700
You dirty kid, come here.
Come on!

925
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:07,500
You rascal, come here.
Come on!

926
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,370
Idiot, I won't leave you.

927
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,660
Don't cry, Rama.

928
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:13,290
Today is Pari’s birthday.

929
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,620
I saved one rupee with difficulty
to buy something for her.

930
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:21,700
That dirty rascal Bhimaa stole
my one rupee.

931
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:24,830
Hey look, Bhimaa is coming.

932
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:28,450
-Why are you crying?
-You stole my one rupee.

933
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:29,580
Who the hell are you?

934
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:32,580
-I’m Mr Shankara Bhagavathulu’s
son Rama. -Shut up!

935
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:38,160
You are Bhimaa’s younger brother Raama,
means more valuable than Bhimaa.

936
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:41,950
You must give a valuable gift
to Pari. Take these ten rupees.

937
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:43,950
Oh no, ten rupees?

938
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:47,330
Call me as brother and I’ll give.

939
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,450
-Leave me, I’ll call.
-Will you really call me?

940
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:50,790
I’ll really call you.
Leave me.

941
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:53,160
-Will you call me for sure?
-I’ll surely call, leave me.

942
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:54,700
Come on, run!

943
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,790
-Call me as brother.
-Get lost!

944
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,870
You’ll someday call me as brother
and ask me to come.

945
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,830
I'll never call you as brother.

946
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:06,870
-Buy me a peppermint Rama.
-Let’s buy bangles first.

947
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,700
Give me a dozen bangles.

948
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:13,250
Idiot, you pushed me there and
are now buying bangles here?

949
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:16,330
-You play cards at this age, idiot?
-No sir, please!

950
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,870
Priest sir, your son is arrested.
SI sir called you to the station.

951
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,450
What have you done, Bhimaa rascal?

952
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:27,410
If something happens to Raama
I will kill you.

953
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:31,700
Rama!
Sir, please forgive me.

954
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,160
Rama hasn’t done the wrong.
It was Bhimaa.

955
01:26:36,370 --> 01:26:39,290
-Listen to me. -I brought
that idiot to apologise, sir.

956
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,160
Our constable manhandled the kid
by mistake. You must forgive us.

957
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:43,410
You first be seated.

958
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,790
-Who hit you?
-Get lost, idiot.

959
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:56,040
I’m always into troubles because
of you. I don’t like you. Get lost.

960
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:05,910
Hey, stop!

961
01:27:06,370 --> 01:27:07,250
-Sir!
-Hey!

962
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:11,160
Hey, stop dude.

963
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:15,120
See, he is a demon.
He is born to me by mistake.

964
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:18,040
No idea what was my sin to
have a curse like him?

965
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,620
God hasn’t given you a curse, sir.
It is a boon.

966
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:22,910
-A boon?
-Yes sir!

967
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,160
Ramaa knows the tradition and
he will serve God.

968
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:30,290
But Bhimaa has the courage, sir.
He can serve people if we can mould him.

969
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,700
No sir, he is born to me wrongly.
Put him in jail.

970
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:38,790
Sir, if you have no objection
can I adopt Bhimaa?

971
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,080
Do as you wish.
I’ll do his final rites, today itself.

972
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:45,910
I just have only one son, Ramaa.
You are dead to me.

973
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:50,200
Let’s go, Ramaa.

974
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:57,830
-Hey Rama, call me brother once.
-Get lost.

975
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,250
-Will you be a Police?
-Will you give me the gun?

976
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:03,580
Why?

977
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:15,540
What happened, dear?

978
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:20,160
His memories are haunting me as curses,
though he's not in front of my eyes.

979
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:26,200
No idea what sin I committed in previous
births, I'm now born as Bhimaa's brother.

980
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:29,540
Hey Bhimaa, for these memories
to vanish from me...

981
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:34,160
Either I must die,
or he should die.

982
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,950
Hey, they threw down some body.

983
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:42,580
Jump, guys.

984
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,200
Hey, it is Bhimaa brother!

985
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:48,120
Careful!

986
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:56,330
Bhimaa brother!
Bhimaa brother!

987
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,410
You saved me by risking your lives.

988
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:02,950
I’ll always be indebted to you.

989
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:05,160
We are indebted to you, sir.

990
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,080
Yes sir! We gave up even hunting,
with a fear once that

991
01:29:09,290 --> 01:29:14,200
thieves and goons may come
and harm our families.

992
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:19,000
Attacks stopped after you arrived.
This whole village changed, sir.

993
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:23,830
We too are able to go hunting
in sea by leaving our families.

994
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:26,580
You are a boon to us from God, Sir.

995
01:29:32,330 --> 01:29:34,080
Why are you sitting alone here, brother?

996
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:36,290
Here is your special tea, brother.

997
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,250
-Call me as brother once again.
-Brother!

998
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,580
Why do you feel so happy when
you are called as brother?

999
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,870
-What is your name, kiddo?
-Rama!

1000
01:29:57,660 --> 01:30:01,700
Ramaa, don’t be sad as your father
passed away. I’m here for you.

1001
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:04,500
-Whichever problem you are into, I’ll be
there for you. -Hey Pari, what is this?

1002
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:05,910
-Dad!
-Get up!

1003
01:30:06,910 --> 01:30:10,370
-Dad! -How many times do I tell
you not to be with this dirty fellow?

1004
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:13,450
-Idiot, your dad was proud of being
the main priest. -No sir!

1005
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:15,080
-He supressed me in that profession.
-No sir!

1006
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:17,080
-Now, you’re trying to snatch
my daughter. -No sir!

1007
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:21,040
If you look at her or be with
her again, I’ll finish you rascal.

1008
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,750
-You move now. Come on!
-Rama!

1009
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:32,040
-You hit my brother, idiot?
-Oh no!

1010
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:45,910
Not just my daughter,
I won’t let you touch temple door too.

1011
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:50,160
Go through this for being born as
brother to Bhimaa idiot. Come on!

1012
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:54,750
Hey Rama, what happened?

1013
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:57,870
Hey stop! Why do you have
so much anger on me?

1014
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,370
Why are you haunting me?

1015
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:01,580
Whatever I do, is to keep you happy.

1016
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:04,660
My life is completely ruined
because of your aggressive nature.

1017
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:06,040
-Hey Rama!
-Huh!

1018
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,790
You know the curse I got?
It is to be born with your features.

1019
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,830
If you come in front of me or try to talk
with me again, I will end my own life.

1020
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,410
This is my promise on that Lord Shiva.

1021
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:23,250
Call me as brother for once and
I’ll go away.

1022
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:24,580
Hey, get lost.

1023
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:34,910
-Call me as brother once again.
-Brother!

1024
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:48,000
Bhimaa, what is this?

1025
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:49,540
What happened, Bhimaa?

1026
01:31:57,950 --> 01:32:01,450
‘Garala Suchi Mukham’, most
dangerous war technique used

1027
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:03,910
by the sea pirates from
the olden days!

1028
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:09,370
Poison is shattered and showed
no effect as you fell in the sea water.

1029
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:14,200
You came back alive though
poisoned and thrown in the sea.

1030
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:17,120
Yours is not any ordinary fate.

1031
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:22,040
You have the fate of deciding
your own death.

1032
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:23,540
Brother!

1033
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:31,290
-Brother, you are safe right?
-I’m fine, dear.

1034
01:32:32,450 --> 01:32:34,950
Brother, we don’t know who our
parents are.

1035
01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:36,950
We don’t have a place or name
of our own.

1036
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,250
They scold us when we
approach someone.

1037
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,830
They beat us when we feel
hungry and ask for food.

1038
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:48,660
When you saved us and took us
close, we felt a lot to cry brother.

1039
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:52,830
We feel very courageous by
calling you brother.

1040
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:01,790
Where are all the other children?

1041
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:06,790
Kids have sensitive hearts.

1042
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:13,250
Poor kids have undergone great
mental stress fearing their death.

1043
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:15,620
We could save these kids.

1044
01:33:15,830 --> 01:33:20,750
No idea how many more kids are
still there, whom we couldn’t save.

1045
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:45,620
Rascal, it wouldn’t take even a minute
to punch you and put to sleep.

1046
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,120
You play with the children’s
lives, rascal?

1047
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:54,080
Hey Bhimaa, what children? Playing with
their lives, what are you talking now?

1048
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:57,540
You’re safe as there’s no proof.
But the day I get a proof,

1049
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:00,330
I’ll squeeze you to death, rascal.

1050
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,620
You are after all an SI.
What’s your ego?

1051
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:08,540
It will not take a minute for me to
use my power and get your dress off.

1052
01:34:08,750 --> 01:34:10,620
Do it, rascal.
Do it if you are so powerful.

1053
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,750
You think I go silent if seniors say
and bend when I get suspended?

1054
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,040
This shirt is just to control
the beast in me.

1055
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:18,830
Once that is off, I’ll strip you
and beat up.

1056
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,870
You are still alive as I’m silent.
If I bring in my entire force…

1057
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,450
Do it, rascal.
Why delay?

1058
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:29,290
Bring in at a high rate or from
the neighbouring state.

1059
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:35,700
Once I start slashing, even the graveyard
in this village will not be enough, rascal.

1060
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,830
Hey Bhavani, vacation time is over.
I’m giving you one final offer.

1061
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:49,410
I’ll kill you after showing hell to you and
your son, which you showed to those kids.

1062
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:52,080
No case and no charge sheet!

1063
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:33,290
Damn! He has no time sense at all.
Bloody idiot!

1064
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:41,080
Hey Rama!

1065
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:44,450
Hey Rama idiot, stop.
Why do you leave when I’m calling?

1066
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:45,580
Oh God!

1067
01:35:45,910 --> 01:35:47,450
Don’t you have the power to
Stop, when the girl loving you

1068
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:49,040
is getting married in a week?

1069
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:51,540
It is not enough that a man has
the moustache.

1070
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:52,790
He also should have some courage.

1071
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,910
She said something like
peeing and all, the day before.

1072
01:35:56,370 --> 01:35:58,500
You don’t give different meanings
to a man daily and confuse me.

1073
01:35:58,700 --> 01:35:59,410
Leave me alone, Pari.

1074
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:03,750
Is it? I left my entire family and
came with all my jewellery,

1075
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,950
why do you ask me to leave?

1076
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:08,620
-Jewellery?
-Come on, say. Say it!

1077
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:14,200
Come Rama, let’s elope and
start a new life.

1078
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:18,870
Present life itself is ruined and
will he have a new life again?

1079
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:23,250
His life will get ruined, if he is by your
side and keep taking dips in the pond.

1080
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:25,580
This crazy fool will get clever
only by eloping with him and

1081
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:26,910
show him the outside world.

1082
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:29,910
Outside world, Pari? I know no
other place than this village.

1083
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,540
Oh God, you don’t need to know.

1084
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:32,830
It’s enough that the bus driver
knows the way.

1085
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,580
You just show some courage
and let’s go now.

1086
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:37,200
Is courage any sweet curd rice
to prepare, for him to know?

1087
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:40,290
He didn’t have that from the childhood
and how will this fool get it now?

1088
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,160
Yup! As I’m here now!

1089
01:36:44,290 --> 01:36:45,120
Who is this fellow?

1090
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,870
Who are you idiot, came like
a clove in the sweet?

1091
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:52,000
I’m neither a clove in sweet or cardamom
in idly. I’m their childhood friend.

1092
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:55,330
-Rama, didn’t you recognise
my face? -Who is this idiot?

1093
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:58,450
Was that you, I broke the knee caps
while stealing coconut from the temple?

1094
01:36:58,620 --> 01:36:59,330
It’s him! Yes, him!

1095
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:03,000
Damn, I’m their childhood friend.
You too didn’t recognise me, Pari?

1096
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:06,040
Who? Srinivasa Sharma?

1097
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:07,910
Vishwanatha Sastry?

1098
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:11,540
-Satish!
-Satish, yes!

1099
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:12,830
-Satish?
-Yes!

1100
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:15,080
He looked so bad like a dark
tamarind seed, right?

1101
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:17,580
He looks the same bad now,
though he is gained some colour.

1102
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:20,290
It is wrong to hold a man and
do body shaming like this.

1103
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:23,660
Pari, do you remember us eating
peanut snacks sitting in the last bench

1104
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:25,450
while master was teaching at
the school.

1105
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:29,500
-Yes, he told it correctly.
-Every mischievous student does the same.

1106
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:33,870
Pari, I feel this idiot is cheating us.
He has no similarities to that Satish.

1107
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,500
Do you still doubt me, Pari?

1108
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:38,080
You remember, I complained about
him being coward in the childhood?

1109
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:42,250
Yes Satish!
You changed so much.

1110
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:44,620
Yes, but you haven’t changed at all.
You look the same beautiful. Staffed nose fellow!

1111
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:48,290
But Rama is still the same coward.

1112
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:51,160
You can’t still be like that, Rama.
You got to show courage, and jump Rama.

1113
01:37:51,370 --> 01:37:52,750
What to jump, when there’s
a pet on the other side?

1114
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:54,000
I’ve got nothing right at my
native place and will have to beg

1115
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:54,950
if I go to some other village.

1116
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:58,450
Yup! Friendship isn’t dirt,
but friendship means the humans.

1117
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:00,330
When I’m here,
will I let you beg Rama?

1118
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:02,000
Will you beg instead of them?

1119
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,950
My foot! I meant, I will get their
marriage done and get him a post as

1120
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:06,950
priest in a big temple.

1121
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:09,950
Who knows if he gets a priest job
or dump us suddenly.

1122
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:12,200
Agree, Rama!

1123
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:16,540
You can enter the temple, marry me
and also make me pregnant.

1124
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,540
Pari is fast at everything from
childhood.

1125
01:38:18,790 --> 01:38:21,040
-Her mom isn’t so.
-Her dad is so, right?

1126
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:24,160
-Hey Rama!
-Pari, what are those dirty deeds?

1127
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:25,750
-I’ll get you both married.
-Go on!

1128
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:26,910
-She is your responsibility now.
-Sure!

1129
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,040
-Hey Pari, move. Come here.
-Ask! Pull her.

1130
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,790
-Aren’t you ashamed of eloping
from home? -She is not.

1131
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,410
Didn’t I say not to be with
this idiot from childhood?

1132
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:35,290
You’ve been saying.

1133
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,120
Will you marry him and live by
cleaning the temple steps?

1134
01:38:37,330 --> 01:38:38,040
That will be the future.

1135
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,160
Look, his brother and father
were so very egoistic.

1136
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:42,580
Thus, God turned him
fit for nothing.

1137
01:38:42,790 --> 01:38:44,910
I’ll get you married to this
Bhattachari tomorrow morning

1138
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,580
and get you locked in his house.

1139
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:48,580
-Bless me, father in law.
-Move now!

1140
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:50,870
-Marriage won’t take place if
you are here. -Hey Rama!

1141
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:06,830
-Tell me, Pari.
-Tomorrow is my wedding.

1142
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:13,410
If you don’t come and take me
tonight, I’ll drink poison and die.

1143
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:20,370
You are to eat with me at our wedding,
but you will have to do my final rites then.

1144
01:39:24,910 --> 01:39:26,040
What will you do now?

1145
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:30,080
If there’s anyone who loves me
in this world, that’s just Pari.

1146
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:34,620
-I’ll do anything for her, uncle.
-That’s the power of love, Rama.

1147
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:37,120
Just tighten your dress and
jump into the arena.

1148
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:48,500
If I had shown the same courage
then, I’d have been in

1149
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:50,500
your father in law’s place now.

1150
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:53,910
Pari!
Pari!

1151
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:58,450
Call more silently, poor mosquitoes
might get disturbed.

1152
01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:02,450
-Pari!
*Damn! You must make a call, idiot.

1153
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,620
Fine, call.

1154
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:07,910
(Reciting a sloka)
Who is it?

1155
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,830
Uncle, I’m Pari’s friend Poori.

1156
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,540
-Are you Pari’s friend?
-Yes, uncle.

1157
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:17,500
You idiot, Rama is the only
friend of Pari.

1158
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:21,250
You should’ve called from
an STD booth.

1159
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:23,910
-Your number is displayed here,
you fool. -Oh no!

1160
01:40:25,620 --> 01:40:26,580
Call on the landline.

1161
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:33,700
Hello!
Hello, who is it?

1162
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:38,080
(Song playing)

1163
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:39,830
Who is it?
Please talk.

1164
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:42,120
Why don’t you answer when
she’s asking, Sarangi?

1165
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:44,910
Saranagi!
Who is that?

1166
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:48,580
Doesn’t she at least know there’s
a person named Sarangi?

1167
01:40:48,790 --> 01:40:51,620
Hey Sarangi idiot, is it you
giving me a blank call daily?

1168
01:40:52,450 --> 01:40:56,290
Are you flirting with aunties,
you donkey? Cut the call now.

1169
01:40:57,870 --> 01:41:01,200
Idiot, why are you doing these dirty
deeds now instead of doing in the youth?

1170
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:05,370
Love is in no way related to the age.
It is linked only with the mileage.

1171
01:41:05,790 --> 01:41:07,330
Such quotations are looked up
only in old age, like you.

1172
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:09,160
What have you done being in
young age?

1173
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:12,540
Let me know what should I do now.

1174
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:16,540
Uncle and aunty will be in the hall
and you go from back side.

1175
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:20,580
-Through kitchen!
-Ok! -Come!

1176
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:22,660
I too waited to see you
displaying this courage.

1177
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:25,120
Uncle, be careful!
We’ll go now.

1178
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:31,790
You called me uncle from childhood,
though we have no blood relation.

1179
01:41:32,580 --> 01:41:35,450
I feel sad now when you are
leaving, dear.

1180
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,500
Fine, get in.

1181
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:45,160
-Take care!
-Aren’t you coming?

1182
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,250
I’ll be here accompanying
my Mandaram.

1183
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:50,370
May you get incoming calls soon!

1184
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:51,910
-May that happen!
-Stop giving missed calls.

1185
01:41:52,830 --> 01:41:54,750
-Where are you taking us?
-We’re going to a safe place.

1186
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:56,290
To a close relative of yours!

1187
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:59,870
All my relatives left me as a kid.
Who is that relative I don’t know?

1188
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,410
Oh no, he says safe place right?
You be quiet.

1189
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:04,700
What are you waiting for?
Change the gear and drive.

1190
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:07,250
-That’s the matter.
-Bye Sarangi! Go on!

1191
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,540
Pari, where did he go?

1192
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,330
There is some powerful temple
in this village, it seems.

1193
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:47,330
He left to make arrangements
for our marriage there.

1194
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,160
He forgot even his phone in
that hurry.

1195
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:54,250
Pari, we came to this new village
believing in this idiot as you hurried us.

1196
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:58,660
-Think once if we’re doing the right
thing or not. -Rama!

1197
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:05,000
Why don’t answer the call though
I called you so many times, Boss?

1198
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:09,250
Police came to know that we cheated
that SLN bus owner and took ten lakhs.

1199
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:13,080
They are all searching for us.
We escaped. You go underground.

1200
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,910
Fine, boss! Be careful! See you.

1201
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:24,000
Who are you, idiot? You’re doing all
this to steal our jewellery, right?

1202
01:43:24,370 --> 01:43:27,700
Rama, I’m your friend Satish.
Tell him, Pari.

1203
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:32,120
Don’t lie. You know it is a grave
sin to cheat a pure Brahmin.

1204
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:34,250
You do such a brutal thing
for money?

1205
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:40,160
Yes! I agree that I once lived
just for money.

1206
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:44,160
But for the first time,
I’m doing this with humanity.

1207
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:46,500
You’ve cheated us and again
saying some cock and bull stories.

1208
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:47,910
I haven’t cheated you, Rama.

1209
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:49,910
I brought you to those related
to you.

1210
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:51,450
I have none in this world.

1211
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:52,910
But you are his world.

1212
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:54,750
Whom are you talking about?

1213
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:57,700
It is not about him, right?

1214
01:44:01,290 --> 01:44:02,250
Yes, it is about that Bhimaa...

1215
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:07,040
Who lost love from his childhood

1216
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,290
and who is treated as God by
hundreds of people!

1217
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:11,660
I brought you, as the work he
wanted to do is possible

1218
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:13,870
in this whole planet, just by you.

1219
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,160
Sir, the children you saved
are orphans.

1220
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:22,830
They have no any identity and
thus complaint wasn’t filed.

1221
01:44:24,330 --> 01:44:26,290
When we tracked this cell phone
you gave, we came to know

1222
01:44:26,500 --> 01:44:27,500
it belongs to Bhavani’s aide.

1223
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:29,830
He had called Tandav’s men.

1224
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:37,700
Tandav is the right hand man
of Bhavani.

1225
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:45,000
Any person crossing the tides to catch him
hasn’t returned with head over the body.

1226
01:44:46,370 --> 01:44:48,290
He is a demon in the human
form, sir.

1227
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:52,080
He transports anything ranging
from spices to girls.

1228
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:56,040
We didn’t get the permission for
a raid due to his political connections.

1229
01:44:56,830 --> 01:45:01,160
Tandava brought a few foreigners by
force and put them on Rudra’s boat.

1230
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:14,660
It seems, Rudra is coming to
the village in two days.

1231
01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:38,950
Hey Bhimaa, come out. You overacted
a lot all these days, as I wasn’t here.

1232
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:41,870
I’ve killed her husband.

1233
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,040
Come!

1234
01:45:59,790 --> 01:46:03,790
Manliness is not in defaming
a woman, but it lies in upholding her.

1235
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:12,250
God created the woman as a man
cannot tolerate delivery pains.

1236
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:15,750
Thus, we shouldn’t give them
any pain.

1237
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:22,250
If we give more suffering to the mother
earth bearing us, result is an earth quake.

1238
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:35,000
-Hey, push everybody in.
-Why, it is a waste of food.

1239
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,040
True!

1240
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:40,000
-Hey! -I understood, sir.
I’ll take everyone to hospital.

1241
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,290
-Mani!
-Sir!

1242
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:43,910
-Take Nandini home safely.
-Yes, sir!

1243
01:47:47,370 --> 01:47:50,620
Tell your wretched headman that
his son is safe with me.

1244
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:03,790
Why did you bring me here?

1245
01:48:16,870 --> 01:48:18,160
Oh no!

1246
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:29,250
-Oh no!
-Bhimaa, what happened?

1247
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:31,910
-My shirt is torn.
-Remove that shirt first.

1248
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,290
Hey, what are you saying?

1249
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:35,120
You shouldn’t be in a torn shirt.

1250
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:36,660
No problem if it is torn.
Leave it.

1251
01:48:36,870 --> 01:48:38,660
That is a bad omen, Bhimaa.

1252
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:41,500
-I don’t believe it. -I’m saying
it is bad omen. Remove that shirt.

1253
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:43,450
They’d think I’m a mad fellow,
if I remove my shirt and stand.

1254
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:46,830
-I don’t even have another shirt.
-I’ll bring something, wait. -Vidya!

1255
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:48,290
Huh, why is this so?

1256
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:51,120
This isn’t good.

1257
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:54,330
Yes, perfect!
Wear this.

1258
01:48:54,580 --> 01:48:57,200
-Fine, turn that side.
-Huh! Ok!

1259
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:23,330
What boss, you are into a good
romantic mood?

1260
01:49:24,370 --> 01:49:26,080
But, I’m still in tension.

1261
01:49:26,290 --> 01:49:28,870
Then, I’ll tell you a story to
change your mood.

1262
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:30,750
-Is it? -Yes!
-Tell me.

1263
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:36,040
-Sky is the boy, like me.
-Ok!

1264
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:38,950
The earth is a girl, like you.

1265
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:42,290
As the both were in pain for
never being able to meet,

1266
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:46,000
God couldn’t see that and
created that sea.

1267
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:52,040
Sky and the sea always are seen
together when we see from far.

1268
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:55,000
Thus, I brought you here.

1269
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:57,790
Sir is saying great romantic stories.

1270
01:49:58,290 --> 01:50:02,160
Not just saying, similar to how
that sky hugs around the earth,

1271
01:50:02,450 --> 01:50:04,660
I too will hug you tight forever.

1272
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:07,750
-Wow!
-I have a small wish. -What?

1273
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,120
-You must sleep on my chest.
-Ok!

1274
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:13,370
Then, you shouldn’t listen to
anything else other than

1275
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:15,410
my heartbeat and the sound
of this sea.

1276
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:22,040
Nothing other than this cool sea breeze
and my warm breathe should touch you.

1277
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:27,120
None other than those stars
should see us.

1278
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:34,870
-That guy is watching us.
-Who?

1279
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:38,580
Hey!

1280
01:50:38,790 --> 01:50:39,870
-Namaste Sir!
-Who are you, idiot?

1281
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:41,790
-Oh no, Bhimaa!
-Why are you scared?

1282
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:42,910
-Sir!
-Did you steal anything?

1283
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:46,040
No, sir.
Everyone is scared of Police, sir.

1284
01:50:48,910 --> 01:50:49,750
What is that?

1285
01:50:50,830 --> 01:50:52,620
-A plant, sir!
-Show it.

1286
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:56,290
Mother plant!

1287
01:50:58,370 --> 01:50:59,580
Mother plant?

1288
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,370
-Where are you taking it?
-To Mr Ravindra Varma!

1289
01:51:03,830 --> 01:51:05,910
-Oh, to the master?
-Yes!

1290
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:08,250
-Fine, go!
-This is a very rare plant.

1291
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:12,040
-Where did you get it?
-This plant is found only in this forest.

1292
01:51:12,410 --> 01:51:15,830
Thus, I traced the place where
insects named salabhas land on

1293
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:18,790
the no moon day and got these.

1294
01:51:19,290 --> 01:51:22,080
It is the time for master to
prepare medicine. I’ll go.

1295
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:24,750
-Did master ask you to come at
this time? -Yes, madam.

1296
01:51:27,330 --> 01:51:28,410
Fine! Come Vidya!

1297
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,660
Master doesn't meet anybody
after Sunset, right?

1298
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:32,500
Come!

1299
01:51:34,290 --> 01:51:36,870
-Wait, I’ll just be back.
-Fine, I too will come.

1300
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:40,000
No, you stay back.
Rudra is here, right? I’ll just be back.

1301
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:41,620
Listen to me.
Where are you going?

1302
01:51:41,870 --> 01:51:43,040
Wait, I’ll just be back.

1303
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:44,830
-Fine, come back fast.
-Ok!

1304
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:05,370
Does this temple have an entry
even from the back side?

1305
01:53:25,660 --> 01:53:29,040
Does this work?
Will she come back to life?

1306
01:53:29,410 --> 01:53:32,910
If you’d have known about me, you
wouldn’t have asked this question.

1307
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:35,160
Ayurveda is that great?

1308
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:39,540
Ayurveda is great of course.
But Ravindra Varma is greater.

1309
01:53:41,830 --> 01:53:45,160
If you do chemical changes to
the mother plant,

1310
01:53:45,330 --> 01:53:47,080
the base to all medicinal plants…

1311
01:53:47,370 --> 01:53:50,580
A medicine with the qualities of
Sanjivini mentioned in Charaka Samhita,

1312
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:53,830
which can cure even the death,
can be prepared.

1313
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:59,330
This is the great medicine, which only
this Ravindra Varma can prepare.

1314
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:02,620
-But, why children?
-Children have the tender bodies.

1315
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:07,790
They are less adulterated, possess
high immunity and are pure in form.

1316
01:54:08,410 --> 01:54:10,700
Thus, the outcome will be great.

1317
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:12,500
Go on!

1318
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:49,410
Hey!

1319
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:26,620
Brother!

1320
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:34,620
Brother!

1321
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:01,790
-Come on, lift guys!
-Lift!

1322
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:39,910
Bhimaa!

1323
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:08,450
Hey, if you take even one step ahead,
she’ll face a horrible death.

1324
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:15,250
If I pierce half inch in, her blood
gets frozen and

1325
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:17,830
the tiny nerves will be splattered.

1326
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:23,910
Then not the water,
but blood rolls out from the eyes.

1327
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:30,410
Unable to bear that pain, she herself
would request me to kill her.

1328
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:36,700
No power in this world can
save her.

1329
01:58:36,910 --> 01:58:38,250
Do you know the value of
a life, idiot?

1330
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:44,540
As I know the value of life, I’m inventing
a great medicine that gives life.

1331
01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:47,620
You are not giving life.
You are killing the innocent people.

1332
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:52,910
Will the great elephant stop walking,
as ants die coming under its feet?

1333
01:58:53,450 --> 01:58:58,250
Many weak lives as these are lost
while I’m advancing towards my goal.

1334
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,200
Let them be gone.

1335
01:59:00,410 --> 01:59:02,750
You are not any great elephant.
You are a fool with arrogance.

1336
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:07,120
This is not foolishness.
It is my knowledge.

1337
01:59:07,910 --> 01:59:11,040
I’ll prepare Sanjivini and
win over death.

1338
01:59:11,410 --> 01:59:14,790
I’ll bring this world to my feet.

1339
01:59:15,830 --> 01:59:19,120
This Ravindra Varma is
the future God.

1340
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:21,910
God doesn’t kill demons like this
for selfish reasons.

1341
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:25,580
No God can give life to the dead.

1342
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:29,790
I’m a greater wizard than that God.

1343
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,620
Mad idiot, what a wizard are you?

1344
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,290
You are a mental patient.

1345
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:37,080
Yes rascal, we are the patients.

1346
01:59:37,290 --> 01:59:40,450
You know what our medicine is?
Money!

1347
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:49,370
As I can get eternity along with
money, I put in so many efforts.

1348
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:54,040
Will you come and stop at
a time when I could get Billions?

1349
01:59:54,330 --> 01:59:58,330
I know you’ll kill them,
if I take a step ahead.

1350
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:04,450
You too know I’d kill you, if I
take another step ahead after that.

1351
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:09,790
Leave Vidya and the kids.
I’ll take one step back.

1352
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:12,200
-Not enough!
-What do you need?

1353
02:00:14,160 --> 02:00:17,410
Your life!

1354
02:00:19,910 --> 02:00:24,330
If my life is useful to save these,
take it.

1355
02:00:28,580 --> 02:00:29,790
No Bhimaa!

1356
02:00:43,410 --> 02:00:44,450
Brother!

1357
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:57,910
Bhimaa!

1358
02:01:04,660 --> 02:01:06,330
No!

1359
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:26,330
No brother!

1360
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:36,620
Bhimaa!

1361
02:01:40,830 --> 02:01:42,500
Hey Ravindra Varma!

1362
02:01:43,620 --> 02:01:45,580
If one more life is gone…

1363
02:01:46,450 --> 02:01:49,660
Or if one more drop of blood
from Vidya falls on the ground…

1364
02:01:50,370 --> 02:01:55,250
You rascal, I’ll come back again.

1365
02:02:01,290 --> 02:02:02,410
Beat me, idiot!

1366
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:07,040
Brother!

1367
02:02:37,750 --> 02:02:39,660
Brother!

1368
02:02:55,660 --> 02:03:00,200
This body should be found.
How?

1369
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:05,200
Both are dead in an accident.
Create it.

1370
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:11,700
I have a small wish.

1371
02:03:11,910 --> 02:03:13,950
You must sleep on my chest.

1372
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:17,790
Then, you shouldn’t listen to
anything else other than

1373
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,580
my heartbeat and the sound
of this sea.

1374
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:25,410
Nothing other than this cool sea breeze
and my warm breathe should touch you.

1375
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,250
None other than those stars
should see us.

1376
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:38,290
Hey, an accident!

1377
02:03:39,910 --> 02:03:41,790
None would know if we throw
these bodies into that

1378
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,250
burning bus and our job is done.

1379
02:03:45,290 --> 02:03:46,450
Ok!

1380
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:54,790
SLN bus coming to Anantapur
from Mangalore met with

1381
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,410
a dreadful accident at
Anantapur ghat road.

1382
02:03:57,620 --> 02:04:00,500
Number 14, an orphan body!

1383
02:04:09,950 --> 02:04:11,200
Is Bhimaa dead?

1384
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:15,700
Ramaa!

1385
02:04:17,370 --> 02:04:19,370
Bhimaa is dead.

1386
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:22,870
I came to know about
your brother's greatness that day.

1387
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,870
I asked his sprit to possess my body

1388
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:43,790
to take revenge, in order to
fulfill his goal. But…

1389
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:49,830
if I have to possess on any body,
he must be a person of my own family.

1390
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:53,580
A guy born along with me is required.
Even though my body is ruined...

1391
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,790
my blood is still flowing
in another guy.

1392
02:04:56,450 --> 02:05:00,750
My replica is still alive to take
my revenge.

1393
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:03,370
It is Ramaa my younger brother.

1394
02:05:07,620 --> 02:05:09,620
Before my 10th day ritual is done,
Rama must remove the holy

1395
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:12,950
rudraksh necklace from his neck
with his own hands

1396
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:16,910
in the powerful Shiva temple
at Mahendragiri.

1397
02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:22,040
He should wholeheartedly
welcome my soul into his body.

1398
02:05:22,330 --> 02:05:25,290
You have to make him do that.

1399
02:05:33,330 --> 02:05:33,790
Hey!

1400
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,200
-No!
-Hey!

1401
02:05:56,290 --> 02:05:57,660
No, don't hit!

1402
02:05:58,330 --> 02:05:59,950
Is he still alive?

1403
02:06:03,370 --> 02:06:04,410
Rama!

1404
02:06:05,410 --> 02:06:06,620
No, don’t hit.

1405
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:08,330
Rama!

1406
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:33,580
This is not him.

1407
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:37,120
Yes! He is not Bhimaa,
but his brother Rama.

1408
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:43,580
How many days more will it
take to prepare Sanjivini?

1409
02:06:43,790 --> 02:06:49,080
You fool, poison arrived first even
when sea was churned for elixir.

1410
02:06:49,950 --> 02:06:53,870
It takes time for us to get
the elixir we need.

1411
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:59,080
Hey, first kill these two and
throw them in sea.

1412
02:07:00,450 --> 02:07:01,410
Why?

1413
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:08,330
We did experiments on kids so far.
Let’s now do on these both.

1414
02:07:10,250 --> 02:07:12,830
Throw all of them after that,
in the sea.

1415
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:20,200
No!

1416
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:26,790
I’m not asking to call in a fear
of losing life.

1417
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:33,290
I’m asking with a wish to
save lives.

1418
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:36,290
Just for once…

1419
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:42,370
Remove that rudraksh necklace
for once and call Bhimaa.

1420
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:47,660
He’d be somewhere around here
waiting for your call.

1421
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:53,830
Your brother’s blood seeped
into this same ground.

1422
02:07:58,830 --> 02:08:00,580
One thing is true, Rama.

1423
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:07,540
What they are doing is brutality
by killing those children.

1424
02:08:09,910 --> 02:08:15,370
But being silent even when there’s
a chance to save, is a sin.

1425
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:19,000
It is a sin, which even your blood
can’t cleanse.

1426
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:24,250
-Brother!
-Look there.

1427
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,790
Brother!

1428
02:08:29,290 --> 02:08:36,500
That kid is calling you as brother.
Not as Rama, but as Bhimaa.

1429
02:08:37,830 --> 02:08:40,410
You say Bhima is a monster, right?

1430
02:08:41,450 --> 02:08:45,410
When it is the killing time,
even God kills like a monster.

1431
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:53,910
It is a monster if killed for ego
and a God when killed for virtue.

1432
02:08:54,950 --> 02:08:56,450
You decide it now.

1433
02:08:57,450 --> 02:09:03,910
Is the hatred you grew on Bhimaa is great
or the confidence those kids grew is great.

1434
02:09:05,540 --> 02:09:09,160
Bhimaa, that relation brings
you anger.

1435
02:09:09,370 --> 02:09:10,370
Get lost!

1436
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:13,870
You hate even to listen to
that name.

1437
02:09:13,950 --> 02:09:15,250
Bhimaa!

1438
02:09:16,790 --> 02:09:19,040
But now, that name is
the shield for us.

1439
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,450
That name is the weapon
punishing these.

1440
02:09:27,370 --> 02:09:28,290
Bhimaa!

1441
02:09:29,290 --> 02:09:30,120
Bhimaa!

1442
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:31,620
Bhimaa!

1443
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:39,790
-Hey Rama, call me once as brother.
-Get lost!

1444
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:43,790
The one who was born In bruguvamsa

1445
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:46,790
Born in Sravana nakshatra (star)!

1446
02:09:47,620 --> 02:09:49,160
Born in Vasishta kula gotra!

1447
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,870
Son of Sankara Bhagavathula!

1448
02:09:52,700 --> 02:09:54,950
I, named Ramachandra!

1449
02:09:57,250 --> 02:09:59,160
Whole heartedly!

1450
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:02,290
Am calling with love!

1451
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:04,540
My brother Bhimaa!

1452
02:10:06,250 --> 02:10:07,250
Come!

1453
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,450
Greed, unsatisfied even after
having the Kingdom!

1454
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:26,950
Ego overtaking the virtue!

1455
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,410
Every time these show up!

1456
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:35,410
The roaring axe comes to life.

1457
02:11:36,500 --> 02:11:40,620
I got a good because of
your cruelty.

1458
02:11:41,250 --> 02:11:46,410
For the first time my brother
Rama called me as brother.

1459
02:11:46,790 --> 02:11:50,450
Yeah, my heart is full of joy.

1460
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:57,830
I’ll present you with a celebration
for this happiness you presented me.

1461
02:11:58,790 --> 02:12:00,540
I’ll present you the celebration
of death.

1462
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:49,500
This is an eightfold capture.

1463
02:14:03,290 --> 02:14:07,500
I killed so many innocent kids…

1464
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,410
Don’t I know how many spirits would
be waiting to take a revenge on me?

1465
02:14:14,620 --> 02:14:15,790
Come!

1466
02:14:22,660 --> 02:14:27,290
Demons, spirits or the ghosts
can’t cross this protection shield.

1467
02:14:28,410 --> 02:14:32,040
I’m the God to be in future.

1468
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:39,410
It is not possible for you to
face me.

1469
02:14:49,410 --> 02:14:51,160
Whenever and wherever
the virtue…

1470
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,790
is offended, hey son of Bharatha!

1471
02:14:54,910 --> 02:14:56,830
And the injustice rises high!

1472
02:14:58,370 --> 02:15:00,330
My arrival is affirmative.

1473
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:03,580
Will the God arrive?

1474
02:15:04,750 --> 02:15:06,660
What ages are you in?

1475
02:15:07,700 --> 02:15:10,580
Will he come like Lord Vishnu
who arrived in Gajendra Moksha?

1476
02:15:12,790 --> 02:15:15,750
Will he come like Lord Narasimha
coming out by breaking the pillar

1477
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:17,910
when Prahlada called?

1478
02:15:19,910 --> 02:15:23,160
Will he come like Lord Shiva,
who came for Markandeya?

1479
02:15:24,290 --> 02:15:28,000
Call for him, let’s see how
he comes. Call for him.

1480
02:15:31,290 --> 02:15:35,870
That Ravanasura who tried lifting
Lord Shiva along with Kailasa!

1481
02:15:38,410 --> 02:15:41,540
was easily captured by
Kartaveeryarjuna in his finger snap!

1482
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:49,410
Parasurama who chopped such great
Kartaveeryarjuna into pieces, will arrive.

1483
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:20,160
Sanjivini was found to Anjaneya
for the good of this world.

1484
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,040
But will never come into the habds
of a mean guy like you.

1485
02:18:23,950 --> 02:18:26,750
You can just find your death in
my hands.

1486
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:33,410
You were proud saying to be future God
and to bring the world to your feet.

1487
02:18:34,910 --> 02:18:39,870
I’ll split open your nerves and show
you the hell before you die.

1488
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:21,660
Though born from the same womb,
we both never took the same path.

1489
02:19:22,410 --> 02:19:25,040
I misunderstood your love
because of my ignorance.

1490
02:19:26,250 --> 02:19:27,500
Please, forgive me.

1491
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:31,620
I wish to relive the moments
we missed from the childhood.

1492
02:19:33,950 --> 02:19:37,540
Oh no! Oh no!
No!

1493
02:19:38,290 --> 02:19:40,790
