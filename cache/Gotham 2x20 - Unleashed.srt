1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,430
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,619
I'll find my way out.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,250
'Cause this place is just one big puzzle,

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,800
and puzzles are my forte.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,790
Oh, my.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,379
I don't know who you are anymore.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,900
Oh, please, that is such
a ridiculous clichÃ©...

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,300
It's time for me to look
out for number one.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,159
The man who contracted Matches
Malone to kill your parents

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,599
called himself The Philosopher.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,159
Hugo Strange. The Philosopher.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,029
I was one of the ones who forced
Thomas Wayne to shut down the program,

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,109
You're lying.

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,440
I needed to be sure you
were behind all this,

15
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,590
and now I am.

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,139
Our creations need new personas

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,690
to give their minds focus.

18
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,979
That sword was made yesterday.

19
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,620
Our replica is central
to his acceptance of his new identity.

20
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,339
I... am Azrael!

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,470
My Lord Dumas.

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,180
Command me.

23
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,649
A murderer walks the streets
of this city a free man.

24
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,819
By your blade, he must be destroyed.

25
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,790
Tell me his name.

26
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,300
James Gordon.

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,200
That-that is not possible.

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,580
You.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,820
You're dead.

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,970
Not anymore.

31
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,149
Five-O, Five-O, come on, come on!

32
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,789
What is the meaning of this?

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,819
You are upsetting the inmates.

34
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,899
Where's your boss, darling?

35
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,450
We got a warrant

36
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:29,539
to search his office and everything in it.

37
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,539
He's busy with patients.

38
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,530
That's quite all right, Ms. Peabody.

39
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,270
We're gonna tear this
place apart, Strange.

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,690
We're gonna get answers.

41
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,269
Answers to what?

42
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,479
Records indicate Theo Galavan's dead
body was brought here,

43
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,999
that it was cremated.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,199
Seems likely.

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,789
Then why the hell
was he at the GCPD last night,

46
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,959
running our captain
through with a sword, huh?

47
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,269
I'm as surprised as you are.

48
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,109
And while you're at it,
explain to me this:

49
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,230
why Victor Fries, also last seen here,

50
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,630
very dead, is alive and kicking
and dressed like a spaceman.

51
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,550
You stink, Strange.

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,230
This whole damned place stinks.

53
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,630
Excuse me.

54
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,959
Is this your office?

55
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,450
Yes, but, Detective, please...

56
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,750
What the...?

57
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,069
Shredded?

58
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,430
Son of a...

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,330
Spring cleaning.

60
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,930
You're free to look around.

61
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,920
I'm just not sure
there's much more to see.

62
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,849
You think shredding a few documents
is gonna save you?

63
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,960
It won't.

64
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,410
We're on to you.

65
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,370
Bad guys come in and monsters come out.

66
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,210
Just like Pinewood, right?

67
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,149
Seeing as how you no longer
work for the police department,

68
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,650
I'm not required to speak with you,

69
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,730
Mr. Gordon.

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,540
You have a lot of anger, James Gordon.

71
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,020
I can help you with that.

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,309
We're gonna tear this damn building apart,

73
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,579
every square inch!

74
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,969
Check your warrant, Detective.

75
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,839
It clearly states that you have permission

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,710
to search my office, nothing more.

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,769
Of course, I'm more
than happy to accommodate you

78
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,889
if you come back with a different warrant.

79
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,979
Just know that I will also
be calling the judge

80
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,000
and telling him how disruptive
it is to have the GCPD...

81
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,259
and others...

82
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,769
traipsing about this place of healing

83
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,510
and disrupting the patients unnecessarily.

84
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,180
This ain't over yet.

85
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,280
Has Azrael returned?

86
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,190
Nope.

87
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,240
Troubling.

88
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,580
What are you doing out of your cell?

89
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,590
Big mistake.

90
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:04,119
Sorry, my bad.

91
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,270
Just got lost.

92
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,680
Escort me back, would you?

93
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,910
Thank you.

94
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,180
Thank you, have a nice day.

95
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,120
I've got to get out of here.

96
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,670
Damn kids.

97
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,350
Did you break the lock?!

98
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,160
Hey, you!

99
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,389
This is God's house, a place of worship,

100
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,690
not a homeless shelter.

101
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,650
Get out before I call the cops.

102
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,470
I need a weapon to fulfill my holy quest.

103
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,170
I don't have any weapons.

104
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,870
then what good are you?

105
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,359
Captain Nathaniel Barnes remains

106
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,500
in critical condition at Gotham General

107
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,549
after suffering a violent attack

108
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,390
by a masked assailant late last night.

109
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,249
So far no arrests have been made,

110
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,599
but reports coming
from within the locked down

111
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,919
GCPD have confirmed
that the masked man is, in fact,

112
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,650
former Gotham mayor Theo Galavan.

113
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,159
Search parties continued
throughout the night,

114
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,100
but, as of yet,

115
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,700
Galavan's whereabouts remain a mystery.

116
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,060
There's nowhere to hide, Galavan.

117
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,090
I'm coming for you.

118
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,759
Alvarez, any sign of him yet?

119
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,339
No, but we've got six choppers in the air

120
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,209
and every sniffer dog
in the state out there looking.

121
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,030
Call the brass upstate,

122
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:15,340
tell them to get more men down here.

123
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,210
That freak couldn't have gotten far.

124
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,719
Tom, get Judge Bam Bam on the phone.

125
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,499
Tell him I need a new
warrant to search Arkham,

126
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,680
every friggin' room, all of it!

127
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,610
What are they all doing?

128
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,020
They don't have a captain, Harvey.

129
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,900
Guess you're it.

130
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,800
I ain't no captain.

131
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,239
Say something to them.

132
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,310
I don't work here anymore, you do.

133
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,730
All right, everyone, listen up.

134
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,410
I know we're all a bit
freaked out right now.

135
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,580
It's understandable, hmm?

136
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,059
Some nutjob in a Halloween
costume and cape

137
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,740
comes into our house and takes
out four of our brothers?!

138
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,170
He does this to our captain?!

139
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,450
Now, I've been around a long time.

140
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,729
It's like the bad guys in this town

141
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,540
just keep getting weirder and weirder,

142
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,330
but under that mask...

143
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,920
is just a man,

144
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,840
and he can bleed,

145
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,370
just like you and me,

146
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,280
and if he bleeds, he can be beaten.

147
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,499
So, let's do what the cap

148
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
would tell us to do if he were here.

149
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,670
Let's go out there

150
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,759
and let's find that son of a bitch

151
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,490
and let's get him, whatever it takes!

152
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,599
I'm not one for speeches.

153
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,470
No, no, no, you did fine.

154
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,370
But?

155
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,529
If that was Galavan that I saw,

156
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,299
he'll know how to stay out of sight.

157
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,110
We got to think outside the box.

158
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,200
Like what?

159
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,320
Who knows him best
who's still in the city?

160
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,720
His sister.

161
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,550
Alfred, pull over.

162
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,460
Master Bruce, are you
out of your tiny, bloody mind?

163
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,679
There's a madman loose on the streets.

164
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,430
Now is not the time to go running
around on your own, is it?

165
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,140
I don't plan on being on my own.

166
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,129
With all due respect, sir,

167
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,409
what good will a 15-year-old
little girl do

168
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,960
even if Galavan does turn up?

169
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,580
Strange lied to the police.

170
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,329
I know it, a-and so do you.

171
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,759
I can't stay at home and do nothing.

172
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,919
We need to trust Jim Gordon.

173
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,970
I'm tired of trusting
Jim Gordon, aren't you?

174
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,520
I am your guardian, Master Bruce,

175
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,019
and it is my job to protect you.

176
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,910
Is it your job to watch me sit
on my hands and do nothing?

177
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,720
Alfred, please.

178
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,050
Let me go.

179
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,680
Hey, buddy, move your car!

180
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,390
Just... just be careful, all right?

181
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,020
I will.

182
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,550
Hey, let's go!

183
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,750
Yeah, all right, mate, keep...

184
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,430
just keep your bloody hair on!

185
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,219
Don't go, baby, come on,
let's talk about this, huh?

186
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,789
Is this because I-I kicked Barbara out?

187
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,370
Just let me go, Butch.

188
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,709
Come on, I'll do whatever you want.

189
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,909
I-I-I'll eat more fruit.
I-I'll work on the snoring,

190
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,830
I swear to God, whatever you need...

191
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,500
Catch you guys at a bad time?

192
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,679
Seriously, how do people
keep getting in here?!

193
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,139
Do I have no security at all?!

194
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,390
Why the rush?

195
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,359
Just time to move on.

196
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,320
Oh, yeah, is that it?

197
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:32,880
Or are you worried
Galavan's coming after you, too?

198
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,350
Don't worry, Butch.

199
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,860
It's not about you.

200
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,410
She's just scared of her brother.

201
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,420
Come on, help me find him.

202
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,590
You two hardly left on the best of terms.

203
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,239
Must have been weird,
seeing your dead brother

204
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,260
show up dressed like a ninja
from Medieval Times.

205
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,060
That thing that stabbed
your captain last night...

206
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,820
wasn't my brother.

207
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,010
It was a 300-year-old
assassin called Azrael.

208
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,410
Azrael?

209
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,110
That image I saw on the news,

210
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,980
his clothes, the way he moved...

211
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,330
it was Azrael.

212
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,929
A mythical figure worshipped by the monks

213
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,330
who raised my brother.

214
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,429
A cold-hearted killing
machine sent into the night

215
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,240
to kill his master's enemies...

216
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,500
and he wants you.

217
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,860
An ancient assassin?

218
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,470
A legend.

219
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,160
My family used to tell stories of him.

220
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,860
He was real?

221
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,140
Who knows.

222
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,709
It was 300 years ago.

223
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,090
Probably, yes.

224
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,940
So, your brother's gone nuts?

225
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,060
You tell me.

226
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,709
Theo convince you
that he was Azrael last night,

227
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,090
or was he acting?

228
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,460
Someone got inside my brother's head.

229
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,890
It's not a safe place to be.

230
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,009
If you're right, I want
to find this person,

231
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,800
but first I have to find your brother...

232
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,010
so help me.

233
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,600
If a search team finds him,
they're gonna kill him.

234
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,050
He is still your brother, after all.

235
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,950
He's blood.

236
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,190
The sword that was used last
night, the one that broke...

237
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,970
it was fake.

238
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:16,320
And you know this how?

239
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,299
The real one belonged to my grandfather.

240
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,780
He was an antiquities collector,
obsessed with Dumas history.

241
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,340
I saw it once; it was beautiful.

242
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,810
Forged by the monks themselves.

243
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,250
It's said to hold supernatural powers.

244
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,050
Theo knew this.

245
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,030
It's possible he'll attempt
to steal it back.

246
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,790
Does your grandfather still have it?

247
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,990
And where is he?

248
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,540
Gotham Cemetery.

249
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,030
He's been dead for 20 years...

250
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,750
but he was buried with his treasures.

251
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,180
Selina?

252
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,850
'Sup?

253
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,920
I remember you telling me

254
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:17,610
you're still feeding your friend's birds.

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,230
Someone has to.

256
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,210
Why you here?

257
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,160
Have you seen the news?

258
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:25,030
Walking zombies in Gotham?

259
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
What's new?

260
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,810
Strange worked for my father
on a project designed to help people.

261
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,649
He perverted it and now I believe
he's found a way to...

262
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,950
Bring back the dead?

263
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,239
A little far-fetched, don't you think?

264
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,269
Perhaps, but he's hiding something.

265
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,000
The police failed to find out what.

266
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,100
I think I can do better.

267
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,780
That so?

268
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,260
When my father shut
down Strange, he was killed.

269
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,329
Selina, I just want the truth, that's all.

270
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,280
You just won't be happy until you
get yourself killed, will you?

271
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,149
Victor Fries and Theo
Galavan both went to Arkham

272
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,219
as dead men. Both returned.

273
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,210
I don't care.

274
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,890
So did your friend Bridget.

275
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,240
Wait, they sent her to Arkham?

276
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,560
She may still be there right now.

277
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,020
Alive.

278
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,760
I told her to leave town,

279
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,880
to run, but she didn't listen.

280
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,650
It's my fault she's there.

281
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,120
Selina, we can put this right.

282
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,800
Strange was ready for the police.

283
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,369
He may even have been tipped off.

284
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,220
The only way we're gonna find
out what's really going on in there...

285
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,110
is if we break in ourselves.

286
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,590
Break in?

287
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,040
To Arkham?

288
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,010
A highly guarded place
that's packed with crazy people?

289
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,720
If it's too dangerous
for you, I'll just go myself.

290
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,580
I didn't say that.

291
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,809
Prisons are meant to stop people
from breaking out, not in.

292
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,810
It can be done.

293
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,050
It's a loony bin, not a prison.

294
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,930
I know it can be done.

295
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,290
But I go alone.

296
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,820
Why?

297
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,450
If I get caught, they'll just toss me out.

298
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,230
Nobody cares about me.

299
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,870
But you?

300
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,009
They see you coming and they'll shut
that whole thing down

301
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,820
quicker than you can say "Rat."

302
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,340
And then you'll never find
out what they've been up to.

303
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,930
That or...

304
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,430
they'll just kill you.

305
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,430
Besides...

306
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,190
I already know a way in.

307
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,050
This is it.

308
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,960
The Dumas crypt.

309
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Dozens of my relatives are buried here.

310
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,120
So does someone have a key?

311
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,030
All right. Key, crowbar.

312
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,580
This one.

313
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,240
My grandfather's.

314
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,260
Wait, wait, wait.

315
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:39,500
I'm sure we're breaking more
than a few laws right now.

316
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,670
Really? This is where you draw the line?

317
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,930
Come on.

318
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,909
This doesn't creep you
out, even a little bit?

319
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,460
It's friggin' grave robbing!

320
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,250
Whatever it takes, Harvey.

321
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,480
Little help?

322
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,660
That was said to be
Azrael's sword up until the end.

323
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,440
He died?

324
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,030
No, he disappeared.

325
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,540
Azrael's thought to be immortal.

326
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,540
It's beautiful.

327
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,370
I will take that.

328
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,630
James Gordon.

329
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,380
Time...

330
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,660
to...

331
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,310
die!

332
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,049
Step aside. He must die.

333
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,220
It's me, brother.

334
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,680
Don't you recognize me?

335
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,719
My quarrel is not with you.

336
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,200
Step aside.

337
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,790
Tabitha.

338
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,030
Your sister.

339
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,200
I have what you're looking for.

340
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,300
Tabitha?

341
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,460
That's right.

342
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,880
You remember where we grew up?

343
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,460
The estate by the sea?

344
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,690
Before the monks took you.

345
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,090
Our dogs, the horses?

346
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,670
We were happy once.

347
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,230
You are Theo Galavan.

348
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,890
My brother.

349
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,430
Theo?

350
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,350
Yes.

351
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,050
Theo Galavan, the new mayor...!

352
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,520
Do you remember now?

353
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,809
Death to the Son of Gotham.

354
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,640
Death to the Son of Gotham.

355
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,160
Bruce Wayne.

356
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,200
We were sent to kill him.

357
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,329
Yes, yes, but...

358
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,450
He dishonored our family name.

359
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,080
Yes.

360
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,230
Death to the Son of Gotham.

361
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,400
Thank you for reminding me.

362
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,290
Traitor.

363
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,000
Harvey?

364
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:20,200
He's gone!

365
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,200
This is Bullock.

366
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,829
I need a backup down at the cemetery.

367
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,800
Galavan's in the wind again.

368
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,450
Okay.

369
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,620
I'm sorry.

370
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,929
I made him remember.

371
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,090
Remember what?

372
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,210
Bruce.

373
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,950
"Death to the Son of Gotham."

374
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,530
Stay with her.

375
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:47,890
I need to find Bruce.

376
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,490
Slow down!

377
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,930
I need this car.

378
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:20,410
- You ain't a cop anymore, Gordon.
- I need the damn car!

379
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,650
Come on, come on.

380
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,009
Master Bruce?

381
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,960
No, it's me. Where's Bruce?

382
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,340
I don't know. He was in the city.

383
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,379
Where in the city?

384
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,479
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I haven't got the foggiest.

385
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,439
He's got a mind of his own at the moment,
that one, doesn't he?

386
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,019
All right, well, we need to find him.

387
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,010
Galavan could be coming after him.

388
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,849
Well, you're having a laugh, ain't you?
I thought he was after you.

389
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,979
He was. Tabitha must
have jogged his memory.

390
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,090
Reminded him of his original mission:

391
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,800
kill Bruce Wayne.

392
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,019
Right. Well, I'll-I'll get the motor.

393
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,409
No, no, no. You stay there

394
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,910
in case he comes back.

395
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,899
Where was the last place
you saw him in the city?

396
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,579
Uh, Collins and Delaney.

397
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,189
Last I saw of him,
he was headed for the roof

398
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,019
to see that Selina, I reckon.

399
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,670
All right, I'll head over there.

400
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,180
Till then, be safe.

401
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,960
Righto.

402
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,670
Will do.

403
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,160
Oh, for Pete's sake, Master Bruce.

404
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,619
Creeping up on someone like that,
I could have filleted you.

405
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,490
Sorry.

406
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,020
What's wrong?

407
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:32,590
Galavan, Master Bruce.

408
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,400
Theo bloody Galavan is what's wrong.

409
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,380
Okay. Okay.

410
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,600
Holy cow!

411
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,590
Forensic guy?

412
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,839
- Street trash girl?
- You framed Gordon.

413
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,664
And you tried to get
a reward by turning him in.

414
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:02,544
Oh, yeah.

415
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,919
What the hell are you doing here?

416
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,470
What the hell are you doing here?

417
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,320
I got to get out of here.
This place is crazy.

418
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,929
They're probably looking for me.
Which way is out of here?

419
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,480
I'll help you if you help me.

420
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,650
Where's Strange right now?

421
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,299
Okay, look, I barely know you,

422
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,729
but that is the last person
that you want to be looking for.

423
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,780
Why is that?

424
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:29,960
The basement here,

425
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,960
it's horrible.

426
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,950
Just trust me, stay away.

427
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,410
- He's a very dangerous man.
- Basement?

428
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,200
Alive people, dead people,

429
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,589
dead-alive people... it's horrible.

430
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,819
- Okay, how do I get there?
- Wow, it's like I'm saying things,

431
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,839
and you're just not hearing them.

432
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,670
He has a friend of mine,
and I'm here to get her out.

433
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:53,680
Now, how... do... I get... there?

434
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,700
You'll tell me the way out?

435
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,600
Yes.

436
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,870
Okay.

437
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,820
There's an elevator.

438
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,510
I'll tell you where it is, but...

439
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,780
can you pick a lock?

440
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,260
Why'd you have to be brave, huh?

441
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,590
I just got used to you being around.

442
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,420
Partners, right?

443
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,150
How am I supposed to keep
people in line now, huh?

444
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,100
I don't think I can do this without you.

445
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,290
You're one of the only people in the world

446
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,590
who looks me in the eye
when they talk to me.

447
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,010
You know that?

448
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,240
You laugh at my jokes.

449
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,320
You actually like the way I look.

450
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,410
I didn't think I'd ever
feel like this again.

451
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,370
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

452
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,930
Well, don't stop now.
I was just getting misty.

453
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,830
What are you doin' here?

454
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,560
Paying my respects.

455
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,050
She's looked better, I must say.

456
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,820
You will not hurt her.

457
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,400
Why would I do that?

458
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,820
I know.

459
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:52,550
Because she stabbed my mother in the back!

460
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,960
If you touch her, I will kill you.

461
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,660
I like this new side of you.

462
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,570
Soft, sentimental.

463
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,080
He has to pay, Butch.

464
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,770
Who?

465
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:12,950
Azrael?

466
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,370
No! Galavan!

467
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,399
See, I will not buy this
whole uber-villain nonsense.

468
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,239
I mean, if he wanted to wear leather,

469
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,409
he should just wear leather.

470
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,080
This is Gotham City. No one cares, right?

471
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,170
We have all suffered by his hand.

472
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,090
Me,

473
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,250
you,

474
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,020
my mother.

475
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,150
And now his own sister.

476
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,230
Galavan must die.

477
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,940
And when he does,

478
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,940
you'll leave us alone?

479
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,120
I suppose.

480
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,950
Promise.

481
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,140
Geez.

482
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,729
Fine. Yes.

483
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,870
Whatever.

484
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,630
Where is he?!

485
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,900
Yeah.

486
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,900
He's here,

487
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:14,980
and he's safe.

488
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,640
Thank God.

489
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,790
I'm coming.

490
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,890
You're more to me than just
a guardian, Alfred.

491
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,010
You're my friend.

492
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,530
Your timing really is quite...

493
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,370
impeccable, Master Bruce.

494
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,930
But we haven't got time for...

495
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,399
sentimental nonsense right now.

496
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,899
We have to make sure
that all the doors are locked,

497
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,669
all the windows are closed,
and the lights are off

498
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,829
to make it as hard as possible
for Galavan to find us,

499
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,909
do you get me?

500
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,680
Detective Gordon's sure he's coming here?

501
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,660
Nothing's certain, is it?

502
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,950
So we need to be ready.

503
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,190
Okay.

504
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,250
It's a big house. We should split up.

505
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,380
Fine.

506
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,570
But just you be quick.

507
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,890
So, you take the upstairs.

508
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,619
I will take the downstairs.

509
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,259
You make sure the windows are closed.

510
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,629
You make sure the doors are locked.

511
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,650
You make sure the skylights are closed.

512
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,529
And then you meet me down here
as quick as you can in the study,

513
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,780
all right? Now go.

514
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,140
Alfred! Alfred!

515
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,950
Ingenious.

516
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,730
You,

517
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,510
you will show me to the boy.

518
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,670
Over my dead body.

519
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,620
As you wish.

520
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,830
What's that noise?

521
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,850
Hey, Ed. What's that noise?

522
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,740
Nygma!

523
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,410
Son of a...

524
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,430
Nygma.

525
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,260
Sound the alarm.

526
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,700
We got a runner!

527
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,700
Go!

528
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,640
Come on, come on, come on.

529
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,260
Okay, great.

530
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,750
Okay.

531
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,610
Alfred! Alfred...

532
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,110
Alfred!

533
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,640
Take one more step, mate,

534
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,160
and I will put a bullet right
between your bloody eyes.

535
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,190
You think that'll stop me, manservant?

536
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,759
I'd like to give it a go,
if you don't mind.

537
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,039
Think I'm flesh and blood? I am immortal

538
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,470
and I have grown tired of you!

539
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,760
Alfred!

540
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,520
Run, Bruce!

541
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,120
Immortal? Let's see, shall we?

542
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,080
Alfred!

543
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,510
Come on, come on.

544
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,870
Give us a minute, please.

545
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,470
I think we can safely say
Azrael has gone rogue.

546
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,599
I'm not comfortable making
that assumption just yet.

547
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,670
But it's been more than 24
hours since he's made contact.

548
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,809
Perhaps that's because Jim
Gordon still breathes.

549
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,509
But if the police catch him
first, how do we explain...

550
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,870
Something that cannot be explained?

551
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,140
We don't.

552
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,389
Theo Galavan is no more.

553
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,489
Azrael is his new creation.

554
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,719
A killer, a madman.

555
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,069
The GCPD will fail
if they try to capture him.

556
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:28,730
They'll have to kill him first.
And when they do,

557
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:31,439
they'll be successfully
covering our tracks for us.

558
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,859
In the meantime, this facility
needs to be shut down.

559
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,639
All subjects moved to the new location.

560
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,990
Already happening.

561
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,160
That's my girl.

562
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:38,740
Damn it.

563
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,480
Don't hide, little boy.

564
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,730
Face me.

565
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,130
Face... death.

566
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,059
You know the Waynes were
a blight upon this city?

567
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,390
A selfish,

568
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,420
arrogant family.

569
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,360
A family with no beliefs.

570
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,310
No honor.

571
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,680
No respect.

572
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,070
You're your father's only son, Bruce.

573
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,980
When I kill you,

574
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,500
I eradicate the Wayne name...

575
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,840
forever.

576
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,610
It will be as though you
had never existed.

577
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:37,070
Enough fun and games.

578
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,790
Prepare to die.

579
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,390
Unexpected.

580
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,540
You okay?

581
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,030
Sorry I couldn't get here sooner.

582
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,669
Seems like I missed all the fun.

583
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,790
Where have you been?

584
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,800
I slowed him down for you, didn't I?

585
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,210
I'll call Bullock.

586
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,870
Time I taught you
how to drive, Master Bruce.

587
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,270
You should know by now

588
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:43,630
that bullets don't kill this monster, Jim.

589
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,059
My last one got stuck in your throat,

590
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,020
so I'm thinking about shoving
this one somewhere else.

591
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,100
Jim, a little tip for next time:

592
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,980
always bring the right tools for the job.

593
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,710
See you in hell, Theo.

594
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,600
You're welcome.

595
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,690
Let's go, Butch.

596
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,260
Good night, fellas.

597
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,770
Oh, my God...

598
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,050
That little sprite was right.

599
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,780
Freeze.

600
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:15,550
Remain where you are.

601
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,340
Oh, dear.

602
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,750
Are you my human subject?

603
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,700
What?

604
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,850
Were you sent here to test me?

605
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,690
Bridget?

606
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,980
Who's Bridget?

607
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,039
It's me, Selina.

608
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,780
What?

609
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:18,889
You burnt yourself when the cops
tried to bust you, remember?

610
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,370
I don't remember anything before this.

611
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,300
Professor Strange told me I had amnesia.

612
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,720
No, don't trust him.

613
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,740
Your name's Bridget.

614
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,569
He told me he'd send people to test me.

615
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,540
Well, I'm not here to test you.
I'm here to take you home.

616
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,769
That's what he said you'd say.

617
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,869
Bridget, no, Bridget, no,

618
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,760
Bridget, no, Bridget, no, Bridget, no!

619
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,179
Bridget, no.

620
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,640
Don't call me that.

621
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,070
My name's...

622
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,930
Firefly.
