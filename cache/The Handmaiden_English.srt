1
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:18,952
You little brats, beat it!

2
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:25,877
Hey...!

3
00:01:59,764 --> 00:02:01,953
It should have been me!

4
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:11,714
You'll miss the train

5
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:13,883
Hurry

6
00:02:21,828 --> 00:02:26,688
PART ONE

7
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:48,542
'Kouzuki Noriaki

8
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,260
Go back to sleep

9
00:02:58,323 --> 00:03:00,428
We're still far from the house

10
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:34,300
Pleased to meet you
I am Okju.

11
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:38,700
A Western-style wing
by an English architect

12
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:45,638
Not even in Japan is there
a building combining two styles

13
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:52,144
It reflects lVlaster's
admiration for Japan and England

14
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:54,858
Next is the annex

15
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:57,692
which lVlaster
had furnished as a library

16
00:03:57,758 --> 00:03:59,446
Last, the ser\/ants' quarters

17
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:01,988
As the Lady's handmaiden
you won't sleep there.

18
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:04,784
You may eat her leftover food

19
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:07,780
but tea leaves go
to the kitchen girls

20
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:09,747
Used soap
is for the steward

21
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:14,918
l'm sure you wouldn't dare
Tamako.

22
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:40,484
Among the richest men,
lVlaster is the greatest book lover

23
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:43,489
And among book lovers
he is the richest.

24
00:04:43,556 --> 00:04:46,657
His ties to the colonial government
even let us use electricity.

25
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:47,954
ln such a home

26
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:52,873
you know what's expected
of a maid like you?

27
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:58,463
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts

28
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:24,782
I sleep in here?

29
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,617
lVliss Hideko wakes easily
on account of her ner\/es.

30
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:31,538
She's behind this door?

31
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,243
IVlother!

32
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:15,124
IVlother!

33
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:18,253
IVlother!

34
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,588
lVliss!

35
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:22,923
lVliss, are you alright?

36
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:25,259
Junko! ls that you?

37
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:29,635
Junko was kicked out, lVliss
l'm the new girl.

38
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:32,265
Seems you had a bad dream

39
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:35,769
You see that big cherry tree?

40
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:40,271
I\/ly aunt went mad
and hanged herself there

41
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,651
Sometimes on moonless nights

42
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:45,529
my aunt's ghost

43
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:49,282
dangles from that branch

44
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:03,630
Here, drink up

45
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:12,678
When babies cry, my auntie
feeds them a spoonful of sake

46
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:21,356
Sweet bird, sweet bird

47
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:41,582
You think l'm Tamako,
a poor Korean handmaiden

48
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:44,962
But my rea/ name 's
Nam Sookee.

49
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:55,556
I was able at age 5 to tel/
a rea/ coin from a fake.

50
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:58,724
Then /earned to forge stamps
from Gugai,

51
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:02,562
and studied pickpocketing
from Kutan,

52
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:06,566
but these babies will never
/earn such useful skills.

53
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,612
Abandoned as newborns

54
00:08:09,678 --> 00:08:13,115
we 'll wash and feed them,
then sell them to Japan.

55
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:15,118
Such meaningful work

56
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:19,745
Instead of starving, they grow up
gentlemen and ladies.

57
00:08:20,523 --> 00:08:25,626
Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid
I wou/dn 't be so miser/y.

58
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:31,910
I wish my breasts gave milk
I 'd breastfeed all of them.

59
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:15,135
l'll tell you the story
of an interpreter,

60
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:21,224
who bribed his way into
translating for high officials

61
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,560
After helping Japan annex Korea
he got rights to a gold mine.

62
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:29,733
Now he wants to turn
fully Japanese.

63
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:32,571
So he gets naturalized

64
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:36,906
marries the daughter
of a fallen Japanese noble

65
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:41,244
and adopts his wife's
family name Kouzuki.

66
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,584
BaH.Bas

67
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:51,420
Bastard builds a mansion,
fills it with books and antiques

68
00:09:53,198 --> 00:09:56,967
He invites Japanese collectors
to his library,

69
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:04,309
He loves books and paintings
like his own flesh,

70
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,229
but he can't help
parting with a few

71
00:10:06,294 --> 00:10:09,897
What to do, when he must sell
but can't bear to?

72
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:11,944
He sells a fake

73
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:20,157
He seeks out a specialist
to create intricate forgeries

74
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:22,328
Unlike him this specialist

75
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:25,205
is a real Japanese
of noble birth!

76
00:10:26,897 --> 00:10:30,211
Count Fujiwara from Nagoya

77
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:34,800
So, who is this?

78
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:42,931
You'll seduce her
- ls she pretty?

79
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:45,975
The Jap wife died ages ago
with no children.

80
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:51,220
But the dead wife's
dead sister's living daughter

81
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:53,818
But is she pretty?

82
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:57,112
An orphan.
Her father was rich

83
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,115
Soon she'll fall in love with me
and we'll elope to Japan.

84
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:03,161
After marrying her there

85
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:07,497
and inheriting her fortune
l'll declare her insane

86
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:09,708
and lock her up in a madhouse

87
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:10,544
Right!

88
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:26,644
Love?

89
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,770
What does a crook
know about love?

90
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:38,320
What of her fortune?
She's rich?

91
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:42,782
Each night in bed I think
of her assets.

92
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:46,328
1.5 million in cash
300,000 in bonds.

93
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:52,626
The uncle is just a guardian
lt's Hideko's fortune.

94
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:56,587
That's why Kouzuki
schemes to marry the girl

95
00:11:57,445 --> 00:11:59,301
To his w...wife's niece?

96
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:00,677
What a s...sick f...f

97
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,429
Right, a sick fuck

98
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,474
So what's our share?

99
00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:09,811
l'll share 50,000

100
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,978
Sookee gets the
dresses and jewellery

101
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:14,732
l'll do it! Take me!

102
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:18,276
I\/ly Japanese is better,
and I worked as a maid!

103
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:33,460
On top of the fifty

104
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:39,548
I get dresses, jewellery
and my own 100,000.

105
00:12:39,946 --> 00:12:41,551
She must be crazy

106
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:44,721
Crazy? Not a bit.

107
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:48,223
I 'll take my fortune
and flee this country.

108
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,519
Endure these country yoke/s
a bit longer.

109
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:12,499
Those fuckers

110
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:16,253
This is Tamako

111
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:19,337
I am at your service
lVliss...

112
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,426
Bloody hell

113
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:27,262
He should 've told me
she was so pretty.

114
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:29,891
I 'm completely flummoxed

115
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:32,435
A reference letter

116
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:35,520
from Lady lVlinami
my last mistress.

117
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:40,567
Here's the letter
Pay attention.

118
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,947
Dear lVliss Izumi Hideko

119
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:53,747
A maid is like
a pair of chopsticks

120
00:13:53,814 --> 00:13:58,542
Her presence is little noted, but
her absence causes much distress

121
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:06,636
The sun scarcely ever shines here

122
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,972
Uncle won't permit it

123
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:14,934
One could never grow fond
of such a dreary place.

124
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:22,443
Not a good liar, are you?

125
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:25,447
l'll take my leave

126
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,462
I\lly head aches before
every reading practice.

127
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:46,800
Would you read it to me?

128
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,305
Pardon?

129
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:04,276
Lady lVlinami said such
nice things about me!

130
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:05,403
Is that so?

131
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,575
You're a Japanese lady,
why don't you speak Japanese?

132
00:15:15,353 --> 00:15:18,413
The books he makes me read
are all Japanese.

133
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:21,503
So read that for me

134
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:35,767
Dear lVliss Izumi Hideko

135
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:40,603
Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid

136
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:43,483
lVlaids are like

137
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:45,527
a spoon... no

138
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:48,612
are like chopsticks

139
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,621
Is it a spoon?

140
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:06,839
I don't know how to read, lVliss

141
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:12,385
Not at all?
What about Korean?

142
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,788
This is your name
Can't you read it?

143
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,255
Reading can be learned

144
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,299
and I don't care if you
curse or steal.

145
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:56,846
But don't ever lie to me
Understood?

146
00:16:57,202 --> 00:16:58,308
Yes, lVliss

147
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:05,441
IVly mum

148
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:10,486
She's beautiful,
quite the charmer!

149
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,237
And me?
Am I "quite the charmer?

150
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:18,451
Everyone says I can't
compare to my mother

151
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:24,917
Count Fujiwara said

152
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:27,961
So you've met the Count?

153
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:34,551
I\lly aunt!
I heard it from my aunt

154
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:36,679
She was his nanny

155
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:39,472
What did the Count
say about me?

156
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:43,603
He said your face

157
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:48,773
Every night in bed he thinks
of your assets... your face.

158
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,336
I've nowhere to go

159
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:12,379
I've just stayed in this house
since coming to Korea at age 5

160
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,302
But in new shoes, even
well-trodden paths feel fresh

161
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:20,389
The ones from here

162
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,350
up to here
should fit you

163
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:31,817
Time for reading practice

164
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:33,695
l'll go alone

165
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:34,905
lVliss?

166
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:36,720
But rain is falling

167
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:56,508
At noon, come knock
on the door. Promise?

168
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:01,389
See you at

169
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:04,392
See you later

170
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:57,610
Why would the lady
of such a big house... ?

171
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:08,121
Did the big house
make her go mad?

172
00:20:46,932 --> 00:20:48,829
I\lly new handmaiden

173
00:20:49,768 --> 00:20:50,831
The snake, the snake!

174
00:20:57,944 --> 00:20:59,924
You mustn't pass that point

175
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:01,843
Be warned!

176
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:05,427
The snake marks the
bounds of knowledge'

177
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:14,939
A snake!

178
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:20,778
The Count?

179
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:22,780
Today?

180
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,827
That's why you insisted
on a bath.

181
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:31,662
I\lly aunt, when she heard
a guest was coming,

182
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:34,624
dropped eveiything and
bathed her Baby lVliss.

183
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:39,878
Nothing made her happier than when
guests praised her baby's scent.

184
00:21:40,903 --> 00:21:44,510
You are my Baby lVliss

185
00:21:45,743 --> 00:21:48,513
Auntie gave the babies
candy during baths.

186
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:51,349
To teach them that
bath time is sweet.

187
00:21:51,413 --> 00:21:53,144
What's wrong?

188
00:21:54,418 --> 00:21:57,980
One of my teeth is sharp
It keeps cutting me.

189
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:45,613
So this was the scent.

190
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,398
Welcome, sir!

191
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:16,340
You are too kind to greet me
this way upon my arrival,

192
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:19,372
when the journey has
left me so unkempt.

193
00:24:19,436 --> 00:24:21,124
Now your tedium is over

194
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,503
l'll ensure your painting
lessons are stimulating.

195
00:24:28,612 --> 00:24:29,925
This must be Okju

196
00:24:29,988 --> 00:24:32,719
At your ser\/ice, milord

197
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,514
You know if you fail, it'll put
me in an awkward position?

198
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:43,438
A decent bone structure
for a Korean...

199
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:48,191
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

200
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:05,458
Count Fujiwara asks lVliss Hideko
to kindly allow her maid Tamako

201
00:25:05,525 --> 00:25:08,587
to be sent to his Lordship
for a brief errand.

202
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:19,307
Did you call for me, milord?

203
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:20,435
You may enter

204
00:25:54,575 --> 00:25:57,636
How you'll be an even
greater thief than your mum

205
00:25:57,911 --> 00:26:00,390
Who believes the talk
of a swindler?

206
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:04,935
When I give the signal
"fully ripe",

207
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,106
Then l'll gobble her up
to the pit.

208
00:26:09,174 --> 00:26:13,443
She's so naive,
even if a man pulls on her nipples

209
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:14,905
she won't know what he wants

210
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:18,116
So it's yourjob to tell her

211
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:21,328
that everything
is because of me

212
00:26:21,852 --> 00:26:24,622
"Oh my,
since the Count arrived

213
00:26:24,688 --> 00:26:27,624
your toenails
are growing much faster!

214
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,920
That sort of thing, all right?

215
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:32,256
Here, a gift

216
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:47,104
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

217
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:51,440
That'// be mine when
she goes to the madhouse

218
00:26:52,215 --> 00:26:55,653
It pains my heart
to see this poor girl

219
00:26:55,718 --> 00:26:58,697
Have you ever seen
sapphires so blue?

220
00:27:01,264 --> 00:27:04,330
Let's take a look

221
00:27:05,812 --> 00:27:09,667
This isn't a sapphire
it's blue spinel.

222
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,380
lt's all right, lVliss.
Spinels are expensive too

223
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:22,805
Oh, my Auntie... I mean
Lady lVlinami taught me

224
00:27:23,494 --> 00:27:25,170
But it's fine!

225
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,269
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart

226
00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:30,941
Is that so?

227
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:51,167
has anything been this pretty?

228
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:55,838
I 'd like to show her to
the people at home.

229
00:28:00,657 --> 00:28:02,305
Probably this?

230
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:06,434
lVlesmerising!

231
00:28:06,497 --> 00:28:10,562
S...Spellbindingly beautiful!

232
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:18,904
He 's shameless

233
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:24,368
B...b...beautiful!

234
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:27,495
I...I...I'm flummoxed
in your presence!

235
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:32,624
If you stutter like that
and make your face go red

236
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,960
those uppity bitches
will feel superior,

237
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:40,509
You try it

238
00:28:43,867 --> 00:28:46,682
One, two, three!

239
00:28:48,915 --> 00:28:52,978
The Count kept pushing
wine on me.

240
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:05,322
lt's suffocating.
How do ladies wear such things?

241
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:11,499
lVliss, you're killing me!

242
00:29:14,816 --> 00:29:17,669
Dressed up,
you look like a lady, too

243
00:29:22,447 --> 00:29:24,178
I think I know

244
00:29:25,617 --> 00:29:27,681
what the Count meant

245
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:31,144
Your face

246
00:29:32,457 --> 00:29:34,355
Each night in bed

247
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,566
I think of your face

248
00:29:40,924 --> 00:29:42,655
Don't be silly, lVliss

249
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:53,581
Ladies truly are
the dolls of maids

250
00:29:54,147 --> 00:29:58,669
All these buttons
are for my amusement.

251
00:29:59,486 --> 00:30:02,256
lfl undo the buttons
and pull out the cords

252
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:06,845
then, the sweet things within

253
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:10,432
those sweet and soft things

254
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:17,200
lf/ were stil/ a pickpocket
l'd slip my hand inside...

255
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:53,932
lVliss, are you truly
going to marry your uncle?

256
00:30:57,586 --> 00:31:01,939
That's what he raised me for,
knowing he'd need my fortune

257
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:04,818
There's a famous collector
in France.

258
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:08,322
He’ll be putting his entire
library up for auction.

259
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:11,450
The gold mine's proceeds
won't cover the cost.

260
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:17,622
If it were me, l'd sell books
to buy gold, not the opposite

261
00:31:51,762 --> 00:31:52,993
For now,

262
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,870
the Lady needn 't go read
to the sick fuck

263
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:58,206
who wants to marry
his wife 's niece.

264
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:04,919
Instead the fake Count goes to
the Library to make fake books.

265
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:12,136
The Lady waits for her
2 o'c/ock art class,

266
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,680
and waits

267
00:32:15,953 --> 00:32:18,143
Poor girl,

268
00:32:18,206 --> 00:32:21,104
losing her heart to a fake

269
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:57,224
Please, Count!

270
00:33:49,297 --> 00:33:50,694
Sorry to be late

271
00:33:51,465 --> 00:33:52,571
lt's no matter

272
00:34:00,852 --> 00:34:05,122
lVlaybe I need more practice
to give it dimensionality?

273
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:07,710
Dimensionality... perhaps

274
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:11,713
Nonetheless, you have a vision
that transcends mere skill.

275
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,676
As if you see directly
into an object's essence

276
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:23,809
I hesitate to stand before you

277
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,478
for fear that you might
read my thoughts.

278
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:36,656
That's enough for today

279
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:45,665
Almost fully ripe

280
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:46,792
A/ready?

281
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,465
Damn

282
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:57,720
Do you know what?

283
00:34:57,785 --> 00:35:01,387
Since the Count arrived,
your cheeks have grown flushed

284
00:35:01,452 --> 00:35:02,558
Have they?

285
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:17,946
When I was a baby, at a
big house, she was hanged

286
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,663
Well, pretty much

287
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:36,590
Still, while alive
she hugged you a lot?

288
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:44,932
I\lly mother died
giving birth to me

289
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:52,940
So it's as if
I strangled her myself

290
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:57,654
I wish l'd never been born

291
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:04,743
No baby is ever guilty
of being born.

292
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:07,620
If your mother thought you
could understand

293
00:36:07,685 --> 00:36:10,249
this is what she'd have said

294
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:15,295
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying

295
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,424
That she had no regrets

296
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:30,978
Your mother stole
a thousand times,

297
00:36:36,881 --> 00:36:38,279
Did she cry?

298
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,951
She laughed

299
00:36:44,891 --> 00:36:48,161
Said she was lucky
to have you before dying

300
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:50,957
That she had no regrets

301
00:36:57,235 --> 00:36:59,465
Wait here a moment, lVliss

302
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:01,551
l'll go pick mushrooms

303
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,679
We'll have mushroom stew
tonight, you like that.

304
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:08,558
l'll go with you

305
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,895
l'll be quick

306
00:37:11,665 --> 00:37:13,230
Before it rains

307
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:23,490
Good girl

308
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,747
What a coincidence

309
00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:31,916
Indeed

310
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:34,418
IVlay I sit by you?

311
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,155
The lady sits, shy and trembling

312
00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:06,991
The gentleman is persistent.

313
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,660
The perceptive maid
has stepped out for a moment.

314
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:14,666
All is well, Sookee

315
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:18,835
Everyone's performing
their roles so damned wel/

316
00:38:20,568 --> 00:38:21,674
Fucking hell

317
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,530
You know S€I"\/HDTS
can't use this entrance!

318
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,606
Hey!

319
00:38:42,882 --> 00:38:45,572
I wish I 'd never come here

320
00:38:48,346 --> 00:38:50,452
It was wrong to come

321
00:38:52,101 --> 00:38:55,205
Tamako, you brought
watercolours, right?

322
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:57,667
Of course, milord!

323
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:59,251
Watercolour paints and brushes

324
00:38:59,315 --> 00:39:01,421
Go and get the oils

325
00:39:01,485 --> 00:39:05,591
A day like this demands oils, yes!

326
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:52,263
A blackout!
Bring a lantern

327
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:53,974
Yes, ma 'am

328
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,941
I need to think

329
00:40:03,629 --> 00:40:05,818
I need to become rich

330
00:40:05,884 --> 00:40:10,488
sail off to a distant harbouh
eat food I scarcely recognise

331
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:13,575
buy my HI/ of
glittering baub/es, and

332
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,787
not think of Hideko

333
00:40:16,893 --> 00:40:18,999
Never think of Hideko

334
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:49,236
I returned and you didn't
even come to me?

335
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,369
You know how hard it is
to do those readings?

336
00:40:58,186 --> 00:41:01,580
IVlust I remove makeup and
change clothes all by myself?

337
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:05,430
I feel a nightmare coming
Sleep here.

338
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:32,447
He proposed to me

339
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:37,369
Next full moon

340
00:41:38,393 --> 00:41:43,205
when my uncle visits his mine
he wants to elope to Japan.

341
00:41:45,398 --> 00:41:47,462
What did you say?

342
00:41:50,152 --> 00:41:51,925
I said I wasn't sure

343
00:41:53,655 --> 00:41:55,220
l'm scared

344
00:41:55,825 --> 00:41:57,847
Of your uncle's anger?

345
00:41:59,536 --> 00:42:01,601
Of the Count

346
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:06,271
What's to be scared of?
He's so kind.

347
00:42:08,546 --> 00:42:11,444
I don't know, Ijust feel it

348
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,782
Like the reflex of pulling
your hand from a flame.

349
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:23,289
Tell me

350
00:42:36,573 --> 00:42:37,638
Pardon?

351
00:42:38,912 --> 00:42:42,807
I mean after getting married
at night...

352
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:49,189
How would I know?
l'm practically a child

353
00:42:49,254 --> 00:42:53,319
With no mother
No one hereto..

354
00:42:59,262 --> 00:43:00,327
Firs

355
00:43:02,516 --> 00:43:04,330
I guess we'd kiss?

356
00:43:06,603 --> 00:43:08,460
What the hell

357
00:43:08,524 --> 00:43:10,834
I 'll show her one thing then
put her to bed.

358
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:14,215
Poor thing

359
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:21,940
alone in a strange country,
reading those useless books

360
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,433
without /earning
a single useful skill

361
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:44,452
Why does the candy
taste different?

362
00:43:45,643 --> 00:43:48,833
The bitter turned souh

363
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:52,420
the sour turned sweet,

364
00:43:52,483 --> 00:43:55,923
the sweet turned savoury.

365
00:43:55,987 --> 00:43:58,500
How do you know all this?

366
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,530
You must have experience?

367
00:44:03,286 --> 00:44:06,580
I\lly friend Kutan taught me

368
00:44:06,956 --> 00:44:09,610
Taught you?
In words?

369
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,689
Yes, only in words

370
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:33,169
So this is how it feels

371
00:44:33,233 --> 00:44:35,879
That's what you will
feel for the Count.

372
00:44:38,612 --> 00:44:40,468
The Count, truly

373
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:46,931
He won't think
he's making love to a corpse?

374
00:44:48,248 --> 00:44:51,186
You know about my
cold hands and feet.

375
00:44:51,249 --> 00:44:52,355
Really?

376
00:44:53,209 --> 00:44:54,316
Here

377
00:45:02,845 --> 00:45:04,576
Feels just fine

378
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,286
You like it?

379
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,423
l'm sure he'll want
to do this too.

380
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:21,259
And then

381
00:45:28,286 --> 00:45:30,184
lt's so cute

382
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,939
If the Count sees this

383
00:45:44,929 --> 00:45:47,992
Will he really be
so tender as this?

384
00:45:48,807 --> 00:45:50,163
Of course

385
00:45:50,226 --> 00:45:53,165
And he'll touch you like this

386
00:45:53,228 --> 00:45:55,293
And like this

387
00:45:58,235 --> 00:46:01,173
Keep doing it
like the Count would

388
00:46:03,614 --> 00:46:06,679
And this is what he'll say

389
00:46:09,411 --> 00:46:12,477
lt's so soft, warm

390
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:16,481
wet, and

391
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:21,485
s...s...spellbindingly beautiful!

392
00:46:41,443 --> 00:46:43,717
Okju

393
00:46:45,196 --> 00:46:48,263
Hideko

394
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,685
Mummy.

395
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,647
Daddy.

396
00:46:59,212 --> 00:47:01,901
Now, the model must stay still

397
00:47:02,672 --> 00:47:06,239
Okju

398
00:47:10,347 --> 00:47:13,245
Hideko
- Wait.

399
00:47:16,188 --> 00:47:20,840
_ _ .doesn 't like it,
you damned scoundre/I

400
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:22,797
Stop it!

401
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:24,900
I can't do this

402
00:47:28,198 --> 00:47:29,762
Come here, Tamako

403
00:47:33,537 --> 00:47:35,142
Find some otherjob to do

404
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:36,936
You catch my meaning?

405
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,489
I've no otherjob to do

406
00:47:48,553 --> 00:47:51,950
Myjob is to
look after the Lady

407
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:06,422
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

408
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:08,425
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

409
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,719
If I miss this fortnight
l'm finished!

410
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,140
Can you feel it?
How much I want it?

411
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:22,396
you think l'll let you
fuck it up, you bitch?

412
00:48:22,756 --> 00:48:27,860
Shall I tell the Lady you're
nothing but a lowly pickpocket?

413
00:48:27,926 --> 00:48:31,614
Fine, l'll have something
to tell her too.

414
00:48:31,682 --> 00:48:35,949
That you’re nothing but the son of
a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman

415
00:48:39,689 --> 00:48:43,458
Boksun raising babies with her
bad back, and those two halfvvits

416
00:48:43,526 --> 00:48:46,128
How will they feel if
you go home empty-handed?

417
00:48:46,195 --> 00:48:48,470
Want to shit
on your mother's legend?

418
00:48:48,112 --> 00:48:50,425
You should go home in glory

419
00:48:55,453 --> 00:48:59,184
So don't push Hideko too hard

420
00:48:59,249 --> 00:49:00,519
She's got no one
on this earth.

421
00:49:00,585 --> 00:49:04,313
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam

422
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,278
And please

423
00:49:09,844 --> 00:49:15,407
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tinyjoke of a cock.

424
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,711
Oh my

425
00:49:25,444 --> 00:49:28,670
Your toenails have grown faster since
the Count arrived.

426
00:49:28,735 --> 00:49:30,675
How curious

427
00:49:31,615 --> 00:49:35,636
Miss, doesn't it bother you
not to know?

428
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,850
How many ships sail
on the wide sea...

429
00:49:40,415 --> 00:49:42,936
People leaving,
people returning

430
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:45,939
those saying farewell
or welcome back.

431
00:49:48,547 --> 00:49:50,151
The hill beyond the manor?

432
00:49:55,931 --> 00:50:00,360
I could be content here
if you were with me.

433
00:50:01,435 --> 00:50:03,457
You're fortunate, Miss

434
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:07,667
The man who loves you
has the power to protect you

435
00:50:07,732 --> 00:50:09,756
That's rare

436
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:14,426
But l'm not sure
if I love him.

437
00:50:15,907 --> 00:50:17,513
You do love him

438
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:22,352
How do you know?

439
00:50:27,211 --> 00:50:29,441
Turn in your sleep and sigh

440
00:50:33,593 --> 00:50:35,698
Even if I say I don't love him

441
00:50:36,513 --> 00:50:39,576
if I say that
I love someone else

442
00:50:45,856 --> 00:50:48,627
Do you still want me
to marry him?

443
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:54,175
You will love him

444
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:10,609
Miss!

445
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:18,491
In the end,

446
00:51:18,556 --> 00:51:22,992
Hideko accepted the proposal,
provided that I come to Japan too

447
00:51:25,811 --> 00:51:27,667
nodded his head

448
00:51:29,108 --> 00:51:31,210
On the day her Uncle left
to visit his mine,

449
00:51:31,277 --> 00:51:35,797
the Count pretended to go back
to Japan, and hid nearby.

450
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:51,856
You'll have a week of freedom

451
00:51:52,297 --> 00:51:57,280
but always remember
the basement.

452
00:52:42,887 --> 00:52:44,577
Miss!

453
00:53:29,228 --> 00:53:35,793
Thank you for travelling
on our ferry today.

454
00:53:48,746 --> 00:53:50,309
Finally we're going home

455
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:52,144
lt's been three years

456
00:54:44,133 --> 00:54:46,282
To not steal

457
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:48,284
To not steal

458
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:50,285
To not commit adultery

459
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:52,787
To not commit adultery

460
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:55,208
To not lie

461
00:54:55,478 --> 00:54:57,710
To not lie

462
00:55:47,198 --> 00:55:52,304
Spider thread pulled
into strings

463
00:55:52,578 --> 00:55:57,101
Strumming makes
a zither sing

464
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,564
Thousand woes

465
00:56:07,677 --> 00:56:14,285
Under the blue sky
Only the crows cry

466
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:43,316
Excuse me

467
00:56:43,878 --> 00:56:44,984
Sorry

468
00:56:50,221 --> 00:56:55,449
The Count paid the innkeeper to spy
on us, afraid we might run off

469
00:56:55,726 --> 00:56:58,787
Why get dressed?
I've nothing to do any\/vay

470
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,876
Things are moving too slowly.

471
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,211
I fear Hideko might
truly go mad.

472
00:57:07,236 --> 00:57:09,465
Shall we play 'maid
like before?

473
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:17,550
From morning to night
we see no sign of the Count.

474
00:57:17,123 --> 00:57:21,170
Certifying the marriage and
converting the inheritance to cash

475
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:58,305
You plucked the flower
now re-plant it.

476
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:00,434
What do you want?

477
00:58:00,498 --> 00:58:04,395
Hurry up and throw her
into the madhouse!

478
00:58:11,507 --> 00:58:13,572
A week here

479
00:58:15,511 --> 00:58:17,750
Then Hnally.

480
00:59:01,641 --> 00:59:03,206
This way

481
00:59:14,487 --> 00:59:16,217
Who is that person?

482
00:59:18,492 --> 00:59:20,430
The Countess Lady Fujiwara

483
00:59:20,495 --> 00:59:23,558
Her maiden name was
Izumi Hideko.

484
00:59:24,831 --> 00:59:26,394
And who might you be?

485
00:59:26,834 --> 00:59:28,397
I am the Lady's handmaiden

486
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:32,609
Then, what kind of treatment

487
00:59:32,673 --> 00:59:35,402
do you believe
your Lady requires?

488
00:59:53,362 --> 00:59:59,342
where no one can harm her,
and where she can do no harm

489
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:06,349
Just a few tests, then let's have
lamb chops at the Peace Hotel.

490
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:22,784
Almost there
Good work.

491
01:00:24,808 --> 01:00:26,789
Don't be frightened

492
01:01:01,845 --> 01:01:04,760
Good day, Countess

493
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,703
Do you remember me?

494
01:01:09,977 --> 01:01:11,250
Countess?

495
01:01:20,446 --> 01:01:21,552
What is this?

496
01:01:21,907 --> 01:01:25,960
We mean you no harm, Countess

497
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,306
We're going to look after you

498
01:01:28,457 --> 01:01:32,477
You've got the wrong person
She is the Countess.

499
01:01:32,918 --> 01:01:35,274
Tell them, Your Lordship!

500
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:40,610
She still believes
she's a Korean handmaiden

501
01:01:41,886 --> 01:01:45,532
lt's because
her nanny was Korean

502
01:01:49,477 --> 01:01:51,623
Let go of me,
you filthy bitches!

503
01:01:51,689 --> 01:01:55,165
We do not use such language here
your Ladyship.

504
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,170
Miss!

505
01:02:06,284 --> 01:02:08,641
If it's any help

506
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:13,602
this is from her mammy,
and she used to cherish it

507
01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:24,300
Such a considerate maid

508
01:02:33,396 --> 01:02:37,124
I tel/ you, right from
the start Miss Izumi Hideko

509
01:02:39,734 --> 01:02:42,132
had always been

510
01:02:42,444 --> 01:02:43,551
Miss!

511
01:02:54,959 --> 01:02:57,647
l'm not a rotten bitch!
No! No!

512
01:03:04,968 --> 01:03:07,198
Put it in your mouth, Hideko

513
01:03:10,265 --> 01:03:12,162
Hold out your hand

514
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:37,686
Next time you feel
like talking back,

515
01:03:38,127 --> 01:03:41,691
remember the taste
of this metal bead.

516
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:50,866
You'll sleep alone from tonight

517
01:04:00,856 --> 01:04:01,628
All right?

518
01:04:01,691 --> 01:04:03,254
Please give me a light

519
01:04:03,693 --> 01:04:06,924
We've been ordered to save oil

520
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:09,136
You little brat

521
01:04:09,198 --> 01:04:10,929
Speak Japanese!

522
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:16,933
In there is a man
the size of an ogre

523
01:04:17,542 --> 01:04:21,771
who can't stand the sound
of girls screaming.

524
01:04:26,882 --> 01:04:28,781
And then?

525
01:04:31,722 --> 01:04:36,119
He'll smother you
with his giant body

526
01:04:36,726 --> 01:04:38,789
So you can't make a sound

527
01:04:53,242 --> 01:04:54,515
Aunt

528
01:04:54,952 --> 01:04:56,809
|V|y, my

529
01:04:58,248 --> 01:05:01,396
Scaring a little girl like that

530
01:05:53,803 --> 01:05:55,492
Am I pretty too?

531
01:05:59,517 --> 01:06:01,290
Look closely

532
01:06:10,444 --> 01:06:12,759
to my big sister

533
01:06:15,449 --> 01:06:16,514
DHV

01:07:06,166 --> 01:07:08,231
P...penis

557
01:07:46,626 --> 01:07:50,646
You think if you speak Korean
I won't understand?

558
01:07:52,715 --> 01:07:57,695
I was going a bit crazy,
so I made them crazy too

559
01:08:01,933 --> 01:08:05,329
When Mrs. Sasaki
looked as crazy as me

560
01:08:05,393 --> 01:08:07,499
life was more bearable

561
01:08:09,898 --> 01:08:13,963
I know you are a bit insane

562
01:08:14,611 --> 01:08:18,342
It runs in your mother's family

563
01:08:18,823 --> 01:08:21,220
That's why l'm training you

564
01:08:21,284 --> 01:08:22,681
To set your mind right

565
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:34,566
Established by
the rational Germans

566
01:08:34,631 --> 01:08:38,700
it's very effective
in treating lunacy

567
01:08:38,928 --> 01:08:42,573
They dig holes in the dirt
put a patient in each one

568
01:08:42,638 --> 01:08:44,243
and put lids on top

569
01:08:44,308 --> 01:08:48,580
If patients improve
they get a leash,

570
01:08:48,645 --> 01:08:51,500
so they can crawl
around like dogs.

571
01:09:18,176 --> 01:09:21,778
The cherry tree that came
with me on the ship from Japan

572
01:09:21,844 --> 01:09:23,909
bloomed twice

573
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:28,453
"When Jinlian finally
took off her clothes,

574
01:09:28,519 --> 01:09:31,623
Ximen-Qing-examined

575
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:35,751

and-smooth-as-jade..."

576
01:09:38,361 --> 01:09:40,757
You must pause between words

577
01:09:41,365 --> 01:09:44,427
Don't read like a dog
lapping at his plate!

578
01:09:46,703 --> 01:09:49,768
Listen to your aunt read

579
01:09:56,714 --> 01:10:01,278
"When Jinlian finally
took off her clothes,

580
01:10:01,552 --> 01:10:05,323
Ximen Qing examined
her Jade Gate,

581
01:10:05,388 --> 01:10:07,326
Discovering the Secret Well

582
01:10:07,391 --> 01:10:10,788
to find it hairless
white as snow,

583
01:10:11,394 --> 01:10:14,000
and smooth as jade

584
01:10:16,732 --> 01:10:18,964
and soft as silk

585
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:24,801
Once he drew apart
the curtains of flesh,

586
01:10:32,917 --> 01:10:37,981
and on fold upon fold
of the red velvet interior

587
01:10:38,254 --> 01:10:40,651
beads of dew were forming

588
01:10:41,257 --> 01:10:46,657
Its centre was dark and void

589
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:50,828
yet as if it had its own life

590
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:55,667
it twitched and twitched

591
01:11:23,552 --> 01:11:27,780
Everyone wanted to cut it down
but my uncle refused.

592
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:33,451
He said this tree from Mt. Fuji
had absorbed my aunt's soul.

593
01:11:34,396 --> 01:11:40,000
The servants whispered it was
due to the tree's high cost,

594
01:11:43,571 --> 01:11:46,507
You can tel/
from the cherry blossoms

595
01:11:46,573 --> 01:11:50,136
which turned brighter
and bloomed longer.

596
01:12:22,942 --> 01:12:25,424
Tell me, Juliette

597
01:12:25,488 --> 01:12:33,120
Do you wish this impetuous
young knight to save you?

598
01:12:47,674 --> 01:12:48,780
Now

599
01:12:49,677 --> 01:12:51,783
my brave knight

600
01:12:56,767 --> 01:12:59,290
Oh, it's a new face!

601
01:13:02,355 --> 01:13:03,420
Now

602
01:13:03,732 --> 01:13:06,880
my brave knight

603
01:13:13,784 --> 01:13:15,932
what do you feel?

604
01:13:19,248 --> 01:13:21,646
I pity the poor woman

605
01:13:21,711 --> 01:13:27,108
I wish to lick her and lick her
caress her and caress her.

606
01:13:27,798 --> 01:13:30,154
If you pity her so

607
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:35,450
why not take her place
and let her whip you?

608
01:13:42,273 --> 01:13:46,668
The duchess raised the whip
high in the air, and then...

609
01:13:54,408 --> 01:13:56,181
And again

610
01:14:12,636 --> 01:14:16,574
If she could be yours
for ten minutes,

611
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,160
what would you give
in exchange?

612
01:14:19,475 --> 01:14:22,831
Whatever your heart desires

613
01:14:23,104 --> 01:14:26,168
Anything in this whole wide world

614
01:14:27,483 --> 01:14:31,480
Once the duke untied me

615
01:14:31,112 --> 01:14:35,176
I sat on the chair
pulled her to me,

616
01:14:35,533 --> 01:14:40,182
and slid my cock
into her cunt.

617
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:48,190
Oh, Juliette, Juliette

618
01:14:50,675 --> 01:14:55,488
As I felt the duke approach
from behind,

619
01:14:55,553 --> 01:14:58,283
a rope slithered
around my neck

620
01:14:59,683 --> 01:15:02,954
The duke slowly
tightened the rope

621
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:12,256
I pulled the swirling
currents of her hair.

622
01:15:13,362 --> 01:15:15,926
Then the duke spoke

623
01:15:18,201 --> 01:15:21,265
The ten minutes are almost up

624
01:15:31,214 --> 01:15:35,111
Slowly, my dear
said the Duchess

625
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:40,282
I haven't yet
fully savoured his pain

626
01:15:46,563 --> 01:15:50,293
No, the knight cried
don't stop!

627
01:15:55,237 --> 01:15:57,468
in the midst of this pain

628
01:16:35,193 --> 01:16:36,758
Is it Sade?

629
01:16:37,362 --> 01:16:39,552
lt's Sade-esque

630
01:16:39,617 --> 01:16:44,679
Believed to be the same Japanese
man who wrote 'The Lizard Skin'.

631
01:16:45,373 --> 01:16:50,351
Acquired from a Japanese sailor
on a ship from Hamburg.

632
01:16:53,296 --> 01:16:57,319
Can you imagine myjoy when

633
01:16:57,385 --> 01:17:02,239
after such a journey, it sat
on my shelf with its brothers?

634
01:17:02,307 --> 01:17:07,328
These are the babes
to whom I feel the most affection

635
01:17:08,313 --> 01:17:14,376
It used to contain an elaborate
monochrome woodcut illustration

636
01:17:16,694 --> 01:17:18,216
but as you can see

637
01:17:18,278 --> 01:17:20,468
So unfortunate

638
01:17:20,533 --> 01:17:25,261
If that were intact,
you could've named your price

639
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:29,682
The author felt words alone could
not fully describe the positions,

640
01:17:29,748 --> 01:17:33,397
and so included an illustration

641
01:17:34,672 --> 01:17:38,400
In that regard,
before we start the bidding

642
01:17:38,798 --> 01:17:39,863
Hideko!

643
01:17:43,345 --> 01:17:46,536
'Pain is a Garment

644
01:19:00,588 --> 01:19:01,944
Beautiful!

645
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:10,495
See you again

646
01:19:11,224 --> 01:19:12,288
Yes, thank you

647
01:19:13,394 --> 01:19:16,708
Today's reading was outstanding

648
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,461
Yes, thank you

649
01:19:20,234 --> 01:19:22,480
Especially the puppet!

650
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:39,230
There was a time when

651
01:19:42,758 --> 01:19:46,445
Imagine the torment
of having so many women

652
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:48,449
make advances on me

653
01:19:48,514 --> 01:19:51,824
when I couldn't afford to
buy them a glass of Burgundy

654
01:19:52,767 --> 01:19:57,331
Do the women here
advance on you?

655
01:19:57,688 --> 01:19:59,752
I look at women's eyes

656
01:19:59,815 --> 01:20:01,546
Only the eyes

657
01:20:01,609 --> 01:20:05,549
They turn their gaze away

658
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,927
but then they always look back

659
01:20:09,702 --> 01:20:14,640
If I were to slide under
someone's covers tonight

660
01:20:14,706 --> 01:20:18,686
only one woman here
would refuse me.

661
01:20:19,627 --> 01:20:22,191
Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?

662
01:20:25,884 --> 01:20:28,946
You left her to marry
a Japanese woman.

663
01:20:29,347 --> 01:20:33,575
But the S€I"\/HDTS tell me
you still share a bed with her

664
01:20:33,642 --> 01:20:35,912
You went so far as to
abandon your wife,

665
01:20:35,977 --> 01:20:38,705
why this urge
to become Japanese?

666
01:20:40,898 --> 01:20:42,712
Because Korea is ugly

667
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:50,385
Some Japanese say
Japan is ugly,

668
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:52,430
and Korea is beautiful

669
01:20:52,493 --> 01:20:54,890
Beauty is cruel by nature

670
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:59,180
Korea is soft, slow, dull
and therefore hopeless

671
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:04,608
Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?

672
01:21:05,548 --> 01:21:07,152
If I gave her the right signal

673
01:21:07,217 --> 01:21:11,781
she'd knock on my door
without her unden/vear.

674
01:21:15,724 --> 01:21:17,788
My thoughts exactly

675
01:21:19,894 --> 01:21:21,834
Then who is it?

676
01:21:21,897 --> 01:21:24,794
The one who would deny you?

677
01:21:26,569 --> 01:21:29,674
I heard you own
the highest quality

678
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:33,469
antique bookmaking tools
of East and West,

679
01:21:34,243 --> 01:21:35,848
but I don't see them here?

680
01:21:35,911 --> 01:21:39,810
Who would deny you?

681
01:21:42,253 --> 01:21:47,357
I met Hideko's eyes by chance
but she didn't look away.

682
01:21:47,424 --> 01:21:50,695
Indeed it was I
who shifted my gaze

683
01:21:50,761 --> 01:21:57,825
Will she make an appearance
in your lewd dreams tonight?

684
01:21:59,519 --> 01:22:02,791
Even if honoured
with such a visit,

685
01:22:02,855 --> 01:22:04,835
I don't think I could consummate

686
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:08,753
Because her body
would be as cold as waterfowl

687
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:16,763
The result of long training

688
01:22:20,456 --> 01:22:23,520
I heard you are engaged to her

689
01:22:23,878 --> 01:22:31,442
If l'm not mistaken,
you are yet to have intercourse?

690
01:22:32,384 --> 01:22:35,198
Her eyes have no desire

691
01:22:35,554 --> 01:22:38,784
It means her soul
is dead inside.

692
01:22:39,976 --> 01:22:42,330
You should go easy
on her training,

693
01:22:42,396 --> 01:22:45,791
unless you enjoy
making love to a corpse

694
01:23:37,534 --> 01:23:41,389
My particular way
of possessing beauty

695
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:46,268
Hideko too must have
received painting lessons?

696
01:23:46,335 --> 01:23:50,397
I was too occupied teaching
her to read with correct diction

697
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,680
Dear me!

698
01:23:52,339 --> 01:23:54,527
In England, where I studied

699
01:23:54,594 --> 01:24:00,614
all ladies were expected to produce
vibrant colour and graceful lines,

700
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:04,746
even in the less noble families

701
01:24:18,782 --> 01:24:20,846
A phone call, sir

702
01:24:21,618 --> 01:24:23,641
At this hour?

703
01:24:23,704 --> 01:24:25,768
lt's the Iwamura Bookstore

704
01:24:26,289 --> 01:24:27,353
Is that so?

705
01:24:27,707 --> 01:24:29,771
Excuse me a moment

706
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,659
You are mesmerising

707
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:49,123
when they wish to touch
a lady's breasts.

708
01:24:49,941 --> 01:24:54,127
l'm familiar with
Western conversational etiquette

709
01:24:55,653 --> 01:24:58,882
I do a bit of reading
you know.

710
01:24:59,282 --> 01:25:01,677
There was no calculation
in what I said.

711
01:25:01,743 --> 01:25:06,849
It was a reflex, like pulling
one's hand from a flame.

712
01:25:07,622 --> 01:25:08,978
l'm no flame

713
01:25:09,459 --> 01:25:12,897
l'm cold as waterfowl
your Lordship.

714
01:25:18,842 --> 01:25:20,782
He will return soon

715
01:25:20,846 --> 01:25:23,699
Mr. Iwamura only called
with a frivolous inquiry,

716
01:25:23,763 --> 01:25:25,786
at my request

717
01:25:25,851 --> 01:25:29,245
There's an issue regarding
your future you should know

718
01:25:29,604 --> 01:25:32,916
l'll wait by the stone lamp
at midnight.

719
01:25:34,608 --> 01:25:38,900
That Iwamura is a real fool

720
01:26:26,703 --> 01:26:28,806
My maid is asleep
in the room next door

721
01:26:28,873 --> 01:26:31,474
I don't fancy being in
scandalous rumours with you

722
01:26:31,542 --> 01:26:34,810
I saw Junko go to the
ser\/ants' quarters with her pillow

723
01:26:34,878 --> 01:26:37,273
Consider your reputation
as a nobleman.

724
01:26:37,712 --> 01:26:39,652
l'm no nobleman

725
01:26:39,714 --> 01:26:41,319
l'm not even Japanese

726
01:26:41,385 --> 01:26:45,155
Think it was easy for a Korean
farmhand's son to reach here?

727
01:26:45,222 --> 01:26:49,159
Fifteen hard years in Japan
before hearing about you.

728
01:26:49,224 --> 01:26:51,287
Another three years to prepare

729
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:55,372
I studied bookmaking
and learned to paint forgeries

730
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:57,669
All so that I could meet you

731
01:26:57,733 --> 01:26:59,254
To seduce and marry you

732
01:26:59,318 --> 01:27:01,714
to possess your
father's inheritance

733
01:27:02,488 --> 01:27:04,550
and then probably
to get rid of you.

734
01:27:06,241 --> 01:27:08,179
But I knew as soon as I met you

735
01:27:08,244 --> 01:27:10,639
For a man to seduce you
would be...

736
01:27:12,664 --> 01:27:14,228
impossible

737
01:27:15,752 --> 01:27:19,630
So in place of seduction,
I decided to propose a deal

738
01:27:20,424 --> 01:27:23,902
Most marriages are prison
but this one will free you.

739
01:27:24,676 --> 01:27:26,614
l'll rescue you from here

740
01:27:26,679 --> 01:27:30,242
take you far away,
and give you freedom

741
01:27:31,684 --> 01:27:33,912
Of course,
we'll split the money

742
01:27:34,852 --> 01:27:36,751
Nonsense

743
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:41,876
Marrying an old man with a black
tongue at your tender age makes sense?

744
01:27:41,943 --> 01:27:44,132
I won't marry anyone

745
01:27:44,196 --> 01:27:45,759
What have you in mind?

746
01:27:51,453 --> 01:27:53,225
That's not proper

747
01:27:53,288 --> 01:27:54,643
There's no beauty in that

748
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:57,478
If you kill yourself,
what of your fortune?

749
01:28:02,925 --> 01:28:07,700
So he can buy 10 little girls
and teach them to read books?

750
01:28:08,387 --> 01:28:10,742
My uncle will find us somehow

751
01:28:13,516 --> 01:28:14,664
Uncle

752
01:28:15,727 --> 01:28:16,666
The basement?

753
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:19,958
It says here
when people are hanged

754
01:28:30,825 --> 01:28:32,931
and her bottom was clean

755
01:28:34,329 --> 01:28:36,392
Want to go somewhere nice?

756
01:28:54,184 --> 01:28:58,164
l'll tell you in detail
what I did to your aunt

757
01:28:58,229 --> 01:29:00,416
after I caught her
running away.

758
01:29:00,482 --> 01:29:05,212
So don't you ever think
of running, understood?

759
01:29:25,256 --> 01:29:28,986
But if I ever
end up there again

760
01:29:33,764 --> 01:29:35,452
Highly concentrated opium

761
01:29:35,517 --> 01:29:37,786
Three drops will make you
sleep all day.

762
01:29:37,852 --> 01:29:40,706
Five drops will
knock down a horse

763
01:29:40,771 --> 01:29:43,625
If you crave death
within five minutes

764
01:29:43,689 --> 01:29:45,462
drink it all

765
01:29:45,527 --> 01:29:48,879
If you carry this, he can never
take you to the basement.

766
01:29:48,945 --> 01:29:50,509
At least not alive

767
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:53,178
It'll be my wedding gift to you

768
01:29:53,617 --> 01:29:55,513
lt's more expensive than jewels

769
01:30:06,883 --> 01:30:12,152
Bring a girl to be my maid. One who
could disappear and not be missed.

770
01:30:12,219 --> 01:30:13,907
If a bit dense, all the better

771
01:30:13,972 --> 01:30:18,367
We'll send her to a madhouse
under my name.

772
01:30:18,934 --> 01:30:21,248
I can find you a new maid

773
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,333
but what do we do
aboutJunko?

774
01:30:28,987 --> 01:30:34,900
You really think l'm prettier
than Miss Hideko?

775
01:30:35,243 --> 01:30:39,348
Sure, Hideko's pretty
and you're pretty.

776
01:30:39,413 --> 01:30:41,475
What?
You speak Korean?

777
01:30:42,998 --> 01:30:44,396
You know

778
01:30:45,251 --> 01:30:46,732
I learned it

779
01:30:55,136 --> 01:30:56,616
You are just mesmerising

780
01:30:56,679 --> 01:30:58,350
Oh my gosh!

781
01:30:59,932 --> 01:31:01,997
You little tart!

782
01:31:06,981 --> 01:31:08,171
I can't!

783
01:31:13,156 --> 01:31:17,260
Forget this wretched place
Come live with me!

784
01:32:04,372 --> 01:32:05,769
Oh, fucking hell!

785
01:32:06,707 --> 01:32:07,813
Fucking hell?

786
01:32:07,875 --> 01:32:09,106
Fucking hell

787
01:32:41,743 --> 01:32:44,308
Naive and a bit foolish

788
01:32:47,748 --> 01:32:49,313
Mother!

789
01:33:00,264 --> 01:33:05,368
Show Sookee your clothes and
jewellery at every opportunity.

790
01:33:05,436 --> 01:33:09,788
The material greed she got from her
mother will make her more gullible.

791
01:33:09,857 --> 01:33:15,753
P.S. Don 't worry if she reads this
/etteh she's totally illiterate.

792
01:33:18,863 --> 01:33:19,967
Countess Fujiwara Hideko

793
01:33:28,289 --> 01:33:30,103
What's with your foot?

794
01:33:35,713 --> 01:33:38,277
Who took Tamako's shoe?

795
01:33:50,563 --> 01:33:53,583
If she ever runs away
because of one of you

796
01:33:53,649 --> 01:33:56,200
l'll strip you all naked
and throw you out!

797
01:33:57,276 --> 01:33:58,632
Fucking hell

798
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:04,346
All smooth

799
01:34:11,249 --> 01:34:12,855
You like the scent?

800
01:34:13,626 --> 01:34:15,190
Want to come in?

801
01:34:15,252 --> 01:34:16,317
Pardon?

802
01:34:33,396 --> 01:34:35,251
No need to be
ashamed at all

803
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:37,543
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart

804
01:34:37,608 --> 01:34:39,715
Is that so?

805
01:34:45,201 --> 01:34:47,387
Returning the earrings
you loaned me.

806
01:34:47,829 --> 01:34:50,931
A woman might wager her fate
on such an exquisite pair.

807
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:54,603
I 'm sure that Sookee
will try her very best

808
01:34:54,669 --> 01:34:59,357
in order to see herself
wearing these in the mirror.

809
01:34:59,841 --> 01:35:03,152
l'll tel/ you how to keep her
from getting suspicious.

810
01:35:03,428 --> 01:35:06,573
Keep her busy until
the day of the wedding

811
01:35:09,266 --> 01:35:11,912
on making you
fall in love with me

812
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:17,417
In other words, don 't fall
in love with me so easily.

813
01:35:39,379 --> 01:35:41,693
How did your mum die?

814
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:45,778
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying

815
01:35:46,636 --> 01:35:48,783
That she had no regrets

816
01:35:49,891 --> 01:35:54,162
ls this the companionship
they write about in books?

817
01:36:01,943 --> 01:36:03,548
Men are disgusting

818
01:36:07,407 --> 01:36:09,120
What's on my mind?

819
01:36:09,994 --> 01:36:13,515
You don't really believe
that I crave your body?

820
01:36:15,289 --> 01:36:16,620
You do!

821
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:18,186
You read too many
of those books.

822
01:36:18,252 --> 01:36:20,147
If there's one thing
l'm after, Miss...

823
01:36:21,255 --> 01:36:26,237
lt's not your eyes,
your hands or ass

824
01:36:26,676 --> 01:36:29,730
it's your money, only that

825
01:36:29,763 --> 01:36:32,492
Of all that you have
money is the best.

826
01:36:34,269 --> 01:36:37,581
Feels great being so rude
to a noble lady.

827
01:36:38,103 --> 01:36:39,834
What's with her?

828
01:36:40,609 --> 01:36:44,712
Why does she stomp her feet,
expressing her angeh

829
01:36:44,779 --> 01:36:47,591
sit up in the middle
of the night and sigh?

830
01:36:48,951 --> 01:36:53,387
Every time she sees the Count,
her eyes seem to say...

831
01:36:53,869 --> 01:36:55,600
I despise you

832
01:36:56,417 --> 01:37:02,620
Try to bear it. Only if she sees this
will she believe the proposal.

833
01:37:20,857 --> 01:37:24,751
Think of me as that puppet,
and l'll imagine another woman

834
01:37:25,192 --> 01:37:26,923
What woman?

835
01:37:29,864 --> 01:37:31,928
The duchess Juliette

836
01:37:34,368 --> 01:37:35,600
Lady!

837
01:37:36,703 --> 01:37:38,769
Milord!

838
01:37:43,877 --> 01:37:45,108
Lady

839
01:37:53,222 --> 01:37:56,117
Jinlian could not fathom
their depths.

840
01:37:57,892 --> 01:37:59,914
Knowing this, Lady Sun

841
01:37:59,978 --> 01:38:04,840
gave Jinlian four
small silver balls.

842
01:38:04,149 --> 01:38:08,671
These are 'minling
or 'bells of passion

843
01:38:08,737 --> 01:38:12,425
Place two in
the lady's Jade Gate

844
01:38:12,490 --> 01:38:15,721
and the other two in yours

845
01:38:18,162 --> 01:38:20,267
Spread your legs apart

846
01:38:20,331 --> 01:38:22,938
and like two scissors

847
01:38:25,338 --> 01:38:28,358
When the lips below
rub against each another

848
01:38:28,424 --> 01:38:30,360
youWlhear
a clear ringing sound

849
01:38:30,425 --> 01:38:32,237
A blackout!
Bring a lantern!

850
01:38:32,676 --> 01:38:34,199
Yes, sir!

851
01:38:34,263 --> 01:38:36,241
'The Sound of Bells
on a Wind/ess Night

852
01:38:38,183 --> 01:38:42,247
When do I put this in?
asked Jinlian.

853
01:38:43,189 --> 01:38:47,668
Does the lady breathe deeply
and swallow hard?

854
01:38:49,112 --> 01:38:52,480
Does she whisper sweetly
in your ear,

855
01:38:52,112 --> 01:38:53,843
and kiss you?

856
01:39:01,205 --> 01:39:03,644
and caress your nipples?

857
01:39:05,586 --> 01:39:07,814
Does her secret part
become slippery

858
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:10,651
as she gently bites
your shoulder?

859
01:39:11,215 --> 01:39:14,780
Then, put in the bells

860
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:23,540
Amazing!
- Indeed!

861
01:39:40,911 --> 01:39:43,600
lt's so cute

862
01:39:48,502 --> 01:39:50,441
If the Count sees this

863
01:39:57,512 --> 01:40:00,409
Will he really be
so tender as this?

864
01:40:01,515 --> 01:40:02,579
Of course

865
01:40:02,642 --> 01:40:05,956
And he'll touch you like this

866
01:40:06,854 --> 01:40:08,419
And like this

867
01:40:16,530 --> 01:40:18,385
Tamako, keep doing it

868
01:40:19,533 --> 01:40:21,305
Like the Count would

869
01:40:23,954 --> 01:40:25,227
The Count

870
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:26,728
The Count

871
01:40:27,583 --> 01:40:29,814
He'll go crazy over this

872
01:40:32,505 --> 01:40:36,280
And this is what he'll say

873
01:40:37,761 --> 01:40:43,744
lt's so soft, warm
wet, and...

874
01:40:47,729 --> 01:40:52,860
s...s...spellbindingly beautiful!

875
01:41:23,806 --> 01:41:26,912
Shall I teach you more, Miss?

876
01:41:26,975 --> 01:41:28,957
Yes

877
01:41:29,895 --> 01:41:31,959
Teach me everything

878
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:21,173
I wish that I had breast milk
so I could feed you.

879
01:42:35,712 --> 01:42:37,859
Do you like it when I do this?

880
01:42:42,386 --> 01:42:45,720
Can you promise
that you won't betray me?

881
01:42:46,721 --> 01:42:48,770
Iilnever

882
01:42:48,473 --> 01:42:49,579
FIGVSI'

883
01:42:50,975 --> 01:42:53,410
SVSI'

884
01:43:06,534 --> 01:43:12,642
Miss, how could such an innocent

885
01:43:12,706 --> 01:43:15,104
You must be a natural

886
01:44:10,764 --> 01:44:12,790
Stop!

887
01:44:13,686 --> 01:44:16,830
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

888
01:44:17,605 --> 01:44:18,959
She's got no one
on this earth.

889
01:44:29,532 --> 01:44:30,596
You see?

890
01:44:31,955 --> 01:44:34,640
If you don't give the impression
you want this marriage,

891
01:44:34,707 --> 01:44:37,977
she may throw another fit
and refuse to go fon/vard.

892
01:44:41,378 --> 01:44:42,651
I can't do it

893
01:44:42,712 --> 01:44:43,610
What?

894
01:44:44,548 --> 01:44:45,946
I want to quit

895
01:44:47,134 --> 01:44:49,531
What's with you all today?

896
01:44:51,639 --> 01:44:53,536
You feel sorry for her?

897
01:44:56,643 --> 01:44:58,874
What is it with women?

898
01:45:01,651 --> 01:45:05,836
You know what that poor
Sookee said about your Ladyship?

899
01:45:05,905 --> 01:45:09,465
That you're too dense to get it
if someone pulls on your nipples

900
01:45:09,534 --> 01:45:12,469
That she was nice out of pity
but you ate it up.

901
01:45:12,535 --> 01:45:14,348
That you were so gullible!

902
01:45:14,411 --> 01:45:17,976
That naive ser\/ant's face

903
01:45:20,627 --> 01:45:23,940
If I say that
I love someone else

904
01:45:24,923 --> 01:45:29,362
Me, who has no one
on this earth...

905
01:45:29,928 --> 01:45:32,407
Do you still want me
to marry him?

906
01:45:32,887 --> 01:45:33,743
Yes

907
01:45:45,483 --> 01:45:46,715
Miss!

908
01:46:09,383 --> 01:46:12,323
I wish l'd never been born

909
01:46:48,213 --> 01:46:49,278
Let go

910
01:46:51,883 --> 01:46:54,990
Miss, l'm sorry!

911
01:46:57,472 --> 01:46:58,495
Let go!

912
01:46:58,932 --> 01:47:01,800
l'm sorry, Miss!

913
01:47:01,142 --> 01:47:02,957
Don't die

914
01:47:03,228 --> 01:47:04,960
l'm sorry

915
01:47:06,899 --> 01:47:08,796
What are you sorry about?

916
01:47:09,903 --> 01:47:14,842
I tried to trick you into
marrying that bastard.

917
01:47:14,908 --> 01:47:18,971
I was going to put you
in a madhouse and run off

918
01:47:19,621 --> 01:47:23,684
Don't die.
Don't get married, Miss!

919
01:47:25,753 --> 01:47:29,481
Sookee,
are you worried about me?

920
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:36,532
l'm worried about you

921
01:47:41,934 --> 01:47:45,165
How do you know my name?

922
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:48,460
You think you're tricking me?

923
01:47:50,776 --> 01:47:52,547
You're the one being tricked

924
01:47:53,864 --> 01:47:56,592
You're the one
bound for the madhouse

925
01:47:58,369 --> 01:48:01,263
I was going to lock you up
in there under my name,

926
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:04,892
then l'd become you
and run far away, with him

927
01:48:09,505 --> 01:48:13,733
I won't say sorry,
since you tried to trick me too

928
01:48:20,514 --> 01:48:24,790
That fucking son of a bitch!

929
01:48:25,185 --> 01:48:28,126
Oh, sorry Miss!

930
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:32,460
'I hope this letter Hnds you wel/
This is Sookee.

931
01:48:32,528 --> 01:48:36,799
I 'm writing to inform you
of a change in plans.

932
01:48:36,865 --> 01:48:41,804
I decided to team up
with the Lady Hideko

933
01:48:41,870 --> 01:48:44,973
As such, l'm now in need
of all your help.

934
01:48:47,375 --> 01:48:51,982
Always remember
the basement.

935
01:49:06,394 --> 01:49:08,707
Want to go somewhere nice?

936
01:49:40,512 --> 01:49:43,740
You didn't teach me
to read Japanese.

937
01:50:05,369 --> 01:50:07,767
Did that bastard draw this?

938
01:50:09,876 --> 01:50:14,854
Is this what you've been reading
to that dirty old man

939
01:50:15,379 --> 01:50:17,276
and those gentlemen?

940
01:52:23,382 --> 01:52:25,569
The daughter of
a legendary thief

941
01:52:25,635 --> 01:52:28,655
who sewed winter coats
out of sto/en purses.

942
01:52:28,972 --> 01:52:32,326
Herself a thief
pickpocket, swind/er.

943
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:36,380
The saviour who came to
tear my life apart.

944
01:52:36,394 --> 01:52:38,167
My Tamako

945
01:52:38,730 --> 01:52:40,461
My Sookee

946
01:53:31,491 --> 01:53:33,389
You scoundrel!

947
01:53:33,452 --> 01:53:35,890
Let go of me,
you filthy bitches!

948
01:53:37,329 --> 01:53:38,436
Miss!

949
01:53:39,332 --> 01:53:40,689
Let go!

950
01:53:42,626 --> 01:53:44,275
Miss!

951
01:53:59,102 --> 01:54:00,416
l'm hungry

952
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:09,423
The first month, I ordered
a slim herringbone suit.

953
01:54:10,402 --> 01:54:11,466
PART THREE

954
01:54:11,508 --> 01:54:13,593
The next month, I wore it to
dine at the Imperial Hotel.

955
01:54:17,206 --> 01:54:20,307
Some Englishmen who frequented
the brothel recognised me.

956
01:54:20,375 --> 01:54:24,104
I thought they'd call the
maitre d' and kick me out

957
01:54:24,544 --> 01:54:25,940
but what do you know?

958
01:54:26,548 --> 01:54:31,153
They were amused
l'd spend a month's pay

959
01:54:31,218 --> 01:54:32,781
on one dignified meal

960
01:54:33,554 --> 01:54:35,992
They started calling me 'Count

961
01:54:37,893 --> 01:54:40,329
Frankly, l'm not that
interested in money itself

962
01:54:40,394 --> 01:54:43,123
What I desire is
how shall I put it.

963
01:54:46,733 --> 01:54:48,171
Something like that

964
01:54:59,998 --> 01:55:02,518
Fourteen hours by train
from Vladivostok

965
01:55:02,585 --> 01:55:05,610
is the summer home of a
genuine Russian noble family

966
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:08,567
Shall we marry there?

967
01:55:17,349 --> 01:55:20,410
That my wife Fujiwara Hideko
has died.

968
01:55:27,526 --> 01:55:31,171
I doubt Sookee would want
to live there very long.

969
01:55:39,535 --> 01:55:41,434
Fuck!

970
01:55:46,294 --> 01:55:48,397
I arranged it with
a photography studio

971
01:55:48,463 --> 01:55:50,691
We'll replace this with
your photograph.

972
01:55:51,550 --> 01:55:55,445
From tomorrow,
we'll give Sookee a new life

973
01:55:55,926 --> 01:55:57,324
l'm glad

974
01:55:57,387 --> 01:55:59,368
Marry me once again

975
01:56:00,181 --> 01:56:01,786
This time as Nam Sookee

976
01:56:03,477 --> 01:56:05,915
You want another wedding night?

977
01:56:11,985 --> 01:56:15,216
I think I like you... slightly

978
01:56:18,492 --> 01:56:21,138
Poor Sookee,
in a place like that

979
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:24,226
all by herself

980
01:56:26,167 --> 01:56:29,229
Did such a thought
ever cross your mind?

981
01:56:29,629 --> 01:56:32,107
Not at all.
Why should I pity her?

982
01:56:32,173 --> 01:56:35,486
Where I come from,
it's illegal to be naive

983
01:56:35,553 --> 01:56:39,154
Where you come from, it's not naive
to fall in love with a business partner?

984
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:41,284
Of course. lt's illegal

985
01:56:41,683 --> 01:56:45,245
So even if my love for you
leads me to ruin,

986
01:56:45,643 --> 01:56:47,374
don't pity me

987
01:56:47,895 --> 01:56:49,210
Love?

988
01:56:51,233 --> 01:56:53,295
What does a crook
know about love?

989
01:57:17,257 --> 01:57:18,572
Fire!

990
01:57:27,102 --> 01:57:31,430
C...c...come this way!

991
01:57:31,105 --> 01:57:32,253
This way!

992
01:58:38,757 --> 01:58:41,696
Because you desired me

993
01:58:41,761 --> 01:58:43,696
and overcame
all obstacles to reach me

994
01:58:43,763 --> 01:58:46,325
I have been born anew
it's true.

995
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:49,455
l'm grateful for that

996
01:58:51,644 --> 01:58:53,751
l'll allow a kiss

997
01:58:59,819 --> 01:59:00,883
Why hot?

998
01:59:03,991 --> 01:59:06,261
ldon%Hke
kisses with conditions

999
01:59:06,327 --> 01:59:09,560
I never learned
how to stop half\/vay

1000
01:59:10,999 --> 01:59:16,229
After this l'll thrust in deep
to your navel.

1001
01:59:17,503 --> 01:59:19,234
Please do that

1002
01:59:22,677 --> 01:59:24,780
Those aren't the eyes
of one who wants it.

1003
01:59:24,846 --> 01:59:27,907
You know you can't
deceive me in such matters

1004
01:59:32,686 --> 01:59:36,792
If I could be yours
for ten minutes,

1005
01:59:36,857 --> 01:59:38,919
what would you give
in exchange?

1006
01:59:39,526 --> 01:59:41,798
Whatever your heart desires

1007
01:59:41,862 --> 01:59:44,926
Anything in this whole wide world

1008
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:15,789
You'll become a
completely new woman

1009
02:02:07,133 --> 02:02:09,819
It won't hurt.
You know from those books?

1010
02:02:09,885 --> 02:02:13,781
In truth, women feel
the greatest pleasure

1011
02:02:13,846 --> 02:02:15,868
when taken by force

1012
02:02:16,183 --> 02:02:19,246
Now l'm going to
rip your unden/vear

1013
02:03:55,782 --> 02:03:58,304
Would you fetch those for me?

1014
02:04:42,495 --> 02:04:44,559
Respected Uncle

1015
02:04:45,666 --> 02:04:50,522
it always pained me
to see you straining

1016
02:04:50,589 --> 02:04:55,484
to speak flawless Japanese
before the Count from Nagoya

1017
02:04:55,552 --> 02:04:58,655
and even to quiver your voice
like a nobleman.

1018
02:05:00,849 --> 02:05:07,413
So I 'm happy to inform you
that you no longer need do so

1019
02:05:08,188 --> 02:05:12,585
That man is the son
of a Korean farmhand

1020
02:05:13,526 --> 02:05:18,592
Oh, did my gift arrive safely?

1021
02:05:23,536 --> 02:05:25,433
I 'm afraid that in rea/ life

1022
02:05:26,374 --> 02:05:29,978
no woman feels pleasure
at being taken by force.

1023
02:05:35,715 --> 02:05:38,112
I fee/ "s/ight/y" grateful

1024
02:05:51,399 --> 02:05:55,450
You wished to see
my bookmaking tools?

1025
02:05:55,111 --> 02:05:59,131
Don't just look,
experience them for yourself

1026
02:05:59,656 --> 02:06:02,100
l'll choose five books
that I cherish...

1027
02:06:07,162 --> 02:06:08,101
Let's see

1028
02:06:08,163 --> 02:06:09,144
Firs

1029
02:06:12,335 --> 02:06:14,148
Confessions of a Whip

1030
02:06:23,345 --> 02:06:25,243
The Lizard Skin

1031
02:06:36,944 --> 02:06:40,700
'Decadent Girls
Who Sell Lingerie

1032
02:06:50,124 --> 02:06:53,190
May I please
smoke a cigarette, sir?

1033
02:06:57,629 --> 02:06:59,861
'Bells and Balls

1034
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:05,199
The Mortician's Bedroom

1035
02:07:17,442 --> 02:07:20,380
How could you let
a little girl fool you?

1036
02:07:23,491 --> 02:07:27,678
But don 't worry.
I 'll catch them for you soon

1037
02:07:30,124 --> 02:07:35,602
I arranged so that no two girls
travelling together can leave Kobe

1038
02:07:41,843 --> 02:07:44,236
Please change the destination
to Shanghai.

1039
02:07:44,304 --> 02:07:47,406
Changing two tickets,
from Vladivostok to Shanghai

1040
02:07:47,471 --> 02:07:49,369
Yes, that's correct

1041
02:07:49,974 --> 02:07:51,662
Show me your passports

1042
02:07:58,691 --> 02:08:00,630
Miss Nam Sookee?

1043
02:08:03,487 --> 02:08:05,427
Mr. Go Pan-dol?

1044
02:08:13,582 --> 02:08:16,144
You need to pay
an additional 3 yen

1045
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:17,564
Aii right

1046
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:25,904
l'm just an old man
who likes dirty stories

1047
02:08:27,681 --> 02:08:31,867
Even listening to the same story
people imagine different things.

1048
02:08:31,933 --> 02:08:35,288
Peering into each of
those fantasies

1049
02:08:35,353 --> 02:08:38,458
was this old man's
humble recreation.

1050
02:08:38,899 --> 02:08:42,400
What to do,
now that it's all over?

1051
02:08:42,611 --> 02:08:45,900
You should at least
tell me your story.

1052
02:08:46,864 --> 02:08:50,429
How did that bitch Hideko taste?

1053
02:09:00,377 --> 02:09:02,442
Right, right

1054
02:09:03,591 --> 02:09:07,445
You have that silly
penchant for cigarettes?

1055
02:09:24,401 --> 02:09:28,384
So how was Hideko?

1056
02:09:34,412 --> 02:09:38,478
You have no windows here?

1057
02:09:41,963 --> 02:09:45,358
Sookee could be listening in
Let's do our best.

1058
02:10:10,363 --> 02:10:11,969
What's this?

1059
02:10:14,535 --> 02:10:17,390
So, where did you touch first?

1060
02:10:17,454 --> 02:10:18,852
Her face ?

1061
02:10:21,208 --> 02:10:22,606
Her breasts?

1062
02:10:28,548 --> 02:10:30,710
Was it soft?

1063
02:10:30,843 --> 02:10:32,699
Did it tighten up?

1064
02:10:33,971 --> 02:10:36,201
Did it have many wrinkles?

1065
02:10:37,183 --> 02:10:39,800
Was it sufficiently wet?

1066
02:10:39,145 --> 02:10:42,539
The viscosity and transparency
of her vaginal secretion?

1067
02:10:44,148 --> 02:10:46,837
Please, one more cigarette, sir

1068
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:18,618
Spider thread pulled
into strings...

1069
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:25,834
I dare say no book
has ever described

1070
02:11:25,898 --> 02:11:28,128
such a ferocious wedding night.

1071
02:11:30,737 --> 02:11:35,135
I thought I heard
a nightingale sing

1072
02:12:09,192 --> 02:12:13,923
And... the clean
bright crimson blood!

1073
02:12:23,373 --> 02:12:25,769
Thus the Lady
became my wife

1074
02:12:26,209 --> 02:12:29,940
Coy one moment,
bold the next...

1075
02:12:33,799 --> 02:12:38,491
But how was she coy

1076
02:12:38,555 --> 02:12:42,786
how was she bold,
tell it to me in detail!

1077
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:46,206
A story is all about the journey

1078
02:12:46,645 --> 02:12:49,127
You should know

1079
02:12:50,565 --> 02:12:52,338
Did she resist?

1080
02:12:53,404 --> 02:12:56,480
So did you pinch her ass
as punishment?

1081
02:12:56,323 --> 02:13:00,178
Or did she spit at you
in contempt?

1082
02:13:00,617 --> 02:13:02,349
Or else

1083
02:13:02,995 --> 02:13:05,392
Did she beg you to do it?

1084
02:13:06,208 --> 02:13:09,645
Like the lady in
The Widow's Lapdog?

1085
02:13:13,213 --> 02:13:14,527
How dare you!

1086
02:13:14,590 --> 02:13:16,613
Hideko is my wife

1087
02:13:16,970 --> 02:13:21,614
What kind of scoundrel rattles on
about his wedding night!

1088
02:14:28,455 --> 02:14:29,603
lt's odd

1089
02:14:31,458 --> 02:14:33,106
Your smoke

1090
02:14:35,754 --> 02:14:38,945
lt's cold, blue

1091
02:14:40,467 --> 02:14:46,493
and strangely beautiful

1092
02:14:47,726 --> 02:14:54,667
You too have become
soft, slow and dull.

1093
02:14:56,276 --> 02:14:59,380
Mercury is most deadly
in its gaseous state.

1094
02:15:06,244 --> 02:15:10,641
At least I will die
with my cock intact

1095
02:19:10,905 --> 02:19:15,950
I hear a sound
in the distance

1096
02:19:15,160 --> 02:19:19,432
that sounds like
the steps of my love

1097
02:19:19,497 --> 02:19:23,645
An echo that
makes my heart

1098
02:19:23,708 --> 02:19:27,108
skip a beat

1099
02:19:27,881 --> 02:19:32,362
But I wait
all through the night

1100
02:19:32,426 --> 02:19:36,730
and my love never
comes to me

1101
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:40,870
There is no end
to the heartache

1102
02:19:40,934 --> 02:19:44,749
that grips me
in this hour

1103
02:19:45,189 --> 02:19:49,300
Waiting for
the footsteps of

1104
02:19:49,442 --> 02:19:52,758
my dear love

1105
02:19:53,864 --> 02:19:57,762
Waiting for
the footsteps of

1106
02:20:19,557 --> 02:20:23,663
But then in
my waiting heart

1107
02:20:23,728 --> 02:20:28,420
suddenly
happiness overflows

1108
02:20:28,107 --> 02:20:32,339
There you are
in the distance

1109
02:20:32,402 --> 02:20:36,219
coming to me

1110
02:20:36,657 --> 02:20:40,847
Filled with dreams
of a new life

1111
02:20:40,911 --> 02:20:44,810
H//ed with happiness

1112
02:20:45,248 --> 02:20:49,147
Inside my waiting heart

1113
02:20:49,586 --> 02:20:53,319
flowers start to bloom

1114
02:20:53,799 --> 02:20:57,697
Come my /oven
come to me

1115
02:21:02,349 --> 02:21:05,997
Let's dream of
happy times

1116
02:21:06,603 --> 02:21:10,837
like long ago

1117
02:21:32,295 --> 02:21:36,194
H//ed with happiness

1118
02:21:36,675 --> 02:21:40,532
Inside my waiting heart

1119
02:21:40,845 --> 02:21:44,745
flowers start to bloom

1120
02:21:45,184 --> 02:21:49,400
Waiting for
the footsteps of

1121
02:21:49,479 --> 02:21:53,400
my dear love

1122
02:21:53,734 --> 02:21:57,465
Waiting for
the footsteps of
