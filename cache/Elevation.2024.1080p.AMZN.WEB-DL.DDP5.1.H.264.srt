1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,974
The sinkholes
appeared with no warning

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,909
-in every country in the world.
-Complete chaos

3
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:10,143
at this hour on the streets of
every major city on the planet.

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,746
They're exploding
from the ground.

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,347
It seems like, with no warning,
they're exploding

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,916
-from the ground.
-Scientists say

7
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,483
the creatures that emerged
from the sinkholes

8
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:18,520
may have been hibernating
for thousands of years.

9
00:00:18,553 --> 00:00:20,320
Their bullets
merely hinder the creatures

10
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,956
but don't stop them.

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,457
Many nations
have called in the military.

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,325
...thousands dead,
no end in sight.

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,995
People who live
at high altitudes are reporting

14
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,863
that they've seen the Reapers
stop cold at 8,000 feet.

15
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:30,798
This is Nederland, Colorado.

16
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:32,534
Most of our town is destroyed,
but everything above 8,000 feet

17
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,536
is completely untouched.

18
00:00:34,569 --> 00:00:36,804
Global lifeline
appears to be 8,000 feet.

19
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:38,840
Authorities are
urging survivors

20
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,875
to stay above that elevation.

21
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:43,443
8,000 feet is
the global lifeline.

22
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:47,247
If you can get to high ground,
go there now.

23
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:04,712
Hey, Hunter.

24
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,446
Everything okay?

25
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,450
Hunter?

26
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:21,361
I just... just wanted
to see other people.

27
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,098
And you said most of the
monsters are sleeping again.

28
00:04:24,132 --> 00:04:26,200
You're on oxygen every night.

29
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,805
What if your lungs seized up
when you were running away?

30
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,976
I'm sorry, Dad.

31
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:39,580
I can't lose you.

32
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,784
I can't.

33
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:45,052
I need you to understand that.

34
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:19,452
-This one's heavy.
-Yeah.

35
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,956
Hold on.

36
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:25,492
-You got it?
-Yeah.

37
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,461
Hey,
what happened this morning?

38
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,232
He went across The Line
to get a better view

39
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,934
of the Red Rock settlement.

40
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,836
Well, he's the only kid
up here.

41
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,604
He's lonely.

42
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,438
He's alive.

43
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:43,110
Some of us need more
than that, Will.

44
00:05:43,144 --> 00:05:44,979
I mean, we may be safe up here,

45
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,282
but this mountaintop is
like a prison to him.

46
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:52,485
He didn't just go there
to see Red Rock.

47
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,424
The Line crosses

48
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,227
Elba Fire Road near there.

49
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:04,832
It's the last place
he saw his mother.

50
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,792
Crow's Nest Refuge reports

51
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,727
they sent a party of five
below The Line

52
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,429
to forage for essentials.

53
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,230
Nobody's come back so far,

54
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,032
but they're still
holding out hope.

55
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:47,134
They asked us to send somebody
out to the pinnacle

56
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:49,103
to look for any signs
they're still out there.

57
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,738
What road did they take?

58
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,040
Sugarloaf Run
in the upper valley.

59
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:08,049
I get it.

60
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:11,652
You trust Nina.
But this is a suicide mission.

61
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,687
It's not your job
to save the world.

62
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,692
Okay, buddy.

63
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,194
I'm here. I'm here.

64
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,163
Take it easy.

65
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:33,374
All right. Deep breaths.

66
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,546
Nice and easy. Deep breaths.

67
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,548
Deep breaths.

68
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,482
Nice and easy.

69
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:43,050
There you go.

70
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:44,418
Nice and easy.

71
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,290
Oh, I love you, man.

72
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,556
So, the hay
keeps the potato warm

73
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,290
as it grows out of the ground.

74
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:25,392
When it gets cold,
you put the hay over it,

75
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:29,531
keep the frost off the ground,
keep the potato warm.

76
00:10:29,564 --> 00:10:30,865
All right?

77
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,601
Now, it's about timing,
all right?

78
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,802
When you let it go...

79
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,737
You have to let it go
at the right moment.

80
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,139
Let go of the string.

81
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:39,640
There you go.

82
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,946
It's Hunter's birthday.

83
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,383
Mm. And you want my last box
of mac and cheese?

84
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,651
I have these to trade.

85
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,587
It's not much, but...

86
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,023
It's enough.

87
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,993
No way!

88
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,394
-How'd you get this?
-Come on.

89
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,929
You know
I got connections, man.

90
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,865
Happy birthday.

91
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,136
Dad, why don't you use
the radio anymore?

92
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,575
Oh. We have flags to signal the
other refuges if we need to.

93
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,276
But it's not the same
as talking to them.

94
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,011
It's hard enough
to make enough electricity

95
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:18,312
for the things
we absolutely need,

96
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,514
like your machine.

97
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:20,915
Especially in the winter,

98
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,216
with the days being so short.

99
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:29,256
You're gonna leave, aren't you?

100
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,926
That was your last filter.

101
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,127
We need more.

102
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,361
You get sick again...

103
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:35,462
Then I won't get sick.

104
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:37,398
No, it doesn't work like that.

105
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,302
When?

106
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,171
I'm going to be okay.

107
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:55,316
I got 'em from Charlie.

108
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,818
I'm pretty sure
he's trying to sleep with me.

109
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,153
He's 80.

110
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,055
Well,
after three years up here,

111
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,923
I'm considering it.

112
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:05,660
Where's Hunter?

113
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:07,328
Sleeping.

114
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:12,866
It's Friday night, you know.

115
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,468
Is it?

116
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:16,203
Mm-hmm.

117
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:19,940
If this was before,
what would you be doing?

118
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,811
I'd probably be at the 19th
hole with my father-in-law.

119
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,650
I'm sorry, I never pictured you
as the country club type, Will.

120
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:30,251
I wasn't.

121
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,920
But Tara's family loved it.

122
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,455
I hated it.

123
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:37,925
And now I miss it.

124
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,604
Goddamn it.

125
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,287
We're out of filters, so
I'm-a have to give you a shot.

126
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,479
Hello, Nina.

127
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,148
How are you?

128
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:39,019
How's the drinking?

129
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:41,155
Keeps me from killing myself.

130
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:44,992
How's yours?

131
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,262
Keeps me from killing you.

132
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,169
I'm leaving tomorrow.

133
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,638
For Boulder.

134
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,743
Well, that's probably the last
thing I expected you to say.

135
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:03,678
I don't have a choice.

136
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,215
You'll die.

137
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,951
They can't be killed.

138
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,688
You believed that,
you wouldn't still have

139
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,724
this pirate flag on your wall.

140
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,992
I found a safe way there.

141
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,734
There is no safe way.

142
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:30,003
I know every map.

143
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,106
Every route. Two days' walk.

144
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,408
Impossible to stay
above The Line the whole time.

145
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:37,846
Hunter's machine.

146
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:42,049
The last filter burnt out.

147
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,519
The hospital in Boulder
will have a crate of 'em.

148
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:46,554
But if I don't go, Hunter dies.

149
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,962
The place was probably looted.

150
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,363
No one had time to loot.

151
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:58,465
You're gonna have to go
below The Line

152
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:59,567
at least a dozen times.

153
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,835
You can't survive a dozen

154
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:01,836
encounters with those things.

155
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,103
You survived.

156
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,305
That was luck.

157
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,842
Luck is not a strategy.

158
00:15:07,876 --> 00:15:09,476
Luck won't help you.

159
00:15:09,511 --> 00:15:11,211
You're the only person
who fought them and lived.

160
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,847
You've studied them for years.

161
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:14,682
-That'll help me.
-So what? "Do me a favor, Nina.

162
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:16,417
Let's go. Let's die together."

163
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,952
But last year, you thought
you found a way to kill them

164
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,355
if you could get back
to your old lab.

165
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,891
That's why Tara went with you.

166
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,559
I have a way to Boulder.

167
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:27,261
It's mapped out. We only go
below The Line twice.

168
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:29,229
Twice?

169
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,532
That's not possible.

170
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:31,866
It is.

171
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,066
Calway Mine.

172
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,269
It goes through the mountain.

173
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,604
A mine?

174
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:37,938
A fucking mine, Will?

175
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,340
That's your plan?

176
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:41,843
That's a death trap
by definition.

177
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,410
My company did a big job there.

178
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:45,379
I walked every inch.

179
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,448
I know those tunnels.

180
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:51,251
You don't know anything.

181
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:55,088
You're desperate.

182
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,057
Desperate people get killed.

183
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,225
8:00 a.m.

184
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,427
Cathedral Point Overlook.

185
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,095
Who says I'm going?

186
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,364
Everything you've done up here
since day one says that.

187
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:08,202
Shooting at that goddamn
Reaper scale every night.

188
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:10,471
All you think about
is killing one of these things,

189
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:13,273
and you need something
from down there to do it.

190
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,108
You owe me this much.

191
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,477
For Tara.

192
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:18,913
Will.

193
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:24,953
Boulder is 2,000 feet
below The Line.

194
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,420
Even if you make it there,

195
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:27,922
they'll be there waiting
for you.

196
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,191
It only takes one of them.

197
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,629
I know.

198
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:11,298
Nina.

199
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,133
Nina, it's getting closer.

200
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,103
Nina!

201
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,305
-It's coming this way!
-Stay to the right!

202
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,440
I can't hold my breath
any longer.

203
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:21,976
Shoot! Shoot!

204
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:25,547
-No, please.
-We're going down!

205
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,016
-Oh, God! Oh, God!
-Please.

206
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:32,020
I-I can't...

207
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,270
-Thanks.
-No problem.

208
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:55,543
I have to go tomorrow.

209
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:58,245
He's got four days,
five at the most.

210
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,681
I'll stay here with him.

211
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,524
Changed the zero to 200 yards,

212
00:18:09,557 --> 00:18:12,259
so you'll be able to engage 'em
from further out.

213
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,595
Oh.

214
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:16,363
AP rounds.

215
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,365
These are from
my own personal stash.

216
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,703
Slow 'em down a bit more
than a regular 556.

217
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:23,403
Good luck out there.

218
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,205
Thanks.

219
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:28,943
Were you planning
on telling me?

220
00:18:29,978 --> 00:18:31,546
Huh?

221
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,180
You just gonna run off
and get yourself killed

222
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,215
without saying a word,
like Tara?

223
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,722
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.

224
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:41,789
Yeah, it was.

225
00:18:41,823 --> 00:18:42,890
-Hey, Tim?
-Yeah.

226
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:44,191
My gear?

227
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,760
Katie, what are you doing?

228
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,595
-Going with you.
-No, you're not.

229
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,296
Not asking permission, Will.
You can't go out there alone.

230
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,065
You need a partner
to watch your back.

231
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,634
Right. Nina's going with me.

232
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,569
Oh, I'm definitely going now.

233
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:56,104
The town needs you up here.

234
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,705
And I need to see
what's down there.

235
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:00,041
Why? What's the point?

236
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:03,645
We're rats on a sinking ship,
and we need to find a way off.

237
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:06,080
No, we don't.
We can survive up here forever.

238
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:07,548
Everyone except Hunter.

239
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:09,784
I don't want to live
like this forever, Will.

240
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,485
And we both know
Hunter doesn't, either.

241
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,987
Well, it's not his decision
to make.

242
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:14,187
Not at eight years old.

243
00:19:15,823 --> 00:19:18,158
We're gonna have to fight them
eventually, Will.

244
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,829
It might as well be today.

245
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,076
We don't need your help.

246
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,778
You don't need anyone's help,
do you, Nina?

247
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:39,279
You ever seen one
coming for you?

248
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,050
Up close.

249
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:46,120
Not just a flickering light
in the distance.

250
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:49,824
The way they tear people apart.

251
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,027
Bullets bounce off them
like nothing.

252
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:55,096
Unless you hit them
square in the face,

253
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:57,065
and even then, it just gives
you a few seconds to run.

254
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:02,503
We're gonna die out there.

255
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,472
But you first.

256
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,299
I won't be gone long.

257
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,868
That's what Mom said.

258
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,235
I'm coming back.

259
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:38,338
Promise.

260
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,046
We hit Alta Vista Ski Area,

261
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,814
we might even use the ski lift.

262
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:48,149
With what power?

263
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:49,717
They have backup generators.

264
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:51,018
Which won't work

265
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:53,921
after sitting idle
for 992 days.

266
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,224
If the batteries aren't
drained, I'll get it running.

267
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,909
So, what's in Boulder, Nina?

268
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,644
My old lab.

269
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:20,548
I thought you were
a professor at Caltech.

270
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,784
Researcher.

271
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:25,452
Can't teach kids.
They're too stupid.

272
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:30,558
Caltech students
are too dumb for you?

273
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:32,827
So what's that make us, then?

274
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:37,464
Not Caltech students, Katie.

275
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:47,340
You could be nice.

276
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,977
At least try.

277
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,313
What's wrong
with not giving a shit?

278
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:01,923
How do we know there isn't one

279
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:04,391
hibernating down there?

280
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,794
I'm not picking anything up.

281
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:09,096
I guess that's not
a compass, is it?

282
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,631
No.

283
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,300
Did you find a way
to track 'em?

284
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,168
Uh, bioelectromagnetism.

285
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:16,270
They generate
their own magnetic fields.

286
00:22:16,304 --> 00:22:17,437
Stronger than ours.

287
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,773
Stronger than any animal
on Earth.

288
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:21,309
When they're within
a half mile,

289
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,877
the needle is drawn to them.

290
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:32,954
So, it's two miles
to the ski area?

291
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,488
One mile if we cut
through the forest.

292
00:22:48,636 --> 00:22:50,538
Nina, you're the expert.

293
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:55,676
Any idea why they don't go
above 8,000 feet?

294
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,378
Mostly, I'm just hoping
they don't change their minds.

295
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:03,117
Anything on that?

296
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,987
Nothing yet.
It's quiet for now.

297
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,359
Might be something
we could use.

298
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:01,008
All right.
Still clear on the tracker.

299
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:03,644
Needle moves, you say so.

300
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,293
Got some ammo here.

301
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,461
A few flares.

302
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:33,607
Jackpot.

303
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:39,947
-Huh?
-You know how to use that?

304
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:41,882
It's designed
for an 18-year-old

305
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,250
just out of basic training.

306
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:44,652
I'm pretty sure
I can figure it out.

307
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:46,287
No need.

308
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:50,658
-So you've done this before?
-I'm from Texas, Will.

309
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:51,959
Well, I'm from Louisiana.

310
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:53,394
It doesn't mean
my dad taught me

311
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:55,596
how to use a grenade launcher.

312
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:06,640
Nina! How's it going?

313
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:13,347
-Nina, can we please go?
-Will you two just shut up?

314
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:14,849
I'm looking at a Reaper scale.

315
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,689
If she wants to stay,
just let her.

316
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:25,326
Just let her.
We don't need her anyway.

317
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,996
Actually, you do. Unlike you,
I'm not dead weight.

318
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,532
Um, fuck you, Nina.

319
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:33,367
We both know who
you're trying to fuck, Katie,

320
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:34,835
and it's not me.

321
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,437
It's your best friend's
husband.

322
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,139
You know what?

323
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:40,007
Who you got killed.

324
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,809
Do you remember that?

325
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:44,478
Shit. Stop it.

326
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,782
You bitch.

327
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:52,686
I don't like you, Nina.

328
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,355
I never have.

329
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:00,494
I don't blame you, Katie.

330
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,035
I'm fine. I'm fine.

331
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:50,545
Where'd they all come from?

332
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,613
Three years without us.

333
00:27:29,183 --> 00:27:30,751
Hold up. I need a minute.

334
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:32,987
Top of the mountain's
8,000 feet.

335
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,156
Ten, 15-minute hike,
we're safe.

336
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:37,958
Or I can try to get
the chairlift working.

337
00:27:37,992 --> 00:27:39,660
We'd have to be
faster than that.

338
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:42,963
They're here.

339
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:50,337
Down there.

340
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:51,640
Run!

341
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:52,973
We'll never
make it to The Line.

342
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:54,475
-We have to!
-It's too far!

343
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:55,943
We have to try the lift.

344
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:57,011
What if the battery's dead?

345
00:27:57,044 --> 00:27:58,145
She's right!

346
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:03,050
-Cover me!
-Okay.

347
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,541
Come on, Will.

348
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:32,346
Come on, baby. Come on.

349
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,401
Oh, shit. Come on.

350
00:29:17,891 --> 00:29:19,226
Fuck.

351
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:25,299
Come on, come on.

352
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:50,090
Hit the switch!

353
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:12,313
Seventy-eight hundred feet.

354
00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:46,313
You have to jump!

355
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:52,886
Come on, Katie!

356
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:55,690
Go, go, go! Jump!

357
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:56,825
Come on!

358
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:08,335
Shit, I'm out.

359
00:31:11,372 --> 00:31:13,575
-Don't let go!
-I got you. I promise.

360
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:17,144
We're almost there.

361
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,619
Hang on!

362
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:26,153
Eight thousand!

363
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:27,354
We made it.

364
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:30,357
We made it. We made it.

365
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:50,043
Run! Run! Run!

366
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:57,685
Come on, Katie!

367
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:21,375
Y'all okay?

368
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,445
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

369
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,397
18-year-old, single malt.

370
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,076
Those grenades did nothing.

371
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:04,752
To one more night alive.

372
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,533
It is different.

373
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,604
Seeing them up close.

374
00:33:24,204 --> 00:33:27,307
We're not meant to share
the planet with those things.

375
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:32,614
Maybe the Jesus freaks
were right.

376
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:37,519
Maybe the Reapers are
judgment for mankind's sins.

377
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:39,621
For eating God's apple,
then clear-cutting

378
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:41,756
the Garden of Eden
with the knowledge it gave us.

379
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,925
I don't buy that.

380
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,860
So what do you buy?

381
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:50,230
They're Earth's
new apex predators.

382
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:52,967
And we're prey.

383
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,975
So how do we
take our place back?

384
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:08,181
They came out of nowhere,
all at once.

385
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:11,451
No one's had a chance
to study them.

386
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:12,854
You study something
long enough,

387
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:14,288
you can figure out
how to kill it.

388
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,223
If it doesn't kill you first.

389
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:23,397
A lot more of us are gonna die.

390
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,734
But one day,
we're gonna beat them.

391
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:35,242
Three years, day and night,
researching them.

392
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:37,745
Something had to stand out.

393
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:42,517
What they did when they
first came out of the ground.

394
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,084
Which was?

395
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:48,623
Wipe out 95% of the world's
population in a month.

396
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:51,593
They didn't stop
to eat or sleep.

397
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:52,927
They just didn't stop.

398
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:56,229
I don't follow.

399
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:00,068
Predators kill to eat.

400
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,869
The Reapers kill to kill.

401
00:35:01,903 --> 00:35:04,072
And they only killed us.

402
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,841
It's like it's all they wanted,
was just to get rid of us.

403
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:09,142
I don't think there's
some master plan, Nina.

404
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,746
Simply what you said.

405
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:13,715
They're predators
and we're prey.

406
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:16,050
I didn't say that. Katie did.

407
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:18,886
So what are you saying?

408
00:35:22,724 --> 00:35:24,993
Nothing. It's just a question.

409
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,795
But I want an answer.

410
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,835
What if Nina's right?

411
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,438
What if she has found
a way to kill those things?

412
00:36:11,471 --> 00:36:13,107
I don't believe her.

413
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:15,409
-Why not?
-She wants it too badly.

414
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:17,645
-What does that mean?
-You know what I mean.

415
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,647
If anyone could
figure it out, it's her.

416
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:21,082
She's a physicist.

417
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:22,650
Yeah, with a Messiah complex.

418
00:36:22,684 --> 00:36:24,652
Baby, that's all physicists.
They make a living

419
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:26,453
unlocking God's secrets.

420
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:29,256
I get it. You trust her.

421
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:31,159
But this is a suicide mission.

422
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:32,927
It's not your job
to save the world.

423
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,395
-What is my job?
-To stay alive.

424
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:39,199
You would have said something
different when we first met.

425
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:42,369
That's before you almost died
in childbirth

426
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:46,874
and we had a one-pound infant
clinging to life in the NICU.

427
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:48,341
This is for Hunter.

428
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,877
No, it's not.

429
00:36:49,911 --> 00:36:51,646
Not for Nina.

430
00:36:52,714 --> 00:36:54,314
This is about her wanting to be

431
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:55,850
the first person
to kill a Reaper.

432
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,118
And she'll die to do it.

433
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:58,786
She's not suicidal, Will.

434
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,322
She's after immortality.

435
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:04,458
Why can't you see that?

436
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:06,160
She doesn't have a family.

437
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:08,863
She's never had a family.
She ca--

438
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,572
It's just a matter of time
before he runs out of filters.

439
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:20,742
That's a year from now,
at least.

440
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:22,844
And the Reapers will
still be down there.

441
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:25,747
So what's the difference?

442
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:29,917
Another year together.

443
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:33,353
That's the difference.

444
00:38:05,086 --> 00:38:07,088
When we come out,
it'll be close to dark.

445
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:09,857
Can't hit the city at night.

446
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:11,726
There's a ranger station
on the other side.

447
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:14,695
We can stay there
until daybreak.

448
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:16,396
What's the plan in there?

449
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:17,932
This is level nine.

450
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,600
The ladder will take us down
to level eight.

451
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:22,537
We take eight
across the mountain, 2.2 miles.

452
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,240
We exit at 8,023 feet,
on the other side,

453
00:38:26,274 --> 00:38:29,076
12 miles west of Boulder.

454
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:32,113
Anything below level eight
is under The Line.

455
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,581
We exit at 8,023 feet?

456
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:34,849
That's right.

457
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,118
How exact is that?

458
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,421
Very.

459
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:43,490
How do you know these tunnels
are perfectly straight?

460
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:44,992
That they don't bow
somewhere in the middle?

461
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:46,426
That would take us
below The Line.

462
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,262
Or did you not think
about that?

463
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,467
-Oh, you son of a bitch.
-Easy.

464
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:56,604
We're going below The Line,
aren't we?

465
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:03,211
-Will?
-For how long?

466
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:07,081
231 yards.

467
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:09,317
What?

468
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:12,253
Both ends of the tunnel are
above 8,000 feet, so...

469
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:15,823
So, nothing! These tunnels
are not hermetically sealed.

470
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:17,291
How do you know
there aren't any fissures

471
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:19,026
that lead to the lower levels
of the mine?

472
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,095
You should have told us this
before we left the refuge.

473
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:22,697
It's 231 yards.

474
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,832
And besides,
your tracker will tell us

475
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:26,334
if one of them is
within a half a mile.

476
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:28,603
-No, it won't.
-It just did.

477
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:30,104
Above ground.

478
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:31,539
It's not gonna work
under a mile of rock.

479
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:34,175
It's 45 seconds.
Why are you so worried?

480
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,509
They come from
underground, Will.

481
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:37,545
They're built for it.
We're not.

482
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:39,347
They can see in the dark.

483
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,549
They detect the smallest amount
of CO2, which we exhale

484
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:43,351
and will build up
pretty fucking fast

485
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:44,585
inside a fucking mine.

486
00:39:45,653 --> 00:39:47,255
Fuck.

487
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:51,058
You swear a lot.

488
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:53,460
Fuck you, Katie.

489
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:55,897
-That's good.
-Let's go.

490
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:15,443
What's wrong?

491
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,245
See my earlier comment
about the tracker

492
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,281
not working
underneath a mountain.

493
00:41:53,981 --> 00:41:55,182
No.

494
00:41:56,217 --> 00:41:57,785
No.

495
00:41:57,818 --> 00:41:59,286
No, no, no, no, no.

496
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,022
No! No!

497
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:06,861
It's welded shut?

498
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:09,997
What now?

499
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:17,204
Climb down to level seven.

500
00:42:17,238 --> 00:42:18,973
That's below The Line, Will.

501
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:21,342
-Yeah.
-For how long?

502
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:25,046
About a thousand yards.

503
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,281
A thousand yards?

504
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:29,183
That's ten football fields.

505
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:30,885
I mean,
how-how steep are these cliffs

506
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:32,119
that we're trying to avoid?

507
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:34,021
They're impassable.

508
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:36,490
So either we climb down
or we go back.

509
00:42:36,525 --> 00:42:38,527
And I'm not going back.

510
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:04,852
Either of you guys afraid
of heights?

511
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:07,088
No, I'm afraid of monsters.

512
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:21,735
So, what do we do
when we get to the bottom?

513
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,671
-We just start sprinting?
-No, we can't sprint across.

514
00:43:23,704 --> 00:43:26,240
We'll just exhaust ourselves
and make too much noise.

515
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:28,409
Worse than that--
we'll quadruple our CO2 output,

516
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,778
which they can track
from a mile away.
That's what that light is

517
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:31,779
at the end of
the tentacles.

518
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:33,614
They track us
like giant mosquitoes.

519
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:36,183
Great.

520
00:43:36,217 --> 00:43:38,219
So, slow and steady.

521
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,389
-Are we ready?
-No.

522
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:44,792
Just need a minute
to ponder my own death.

523
00:43:48,762 --> 00:43:50,431
You're funnier than I realized.

524
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:51,866
Thanks.

525
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:53,934
You're smarter than I realized.

526
00:43:57,506 --> 00:43:59,707
So, where were you
when they showed up?

527
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,713
Well, the night
before the Reapers appeared...

528
00:44:07,448 --> 00:44:09,817
...my boyfriend and I
had gotten into an argument.

529
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:13,921
And he took a swing at me
and broke my nose.

530
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,222
-What?
-Yeah.

531
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:16,490
What'd you do?

532
00:44:16,525 --> 00:44:18,159
I hit him with a frying pan

533
00:44:18,192 --> 00:44:20,427
and stole his car
and drove it to Nederland.

534
00:44:20,461 --> 00:44:22,062
That's fair.

535
00:44:22,096 --> 00:44:25,166
Anyway, next morning,

536
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,901
I heard everything happening
over the radio,

537
00:44:26,934 --> 00:44:29,904
so I just went straight up
the fire road till the end

538
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:32,006
and found the refuge.

539
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:34,708
-Life's a bitch sometimes.
-Yep.

540
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,779
And then giant murder bugs
hatch from the ground,

541
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:41,583
and it's amazing how quick
nostalgia sets in.

542
00:44:41,616 --> 00:44:45,119
You should be
a motivational speaker.

543
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:48,856
Can we get down this ladder,
please?

544
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,431
This way.

545
00:46:00,227 --> 00:46:02,096
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

546
00:46:03,464 --> 00:46:05,700
I think there's
something back there.

547
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:07,935
I don't see anything.

548
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:09,970
I heard something.

549
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:13,774
-Or maybe I'm just being crazy.
-Wait.

550
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:16,910
-Cover your light.
-What?

551
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:18,779
Please do it.

552
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:30,759
Is that...?

553
00:46:34,228 --> 00:46:36,196
Move!

554
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:49,443
Duck!

555
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:09,263
Go, go, go, go!

556
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:18,972
Oh, shit.

557
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:21,543
Will! Will! In here!

558
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:25,913
It ends.

559
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:27,147
Go, go, go!

560
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:29,350
Will, it's a dead end. Shit.

561
00:47:35,557 --> 00:47:37,324
Over here! Come on!

562
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:39,426
Turn off your headlamps.

563
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,028
They can still track us
through the CO2.

564
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:43,263
-So what do we do?
-Don't breathe.

565
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,747
-There's a way out!
-Go, go, go!

566
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,649
Go, go, go, go, go!

567
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:13,287
Hurry!

568
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:18,425
Go!

569
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:24,097
Will!

570
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,935
Will, Will, Will, come on.

571
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,235
Come on.

572
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:30,939
-Come on!
-Come on, run!

573
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:33,207
Katie, wait for us! Katie!

574
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,242
There's an exit!

575
00:49:36,276 --> 00:49:38,145
Katie!

576
00:49:38,178 --> 00:49:39,781
Katie!

577
00:49:53,494 --> 00:49:54,796
Katie, no!

578
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:57,264
Will!

579
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:05,607
No.

580
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:13,280
She's gone.

581
00:50:14,516 --> 00:50:16,149
She's gone.

582
00:50:17,952 --> 00:50:19,587
Oh, my God.

583
00:50:19,621 --> 00:50:21,923
It led right back into
the tunnel we came through.

584
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:25,960
What was she thinking?

585
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:29,631
It's coming back.

586
00:50:29,664 --> 00:50:31,699
What's that?

587
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:33,333
What?

588
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,642
Oh, my God. It's a ladder.

589
00:50:46,681 --> 00:50:48,215
Will, come on!

590
00:51:34,127 --> 00:51:36,030
Katie.

591
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:42,436
You still believe in God?

592
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:44,137
I'm stubborn.

593
00:51:46,574 --> 00:51:48,408
What'd you ask for?

594
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:53,380
Revenge.

595
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:28,042
Looks okay.
You think it'll start?

596
00:53:28,076 --> 00:53:30,545
If there's a fresh battery
inside.

597
00:53:30,578 --> 00:53:34,515
Tires are kind of ratty,
but it'll do.

598
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:27,602
I must have made
a thousand boxes of this stuff.

599
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:31,873
Every night,
Tara would ask Hunter

600
00:54:31,906 --> 00:54:35,209
what did he want for dinner,
and every night--

601
00:54:35,243 --> 00:54:36,744
mac and cheese.

602
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:40,748
It's the casein,
the milk protein in cheese.

603
00:54:40,782 --> 00:54:43,151
It's like an opioid,
as addictive as morphine.

604
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:51,159
Sorry.

605
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:04,337
I really liked Tara.

606
00:55:07,842 --> 00:55:10,410
Seems like that was the
last person you liked, Nina.

607
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:17,251
Katie grew on me.

608
00:55:17,285 --> 00:55:19,654
Guess I got her killed, too.

609
00:55:21,756 --> 00:55:24,959
I should have never
brought us in those mines.

610
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,627
Would have been easier
scaling the mountain

611
00:55:26,661 --> 00:55:29,163
with no equipment.

612
00:55:29,197 --> 00:55:31,431
You want to make
her death matter?

613
00:55:31,464 --> 00:55:32,633
Don't feel guilt.

614
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:34,669
Feel anger.

615
00:55:36,704 --> 00:55:39,173
I don't feel anything anymore.

616
00:55:39,207 --> 00:55:40,608
That's too bad.

617
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,143
Anger's a terrible thing
to waste.

618
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:44,145
You would know.

619
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:46,446
So would you.

620
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,419
I don't hate you, Nina.

621
00:55:52,452 --> 00:55:54,155
Yeah, you do.

622
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:55,957
I would.

623
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:02,663
What's in your old lab?

624
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:08,435
Periclase.

625
00:56:08,468 --> 00:56:10,638
Cubic version
of magnesium oxide.

626
00:56:10,671 --> 00:56:12,240
Okay.

627
00:56:13,975 --> 00:56:16,510
The Reapers' scales--
they're impenetrable.

628
00:56:16,544 --> 00:56:18,880
I think it's because
they're electrically charged.

629
00:56:18,913 --> 00:56:20,882
A defense mechanism, I think.

630
00:56:20,915 --> 00:56:22,250
You think?

631
00:56:24,352 --> 00:56:27,121
If I'm right,
a projectile, a bullet,

632
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:29,323
bonded with periclase,
it hits them,

633
00:56:29,357 --> 00:56:31,659
and theoretically,
it creates a momentary

634
00:56:31,692 --> 00:56:34,394
million-volt differential,
and boom.

635
00:56:34,427 --> 00:56:36,496
Uncontrollable
internal combustion.

636
00:56:37,732 --> 00:56:39,967
A magic bullet?

637
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:42,169
That's what you've been
working on all this time?

638
00:56:42,203 --> 00:56:44,538
Literally a magic bullet?

639
00:56:44,572 --> 00:56:46,340
It's not magic. It's science.

640
00:56:46,374 --> 00:56:48,809
-It's a guess.
-It's a hypothesis.

641
00:56:48,843 --> 00:56:51,579
With a healthy dose
of wishful thinking.

642
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,718
Tara believed me.

643
00:57:01,289 --> 00:57:03,925
Tara would believe anything
she thought could save Hunter.

644
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:06,928
You knew that,

645
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:09,096
talked her into going
and got them all killed.

646
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:13,301
My wife, our friends.

647
00:57:14,802 --> 00:57:16,637
I told her not to go.

648
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:20,641
I told her
listening to you was suicide.

649
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,616
And yet, here you are.

650
00:57:28,649 --> 00:57:31,786
With me,
standing on that same ledge.

651
00:58:00,114 --> 00:58:01,749
Here we go.

652
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:19,994
Jesus.

653
00:59:21,328 --> 00:59:22,897
Fifth floor.

654
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:38,079
This way.

655
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,914
Don't look.

656
01:00:13,948 --> 01:00:15,816
I have to.

657
01:00:42,143 --> 01:00:43,578
Where are they?

658
01:00:43,612 --> 01:00:45,312
There should be cases
of 'em in here.

659
01:00:47,648 --> 01:00:50,217
-Was that...?
-Can't tell.

660
01:00:50,251 --> 01:00:52,086
Nothing on the tracker.

661
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:55,990
Where else could they be?

662
01:00:56,023 --> 01:00:58,025
Uh, the OR.

663
01:01:00,361 --> 01:01:02,496
That's one, no question.

664
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:21,949
Here.

665
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,693
-Come on, Will, we got to go.
-I know.

666
01:01:34,728 --> 01:01:36,797
Shit. It's close.

667
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:38,399
I'm looking. I'm looking.

668
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:42,937
I got 'em!

669
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,606
All right, come on.

670
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,641
Come on, come on, come on!

671
01:01:47,676 --> 01:01:49,076
Okay.

672
01:02:07,596 --> 01:02:09,196
Come on.

673
01:02:14,268 --> 01:02:16,870
Jesus fucking Christ!

674
01:02:42,029 --> 01:02:43,732
Holy fuck!

675
01:02:52,707 --> 01:02:54,542
Go. Go.

676
01:02:57,778 --> 01:02:59,614
Here! In here.

677
01:03:04,084 --> 01:03:06,954
-Now we're trapped.
-No, we're not.

678
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,470
Stairs.

679
01:03:23,505 --> 01:03:25,774
-What are you doing?
-I'm right behind you.

680
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,861
I thought I told you to run.

681
01:04:20,894 --> 01:04:22,896
And I didn't listen.

682
01:04:29,136 --> 01:04:30,871
Is it dead?

683
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:34,007
It's not moving.

684
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,150
Yeah, but...

685
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:45,720
Right. We should
get the hell out of here.

686
01:04:46,855 --> 01:04:48,222
The lab is close.

687
01:04:48,255 --> 01:04:50,224
-There's no time.
-I still need periclase.

688
01:04:50,257 --> 01:04:52,259
-The magnesium oxide.
-I have Hunter to think about.

689
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:53,828
This is about more
than just your son.

690
01:04:53,862 --> 01:04:55,396
There's no such thing
as more than my son.

691
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:57,164
How much time
did you just buy yourself?

692
01:04:57,197 --> 01:04:59,667
Six months? A year? Then you're
right back here again.

693
01:04:59,701 --> 01:05:01,669
Or we can prove
that they can be killed,

694
01:05:01,703 --> 01:05:03,671
and when we fly that flag
over the refuge,

695
01:05:03,705 --> 01:05:06,306
everyone else stuck on those
mountaintops will know it.

696
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,710
The whole world will come
and fight with us.

697
01:05:08,743 --> 01:05:11,513
The odds may be stacked
against us, but I'm with Katie.

698
01:05:11,546 --> 01:05:13,515
We can't live like this
forever.

699
01:05:13,548 --> 01:05:15,550
Sooner or later,
we have to fight them.

700
01:05:16,718 --> 01:05:18,753
But I need your help.

701
01:05:18,787 --> 01:05:20,789
I can't do this alone.

702
01:05:23,691 --> 01:05:26,026
Shit.

703
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:27,461
Let's go.

704
01:06:27,988 --> 01:06:29,990
Scale.

705
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,042
Nothing on the tracker.

706
01:06:50,043 --> 01:06:52,179
I'm gonna need five minutes.

707
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:53,848
I'll keep watch.

708
01:07:07,361 --> 01:07:09,029
Thank God.

709
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,569
I never knew you had a family.

710
01:07:51,706 --> 01:07:53,708
Well, I did.

711
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:56,711
You never said a word.

712
01:07:56,744 --> 01:07:58,513
No.

713
01:08:06,054 --> 01:08:07,354
Let's let this dry,
see what happens.

714
01:08:07,387 --> 01:08:09,189
Gonna take a few minutes.

715
01:08:09,222 --> 01:08:11,793
Figured you might want this.

716
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:37,986
I was here when it happened.

717
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,255
It was a Saturday, but...

718
01:08:42,289 --> 01:08:45,026
but my team was close
to a breakthrough,

719
01:08:45,059 --> 01:08:47,528
using cobalt to increase
the electron flow in batteries.

720
01:08:47,562 --> 01:08:49,329
Makes 'em
three times more efficient.

721
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,303
That's what I was thinking
about when the world ended.

722
01:08:58,106 --> 01:08:59,841
Batteries.

723
01:09:05,145 --> 01:09:08,116
Billy, my seven-year-old,
had a soccer game that day.

724
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:09,917
You ever seen kids that age
play soccer?

725
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:12,285
How they all just converge
on the ball at once?

726
01:09:18,693 --> 01:09:21,763
The worst part is,
I chose not to go to that game.

727
01:09:30,104 --> 01:09:32,674
My husband had
been traveling for two weeks,

728
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:35,143
and he came back.

729
01:09:35,175 --> 01:09:37,177
I was...

730
01:09:40,682 --> 01:09:43,216
I was tired of being a mom.

731
01:09:44,384 --> 01:09:47,021
But there's nothing
you could have done.

732
01:09:47,055 --> 01:09:50,058
I could have held him
in my arms one last time.

733
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:03,671
I'm sure you've had
the same thought about Tara.

734
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:12,146
I never should have
encouraged her to come with me.

735
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,715
I was overconfident.

736
01:10:13,748 --> 01:10:15,783
I thought I'd figured out a way
to hold them off,

737
01:10:15,817 --> 01:10:17,785
and I was wrong.

738
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:19,453
If it's any consolation,
I hate myself more

739
01:10:19,486 --> 01:10:22,090
than you could possibly
hate me.

740
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:28,162
I only blame you because it's
easier than blaming myself.

741
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:32,533
I knew she was going to go,

742
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:34,569
even after I tried to stop her.

743
01:10:36,269 --> 01:10:38,206
And I let it happen.

744
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:39,640
You can't blame yourself.

745
01:10:39,674 --> 01:10:41,676
Neither of us can.

746
01:10:42,677 --> 01:10:44,912
What's the point?

747
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:53,420
All right.

748
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:15,610
You tried, Nina.

749
01:11:15,643 --> 01:11:18,546
You did everything you could.

750
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:20,014
Go home, Will.

751
01:11:20,047 --> 01:11:22,449
Go save your son.

752
01:11:22,482 --> 01:11:24,252
He's running out of time.

753
01:11:25,253 --> 01:11:27,420
-What about you?
-I'm gonna stay.

754
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:29,389
There are other things
I can try.

755
01:11:29,422 --> 01:11:31,526
Look, I'm not leaving you here.
We're in this together.

756
01:11:31,559 --> 01:11:33,127
And you got me here.

757
01:11:33,161 --> 01:11:34,729
But it didn't work,
and I'm not leaving

758
01:11:34,762 --> 01:11:36,564
until it does
or until they kill me first.

759
01:11:36,597 --> 01:11:38,298
-Nina...
-Look,

760
01:11:38,331 --> 01:11:40,201
my car is still
in the lot outside.

761
01:11:40,234 --> 01:11:43,538
If I get this right, I won't
need your help to get back.

762
01:11:43,571 --> 01:11:46,240
I'll be on the road
right behind you.

763
01:11:46,274 --> 01:11:49,577
If I don't...

764
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:51,679
there's no point
in you dying here with me.

765
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:55,482
Go.

766
01:11:56,818 --> 01:11:58,485
Go be with Hunter.

767
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:51,959
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

768
01:15:17,151 --> 01:15:18,552
Shit.

769
01:16:28,956 --> 01:16:31,459
Oh, shit.

770
01:16:41,035 --> 01:16:43,104
Oh, shit.

771
01:17:42,863 --> 01:17:45,499
Son of a bitch.

772
01:18:04,785 --> 01:18:06,521
They're machines.

773
01:18:08,489 --> 01:18:10,659
They hunt us,
but they don't eat us.

774
01:18:10,691 --> 01:18:13,093
They don't sleep.
They don't breathe.

775
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:15,796
They don't go an inch
above 8,000 feet.

776
01:18:15,829 --> 01:18:17,632
That's not a living creature.

777
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:19,900
That's programming.

778
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:22,803
By who?

779
01:18:34,683 --> 01:18:36,585
Good shot.

780
01:18:37,652 --> 01:18:39,220
Thanks.

781
01:18:45,025 --> 01:18:47,228
Why 8,000 feet?

782
01:18:47,261 --> 01:18:49,029
I have no idea.

783
01:18:59,006 --> 01:19:01,008
Is your car still running?

784
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:03,043
Radiator blew half a mile back.

785
01:19:04,512 --> 01:19:07,314
God, it felt amazing
to kill those fuckers.

786
01:19:07,348 --> 01:19:09,850
Going to feel even better
when you raise that pirate flag

787
01:19:09,883 --> 01:19:12,419
and tell the world
we have a way to beat 'em.

788
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:34,643
Dad!

789
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:40,447
Told you I was coming back.

790
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:42,316
I missed you so much.

791
01:19:52,661 --> 01:19:53,994
Come on.

792
01:20:15,983 --> 01:20:17,885
Oh, you see it? They did it!

793
01:20:25,794 --> 01:20:27,361
Crow's Nest, this is Red Rock.

794
01:20:27,394 --> 01:20:28,797
Are you seeing
what we're seeing?

795
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:30,164
We have line of sight...

796
01:20:30,197 --> 01:20:32,066
Yes. Confirmed.

797
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:33,601
-We have clear line of sight.
-Copy that. This is...

798
01:20:33,635 --> 01:20:35,670
This is Lost Gulch Refuge.

799
01:20:38,205 --> 01:20:40,742
Three years ago,

800
01:20:40,775 --> 01:20:43,477
the world we knew
disappeared overnight.

801
01:20:46,614 --> 01:20:49,584
We lost our homes,

802
01:20:49,617 --> 01:20:52,353
our communities

803
01:20:52,386 --> 01:20:54,855
and most of the people
we loved.

804
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:03,297
We still don't know why
above 8,000 feet we were safe.

805
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,570
But we don't have to play
by those rules anymore.

806
01:21:14,174 --> 01:21:16,578
The Reapers tried
to take our planet.

807
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:22,082
They thought we'd die up here
in these mountains.

808
01:21:30,725 --> 01:21:34,596
Well, we're still here.

809
01:21:57,351 --> 01:22:00,622
Sooner or later,
we had to fight them.

810
01:22:03,924 --> 01:22:06,026
Might as well be today.
