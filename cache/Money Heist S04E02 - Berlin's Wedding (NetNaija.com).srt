1
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,875
<i>There are always happier days to remember.</i>

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,500
<i>The more fucked you are,</i>
<i>the happier those days seem to be.</i>

3
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>While hoping for a miracle</i>

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,208
<i>and hearing the beep</i>
<i>of Nairobi's vital signs,</i>

5
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:35,541
<i>I remembered those days,</i>
<i>like the soccer match at the monastery.</i>

6
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,416
-Keep up the defense. One minute left.
-Come on.

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,416
-Hey!
-Come on.

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,458
Go.

9
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,000
Take this.

10
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:47,500
<i>I never imagined the seconds before</i>
<i>a corner kick could be so much fun.</i>

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,166
Hey!

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,833
Ref, he touched my balls!

13
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,000
You saw that.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Please! Enough. There's a minute left.
Are you going to waste it arguing?

15
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,083
I was defending. He was glued to my ass!

16
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,375
I saw you touching his balls, pig.

17
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,833
That's enough!
Don't touch him again... anywhere, OK?

18
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,833
-Or you'll be sent off.
-OK, go.

19
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:07,750
Come on, go!

20
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,833
It's a goal!

21
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,250
Penalty!

22
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,250
-Let's see what happens.
-There's gonna be a fight.

23
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,375
There we go!

24
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,916
Penalty and a red card. Get out of here!

25
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,041
-Tokyo!
-Go.

26
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,750
<i>-There's no signal. Everything's down.</i>
<i>-What do we do?</i>

27
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,375
<i>-We're losing her.</i>
<i>-No, fuck!</i>

28
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,416
Carefully.

29
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,208
Slowly.

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,833
OK, I have it.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,250
A little bit higher.

32
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,916
You're doing really well.

33
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,250
Now remove the bullet.

34
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,708
Go on.

35
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,416
That's it.

36
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,250
Good.

37
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,958
Be careful. That's it.

38
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,875
There it is.

39
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,125
<i>That is nostalgia:</i>

40
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:57,416
<i>finding out that past events</i>
<i>you hadn't even imagined were happiness</i>

41
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:58,916
<i>actually were.</i>

42
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,375
Yeah!

43
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,750
<i>We hadn't even</i>
<i>reached the end of the first half,</i>

44
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:23,208
<i>and Lisbon was 3 kilometers from the tent</i>
<i>and forced to switch jerseys.</i>

45
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,416
<i>Goal by Sierra into the top corner.</i>

46
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,416
<i>Meanwhile, like robots,</i>

47
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,291
<i>we removed a piece of Nairobi's lung.</i>

48
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,666
<i>We didn't know</i>
<i>if we were saving her life</i>

49
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,208
<i>or finishing her off.</i>

50
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,250
<i>A second teammate down.</i>

51
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,916
<i>And a second goal against us.</i>

52
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,958
<i>And the third was yet to come,</i>
<i>from Palermo.</i>

53
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,000
<i>But it'd be on our side.</i>

54
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,083
<i>He had been a good captain.</i>

55
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,375
<i>But he was an awful team player.</i>

56
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,458
<i>The only thing resembling the plan</i>
<i>was the Professor's arrival in Madrid.</i>

57
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:34,500
<i>But not even that was right.</i>
<i>A rider was missing.</i>

58
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,750
Professor...

59
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,375
we have to go.

60
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,708
<i>By motorbike and along forest trails,</i>
<i>dirt roads, and cattle routes,</i>

61
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,333
<i>they crossed La Mancha,</i>
<i>avoiding checkpoints.</i>

62
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,875
<i>The knight and his squire,</i>

63
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:04,583
<i>defeat after defeat, advancing towards</i>
<i>a battle of fools in this unwinnable war.</i>

64
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,958
<i>Meanwhile, everything</i>
<i>was about to explode.</i>

65
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,333
{\an8}Can you believe this?

66
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:37,166
{\an8}Me, pregnant.

67
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,500
{\an8}Who would have thought?

68
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,583
{\an8}Congratulations.

69
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,791
{\an8}Thank you.

70
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,750
{\an8}Seriously...

71
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,083
{\an8}you're very brave, you know?

72
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,875
{\an8}I did what I had to.

73
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,958
{\an8}Unless we make a stand,
they'll trample us like in Auschwitz.

74
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,041
{\an8}If it stings too much, tell me.

75
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,833
{\an8}Go ahead, put alcohol on it.
I can handle pain. I'm used to it.

76
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,041
{\an8}Let's see...

77
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,250
{\an8}Keep going.

78
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:44,500
Have you lost your mind?
You beat the crap out of him.

79
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:48,291
-You can't lose it like that!
-How can I not? This is a pressure cooker.

80
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,291
Exactly!

81
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:53,541
That's why you can't come to blows
with people, like a spoiled brat!

82
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,791
You have blood... Your top's...

83
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,500
Don't worry about me.
I can't see with this eye.

84
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,166
Listen, Amanda...

85
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,125
have you had any anxiety attacks
because of the heist?

86
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,208
-Well... I think so.
-I see.

87
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,583
And I can't sleep
for more than 30 minutes straight.

88
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,416
Because I have a knot right here, and I...

89
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,083
That's normal in these cases.

90
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,250
There's a lot of tension.

91
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:42,791
A lot of tension. But don't worry,
I'll get you some sedatives.

92
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:49,500
We don't want you getting PTSD,
because it's so hard to get over.

93
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,166
In fact, sometimes...

94
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,083
it lasts forever.

95
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,208
Let me help you. You have some blood here.

96
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't worry, while I'm around...
you'll have everything you need.

97
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,541
You'll be my personal project.

98
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:18,083
We're holding up the Bank of Spain.
Maybe you've forgotten, but I haven't.

99
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,250
-We never acted like dicks before.
-Maybe I'm traumatized.

100
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,125
Maybe that's what's up.
We're all traumatized.

101
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,666
What the fuck do you mean?
What's my trauma?

102
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,500
-I'm not--
-Tell me.

103
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,791
You broke up with Tokyo.

104
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,166
How many guys do you know
who would leave Tokyo?

105
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,833
None, because you don't leave Tokyo.

106
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,083
What do you know about Tokyo?

107
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,083
Tokyo is a fucking Maserati.
Everyone wants one.

108
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,958
If you leave one in the street

109
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,625
with the doors open and keys in it,
you've gotta be fucked up.

110
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,625
Look, Rio. I'm gonna make this very clear:

111
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
maybe your trauma comes
from them affecting your manhood.

112
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,125
Maybe they pushed you too far...
with the torture.

113
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:08,041
You need to let it out.
That's why you left Tokyo, isn't it?

114
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,333
If one person did it or if it was a group,
the trauma it causes is different.

115
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:13,416
Let it out!

116
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,583
You can count on me...
for whatever you need.

117
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,208
Anything.

118
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,583
Ladies and gentlemen...

119
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,833
I regret to inform you
that I must say goodbye.

120
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,041
I'm leaving.

121
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:49,916
-Keep up the good spirits.
-What the fuck are you doing?

122
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,208
Matías...

123
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,500
I'm leaving.

124
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,708
Pleasure working with you, as always.

125
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,625
I would even say...

126
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,916
that I love you a lot, Matías.

127
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,291
As for all of you...

128
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,291
I hope my leadership
hasn't been too traumatic.

129
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:15,583
You can tell your grandchildren
and loved ones this story. Anyway...

130
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,666
Ladies and gentlemen,

131
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,416
it's been a pleasure.

132
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,791
What the...?

133
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,041
Calm down.

134
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,625
Palermo, calm down.

135
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,625
Let's talk... calmly.

136
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,333
But you're not leaving.

137
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,666
Fucking hell!

138
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,875
You staged a coup d'état, you bitch!
What did you expect?

139
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,458
I'm in charge of the military side,
you're in charge of the technical.

140
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,708
The technical side?

141
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,375
Do I look like
some nerdy engineer with glasses?

142
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,916
What sort of orders would I give?

143
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,500
Now melt, now don't!

144
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,041
Bathyscaphe out! Bathyscaphe in!
Immersion! Emersion!

145
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,708
Who the fuck do you think I am?

146
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,333
I didn't come here for this shit!
This is beneath me. I'm off.

147
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:32,458
I'm activating the manual door,
and I'm doing you a favor.

148
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,875
Because if I stay,
I'll shoot the shit out of you

149
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,416
and the rest of them.

150
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,375
I'm not on your side anymore.

151
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:56,500
It's me who's doing you a favor.
Because I swear, the next thing I'll do...

152
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,958
is kill you.

153
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,583
I don't think so.

154
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,833
I think so.

155
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,708
Claymore mines...

156
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,458
which, as you can see...

157
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,208
are pointing towards you.

158
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,125
They won't get me.

159
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,458
You know I have no qualms
about killing you.

160
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,375
Easy.

161
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,416
You can't betray us like this.

162
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,333
Do you want to bet?

163
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,541
Palermo! Don't move!

164
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,500
Oh, good.

165
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:42,583
The mad princess came
to wave her prince goodbye at the station.

166
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,500
Have some dignity!

167
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,166
Where are you going? To prison?

168
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,583
To be shot in the forehead?

169
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,583
To sell us out?

170
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,208
I won't sell anyone out.

171
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,583
I have a safeguard: state secrets.

172
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,291
I won't betray you.

173
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,791
Leaving is betrayal.

174
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,291
Leaving us alone here is betrayal.

175
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,208
Don't...

176
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,708
move, I don't want to kill you, big man.

177
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,458
You don't want to kill me?

178
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,750
You'll have to kill me.

179
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,875
What you're doing is crazy, Helsinki.

180
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,416
If you leave, Palermo...

181
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,791
I swear...

182
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,750
I'll go boom...

183
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,166
boom... ciao.

184
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:38,333
I'm serious, Palermo. I will.

185
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,208
Seriously.

186
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,666
I got you.

187
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,916
What the hell did you say to Rio?

188
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,541
-About what?
-You told him he's traumatized.

189
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,416
Call it what you like,
but something's up.

190
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,750
Something's up?
Because he left Tokyo?

191
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,375
-Because she's a... Maserati.
-Look...

192
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,833
The Maserati thing is the way guys talk.

193
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,416
What I'm saying is
something happened during the torture.

194
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,041
-They pushed him too far.
-They did what?

195
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,666
Forty sweaty guys opened his back door.

196
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,458
In his back door.

197
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,458
Rio was tortured,
and you go and give him all that shit.

198
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,250
It's true.
I asked if they crossed the line.

199
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:51,375
Know what? He went quiet
because he can't face it. A textbook case.

200
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,291
No.

201
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,000
I can't.

202
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,291
You can't what?

203
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,916
You know? All of a sudden I feel...

204
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,750
-as if the bubble has burst.
-What bubble?

205
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:05,833
What bubble?

206
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:10,125
No, I want to know
what bubble we're talking about.

207
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,333
What bubble?

208
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,166
It's as if a blindfold
has fallen from my eyes.

209
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,125
I don't recognize you.

210
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:25,250
I don't know what we're doing together.
I don't know who you are.

211
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,833
Mónica... don't get me wrong.

212
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,166
Tokyo may be a Maserati,
but it doesn't mean you're a 600.

213
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,625
I'm sorry, Denver.

214
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,833
I can't stay with you.

215
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,458
Right.

216
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:03,416
When you see her coming at you,
angry like a hydra, shut up.

217
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:09,083
A hydra... A... Never mind.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.

218
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,166
-And not defend myself?
-No.

219
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,041
Because you don't even know
why she's angry.

220
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,791
You, hush.

221
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,125
The less you know
what she's talking about,

222
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:19,250
the sorrier you are.

223
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,500
You say, "Yes, sorry, darling"
to everything.

224
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,375
Now, that is a textbook case.

225
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,958
-From a textbook for the henpecked.
-No, for survivors.

226
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,875
You wait for the storm to pass.

227
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,875
When you work out
which way the wind is blowing,

228
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:36,583
and when she has calmed down,

229
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,833
then, and only then...

230
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,666
you make your move.

231
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,541
Didn't you see me before?

232
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,625
We've had problems since the monastery.
That's what's going on.

233
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,416
-Well...
-This has been building up.

234
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,041
And with all this pressure,
it all comes out.

235
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,958
That's what's up.

236
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:18,625
<i>Professor.</i>

237
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,375
<i>It's Tokyo.</i>

238
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,416
-You just staged a coup d'état.
-<i>Palermo's gone crazy.</i>

239
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,000
He almost blew up the lobby.

240
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,916
-<i>But we've got it under control.</i>
-You don't.

241
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,500
You can't control him. He's unpredictable.

242
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,666
He's tied up and under surveillance 24/7.

243
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,083
Tokyo, the plan is falling to pieces!

244
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,416
I'm still here, Professor.

245
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,125
So what?

246
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,833
<i>Without Palermo,</i>
<i>we can't get the gold out.</i>

247
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,541
<i>Do you know how to do it?</i>

248
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,208
And without Nairobi!

249
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,125
And without Lisbon!

250
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,041
<i>Palermo was leaving</i>
<i>because it's the only smart thing to do.</i>

251
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,208
Professor...

252
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,041
<i>you've been my guardian angel.</i>

253
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,583
Now it's my turn.

254
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,041
How did it happen?

255
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,625
She died to protect me.

256
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,666
I'm really sorry.

257
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,208
<i>I...</i>

258
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:41,125
was camouflaged
in a tree, and there were...

259
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,250
soldiers and police officers everywhere.

260
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,916
<i>She was on a farm.</i>
<i>That's where they found her.</i>

261
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,625
<i>They made her kneel down, unarmed,</i>
<i>and they asked her about me.</i>

262
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,291
<i>I ran and ran.</i>

263
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,583
They asked her, "Where's the Professor?"

264
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,666
I said, "Tell them, Raquel.

265
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,583
Tell them where I am,
tell them I'll surrender, please."

266
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,333
<i>"I don't know."</i>

267
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,291
<i>She repeated, "I don't know."</i>

268
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,208
<i>And they shot her twice.</i>

269
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,250
She was unarmed,
and they shot her twice.

270
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,875
I didn't make it in time.

271
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:41,875
<i>Did you see it?</i>

272
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:44,833
You only heard it?

273
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,791
Professor,
did you see them moving her body?

274
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,208
I had to run.

275
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,041
<i>Listen to me.</i>

276
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,375
I also heard
my mother tell me to come home,

277
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,333
<i>that I'd be safer there.</i>

278
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,000
<i>But 20 cops</i>
<i>were waiting in her kitchen.</i>

279
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:06,541
And in the tent,
they also heard us fleeing from the bank,

280
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,958
<i>but we're still here.</i>

281
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,166
<i>The only one who left</i>
<i>was a ferret with a hood.</i>

282
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,791
<i>Is there anything in the news?</i>

283
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,250
Nothing.

284
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,041
The same as with Rio.

285
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,375
If they'd killed her, we'd know.

286
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,541
She's being interrogated.

287
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,000
-Where are you going?
-The Bank of Spain.

288
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,666
It's not a good idea. It's too risky.

289
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,250
I appreciate your concern,

290
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,791
but it's the only place I can find out
if my partner's alive. Move.

291
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,375
-No.
-I'm asking you.

292
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,250
-No, Professor.
-Move.

293
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:54,791
I won't let you get on the motorbike.

294
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,458
Seventy.

295
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:14,041
With what we have in those reports,
you'll be 70 when you're released.

296
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,375
Paula will be 40.

297
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:21,083
And your mother will be so long dead,
she'll be bones in a grave.

298
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,125
Stop, you don't need to go on.

299
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,875
The recommended sentence
depends on the prosecutor, not you.

300
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:29,291
And the final decision, on the judge.

301
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,875
But you know full well

302
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,750
that the prosecutor and the judge

303
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,875
work with what I write in these reports.

304
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,458
And I can write whatever I want.

305
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,708
What do you want me to write?

306
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,791
You're going to make me
resort to violence.

307
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,416
-I'm protecting the plan.
-It's my plan.

308
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,125
This isn't the plan. It's improvisation.

309
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,208
You always say, "No improvising."

310
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,041
I won't give in.

311
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,291
You need to understand

312
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,166
that that's the only place
I can get answers.

313
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,416
In the Bank of--

314
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,125
Very well.

315
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,625
Seriously, Professor?

316
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,708
I don't know where the Professor is,
or what he'll do.

317
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,333
Can't you think?

318
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,458
Has love clouded your mind?

319
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,750
The plan includes this kind of firewall.

320
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,750
It's nothing to do with love.

321
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,166
Of course it is.

322
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,333
But just think,
in prison, love drains away like water.

323
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:40,750
<i>It disappears fast.</i>
<i>In two months, it's all dried up.</i>

324
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,375
<i>Two months of suffering</i>
<i>or a life in prison?</i>

325
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,250
Even if you were reincarnated seven times,

326
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,333
you still wouldn't understand
our love.

327
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:52,791
To protect the plan,

328
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:55,500
we need to see
if she's being interrogated there.

329
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:58,041
If so, it'll be Alicia Sierra doing it,

330
00:24:58,125 --> 00:25:01,000
and she'll be at the Bank of Spain.

331
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,208
But you can't go!

332
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,291
Let me tell you
about the nature of your love.

333
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,916
One in jail in Soto del Real,
the other in Cádiz,

334
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
waiting for a yearly conjugal visit.

335
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:15,708
That's if you're lucky.
Because if we don't catch your lover,

336
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:18,416
<i>you won't ever fucking see him again.</i>

337
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,333
Choose between that or getting out in time
to be a mother to your daughter.

338
00:25:23,416 --> 00:25:26,250
You're trying
to emotionally manipulate me.

339
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm just speaking the truth.

340
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,083
As always.

341
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,416
To protect the plan, we must go.

342
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,375
How will you go to the tent
if your face is all over the news?

343
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,416
Like everyone else.

344
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,666
In a red jumpsuit and a Dalí mask.

345
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:46,000
Oh, good.

346
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,541
She won't betray us.

347
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,750
Give me your hand.

348
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:55,791
Give me your hand.

349
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:02,291
How many times have you thought
you'd fallen in love before?

350
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:10,291
The same will happen this time,
and you know it.

351
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,208
Everyone is capable of betrayal,
Marseille.

352
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,708
You only have to know--

353
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,791
That was quite a punch--
I thought we were finished.

354
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,166
Were we?

355
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,000
I didn't know.

356
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,625
-Have some more to drink.
-I've had two.

357
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,958
You look so serious.

358
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,208
This is a weird wedding, Andrés.

359
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:24,541
It's a great party!

360
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,875
-Brother!
-I feel bad for her. She's young,

361
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,833
and she's in love, but you're sick.

362
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:33,833
Didn't you hear the priest?
"Till death do you part."

363
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,250
Maybe for you it's the grand finale,

364
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:41,541
but for her, it's the beginning,
and it isn't a fair one.

365
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,375
She knows I'm sick.

366
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,458
Everyone knows I'm sick.

367
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,791
You're betraying her feelings.

368
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:54,125
I'll give her
the best two or three years of her life.

369
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,166
Yes, and after that...
Actually, I will betray her in a way.

370
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:00,833
Anyway.

371
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,291
Betrayal is an inherent part of love.

372
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,041
Since we're on the subject, have a look.

373
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,000
Martín.

374
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:11,375
What a legend! My best friend. He's happy.

375
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,083
Would he betray me?

376
00:28:15,208 --> 00:28:16,708
Of course he would,

377
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:19,375
in the right circumstances. Tatiana?

378
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,583
Tatiana would too.

379
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:28,291
You say you experience love,
but you only see traitors everywhere.

380
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,916
No, I'm not saying that.

381
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,625
I'm saying, betrayal doesn't depend on
how or how much you love someone.

382
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:39,625
It depends on
how difficult your dilemma is.

383
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:42,708
Would you betray your beloved?
In theory, no.

384
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:45,375
But what if you were told
that if you did,

385
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:48,750
you'd be given a drug
to save your beloved brother?

386
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,583
That is a real dilemma.

387
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,625
<i>Sergio Marquina. Emotional coldness.</i>

388
00:29:22,666 --> 00:29:24,583
<i>Compulsive narcissism.</i>

389
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,708
<i>Pathological shyness.</i>

390
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,708
<i>Psychopathic traits...</i>

391
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,708
-In short, a gem.
-Well.

392
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:37,083
A report written by a mock expert
without interviewing the subject.

393
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:41,125
He's much more fun
than what it says there.

394
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,125
Cool.

395
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:46,958
Yeah, a psychopath can be so much fun.

396
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,458
Then there's your profile.

397
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:52,208
What about it?

398
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,708
You're the caring type that gets attached
to this sort of jerk.

399
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,375
You idealize them.

400
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:04,375
Gradually, you get smaller by their side.
Then, they use and manipulate you.

401
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,583
When did you give up on
your gut instinct, inspector?

402
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:12,166
Before the Professor came into your life?

403
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:18,000
Because Alberto used to beat you up.
How does this one humiliate you?

404
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,750
First you use my mother's Alzheimer's
and now domestic violence.

405
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:28,583
Tell me the story is not repeating itself.
Tell me at some point it hasn't clicked,

406
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:32,208
and you've thought, "Careful,
this guy could be a bastard."

407
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,625
Say it's not true.

408
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,375
<i>You know about protocols and negotiation,</i>
<i>but so do I.</i>

409
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:40,083
I beat you, Raquel.

410
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,166
I must be a fool,
because I thought we had fallen in love.

411
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,458
I didn't ask you to come.

412
00:30:45,541 --> 00:30:46,916
<i>It was a bluff.</i>

413
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,375
She hung up,
and we didn't even play our hand!

414
00:30:49,458 --> 00:30:52,041
She went for you
because you're the weakest link.

415
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,541
What's he done for you?

416
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:58,208
Would he go to an island
with his family for you?

417
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,375
Would he follow a plan of yours?

418
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,791
Have you ever been the protagonist? Ever?

419
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:10,666
Or have you always followed him
like a puppy?

420
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:14,250
I warned you about Alberto.
He was a son of a bitch.

421
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,666
And this guy's the same.

422
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,166
The question is very simple, Raquel:

423
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,541
do you deserve to spend 30 years in prison

424
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,041
for an idiot in a mask?

425
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,333
Colonel...

426
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:39,250
I've been checking the reports,
and it may be my mistake,

427
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:42,458
but I can't find
the records for Murillo's arrest.

428
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,416
-You've been checking what?
-I don't want a technicality...

429
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,708
Well, you know...
it's a question of human rights.

430
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:52,875
What's wrong with you?
Did you join an NGO?

431
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:55,250
Amnesty International? Cut the crap.

432
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:57,041
But according to the law--

433
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:00,291
Do you know
when we start applying the law in here?

434
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,958
Can you guess?

435
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,750
Give me an answer.

436
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:08,166
-When you--
-...fucking say so.

437
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,791
Specifically, whenever I fucking want to.

438
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:14,666
I don't give a shit about arrest reports
or procedural guarantees.

439
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,291
Do you understand?

440
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,416
Yes, I do.

441
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:25,916
So until then...

442
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:32,916
Until then, that bitch will be sat there
with no sleep, peeing in a bucket.

443
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:35,166
Got a problem with that?

444
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,750
No... no problem.

445
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,125
Good, Antoñanzas. Good.

446
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:46,166
TRANSPARENCY

447
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:53,041
GIVE ME A RAISE

448
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,750
LONG LIVE EVIL
LONG LIVE CAPITAL

449
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:01,916
<i>This system does not represent us!</i>

450
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,833
<i>The Professor would've loved X-ray vision</i>
<i>to see if Lisbon was behind the canvas.</i>

451
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,583
<i>But he wasn't Superman.</i>

452
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:11,583
<i>So he had to make do</i>
<i>with being Sherlock Holmes.</i>

453
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,375
<i>He arrived at the bank</i>
<i>in search of a thread to pull.</i>

454
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:16,583
<i>And he found three.</i>

455
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,958
<i>The van. What was it doing there?</i>

456
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,916
<i>And why did it have mud on it?</i>

457
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:26,166
CNP85600N.

458
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,250
<i>Pakistan found the answer.</i>

459
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,916
<i>The van belonged</i>
<i>to the police in Huelva,</i>

460
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,875
<i>near where Lisbon</i>
<i>had supposedly been killed.</i>

461
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,166
<i>Ángel.</i>

462
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,208
<i>If anyone should have been following</i>
<i>the Hamelin plan trail, it was him.</i>

463
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:47,166
<i>Unless he had</i>
<i>something more important to do.</i>

464
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,541
<i>Like transferring Lisbon to Madrid.</i>

465
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:54,125
<i>If anyone should have been mourning</i>
<i>a friend's death, it was also him.</i>

466
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,750
<i>And Alicia Sierra.</i>
<i>The truce had been declared hours ago.</i>

467
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,375
<i>But there she was.</i>

468
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,416
<i>As much of a workaholic as she was,</i>

469
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,833
<i>she should have been home</i>
<i>soaking her ankles.</i>

470
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:12,041
<i>Unless she got off on interrogating</i>

471
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:15,041
<i>one of the most-wanted criminals</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

472
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:18,125
<i>Lisbon might be alive.</i>

473
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,333
<i>But he needed to check</i>

474
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:23,291
<i>and let her know he wouldn't abandon her.</i>

475
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,875
The ambulance you used
as a communication center arrived.

476
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,375
Know who'll inspect it?

477
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,583
Alberto, your ex-husband.

478
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,791
Besides being the best CSI,

479
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:04,041
he's very eager
to fuck your life up even more.

480
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,666
There's another option.

481
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:20,208
I could go in there... before anyone else
and get rid of all the evidence.

482
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,333
You won't find anything.

483
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:36,958
Shit, Raquel.

484
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:39,458
You should know.

485
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,125
We always find something.

486
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,208
We'll find a clue that leads us
to your mom and daughter.

487
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:50,000
You'll see.

488
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:48,208
Next five, get ready
to go to the bathroom with my colleague.

489
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:02,750
Hey, Gandía, now we're on the same team,
may I ask a question?

490
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:06,791
I'm confused.
Are we... the good guys or the bad guys?

491
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,583
I'll cut your nutsack open,

492
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:15,291
pull out your balls,
and shove them in your mouth.

493
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,000
That'd be interesting.

494
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,916
But your hands are tied up, buddy.

495
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:35,000
Did you know the reliability of handcuffs
is based on one anatomical feature?

496
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,583
The metacarpal stops them coming off.

497
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:43,125
But it's very easy to dislocate it.

498
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:46,458
-Really?
-Well...

499
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
they're ideas for freedom.

500
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,333
<i>Free</i>

501
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,791
<i>Like the sun at dawn</i>

502
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,125
<i>I'm free</i>

503
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,416
<i>Like the sea</i>

504
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,666
<i>Free</i>

505
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,541
<i>Like the bird that escaped from its prison</i>

506
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,041
<i>And can finally fly</i>

507
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,875
<i>Free</i>

508
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,333
<i>Like the wind that gathers</i>

509
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:19,375
<i>My lament and my regret</i>

510
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:21,458
<i>I walk endlessly</i>

511
00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:25,833
<i>In search of the truth</i>
<i>And I'll finally know</i>

512
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:29,625
<i>What freedom is</i>

513
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:34,666
Go to sleep.

514
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:39,666
Four corners to my bed,

515
00:38:40,875 --> 00:38:42,958
four angels round my head.

516
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,625
Luke, Matthew, and Joseph,

517
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:48,291
our Lord and the Virgin Mary.

518
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,208
Antoñanzas.

519
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,166
Why are you here?

520
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:13,625
You're...

521
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:16,833
You're under arrest!

522
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:22,708
On your knees.

523
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,833
I was only testing the waters.

524
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,083
On your knees.

525
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,250
Please, my wife and daughters are in bed.

526
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,791
They'll be fine.

527
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:47,333
You just have to follow instructions
and answer some questions.

528
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:51,083
I won't speak to someone
who has a gun to my head.

529
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:54,250
You will speak.

530
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:59,708
We've got, one:

531
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:02,666
the ambulance.

532
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,250
Two:

533
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:11,750
the dotty grandma.

534
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:15,458
Where am I?

535
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:16,708
I can't do it.

536
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,666
Three: the motherless child.

537
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,125
Mommy.

538
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:24,958
Mommy.

539
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,125
Four:

540
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,958
the Professor's love,

541
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,375
which will last two days
once you're in prison.

542
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:44,833
And now, the final scene.

543
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:53,916
You're assaulting an officer.
You don't know what you're getting into.

544
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,083
We called a truce.

545
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,833
A truce can be
the most important part of a war.

546
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
I can't...

547
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:08,541
I can't breathe.

548
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:14,458
Pull yourself together.

549
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:16,708
Calm down.

550
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:20,541
I can't breathe.

551
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,375
Marseille.

552
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,625
Better?

553
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:06,416
If you cooperate,

554
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:10,625
the prosecution will request 12 years,
you'll get 10,

555
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:12,875
and you'll be out in five.

556
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,625
That's how your life could be.

557
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:19,541
If you don't cooperate,
you'll get 30 years.

558
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,250
That's how your life will be.

559
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,583
Your choice, Inspector.
