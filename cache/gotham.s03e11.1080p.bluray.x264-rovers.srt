1
00:00:01,974 --> 00:00:05,185
- Previously on Gotham...
- My name is Volk. My brother Jacob.

2
00:00:05,216 --> 00:00:06,616
We are called the Whisper Gang.

3
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:08,017
Those men were willing
to kill for this key,

4
00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:09,519
- but what does it open?
- A safe.

5
00:00:09,554 --> 00:00:12,221
Inside, there is a device that
we believe can destroy them.

6
00:00:12,257 --> 00:00:13,756
They call themselves

7
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,591
the Court of Owls.

8
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:17,727
Isabella was murdered.
Her brake lines were cut!

9
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:18,761
And I know who did it.

10
00:00:18,796 --> 00:00:20,997
You can stop the blade
from being released.

11
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:22,899
If you click this button, it will send

12
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:24,500
a fatal jolt to Butch.

13
00:00:24,536 --> 00:00:26,302
Hey, Butch, you're sweet.

14
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:30,072
- You really didn't kill her?
- No!

15
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:32,341
- Guilty!
- The lab analyzing

16
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:34,410
Alice Tetch's blood
has developed a test.

17
00:00:34,445 --> 00:00:36,279
- You're kidding.
- Don Falcone, please.

18
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:38,881
We'll pull your car around.

19
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,149
Carmine's not the target.

20
00:00:40,184 --> 00:00:41,851
You are. Get down!

21
00:00:45,156 --> 00:00:48,457
Why are you coming
after me?! You know why.

22
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:50,026
Why are you trying to kill my son?

23
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:52,728
We will expect your
assistance when called on.

24
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:56,299
Until then, your son is
safe... At least from us.

25
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:58,901
Why does it feel like
we keep saying good-bye?

26
00:00:58,937 --> 00:01:00,044
Maybe it's all we have left.

27
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:02,129
Or we just haven't done it properly yet.

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,106
Bye, James Gordon.

29
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:06,108
She loves him, she loves him...

30
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:08,911
You lost?

31
00:01:08,947 --> 00:01:12,815
She loves me...!

32
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:29,231
Hey.

33
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:50,386
I'm getting married tomorrow.

34
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:51,621
Congratulations.

35
00:01:51,656 --> 00:01:54,957
People always talk about
love at first sight.

36
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:56,993
I never believed it.

37
00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:00,763
But the moment I saw her, I knew.

38
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:02,231
Yeah.

39
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:05,234
So, what do you do?

40
00:02:05,269 --> 00:02:06,936
I'm a hematologist.

41
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:08,337
At Gotham Bio-Lab.

42
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:11,540
You aren't working on that blood virus,

43
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:13,142
are you, from, um...

44
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:15,411
what's her name? Tetch?

45
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:18,247
Alice Tetch?

46
00:02:18,282 --> 00:02:21,651
Uh, my fiancée is with
the police department.

47
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:23,519
She's the medical examiner on the case.

48
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:25,021
Oh. Yes.

49
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:26,355
She said

50
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:29,291
you had come up with
a test for the virus.

51
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:32,128
I really can't talk about it.

52
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:37,594
She almost married someone else.

53
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:41,671
I think her ex still hopes she'll come

54
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:44,006
running back.

55
00:02:44,042 --> 00:02:46,042
Not gonna happen.

56
00:02:50,982 --> 00:02:53,549
She loves him.

57
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:56,519
She loves him. She loves him.

58
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:57,620
Do you hear me, Jim?

59
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:01,023
I won't let you have her!

60
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,374
Volk is dead?

61
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:19,775
We found his and Dmitry's bodies

62
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,444
early this morning.

63
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,512
They were killed Talon,
the Court's assassin.

64
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:25,681
Well, that certainly changes
things a bit, doesn't it?

65
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:28,851
How? You possess the key.
The key opens the safe.

66
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:30,219
Inside the safe is an object

67
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:31,854
that can bring down the Court of Owls.

68
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:33,222
None of this has changed.

69
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:39,729
If this assassin saw us with Volk...

70
00:03:39,764 --> 00:03:40,963
That means the Court already knows

71
00:03:40,998 --> 00:03:43,013
that you're breaking
your deal, Master Bruce.

72
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,700
I wish we knew for certain.

73
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:46,769
Yeah, well, I wish we knew
for certain what was in

74
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:48,771
that blinking safe or how
far we can trust this little

75
00:03:48,806 --> 00:03:50,706
Whisper Gang front.

76
00:03:50,742 --> 00:03:52,975
Ask yourself this:

77
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,245
Is bringing down the Court
really worth the risk?

78
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,253
The Court of Owls has
taken over my company,

79
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:06,255
threatened people I care about,

80
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,357
and is likely responsible
for my parents' deaths.

81
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:11,494
What's our next step?

82
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:20,970
I'm giving this one to Alvarez.

83
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,071
No.

84
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:23,639
I told you to take the day off.

85
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:25,074
I know.

86
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:27,276
You do know I'm acting
captain now, right?

87
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,844
Yeah.

88
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,346
Jim, there will be another
dead body tomorrow.

89
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,915
Seriously, take the day.
Go fishing, get drunk.

90
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,416
Harvey, this is my job.

91
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:36,619
Lee getting married doesn't change that.

92
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:38,521
Take a look at this guy's head.

93
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:41,423
Whoa. What's that coming out of his ear?

94
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,592
His skull was crushed.

95
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:46,328
Like someone squeezed
it from either side.

96
00:04:46,364 --> 00:04:48,464
Can you imagine the
strength needed to do that?

97
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:51,133
I got to tell you, my first thought...

98
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:52,168
- Oh, no.
- Barnes.

99
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:53,269
Stop it!

100
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:55,271
Barnes had the virus. He's at Arkham.

101
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:57,540
That story's over. This
is what I was afraid of.

102
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:59,809
Wallet's here, but the killer
took a badge or something

103
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:01,210
from around his neck.

104
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:02,444
Your emotions are all stirred.

105
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,779
You're seeing things
that aren't really there.

106
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:06,782
This is just a classic case
of wrong place, wrong time.

107
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:08,350
One man takes another man's skull

108
00:05:08,386 --> 00:05:09,785
in his bare hands and crushes it.

109
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,353
I see it all the time.

110
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,823
Receipt... from the cafeteria

111
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,791
at Gotham Bio-Lab, where
Alice Tetch's blood

112
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:17,359
is being tested.

113
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:19,461
- Crap.
- I'm gonna swing by.

114
00:05:19,497 --> 00:05:20,663
Finish up here, will you?

115
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:23,666
Sure, Jim. Happy to oblige.

116
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:27,594
No rest for the wicked.

117
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,972
Relax.

118
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:32,474
I'm not here to get revenge

119
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,510
for you lopping off Tabby's paw.

120
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:36,078
Though I am surprised to find you

121
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:38,747
back at work and not
tracking down who really did

122
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:40,249
kill your lady love.

123
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:42,518
That's because you don't
see the full picture.

124
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,254
The mayor has many enemies.

125
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:46,422
These enemies understand that I am

126
00:05:46,457 --> 00:05:47,823
a fundamental part of this operation.

127
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:49,825
They weaken me, they weaken him.

128
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:52,528
That was clearly the
intent of killing Isabella.

129
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:54,930
Also, I have spies

130
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:56,699
all over this city.

131
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:58,400
Soon enough, whoever killed Isabella

132
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:00,202
will reveal themselves,

133
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:02,605
and I will strike.

134
00:06:03,641 --> 00:06:05,624
Poor blind baby.

135
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:11,272
It's always hardest to see
what's right under our noses.

136
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:15,251
Penguin!

137
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:21,680
Did you just fake cough "Penguin"?

138
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:24,593
Needless to say,

139
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:27,596
that is... absurd on a number of levels.

140
00:06:27,632 --> 00:06:29,465
Really?

141
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,935
All a crime requires is
means, motive and opportunity.

142
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,403
And your beaky little buddy

143
00:06:34,438 --> 00:06:37,106
certainly has the means and opportunity.

144
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:38,741
But no motive.

145
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:42,377
Oh, I would say he had the
oldest motive in the book.

146
00:06:43,114 --> 00:06:44,446
"Rich men want it,

147
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:47,216
wise men know it, the
poor all need it..."

148
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:49,952
Love. What does that have to do...

149
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:56,425
And the penny... drops.

150
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,700
You are suggesting...

151
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:07,870
that Oswald...

152
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:09,772
is in love with me?

153
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:13,475
- That is ridiculous.
- I know. I mean,

154
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:16,412
personally, I find you a
bit of a cold fish, but...

155
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:20,416
Ozzie saw you being taken away
from him by that bookish vixen,

156
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:21,917
and...

157
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:27,957
Aah... oh, no!

158
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:31,360
Hmm.

159
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:33,529
No.

160
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:37,266
In fact, I'm beginning to wonder
what your motive is in all this.

161
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:39,835
That's for later.

162
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,403
Right now,

163
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,342
I... just want to see
justice for that poor,

164
00:07:46,377 --> 00:07:48,310
sweet girl.

165
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:49,945
Ms. Kean,

166
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:53,015
I need you to understand two things.

167
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,483
One,

168
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:57,186
Oswald did not kill Isabella;

169
00:07:57,221 --> 00:08:00,622
and two, he's not in love with me.

170
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:06,591
Are you so certain?

171
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:10,165
Don't you owe it to her to find out?

172
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:13,802
Let me know how it goes.

173
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:20,175
The Court of Owls maintains a
number of buildings in Gotham.

174
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:22,177
This one is rarely occupied

175
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:25,455
and always well guarded,
and there are two alarms.

176
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:27,149
The first covers points of entry.

177
00:08:27,184 --> 00:08:29,385
Last week, we managed to
disarm one of the windows.

178
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,553
Once inside, the front door
can be opened using a code

179
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:32,955
that we possess.

180
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,491
The second alarm is in the basement.

181
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:37,192
In the room with the safe.

182
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:39,895
The floor is fitted
with infrared sensors.

183
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,497
You must cross it on a rope.

184
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:44,767
I have trained for this.

185
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:45,901
You will give me the key you found,

186
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:47,202
and I will retrieve the object.

187
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:50,005
But you still don't know
what the object is, right?

188
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,142
Only that the Court
protects it, fears it.

189
00:08:53,177 --> 00:08:56,078
And that with Talon hunting
us, we have no time.

190
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,852
Right, so...

191
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:05,154
let's go through this again.

192
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:06,255
What'd you decide?

193
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,791
We're gonna break in today.

194
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:10,426
We can't wait any longer.

195
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:14,596
- You okay?
- Fine.

196
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:16,365
Just hungry.

197
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,870
GCPD.

198
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,541
Guy named Ryan Pfeffer work here?

199
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:28,210
Uh, yeah.

200
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:29,511
It's, uh, sublevel three.

201
00:09:29,547 --> 00:09:31,580
- What, he in trouble?
- He was killed last night.

202
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:33,515
I need to talk to his colleagues.

203
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,250
You guys keep track of
when key cards are used?

204
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:36,485
Uh, yeah.

205
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,719
All right.

206
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,888
If anybody uses his, call me.

207
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:42,791
Sure, but... his was
used 20 minutes ago.

208
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:45,427
He hasn't logged out.

209
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:47,229
Call the police. Now.

210
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,127
Jim, Jim.

211
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:19,628
You're ahead of schedule.

212
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:23,098
Our paths weren't meant
to cross just yet.

213
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:29,171
But I'm not gonna kill you yet.

214
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:30,606
I do that,

215
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:32,141
you become the martyr,

216
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:34,643
and she'll carry you
in her heart forever.

217
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:36,845
No. Before I kill you,

218
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:39,982
she has to hate you.

219
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:41,316
And she will.

220
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:47,356
Come find me, Jim.

221
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,402
So you didn't get a look
at the guy, and he's not

222
00:10:56,446 --> 00:10:58,494
on the cameras. We might get
something off the prints, but...

223
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,659
Doubtful, if he was smart enough
to avoid the cameras. I'm good.

224
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,427
He seems to have been
interested in the research

225
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,929
into Alice Tetch's blood.

226
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,598
Pfeffer's office was ransacked,
and the files were missing.

227
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,267
So someone else is infected with
the virus? That's just great.

228
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,368
It isn't you, is it?

229
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,504
Because that sure
would make things easy.

230
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,451
No, it's not me. What's
that on your hand?

231
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,275
"Arkham."

232
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,077
I didn't write it.

233
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,278
Okay, let's all just calm down.

234
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,547
So the virus-infected
killer wrote on your hand.

235
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,783
He wants you to go to Arkham.

236
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:26,917
Barnes is in Arkham.

237
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,185
No.

238
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,787
It's not about Barnes.

239
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,124
- Jim, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

240
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,133
Hello, Jervis.

241
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,001
James.

242
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,036
What an unexpected pleasure.

243
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,075
Someone else is infected
with your sister's blood.

244
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,476
You don't say.

245
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,412
And I've been thinking it's possible

246
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,314
she infected them accidentally.

247
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,051
Yes, possible. Possible.

248
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,988
But your reaction tells
me you knew. So...

249
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,990
you infected them after you stole

250
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,936
your sister's blood,
but you stayed quiet,

251
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:12,182
waiting for them to show symptoms.

252
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,900
Well, that would be darn
sneaky of me, wouldn't it?

253
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,268
I need the name.

254
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,502
Oh.

255
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,373
You need the name.

256
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,376
So... I've been quiet
about it all this time,

257
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,580
and now I'm going to help you
because we're such good friends?

258
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,683
Because I can make your life
here very uncomfortable.

259
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,085
More uncomfortable than having
Captain Barnes next door

260
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,151
screaming "Guilty!"
all hours of the night?

261
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:39,523
Give me the name!

262
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,358
Oh, James,

263
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:45,196
I would love to see what
Alice's virus would do to you.

264
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,632
The beast in you is right there.

265
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,734
So desperate to get out.

266
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:55,606
And I know of whom you speak.

267
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,675
Oh, yes, indeed.

268
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,678
I stabbed him and pricked
him and caused him to bleed.

269
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,380
But nothing you can say,
no words you might possess,

270
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,616
can pry from me the smallest guess,

271
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,352
for this game is my game!

272
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,287
I say when it's done.

273
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,424
And right now I'm having too much fun.

274
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,461
You want to play a game, Jervis?

275
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,030
Fine. Let's play a game.

276
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,134
Whoever you infected...

277
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,137
has some sort of plan.

278
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,291
I want you to tell me
the name of this man.

279
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,377
Wow, James, I...

280
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,513
have to give that effort an "F."

281
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,415
And can you really imagine that...

282
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,384
Two are dead.

283
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,186
More may die soon.

284
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,755
This isn't a game. Give me his name.

285
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,657
You will only know his
name when it's too late!

286
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,726
When the one you love has
been murdered by hate!

287
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,929
Guard! Take me to my cell!

288
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,731
- What do you mean the one that I love?
- Guard!

289
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,999
Give me his name, Tetch.

290
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,834
Give me his name or
you'll share the blame!

291
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:58,402
Nothing! Nothing! I'll tell you naught!

292
00:13:58,437 --> 00:13:59,870
His name shall be neither
spoken nor taught.

293
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:00,905
He'll cut and he'll crush

294
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,206
and the blood will run thick.

295
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,441
Though from healer to
killer is no easy trick.

296
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,612
"Healer to killer."

297
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,981
He's a doctor.

298
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:12,549
My God.

299
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,751
You'll never stop him, James.

300
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,653
He'll kill and he'll kill

301
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,021
- and he'll kill!
- This is Gordon.

302
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,889
Give me Dr. Mario Calvi immediately.

303
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,291
On my damn authority!

304
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,960
Just do it!

305
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,941
I take it you're off?

306
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,278
When we were casing that place,

307
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,314
I got a feeling we were being watched.

308
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,717
And if this Court of
Owls is all you say,

309
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:49,586
they're not gonna be too cool
with Bruce breaking their deal.

310
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,156
That's very true.

311
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,758
And Master Bruce knows the Court

312
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,328
will catch up with him sooner or later.

313
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,096
And if he has the
opportunity to take them out,

314
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,097
then he'll take them out.

315
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,398
That's a big if.

316
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,067
Especially when your stupid job

317
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,335
is supposed to be protecting him.

318
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,104
My stupid job, miss, is to
make sure that he grows up

319
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,840
to be the man he's meant to be.

320
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,409
Still...

321
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,178
kind of a punk move for him

322
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,780
to make a deal with the
people who killed his parents.

323
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,048
Yeah, well, you understand this, then.

324
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,318
He only did what he did

325
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:23,387
to protect the people he cares about.

326
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,422
For you.

327
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,293
And it cost him dearly.

328
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,102
Are you serious? Arresting
Don Falcone's son

329
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,270
- on his wedding day?
- I had no choice.

330
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,305
He's got the virus.

331
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,773
Do you really think Lee Thompkins...

332
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,208
Dr. Lee Thompkins...

333
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,143
Wouldn't know if her own
fiancé had the virus?

334
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,612
How long did Barnes have it and hide it?

335
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,781
Tetch must have infected him
that night in the hospital

336
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,349
when he dosed me; it
would explain things.

337
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,384
Like what?

338
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,386
Mario hitting me at
the engagement party.

339
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,287
You know what also would explain that?

340
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,656
You telling Tetch to shoot his fiancée.

341
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,858
You should've seen his face

342
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,493
when those assassins
attacked us... his rage.

343
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,894
He was being attacked by assassins!

344
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,496
What was I supposed to do, Harvey,

345
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,498
wait until he kills
again, till he hurts Lee?

346
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,900
You were supposed to wait
until you had enough proof.

347
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,136
And why would Tetch infect
Mario in the first place?

348
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,971
To hurt me.

349
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,339
Okay, let's say you're right.

350
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,207
Let's say that Mario is infected.

351
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,177
So he crushes some guy's
skull, he breaks into the lab,

352
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,547
he attacks you, and then he
writes "Arkham" on your hand?

353
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:26,550
Why would he want you to find him?

354
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,185
I don't know.

355
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,889
He doesn't have the virus.

356
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,757
What? No, no, no, no. Run it again.

357
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:34,758
I ran it three times.

358
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,093
He's clean.

359
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,861
I could've told you that.

360
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,263
But, hey, I'm glad it's official.

361
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,698
Dr. Calvi, on behalf of the GCPD,

362
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,101
I just want to apologize for any...

363
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,703
inconvenience or embarrassment
this may have caused you.

364
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,005
No need.

365
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,840
Living with Lee, I
understand the pressures

366
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,942
you're all under. But
if you'll excuse me,

367
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,710
I have a wedding to attend.

368
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,113
Jim, I understand

369
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,883
this is a tough day for you,
but... no hard feelings.

370
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,019
The test. That's why
you broke into the lab.

371
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,587
To find out how to beat it.

372
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:04,888
- But why?
- Jim...

373
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,457
I know you have the virus.

374
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,591
I'm gonna prove it.

375
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,626
And I promise, you will never marry Lee.

376
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:16,421
But she didn't say anything?

377
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,492
She said she thought
we were being watched.

378
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:22,529
Personally, I think sh-she's
just got the jitters.

379
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,154
She can't still be mad I told
Ivy she was my girlfriend.

380
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:27,689
Oh.

381
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,057
It just slipped out.

382
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:30,625
She can call herself whatever she wants.

383
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,327
Fascinating as I find this tale of young

384
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:33,728
unrequited love is, Master Bruce,

385
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:37,265
please can we just concentrate
on the task at hand?

386
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,666
Do you have the key?

387
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:41,035
Excellent.

388
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:43,104
Alfred, you know when we get this thing,

389
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,572
whatever it is...

390
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:46,808
the Whispers are gonna
try to take it from us.

391
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:49,911
Well, to be honest, Master Bruce,

392
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:51,679
it's not the Whispers I'm worried about.

393
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:11,266
And have we made any headway

394
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:12,567
on the waterfront negotiations?

395
00:18:12,602 --> 00:18:14,669
I have spoken with the union leader.

396
00:18:14,704 --> 00:18:16,070
He agreed to our offer.

397
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:18,840
So those photos can
go back in the vault.

398
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,942
They were quite saucy, weren't they?

399
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:22,444
And how about the...

400
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:25,180
Your approval for the new casino
should come through tomorrow.

401
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:27,115
Demolition can begin right away.

402
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,784
Ed, I cannot tell you
how good it is to see you

403
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,186
back to your old self.

404
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:34,689
Just one last signature.

405
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:40,829
This is your resignation.

406
00:18:40,864 --> 00:18:43,998
Isabella's death has altered things,

407
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:45,700
and I can't continue... No!

408
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:47,894
Ed, I will not let you leave.

409
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,007
It is not in your best interest.

410
00:18:53,043 --> 00:18:54,976
You have to stay busy.

411
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,648
How can I say this? Um...

412
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:04,152
We're friends.

413
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:07,889
Aren't we, Oswald?

414
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:10,058
Of course!

415
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:12,660
Since the accident...

416
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:15,830
And-and I never thought
that this could happen...

417
00:19:18,387 --> 00:19:20,468
I've had the desire to

418
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:23,371
become more than employer-employee.

419
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:27,175
More than friends.

420
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:33,348
I have been feeling the same.

421
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:35,683
I didn't want to mention it,

422
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:38,052
because of all the
awfulness about Isabelle.

423
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:39,821
Isabella!

424
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:41,022
But...

425
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:46,361
one cannot deny love.

426
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:51,266
Wh-What is it? Wh-What's wrong?

427
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:55,570
There...

428
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:57,372
there's been a misunderstanding.

429
00:19:57,407 --> 00:19:59,607
I was going to...

430
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:02,544
propose that we become partners.

431
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,747
Business partners.

432
00:20:05,782 --> 00:20:08,917
Partners?

433
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:10,251
Then...

434
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:12,053
Excuse me.

435
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:21,229
Lee? You here? It's Jim!

436
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:22,864
Hello, Jim.

437
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,066
I saw you left Lee a message.

438
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:27,902
I, uh, accidentally took
her phone this morning.

439
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:30,371
She's not here, by the way.

440
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:31,439
- Drink?
- No, thanks.

441
00:20:31,474 --> 00:20:33,942
How'd you pass the test?

442
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:38,880
Because I don't have the virus.

443
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:40,782
Or do I?

444
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:45,987
You gonna arrest me, Jim?

445
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:48,656
Do you want to look even more
like the paranoid ex-lover?

446
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:51,059
I'll only pass the test again.

447
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:52,660
We'll find out how you beat it.

448
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:54,607
Only a matter of time.

449
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:57,165
Let's say I do have tirus

450
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,600
How would I have gotten it?

451
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:00,068
From Tet.

452
00:21:02,205 --> 00:21:06,007
Dr. Calvi, I'd like
you to meet my sister,

453
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:07,442
Alice.

454
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,644
With Barnes...

455
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,014
the virus stoked his
anger at the guilty.

456
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:15,249
What dark part of me
has it brought to life?

457
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:17,685
Jealousy.

458
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:19,854
You're afraid of losing Lee.

459
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:22,223
If that's true...

460
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:25,860
that means the woman we
both know you still love

461
00:21:25,895 --> 00:21:30,198
is gonna marry a lunatic
who'll do anything to keep her.

462
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,500
Are you sure you don't want that drink?

463
00:21:32,535 --> 00:21:34,602
What I want to know is why you put me

464
00:21:34,638 --> 00:21:36,004
on your trail.

465
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,605
What are you after?

466
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:39,273
Let me give you a hint.

467
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:42,210
You see, what keeps me up at night

468
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:45,546
is not the thought that you love her.

469
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:47,348
It's the thought...

470
00:21:47,384 --> 00:21:49,751
that a part of her still loves you.

471
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,921
Well, in that case, let's find her.

472
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:56,457
Let her decide if she's gonna marry you.

473
00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:00,595
Yeah, I don't think so.

474
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:06,601
Virus made you strong, not bulletproof.

475
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:07,835
Let's go.

476
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:09,270
You know what, Jim, with
all this virus talk,

477
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:10,838
you keep forgetting one thing.

478
00:22:10,874 --> 00:22:13,841
I'm still Carmine Falcone's son.

479
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:16,903
You know Victor.

480
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:20,563
Hi-ho.

481
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:29,662
Victor, were you listening to him?

482
00:22:29,712 --> 00:22:31,445
He has the same virus as Barnes had.

483
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:32,813
What's that?

484
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:35,282
Oh, no. I wasn't listening.

485
00:22:35,318 --> 00:22:36,984
- You have to let me go.
- Uh-huh.

486
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:39,820
- Does Falcone know you're here?
- Wait.

487
00:22:39,856 --> 00:22:42,256
Wait.

488
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:47,194
You're free to go, Jim.

489
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:51,098
I'll keep this.

490
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:53,868
I don't understand.

491
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:55,202
I was only supposed to keep you

492
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:58,005
until the big hand was on
nine and the little hand...

493
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,607
My mag... now.

494
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:03,010
Sorry, Jim. But, hey, give
the bride a kiss for me.

495
00:23:04,514 --> 00:23:06,514
I asked.

496
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:13,154
And it is with great pleasure

497
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:16,223
that I present this
award to Mr. Kyle Davis

498
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:19,360
for his magnificent book,

499
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:22,229
an Oral History.

500
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:24,832
Looks just fascinating.

501
00:23:26,502 --> 00:23:27,835
Thank you.

502
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,503
Oh, you're too kind.

503
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:31,572
I love sewers.

504
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:48,289
Ed.

505
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:50,791
I was worried when you ran off

506
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:53,127
that I might have upset you.

507
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:57,431
Can't we just pretend
that nothing happened?

508
00:23:57,466 --> 00:23:59,466
Go back to the way things were?

509
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,342
You are the best friend I've ever had.

510
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:10,477
I don't want to lose you.

511
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:14,114
Please?

512
00:24:17,253 --> 00:24:19,019
You're my best friend as well, Oswald.

513
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,958
Remember that.

514
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:43,210
Jim, what are you doing here?

515
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:44,723
Are you okay?

516
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:46,614
Where's Mario?

517
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:49,488
He's out at the church.
We're about to get married.

518
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:51,752
You can't marry him.

519
00:24:51,787 --> 00:24:53,854
Oh, my God.

520
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:56,790
- Just give us a minute.
- Yeah.

521
00:25:05,968 --> 00:25:07,067
Listen to me,

522
00:25:07,103 --> 00:25:08,836
and I know how this is gonna sound...

523
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:11,605
You think that he has
Alice Tetch's virus.

524
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:13,974
- He told you.
- Yes.

525
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,176
And he told me that you
had him arrested today,

526
00:25:16,212 --> 00:25:17,878
on our wedding day.

527
00:25:17,913 --> 00:25:20,614
And you had Lucius give him the
test three times, and he passed.

528
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,715
What's wrong with you?

529
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:23,884
He cheated the test, Lee.

530
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,486
I don't know how, but he did.

531
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:27,755
Tetch infected him that
night in the hospital.

532
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,290
You went to see Tetch, didn't you?

533
00:25:29,325 --> 00:25:30,824
- Yes.
- Jim,

534
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,026
don't you see?

535
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:33,994
Tetch is planting ideas in your head.

536
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,129
- No.
- Don't you remember?

537
00:25:35,164 --> 00:25:36,030
He's done this before.

538
00:25:36,065 --> 00:25:37,531
No, this isn't like that.

539
00:25:37,566 --> 00:25:40,234
Okay, what is more likely,
that Tetch is planting ideas

540
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:42,436
in your head to screw
with you or that Mario

541
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:43,771
has Alice's virus?

542
00:25:43,806 --> 00:25:45,939
Lee, you cannot marry him!

543
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:50,311
Mario said that you would
never let us be happy.

544
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:53,213
I thought he was
overreacting, but he's right.

545
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:57,418
Tetch or not, you are obsessed.

546
00:25:57,453 --> 00:25:58,952
Let it go.

547
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:02,523
This is what he wanted.

548
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:04,191
- What are you talking about?
- This.

549
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:06,760
Me coming here.

550
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:08,729
That's why he put me on his trail.

551
00:26:08,764 --> 00:26:13,033
He got the test so he could
find out how to beat it.

552
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:17,137
He had me arrest him so
I'd look like a jealous ex.

553
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:20,407
That's why Zsasz let me
go, so I'd race here...

554
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:23,844
finally push you away.

555
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:25,579
Oh, Jim.

556
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:27,648
I say this as someone

557
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:30,050
who cares about you.

558
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:32,319
Get help.

559
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:40,027
I love you.

560
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:47,267
I love you.

561
00:26:47,303 --> 00:26:48,535
I've never stopped.

562
00:26:50,072 --> 00:26:52,606
I should've come to see you as
soon as I got out of prison,

563
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:54,675
but I couldn't.

564
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,210
I was ashamed.

565
00:26:57,446 --> 00:27:00,013
I thought I had to set things right.

566
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:02,116
But I did finally come,

567
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:03,550
Lee.

568
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:07,521
I saw you,

569
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:10,591
through the window, with him.

570
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:12,593
You were smiling.

571
00:27:12,628 --> 00:27:14,128
You looked happy.

572
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:19,066
I couldn't bring myself to go in.

573
00:27:19,101 --> 00:27:22,536
I've regretted it every day since.

574
00:27:22,571 --> 00:27:24,571
Please.

575
00:27:28,344 --> 00:27:29,443
Don't marry him.

576
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,486
After the wedding...

577
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,624
Mario and I are leaving Gotham.

578
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:46,760
I'll never see you again.

579
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:49,296
- Lee...
- Damn you...

580
00:27:49,331 --> 00:27:53,100
for telling me this now.

581
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:55,335
You come in here with
these crazy accusations,

582
00:27:55,371 --> 00:27:57,671
and when I don't believe
you, you pull this?

583
00:27:58,941 --> 00:28:00,941
How dare you?!

584
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,780
Don't you see?

585
00:28:06,816 --> 00:28:10,083
- He wants you to hate me.
- Well, he succeeded.

586
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,820
- Get the hell out of here!
- No!

587
00:28:12,855 --> 00:28:14,121
Fine.

588
00:28:14,156 --> 00:28:16,274
Carmine.

589
00:28:17,126 --> 00:28:19,960
Can you please help Detective
Gordon find the exit?

590
00:28:19,995 --> 00:28:21,795
Certainly.

591
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:25,866
And if you're ready, my dear.

592
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:30,137
I am.

593
00:29:19,121 --> 00:29:21,021
Do you, Leslie,

594
00:29:21,056 --> 00:29:22,322
take Mario to be your husband?

595
00:29:22,358 --> 00:29:24,091
I do.

596
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:29,563
And do you,

597
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:31,865
Mario, take Leslie to be your wife?

598
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:33,767
I do.

599
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:38,505
I now pronounce you

600
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,207
husband and wife.

601
00:29:40,242 --> 00:29:41,942
You may kiss the bride.

602
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:06,129
Ladies and gentlemen,

603
00:30:06,154 --> 00:30:07,920
Mr. and Mrs. Calvi.

604
00:30:33,637 --> 00:30:34,836
Well, I think it's safe to admit

605
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,773
that our foreign friends
are no-show, Master Bruce.

606
00:30:37,808 --> 00:30:39,641
It was a right dodgy plan, anyway.

607
00:30:39,677 --> 00:30:41,043
Where are you going?

608
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:42,344
That would be home.

609
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:45,047
Alfred, this is our only
shot to take down the Court.

610
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:46,348
You don't know that, do you?

611
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:47,950
I mean, it was a moot point, anyway.

612
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:49,484
I mean, walking across the
entire length of a room

613
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,485
on a bloody tightrope?

614
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:52,287
I can do it. I... I did it.

615
00:30:52,323 --> 00:30:54,723
Yeah, three times out of 20. I counted.

616
00:30:54,758 --> 00:30:55,724
No, thank you very much.

617
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,359
I can do it.

618
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:00,762
Oh, that's bloody marvelous, isn't it?

619
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:01,863
Hey?

620
00:31:04,868 --> 00:31:06,468
Right.

621
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:08,737
you stay on comms

622
00:31:08,772 --> 00:31:10,172
at all times.

623
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:13,375
If I order abort, you
abort. Is that clear?

624
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,977
I need my head examined.

625
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:16,278
Really do.

626
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:21,416
What?

627
00:31:21,452 --> 00:31:23,552
Just wondering.

628
00:31:25,556 --> 00:31:27,322
Does this mean you are my girlfriend?

629
00:31:27,358 --> 00:31:29,858
Shut up.

630
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:40,202
So, I thought, if I were Mario,

631
00:31:40,237 --> 00:31:41,503
how would I beat the test?

632
00:31:41,538 --> 00:31:43,105
Well, the test looks for
this one marker in the blood,

633
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,507
but that marker can be
masked by an abundance

634
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,541
of certain other drugs.

635
00:31:46,577 --> 00:31:48,043
The two most easily available,

636
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:49,244
Cloracinamine and...

637
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,046
Lucius, just-just get to the point.

638
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:53,949
Mario's blood came back off
the charts for Cloracinamine.

639
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:56,318
Alvarez!

640
00:31:56,353 --> 00:31:58,654
Get a unit on Lee Thompkins
and Dr. Mario Calvi,

641
00:31:58,689 --> 00:32:00,389
and don't let them out of your sight!

642
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:01,690
This isn't proof that Mario

643
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:02,791
killed those men.

644
00:32:02,826 --> 00:32:05,127
No, but it's enough
for a search warrant.

645
00:32:05,162 --> 00:32:06,895
Now I got to go find Jim Gordon.

646
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:10,198
Don't mess with Falcone!

647
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:39,695
Hey.

648
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,759
All right, straight to the safe room.

649
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:12,260
I'm gonna check the rest of the house.

650
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:14,129
Go on. This way.

651
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:26,341
Not exactly hiding it.

652
00:33:26,376 --> 00:33:27,642
There's no point.

653
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:29,411
The floor is alarmed.

654
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,228
Don't... let... go.

655
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:19,988
Come on!

656
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:26,828
Out the way you came!

657
00:35:32,169 --> 00:35:33,169
- Let's go!
- No!

658
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:40,343
No!

659
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:15,877
We have to leave.

660
00:36:15,913 --> 00:36:17,445
And who exactly are you?

661
00:36:17,481 --> 00:36:18,780
You're the one who's been

662
00:36:18,815 --> 00:36:20,081
following us.

663
00:36:26,423 --> 00:36:28,290
Hey.

664
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:32,360
You know her?

665
00:36:33,397 --> 00:36:34,763
That's my mom.

666
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,500
Now can we get out of here?

667
00:36:38,535 --> 00:36:40,035
You're bloody right.

668
00:36:49,028 --> 00:36:51,409
Found it! In his trash.

669
00:36:51,523 --> 00:36:52,488
Cloracinamine.

670
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:55,124
Oh, yes.

671
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,192
We got him.

672
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:57,193
Tell Alvarez.

673
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,661
That was Alvarez.

674
00:36:58,697 --> 00:37:00,663
Lee and Mario snuck
out of the reception.

675
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:02,365
He lost them.

676
00:37:09,074 --> 00:37:11,341
I can't even hold a knife.

677
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:13,209
I swear, when I see Nygma...

678
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:15,511
We'll kill him together. Real slow.

679
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:17,313
How sweet.

680
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:25,089
Son of a bitch!

681
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,223
Hear him out.

682
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:28,658
Please.

683
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:42,472
I don't want to kill him.

684
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:50,279
I want to destroy him.

685
00:37:51,483 --> 00:37:53,349
I want to take...

686
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:55,418
away...

687
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:57,387
everything that he loves.

688
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:01,624
I want to make him...

689
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:03,126
despised.

690
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:04,627
What are you talking about?

691
00:38:04,662 --> 00:38:05,828
Penguin.

692
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,934
- He killed the librarian.
- What?

693
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:14,604
And you cut off my hand?!

694
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,506
I assume you want something.

695
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,307
With Penguin gone,

696
00:38:18,343 --> 00:38:20,176
the underworld will need a new leader.

697
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,181
I think it's time Gotham
had a woman's touch.

698
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:27,016
The crime families
will never follow you.

699
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:28,317
Well, that's where you come in.

700
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:30,486
You know the families in and out.

701
00:38:30,522 --> 00:38:32,255
Not to mention, you're a whiz

702
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,257
at strategy.

703
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,627
Think about it, Ed.

704
00:38:37,662 --> 00:38:41,497
Your brains, their brawn,

705
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:44,133
my...

706
00:38:44,169 --> 00:38:45,701
me.

707
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:47,770
We could make quite a team.

708
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:54,510
We destroy Penguin first.

709
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:56,813
Of course.

710
00:38:56,848 --> 00:38:59,315
But there is one thing you need to do.

711
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,522
Okay.

712
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:14,997
I'm sorry about your hand.

713
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:16,466
Apology not accepted!

714
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:18,668
Well, we'll work on that.

715
00:39:18,703 --> 00:39:19,703
Drinks!

716
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:47,663
Hey.

717
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:52,635
Thank you.

718
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,371
Thank you for letting us
leave that party early.

719
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:56,539
Hmm, of course.

720
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:57,874
I wanted to.

721
00:39:57,909 --> 00:39:59,342
I love this house.

722
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:00,810
It's my father's refuge.

723
00:40:00,845 --> 00:40:03,112
Not many people know about it.

724
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:07,550
I know Gordon came to the church.

725
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:09,452
Talked to you.

726
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,153
It was just like you said.

727
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:12,622
He said you had the virus.

728
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:13,990
He was obsessed.

729
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:17,727
And what did you say?

730
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:20,630
That after the wedding, we
would be leaving Gotham.

731
00:40:20,665 --> 00:40:22,298
That I would never see him again.

732
00:40:23,334 --> 00:40:24,901
Is that it?

733
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:26,135
What are you asking me?

734
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:29,305
I'm asking...

735
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:33,142
if there's any part
of you, however small,

736
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:35,845
that still has feelings for him.

737
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,313
And I swear,

738
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:40,016
I will never ask you again.

739
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:44,387
A part of me will always care for him.

740
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:48,624
But I married you.

741
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,593
I love you.

742
00:40:57,635 --> 00:41:00,202
That's all I needed to know.

743
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:08,844
Where are they?

744
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,079
Don Falcone, he just...

745
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:11,380
Where are they?!

746
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:14,584
You don't give up, do you?

747
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:16,752
Your son has Alice Tetch's virus.

748
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:18,454
He's killed two people we know of.

749
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:20,389
Every cop in this city is after him.

750
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:21,591
Where is he?

751
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:30,132
You knew?

752
00:41:30,168 --> 00:41:32,835
That Mario had the same virus as Barnes?

753
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,036
No.

754
00:41:34,072 --> 00:41:36,272
I knew he was in danger,
but I didn't know why.

755
00:41:36,307 --> 00:41:39,442
I never suspected this.

756
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:42,211
You're saying the attacks
on Mario... the car bomb...

757
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:43,613
It's because of the virus?

758
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:46,616
How is that possible?
Who knew he had it?

759
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:47,850
I can't tell you that.

760
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:52,851
I'll send my men to bring Mario in.

761
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:56,559
You think I'd trust Lee's
life with these two goons?

762
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:58,594
Tell me where they are.

763
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,363
If I do that, you'll kill him.

764
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:01,564
I know you, James.

765
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,500
Mario is my son.

766
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:08,170
There is nothing and no
one more valuable to me.

767
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:11,340
And if he does have this
sickness, he needs help.

768
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:12,808
And if he kills Lee, he'll cross a line

769
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:14,176
he'll never come back from.

770
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:18,481
Even if he's cured, knowing
that will destroy him.

771
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:20,049
I'm your only hope.

772
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:24,053
Still, I'll send my men.

773
00:42:24,088 --> 00:42:25,121
You mean these two?

774
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:31,127
Anyone else you want to send?

775
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:34,597
Swear that you'll brg him in alive.

776
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:36,198
I swear.

777
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:37,667
Now, where are they?

778
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,874
She loves him.

779
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:46,108
Loves him!

780
00:42:46,144 --> 00:42:48,010
She loves him. Loves him.

781
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:50,713
She loves him. She loves him.

782
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:52,181
She loves him. Loves him.

783
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:54,116
She loves him. She loves him.

784
00:42:59,991 --> 00:43:02,024
She loves him.

785
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,959
She loves him. Loves him.

786
00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:05,861
She loves him. She loves him.

787
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:07,096
Lee!

788
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:08,998
Jim?
