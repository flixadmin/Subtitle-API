1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,605
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,608 --> 00:00:04,502
This place looks exactly
like it did when I was 13.

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,869
We had planned to come
back here with both of you.

4
00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:08,507
Yeah. That didn't really work out.

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,471
Because I died.

6
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:11,195
Have you come to doubt your commitment

7
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:12,204
to this mission?

8
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:14,387
It might help if I actually knew why.

9
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,825
The recovery of your universe

10
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:17,930
will require a single task.

11
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:20,150
You must betray Oliver Queen.

12
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,528
If saving it means going back

13
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,855
to the person that I used to be,

14
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,598
the what the hell is the point?

15
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,658
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,405
Passes it quickly over to the right.

17
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,532
Tark drives the lane.

18
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,626
Kicks it to Aldrich in the corner for 3.

19
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:39,780
Bingo! Count it and the foul!

20
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:41,782
That's an 8-0 run by the Comets,

21
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:43,617
who have stormed all the way back

22
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,619
to tie it up here in the fourth quarter.

23
00:00:45,621 --> 00:00:48,288
No way. It tastes the same.

24
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,841
I'm telling you this big
belly burger's just better.

25
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:53,379
I think he's right. This
is pre-gwespin foods merger.

26
00:00:53,382 --> 00:00:55,536
Dad, what are you still doing here?

27
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:58,409
How did we get here?

28
00:00:58,412 --> 00:00:59,799
What do you mean?

29
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:03,561
Uh, I was on a roof
with John and Laurel,

30
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,186
and we were tranqed.

31
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,232
Yeah. By Lyla.

32
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:09,369
Dad said it was all just
a big misunderstanding.

33
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:17,335
Ahem. What did we do with
Burov's plan for the weapon?

34
00:01:17,337 --> 00:01:20,027
You said we didn't need it anymore.

35
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,828
Why? The Monitor's still out there.

36
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,240
He's still a threat.

37
00:01:23,242 --> 00:01:25,200
Dad, are you okay?

38
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:27,387
You... you look like you
don't remember any of this.

39
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:30,164
I...

40
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,153
I need to talk to John.

41
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:34,082
That should be easy.

42
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:37,994
He's waiting for you at
that fancy fundraiser.

43
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,539
What fundraiser?

44
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,892
The one you're very late for.

45
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,529
I mean, you do remember
you're Oliver Queen, right?

46
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:56,231
Hey, Queen, what's the difference

47
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:58,192
between a cop and the Green Arrow?

48
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:00,736
A cop doesn't need to play
dress-up to do his job.

49
00:02:00,738 --> 00:02:04,048
Ha. Yeah, sure. Whoa!

50
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,576
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Queen.
- It's fine, it's fine.

51
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,003
There you are, man.

52
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:12,465
The party started an hour ago, Oliver.

53
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,633
Do you remember getting
tranqed last night?

54
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,781
Yeah. Uh, Lyla feels awful about that.

55
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:19,356
By the way, that wasn't last night.

56
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:21,965
- That was two days ago.
- What? No.

57
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:24,142
No, no. That... John,
that is the last thing

58
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,095
that I remember before waking up

59
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:28,814
in my apartment earlier tonight.

60
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,266
You okay, man?

61
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:35,079
No. This is... this... Is this the...

62
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:36,975
This is the Monitor.

63
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:38,657
- Oliver.
- Your wife is working

64
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,209
with the Monitor, John. What...

65
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:42,453
I thought we already settled this.

66
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:44,997
I have been working with the
Monitor but as a double agent,

67
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,875
which I told you on the roof.

68
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:48,285
I don't... I don't remember that.

69
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:49,686
I'm not remembering anything.

70
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:51,268
Oliver, look. Just maybe
you should go home, man,

71
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,746
get a little sleep, okay?

72
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:56,675
Oliver, there you are. Mayor's
looking for you. Come on.

73
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,511
What?

74
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,629
- What happened there?
- Oh.

75
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:02,739
Can't give a speech
with a stained shirt.

76
00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:04,683
Give a s... what speech?
I'm giving a speech?

77
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:09,137
Very funny. Your joint
remarks with the mayor.

78
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:12,641
Rene, um, serious question.

79
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:15,310
When did Palmer Tech get rebuilt?

80
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,646
You really need to drop
this amnesia routine quick.

81
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:19,624
This fundraiser is
our only chance to take

82
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:22,484
the SCPD vigilante pilot program global.

83
00:03:22,486 --> 00:03:24,152
The mayor needs you to be on point.

84
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:25,871
- He's waiting for you.
- He who?

85
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,536
Isn't... isn't Pollard the mayor?

86
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:29,251
In her dreams maybe.

87
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,515
What's the matter, Oliver?

88
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:38,201
You look like you seen a ghost.

89
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:45,298

90
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:46,622
So listen. I was thinking about making

91
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:47,914
a few changes to the speech,

92
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:51,585
so I figured I should
run it by you first.

93
00:03:51,588 --> 00:03:55,010
This is not possible. This is...

94
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:57,476
What? Don't tell me you're scared

95
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,666
of a little last-minute
memorization, Oliver.

96
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:04,151
It's been a while since I've seen you.

97
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:05,455
Couple of days maybe.

98
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,088
You're looking at me
like it's been years.

99
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:09,795
No. You're right. A couple days.

100
00:04:09,798 --> 00:04:12,116
Right. So listen. I was thinking

101
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,844
about adding a line about, you know,

102
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:16,347
me telling you it was
a bad idea to unmask,

103
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:18,313
but, you know, maybe a joke about how

104
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:19,797
you'd rather take it to Supermax

105
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,021
than take my advice.

106
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:23,358
Heh. You know? What do you think?

107
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:25,730
You know that I went to Slabside?

108
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,249
Uh... yeah. What's that,

109
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:31,269
your way of saying I should
have come visit more often?

110
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,948
Quentin, right before
I turned myself in...

111
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,703
Diaz shot you, right?

112
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:40,520
Oh. Yeah.

113
00:04:40,522 --> 00:04:42,898
That son of a bitch almost killed me.

114
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,285
Almost died in the
O.R. you don't remember?

115
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,740
I remember it differently.

116
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:52,032
Well, the doctors called it a miracle.

117
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:53,884
I was without oxygen for so long,

118
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:55,304
I should have been 6 feet under.

119
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:58,722
Felt like I escaped
my fate or something.

120
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:00,958
Hey. There's something you need to see.

121
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,065
So... there's a hostage situation

122
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:10,374
at the SCPD.

123
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,209
The leader's demanding
to meet with the mayor.

124
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,315
No. No. You can't go down there.

125
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:15,108
We'll call in a special-ops team.

126
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:18,074
I'm the mayor. Nobody
does my dirty work for me.

127
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:19,552
Give my apologies to the guests.

128
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:21,314
I'm... I'm gonna come with you.

129
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:24,271
Okay, but you might want
to bring a change of clothes

130
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:26,978
because something tells me
we're gonna need the green guy.

131
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,350
Get the feds on the line.
Tell them I need backup

132
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:36,712
here now, right now.

133
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,151
What's the situation, Captain?

134
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:39,993
Armed mercs stormed my precinct,

135
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:42,738
took a dozen of my guys hostage.

136
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,733
How'd they get by your men?

137
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:47,179
It's a long story that I
don't have time to tell.

138
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,181
The only demand was
to speak to the mayor.

139
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,924
All right. Well, I'll go talk to them.

140
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:52,801
I appreciate that, but there is no way

141
00:05:52,803 --> 00:05:53,821
I'm sending you in there.

142
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:55,528
Listen. I wore the blues a long time

143
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:57,031
before I wore this monkey suit, okay?

144
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:58,558
- I can hold my own.
- I know, sir.

145
00:05:58,561 --> 00:05:59,914
It's not the point.

146
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,447
She's right. It's too risky.

147
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,187
Says the man who risks
his life every day

148
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,715
for this city?

149
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:07,699
Give me a vest. I'll go in there,

150
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,010
I'll distract the son of a bitch,

151
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:10,604
and in the meantime,
you sneak around the back

152
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:12,490
and do your thing, okay?

153
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:14,103
The longer this drags on,

154
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:16,440
the worse it gets.

155
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,851
Let me do this.

156
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:20,406
I'll have his back.

157
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:25,058
I want you on comms the whole time.

158
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:26,185
Sure.

159
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,940
This is mayor Quentin Lance.

160
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:39,699
I'm unarmed. I'm coming in.

161
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,145
- That's far enough.
- All right.

162
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:47,406
Just... just take it easy, okay?

163
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:48,874
Take it easy.

164
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:52,837
I'm in position. Keep him talking.

165
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,146
You asked for me. Here I am.

166
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,765
What do you want to talk about with me?

167
00:06:56,768 --> 00:06:58,059
You're the mayor. You're a guy

168
00:06:58,062 --> 00:06:59,547
who can make things happen.

169
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,803
Why don't you let a few of
these guys go while we talk?

170
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:03,537
So I can get stormed by the cops?

171
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,291
No, thanks. I'm not stupid.

172
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,518
But it would show that you
don't want anybody to get hurt

173
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,019
because if anybody gets hurt,

174
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:11,096
you're in real trouble.

175
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,190
Actually, I think you're
already in trouble.

176
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:14,841
I'm the one holding the gun.

177
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:17,385
Not for long. Put it down.

178
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:18,917
Agh. Err.

179
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,365
This... is... over.

180
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:24,809
This isn't over until
you stop it, Oliver.

181
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,536
That's the only way out.

182
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:28,165
What are you talking about?

183
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,491
- No!
- Quentin!

184
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:34,736
Ahh!

185
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:36,363
Tark drives the lane.

186
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:38,515
Kicks it to Aldrich in the corner for 3.

187
00:07:38,518 --> 00:07:41,709
Bingo! Count it and the foul!

188
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,131
That's an 8-0 run by the Comets,

189
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,800
who have stormed all the way back

190
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,219
to tie it up here in the fourth quarter.

191
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:56,814
88 apiece. What a
comeback for the Comets,

192
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:58,317
and there's a timeout...

193
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,334
No way. It tastes the same.

194
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:02,605
I'm telling you this big
belly burger's just better.

195
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,910
I think he's right. This
is pre-gwespin foods merger.

196
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:10,214
Ooh, dad. What are you still doing here?

197
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:13,102
I'm late for a fundraiser.

198
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:14,412
Yeah. Really late.

199
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,295
You want a burger? Those
things never have good food.

200
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:25,896
Did something happen at
the SCPD headquarters?

201
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:28,134
Like what?

202
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:30,721
Never mind.

203
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,719
Hey, Queen. What's the difference

204
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:40,813
between a cop and the Green Arrow?

205
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:43,507
A cop doesn't need to play
dress-up to do his job.

206
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:45,301
Ha ha ha!

207
00:08:45,303 --> 00:08:49,179
- Ooh! Nice reflexes, Mr. Queen.
- Thank you.

208
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:52,492
There you are. You know the
party started an hour ago, right?

209
00:08:52,494 --> 00:08:53,696
I need to speak with you.

210
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,315
Uh, this is gonna sound crazy.

211
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:59,164
Um... I have been here
before. So have you.

212
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,607
What are you talking about?

213
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,451
About the Monitor
dropping me into some sort

214
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:05,319
of alternate reality
t-t-time loop or something,

215
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:06,543
where everything is different,

216
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,045
where Lance is still alive.

217
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,175
Oliver, Lance has always been alive.

218
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:12,336
No, he hasn't. You just don't remember

219
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:15,014
because the Monitor has done
something to people's memories,

220
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:17,016
but I... I think I know
the way out of this,

221
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:20,494
but I... I need to
stop a bomb at the SCPD.

222
00:09:20,497 --> 00:09:22,837
Oliver, will you just calm down, man?

223
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,382
If there was a bomb,
we would know about it.

224
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:26,611
Lyla would know about it.

225
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:27,825
Lyla's a part of this.

226
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:29,297
Part of what?

227
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,633
Oliver seems to think that he's caught

228
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:31,954
in some sort of time loop.

229
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,290
If we're traveling back in time,

230
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:34,588
I'd like to revisit my 20s.

231
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:36,169
I... I need to speak with Quentin.

232
00:09:36,172 --> 00:09:38,914
They mayor's waiting for me.

233
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:40,948
Yeah. How'd you know?

234
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,359
Mr. Mayor.

235
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:44,972
Oh. Hey, Oliver. Listen.

236
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:47,904
I, uh... I made a few last-minute
changes to the speech, so...

237
00:09:47,907 --> 00:09:51,125
- We need to talk.
- Sure. Let's.

238
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:54,203
Uh, yeah. I wanted to run
these changes by you anyway.

239
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:56,464
You want to add a joke about Slabside,

240
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,707
about how I would rather spend time

241
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,919
in a Supermax than take your advice.

242
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:04,380
You steal a copy of
my speech or something?

243
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:07,424
We've had this exact
conversation already.

244
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:11,387
What are you talking about?

245
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:14,723
Fully aware of how
this is going to sound.

246
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:19,436
Quentin, I'm trapped in
some sort of... time loop,

247
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:23,232
where the same events just
keep repeating themselves.

248
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:24,761
Like "Groundhog Day."

249
00:10:24,764 --> 00:10:28,236
Sure except this one
ends a lot of people dead,

250
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:30,447
including the two of us.

251
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:34,427
Okay. How can I help?

252
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:36,286
Do you actually believe me?

253
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:39,248
Oliver, I've seen one daughter die

254
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,872
and come back to life twice.

255
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,918
I've seen another come
from some other Earth.

256
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,846
I've seen a guy in red run
so fast he can reverse time.

257
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:48,757
This is not exactly
outside the norm, is it?

258
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,718
Also, I'm done learning my
lesson about doubting you

259
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:54,304
because that always
bites me in the ass. Heh.

260
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,618
What happens now?

261
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,769
Very shortly, we are gonna learn that

262
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:04,031
there is a hostage
situation at the SCPD.

263
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:07,651
They're going to insist that
they talk to you and only you.

264
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:09,778
And how does it go south?

265
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,114
There's a hidden explosive device

266
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:14,300
that I didn't know about
the first time through,

267
00:11:14,302 --> 00:11:17,378
and judging from the blast,
it's underneath the building.

268
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,858
Okay. So you find it, you
keep us from going boom.

269
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:22,883
- What then?
- I break out of the loop.

270
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:24,727
Great. Out of the loop.

271
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:27,480
Here you are. There's
something you need to see.

272
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:31,879
Get the feds on the line.

273
00:11:31,882 --> 00:11:33,485
Tell them I need backup now.

274
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:34,946
What's the situation, Captain?

275
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:36,407
Armed mercs stormed the precinct,

276
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,991
took a dozen of my guys hostage.

277
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:43,277
They have a bomb.

278
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,239
We already did a sweep
of the entire building.

279
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:47,858
It's not in the building.
It's underneath it.

280
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,243
How could you possibly know that?

281
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:53,530
I trust him. Instinct thing.

282
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:54,958
So what do you want to do?

283
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,917
This is Mayor Quentin Lance.

284
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,596
I'm unarmed. I'm coming in.

285
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,814
Stop right there.

286
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:16,261
Oh. It's you. Would you relax?

287
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:18,514
We are both here for the same thing.

288
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:20,432
Hey. How did you know to come down here?

289
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:22,851
I may have learned about the existence

290
00:12:22,853 --> 00:12:25,538
of this place as a
part of a former career.

291
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,947
How did you know about the bomb?

292
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:29,399
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

293
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:31,860
Well, actually, since you're
not going to remember anyway,

294
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:35,857
there is a crazy space god who
has me trapped in a time loop.

295
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,033
Yeah? Me, too.

296
00:12:38,035 --> 00:12:39,484
It's my second time through.

297
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:41,214
Same. I wake up in the bunker.

298
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:42,390
I wake up in my apartment,

299
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:44,026
so clearly, the Monitor is doing this.

300
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,037
- You mean punishing us?
- Yeah.

301
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,044
We are the two people who have
royally pissed him off the most.

302
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,214
In Russia, I disobeyed him,

303
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:54,091
and you... you tried to destroy him.

304
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:55,507
At least we're in it together now.

305
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,010
I think disarming that
is the way out of here.

306
00:12:58,013 --> 00:13:00,180
How long do you think
until this thing goes boom?

307
00:13:00,182 --> 00:13:01,816
Oh. Your guess is as good as mine.

308
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:05,936
Quentin's upstairs buying us some time.

309
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:07,938
- Quentin... he's here?
- Yeah.

310
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:11,572
I think we just activated
some kind of failsafe.

311
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:13,130
Look. We need more time
with the next loop, Laurel.

312
00:13:13,132 --> 00:13:14,904
It would probably help if we
found each other faster next time.

313
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:16,026
There's a party at the
Palmer Tech building.

314
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,192
- Meet me there.
- Are we talking formal wear or...

315
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:20,742
Tark drives the lane.

316
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:22,911
Kicks it to Aldrich in the corner for 3.

317
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:24,305
Bingo!

318
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:26,456
No way. It's the same.

319
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,333
I'm telling you. This big
belly burger is just better.

320
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:29,793
Guess you realized you're late.

321
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:30,845
Something like that.

322
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:34,575
Hey, Queen. What's the difference

323
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:35,685
between a cop and the Green Arrow?

324
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:37,851
Cop doesn't need to play
dress-up to do his job.

325
00:13:37,854 --> 00:13:39,237
Sorry.

326
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:42,948
Mr. Mayor.

327
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:45,976
Hey, Oliver. Listen. I made
a few last-minute changes

328
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:46,957
to the speech.

329
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,528
And you figured you should
run them by me first.

330
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,214
Yeah, exactly.

331
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:52,867
Hey, baby girl.

332
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,967
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

333
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,803
Me either.

334
00:13:57,806 --> 00:13:59,189
You okay, honey?

335
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:04,545
I'm just really happy to see you.

336
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:07,054
Oh. I'm happy to see you, too.

337
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:09,086
Though I got to say I'm glad you left

338
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:10,792
the black lipstick at home tonight.

339
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:12,319
You know that I'm Earth-2 Laurel.

340
00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:13,906
Who else would you be?

341
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:15,375
Look. I'm really sorry to interrupt,

342
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:16,965
but you and I need to go.

343
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:19,063
You're coming with
us. We need your help.

344
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,481
What do you mean there's a bomb?

345
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:25,682
I know how to stop it,

346
00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:26,786
but you have to trust me.

347
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:28,205
I'm gonna need a vest.

348
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,008
Not this time, Quentin.

349
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:31,647
This is Mayor Quentin Lance.

350
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:36,502
You wanted to talk. Let's talk.

351
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:39,213
The detonator operates on
an oscillating frequency.

352
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:40,412
If we can find the right one,

353
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:42,596
we should be able to disrupt it.

354
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,402
Vincent, listen to me.

355
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,030
I know you don't really want to do this.

356
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:47,742
And I know that if you don't get in here

357
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:50,119
these men are gonna die.

358
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,832
I have an idea.

359
00:14:53,837 --> 00:14:56,838
We did it.

360
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,613
Okay. Fine. You did it.

361
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,527
We stopped the bomb. What the
hell are we still doing here?

362
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,346
I don't... I...

363
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:06,049
We must have missed something.

364
00:15:07,718 --> 00:15:08,851
- No!
- No!

365
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,580
No! No!

366
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,525
Tark drives the lane.

367
00:15:16,527 --> 00:15:18,709
Kicks it to Aldrich in the corner for 3.

368
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:19,920
Bingo!

369
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:31,768
All right. Quentin's
death is the reset point,

370
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:33,619
which means that

371
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,597
saving him must be the key.

372
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,581
What kind of sick game
is the Monitor playing?

373
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,250
I don't know. We need to find out

374
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:41,177
who is behind this hostage situation.

375
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,680
If it's just about killing
Quentin, then why plant a bomb?

376
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:45,440
It seems like a lot of extra work.

377
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:47,108
Maybe whoever is behind this wants

378
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,733
their involvement kept a secret.

379
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:51,102
Do you really think there's
a larger conspiracy here?

380
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:52,675
Those were mercenaries, Laurel,

381
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:54,678
which means that
somebody had to hire them.

382
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:58,860
Great, and I'm sure they're
gonna be really easy to find, too.

383
00:15:58,863 --> 00:16:00,455
Any idea where to start?

384
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:02,941
Let's get Quentin out of here.

385
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:05,033
Why don't you take him to the bunker?

386
00:16:05,036 --> 00:16:06,818
What about you?

387
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:10,173
I'm gonna go take a look at that bomb.

388
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:17,788
Laurel, I didn't think
you'd make it tonight.

389
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,836
I am really not in
the mood for small talk

390
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,500
with the Monitor's bestie.

391
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:23,294
- Excuse me.
- It turns out tranq darts,

392
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:24,590
they don't feel so good.

393
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:27,556
I told you that was a
big misunderstanding.

394
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,759
Well, understand this.
The second I get out

395
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:31,969
of this sadistic "edge
of tomorrow" reboot,

396
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,846
I am going to make sure to tell everyone

397
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:36,348
exactly what kind of
traitor you really are.

398
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,068
Laurel, I truly have no idea
what you're talking about,

399
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,162
but whatever it is
you're feeling toward me,

400
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:42,481
that's on you.

401
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:45,073
Thank you for the advice, Dr. Phil,

402
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:47,001
and now here's some for you.

403
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:49,028
The next time you decide
to double-cross someone,

404
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,823
don't pick a woman who
specializes in revenge.

405
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,751
You're threatening me.

406
00:16:54,753 --> 00:16:57,470
Yes. Yes, I am, but don't worry.

407
00:16:57,472 --> 00:16:59,422
You won't remember anyway,

408
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:01,120
and by the way, I pull off

409
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:02,892
the short hair way better than you do.

410
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:12,360
What are you doing here?

411
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:17,348
Well, word came down that the
Green Arrow called in a bomb threat,

412
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,034
so I thought to myself,
"How did he know about that,

413
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:21,443
and why didn't he call me?"

414
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:24,355
Because the Monitor has
me trapped in a time loop.

415
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:26,218
Already told you that.

416
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:28,900
Okay. Definitely not the
answer I was expecting,

417
00:17:28,903 --> 00:17:31,287
but if the Monitor's
involved, anything is possible.

418
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,289
Any idea how to break out?

419
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,717
I have to save Quentin's life.

420
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,385
I thought that this was the key to it,

421
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:39,411
but I'm not finding anything.

422
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:41,413
Well, has to be something.
No case is unsolvable.

423
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:42,965
This might be impossible.

424
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:44,726
Well, you'll figure it out.

425
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:46,803
I do wish I was as sure as you are.

426
00:17:46,805 --> 00:17:49,972
You want to know what
makes me so sure? You.

427
00:17:49,974 --> 00:17:52,091
You, Oliver. You always figure it out.

428
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:54,760
You never stop fighting.
You never give up.

429
00:17:54,762 --> 00:17:56,428
You always keep at it.

430
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,980
Why should this be any different?

431
00:17:57,982 --> 00:18:00,650
Whatever version this is of you,

432
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:02,838
you still give the best advice.

433
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:04,913
- Yeah. I'm flattered.
- Well, A.R.G.U.S. has

434
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:08,366
some more sophisticated
analytical equipment.

435
00:18:08,368 --> 00:18:12,111
Any chance you can get me in there?

436
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:13,880
Yeah. I bet I can make a few calls.

437
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:18,037
So you're telling me we're in some kind

438
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,930
of a alternate reality based on
the plot of a Bill Murray movie?

439
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:25,842
Well, I was gonna go with a
tom cruise flick but basically.

440
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:28,794
Also just really glad
that you believe me.

441
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:30,796
Well, it's not the craziest
thing you ever told me.

442
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:32,320
I mean, I'm just glad this Monitor guy

443
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:33,956
just kept me as mayor, you know?

444
00:18:36,112 --> 00:18:40,439
What? What's that look?

445
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:44,154
It... it's just that, uh, in my world

446
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:48,790
or in the real world, uh,
you're not mayor anymore.

447
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:51,626
Really? Ohh. Pollard.

448
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:54,170
She always had it in for me. Heh.

449
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,576
There something else?

450
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:02,995
Laurel. Sweetheart, I
always know when you're

451
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:04,380
hiding something from me.

452
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:05,664
Please tell me. What is it?

453
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,308
It... it's a year and a half ago

454
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,385
when Diaz... when he shot you

455
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:12,004
in... in the real reality or whatever,

456
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:14,840
you... you didn't exactly, um...

457
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:20,897
I didn't recover.

458
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:24,742
No. No. You died to save me.

459
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:31,523
Best way I could have gone.

460
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:33,743
What?! I'm sorry. I basically just

461
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:37,246
told you you're a ghost, and
you're completely ok with that?

462
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:39,657
It doesn't... it doesn't faze
you? You're completely calm?

463
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:43,085
I always felt like I
cheated death with that one.

464
00:19:43,087 --> 00:19:47,498
Guess that's because I didn't.

465
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,709
Fate's just tricky like that.

466
00:19:56,884 --> 00:19:59,113
- It's Oliver.
- Yeah?

467
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,862
He figure out who wants me dead?

468
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:03,555
Not yet, but he did
figure out the location

469
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:04,890
of the mercs' hideout.

470
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:07,160
Okay. So we better go.

471
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,863
How'd you find this place?

472
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,792
Uh, we analyzed the bomb

473
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,162
and traced the chemical signature

474
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:25,489
back to this building.

475
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,371
Interesting.

476
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:28,823
What?

477
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:31,200
Your mouth but Felicity's words.

478
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:34,254
It still doesn't tell
us who hired these bozos.

479
00:20:34,257 --> 00:20:36,013
Maybe this will help.

480
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:51,788
Bomb!

481
00:20:58,453 --> 00:20:59,803
Ohh.

482
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:12,048
Lyla, what the hell are you doing?

483
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:14,293
Helping you. You're
missing the point, Oliver.

484
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:16,229
- What?
- You can't fight this.

485
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:21,366
Lyla!

486
00:21:25,971 --> 00:21:28,443
Passes it quickly over to the right.

487
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:30,087
Tark drives the lane.

488
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,922
Kicks it to Aldrich in the corner for 3.

489
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,833
Bingo! Count it and the foul!

490
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,523
No sign of Lyla anywhere. You?

491
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:43,267
John just told me she got called away

492
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,770
on a last-minute A.R.G.U.S. mission,

493
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:47,270
meaning she's never even been here.

494
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:50,090
Maybe the Monitor deleted
her for going rogue.

495
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:51,758
Heh. Wouldn't that be so, so sad?

496
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,593
She's clearly helping him.
There's no reason for her

497
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:54,995
to switch sides right now.

498
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:57,076
So why reveal her
hand? It makes no sense.

499
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,881
You spoke with her.

500
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,058
Was there anything, anything at all

501
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:03,144
in the conversation that stood out?

502
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:05,939
She said how I feel
towards her was on me

503
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:09,651
like it's my fault that I'm stuck here.

504
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:13,446
I told you the Monitor's punishing us.

505
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:14,732
I'm not so sure.

506
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:17,541
We've had to watch Quentin
die over and over again,

507
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,378
and we can't save him.

508
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,434
If I had to design
hell, this would be it.

509
00:22:22,437 --> 00:22:24,999
But right before Lyla disappeared,

510
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,335
she told me she was trying to help me.

511
00:22:27,337 --> 00:22:30,839
She also told you you can't fight this.

512
00:22:30,841 --> 00:22:33,650
It seems pretty clear to me
that we're not supposed to win.

513
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,010
The first time that I met Mar Novu,

514
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:38,726
it felt... it felt the same.

515
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:41,307
It was like I was put in a
situation where there was no way out,

516
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:42,926
but it was a test, Laurel.

517
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,451
It was a test just like
I think that this is.

518
00:22:45,454 --> 00:22:47,355
- A test of what?
- I don't know,

519
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:49,649
but there is a way out of here,

520
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:51,270
and I'm gonna find it.

521
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:53,486
- You just never give up, do you?
- No, I don't.

522
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:56,748
Are you with me?

523
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,675
Fine.

524
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,996
What's our play?

525
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,790
We go back to the mercs' hideout.

526
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:04,538
We know where the danger is this time,

527
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,500
so we can do things differently.

528
00:23:07,503 --> 00:23:10,230
You grab Quentin, and
I'll meet you there.

529
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,557
Okay.

530
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:15,267
So you're telling me
we've been here once

531
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,027
and still came back for more?

532
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,696
At least now we know what not to do.

533
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,156
Okay.

534
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:33,026
That should disable the bomb.

535
00:23:33,028 --> 00:23:35,069
Well, I certainly hope
so because I am getting

536
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:36,964
sick and tired of getting blown up.

537
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,146
Okay. So now what?

538
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:43,983
We find out who hired
those mercs to kill you.

539
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,917
Money leads to a man
named Anderson White.

540
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:50,126
Never heard of him.

541
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:51,674
Looks like he's been accused

542
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:53,229
of not too many nice things...

543
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:55,816
Money laundering, racketeering.

544
00:23:55,818 --> 00:23:57,926
Doesn't explain why he'd want me dead.

545
00:23:57,928 --> 00:23:59,945
Well, that's what we're gonna find out.

546
00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:02,745
CEO of a company named Global Solutions.

547
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:04,480
They have a warehouse down by the docks.

548
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:05,791
Let's go.

549
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,707
We need to find white.

550
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:24,169
No! No! I got you.

551
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,579
Come on, come on.

552
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,676
I'll take care of the rest.

553
00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:35,797
Err! Ugh.

554
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,573
Oh, I'm sorry, baby girl.

555
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,443
Looks like we lost this round.

556
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:44,615
No. No! I am not letting you die again.

557
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,433
- It's too late.
- No.

558
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:51,029
It... it's... it's time to say good-bye.

559
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,850
I'm not giving up on you, Quentin.

560
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:55,458
Quentin, I am not giving up on you.

561
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:58,370
You never gave up on me.

562
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,872
You believed in me when nobody else did.

563
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,951
Well, that's what dads do. They believe.

564
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:06,760
I want you to know that you

565
00:25:06,763 --> 00:25:09,663
are the reason that
I'm trying to be a hero.

566
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,308
It's because of you.

567
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,148
Sweetheart... you are a hero.

568
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,467
You are.

569
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:23,303
Thank you.

570
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:25,805
Thank you. I never had
the chance to tell you

571
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:27,566
how much you mean to me.

572
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,496
- Well...
- Thank you.

573
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,906
I think you just did.

574
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,844
I love you. I love you.

575
00:25:56,046 --> 00:25:58,355
Good-bye.

576
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:01,174
Damn it.

577
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:03,860
All right. Okay. All right, Laurel.

578
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,113
We fix this next time. We'll fix it.

579
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,536
I can't do this again.

580
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,538
I'm done, Oliver.

581
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,095
All I have ever wanted was a chance

582
00:26:17,098 --> 00:26:18,750
to say good-bye to Quentin.

583
00:26:22,072 --> 00:26:23,630
Now I have.

584
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:28,284
Tark drives the lane.

585
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,499
Kicks it to Aldrich in the corner for 3.

586
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:34,119
Bingo! Count it and the foul!

587
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:37,394
Laurel?

588
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:41,273
Laurel!

589
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,226
She's not here.

590
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:55,153
- Where is she?
- Gone.

591
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,062
What did you... what did you do, Lyla?

592
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:59,607
I didn't do anything. Laurel
got what she needed from this.

593
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:01,401
I don't have time for these games, Lyla,

594
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:04,070
so whatever this is, get
me out of here right now!

595
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:05,332
I can't do that, Oliver.

596
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:07,165
Mar Movu needs you to understand

597
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,043
no good will come from struggle.

598
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:11,836
The only way to win is
to accept the inevitable.

599
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,122
I have no idea what that means.

600
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:16,767
Learn that, and this will end.

601
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:21,418
Lyla!

602
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:24,702
So if me dying is the problem,

603
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:26,981
maybe bringing me into the
lion's den isn't so smart.

604
00:27:26,984 --> 00:27:29,048
Couldn't think of a better
way to keep you safe.

605
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:30,525
Yeah. That makes sense.

606
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:31,607
Huh!

607
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,210
Ah-ah-ah-ah. Unless you
want a hole for a head.

608
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:38,416
Are you Anderson White?

609
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:40,135
You really think Mr.
White would be here?

610
00:27:40,137 --> 00:27:42,479
He ordered a hit on my friend. Why?

611
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:48,819
I guess the clock's ticking.

612
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:53,590
Looks like a list of hits.

613
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:55,409
And clients. Coded and anonymous.

614
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:56,910
White's just the middleman.

615
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:58,820
A CEO with a healthy
side business brokering

616
00:27:58,822 --> 00:28:00,130
hits for wealthy asshats.

617
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:01,630
All right. We're back to square one.

618
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:03,901
We have no idea how deep
this rabbit hole goes.

619
00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:05,654
We got to get going.

620
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:13,839
Unh!

621
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:31,611
Get down! Get down!

622
00:28:34,307 --> 00:28:38,309
Hey. You okay? You all right? Okay.

623
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:39,786
No time. Come on.

624
00:28:42,407 --> 00:28:45,066
Come on.

625
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:46,943
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

626
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:48,295
Whoa!

627
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:54,051
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

628
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,223
Go, go, go.

629
00:29:20,145 --> 00:29:22,145
Let's go.

630
00:29:22,147 --> 00:29:23,747
Get down, get down!

631
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:35,342
Over there!

632
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:44,970
Ohh. Oh, it's the last one.

633
00:29:44,973 --> 00:29:47,002
How many arrows you got left?

634
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:51,159
Not enough.

635
00:29:51,162 --> 00:29:53,526
Oh, boy. Aren't we the couple?

636
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:55,937
We are gonna find a way out of this.

637
00:29:55,939 --> 00:29:57,847
There has to be a way to fix it,

638
00:29:57,849 --> 00:29:59,113
and we are gonna find it, Quentin.

639
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:01,349
It doesn't matter how many
times. We're gonna find it!

640
00:30:01,352 --> 00:30:03,368
Heh heh. Yeah? Sure. What's it gonna be,

641
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:05,521
60 times, 100 times?

642
00:30:05,523 --> 00:30:07,624
It's gonna be however
many times it takes!

643
00:30:10,904 --> 00:30:14,530
You know, getting hunted like this

644
00:30:14,532 --> 00:30:16,073
in a space like this is kind of like

645
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:17,884
what I was doing to
you all those years ago.

646
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:19,535
Remember?

647
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:25,420
Ohh. Oof.

648
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,136
Sort of makes sense I'd go out
like this now, don't you think?

649
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:30,087
Would you please just
save your strength.

650
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,883
For what?

651
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:36,385
Oliver, you take care of these guys,

652
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:37,571
there'll be more behind them,

653
00:30:37,573 --> 00:30:38,888
there will be more behind them.

654
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,191
There is no saving me from this!

655
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:45,745
Okay? You ever think that's the point?

656
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:49,491
Maybe you're not supposed to.

657
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:53,086
I'm not giving up...

658
00:30:53,088 --> 00:30:55,780
And you're not giving up either.

659
00:30:55,782 --> 00:30:58,758
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not giving up.

660
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,669
Maybe I'm giving in.

661
00:31:01,671 --> 00:31:05,340
You see, I've been outrunning
death for a while now.

662
00:31:05,342 --> 00:31:08,251
The siege, the island,

663
00:31:08,253 --> 00:31:12,296
but when Diaz shot
me, that felt different

664
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:17,134
like I was finally at the end,

665
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:19,237
and I made my peace with that.

666
00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:26,703
And maybe it's time you did, too.

667
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:38,455
It looks like fate's knocking.

668
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:40,800
Just... just...

669
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:43,261
You just get ready to move.

670
00:31:56,944 --> 00:31:58,992
I'll see you on the other side, Oliver.

671
00:32:04,234 --> 00:32:05,492
Quentin.

672
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:14,620
Tark drives the lane.

673
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:16,881
Kicks it to Aldrich in the corner for 3.

674
00:32:16,883 --> 00:32:20,218
Bingo! Count it and the foul!

675
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,128
That's an 8-0 run by the Comets,

676
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,639
who have stormed all the way back
to tie it up here in the fourth quarter.

677
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:29,893
88 apiece. What a
comeback for the Comets,

678
00:32:29,895 --> 00:32:31,570
and there's a timeout...

679
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:56,012
No way. It tastes the same.

680
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:59,424
Dad, what are you still doing here?

681
00:32:59,426 --> 00:33:04,044
Hey, guys. I'm just
heading out the door.

682
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:06,597
Wanted to let you know, all of you know

683
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:12,028
what a... just what a gift

684
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,388
getting to know you all has been.

685
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,866
Dad, you're going to a fundraiser.

686
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:18,701
It's not like you're going into war.

687
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:19,819
Heh heh.

688
00:33:19,822 --> 00:33:22,688
Although I guess I can
see the similarities.

689
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,609
I think he's talking about Crisis.

690
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:31,989
I'm just really proud of all you guys.

691
00:33:31,991 --> 00:33:33,425
I'm really proud.

692
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:38,221
I got to go.

693
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:39,514
Dad...

694
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,086
You're gonna be fine.

695
00:33:46,088 --> 00:33:48,339
So are you.

696
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:51,217
All of you will be

697
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:52,610
whatever happens.

698
00:33:58,985 --> 00:34:00,726
Hey, Queen. What's the difference

699
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:03,204
between a cop... hey!

700
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:13,998
Quentin, excuse me.

701
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,574
Yeah.

702
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:16,909
What's the matter, Oliver?

703
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:18,761
You look like you've seen a ghost.

704
00:34:18,763 --> 00:34:20,838
Maybe I did.

705
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,932
May I speak with you for a second?

706
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:25,602
Sure.

707
00:34:25,604 --> 00:34:27,795
Uh, yeah, you want
to go over the speech?

708
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:30,463
Because I was thinking
about adding a few lines.

709
00:34:33,302 --> 00:34:34,611
I have a question for you.

710
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:36,804
Sure.

711
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:39,960
Back when I was running
around as the hood,

712
00:34:39,963 --> 00:34:41,438
you were trying to arrest me.

713
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:43,434
- You remember that?
- Heh heh heh.

714
00:34:43,437 --> 00:34:45,819
Ah. Yeah. The good, old days.

715
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:47,704
How could I ever forget?

716
00:34:47,707 --> 00:34:49,515
The question is...

717
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:54,631
What made you decide that I wasn't

718
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:57,408
your enemy anymore?

719
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,661
What changed your mind?

720
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:05,011
Heh. Oh, you know, my daughters for one.

721
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:06,656
Because I didn't raise dummies,

722
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:08,960
and, uh, you know, if
they were okay with you,

723
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:11,589
then I figured I should be, too.

724
00:35:11,591 --> 00:35:15,626
- Yeah.
- They trusted me,

725
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:17,251
and you trusted them.

726
00:35:17,254 --> 00:35:19,138
Yeah. They got me to
listen to what I always knew

727
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,399
in my gut, that we were on the same side

728
00:35:21,401 --> 00:35:23,493
and fighting for the same goal,

729
00:35:23,495 --> 00:35:26,532
and it just took me
a while to get there.

730
00:35:26,535 --> 00:35:28,243
Sorry.

731
00:35:28,246 --> 00:35:30,287
It's okay.

732
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,076
Oliver, is there any particular reason

733
00:35:32,078 --> 00:35:34,153
for this trip down memory lane?

734
00:35:34,155 --> 00:35:35,421
Yeah.

735
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:41,261
God, I've been hanging on to something.

736
00:35:43,998 --> 00:35:45,848
Someone told me just recently that,

737
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:49,644
uh... it's about time
I made peace with it.

738
00:35:52,691 --> 00:35:56,317
Okay. Sounds like a smart someone.

739
00:36:00,365 --> 00:36:01,864
Yeah.

740
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:08,895
Oh, I shouldn't have to
say good-bye to you again.

741
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:12,283
Good-bye?

742
00:36:12,285 --> 00:36:15,402
Evening's just getting started.

743
00:36:15,404 --> 00:36:16,879
Yeah.

744
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:23,011
Thank you, Quentin for everything.

745
00:36:24,914 --> 00:36:26,396
Mr. Mayor.

746
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:28,192
We're gonna see each
other again, Oliver.

747
00:36:28,195 --> 00:36:29,694
Mr. Mayor!

748
00:36:31,712 --> 00:36:33,062
Ahem.

749
00:36:34,733 --> 00:36:36,774
I hope so.

750
00:37:01,926 --> 00:37:04,576
Congratulations, Oliver.

751
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:06,179
Now you understand.

752
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:11,550
I couldn't change Quentin's fate.

753
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:17,047
I can't change mine either, can I?

754
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,610
No. I'm sorry.

755
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:24,447
Why did the Monitor go to all

756
00:37:24,449 --> 00:37:27,692
of this trouble just to...

757
00:37:27,694 --> 00:37:29,309
Just to prove a point?

758
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:31,028
You've always been a man who needed to

759
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,122
see things for himself.

760
00:37:33,124 --> 00:37:36,209
Telling you wouldn't have been enough.

761
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:38,277
How long have you worked for him?

762
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:39,611
A while.

763
00:37:39,613 --> 00:37:42,167
You lied to us, Lyla.

764
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,655
You...

765
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:47,136
You lied to John.

766
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:48,638
Keeping this from John has been

767
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,139
the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

768
00:37:50,141 --> 00:37:51,247
Then why do it?

769
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,791
The same reason you
left Felicity and Mia

770
00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:56,837
in that cabin... to protect my family.

771
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:59,006
Do you honestly believe that working

772
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:01,967
with the Monitor is
the best way to do that?

773
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:03,561
It's the only way.

774
00:38:03,563 --> 00:38:06,316
The Crisis is coming.
There is no stopping it.

775
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:08,348
All we can do is try to survive it.

776
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,017
Okay. Help me out here, Lyla.

777
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:12,737
I don't even know what it is.

778
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:17,900
I know, but you will... soon.

779
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:19,577
What I can tell you

780
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:21,245
is there is an evil
coming that is greater

781
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:23,589
than anything we've ever had to face.

782
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:30,204
Can we stop it?

783
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:33,040
I don't know...

784
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:35,226
But you are the only chance we have.

785
00:38:38,506 --> 00:38:40,598
So everything I've done

786
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,193
from the moment I left that cabin,

787
00:38:44,195 --> 00:38:47,530
this has all been some...

788
00:38:47,532 --> 00:38:49,389
Bigger part of a test?

789
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:51,609
He needed to be sure you were ready.

790
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:54,561
He's just been sending
me on useless missions.

791
00:38:54,563 --> 00:38:55,946
They weren't useless.

792
00:38:55,948 --> 00:38:58,282
The Dwarf Star particles, Dr. Wong,

793
00:38:58,284 --> 00:39:00,234
even the antimatter weapon,

794
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:01,860
they all have a purpose,

795
00:39:01,862 --> 00:39:04,046
just not the one you were expecting.

796
00:39:10,555 --> 00:39:12,847
Why did he involve my children?

797
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:14,849
Time is a gift.

798
00:39:20,473 --> 00:39:22,047
What now?

799
00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:23,733
You complete your final mission.

800
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:28,780
I'll see you there.

801
00:39:44,255 --> 00:39:46,923
Ohh.

802
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:48,382
Where are we?

803
00:39:50,578 --> 00:39:53,421
You okay?

804
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,630
I have a killer headache.

805
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:59,251
The last thing that I
remember is Quentin...

806
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:02,271
dying in that warehouse.

807
00:40:02,273 --> 00:40:04,515
I was wearing these on the roof

808
00:40:04,517 --> 00:40:08,594
when we got tranqed, so
does that mean that...

809
00:40:08,596 --> 00:40:10,596
We got out.

810
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:13,357
How?

811
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,142
We learned our lessons.

812
00:40:15,144 --> 00:40:17,936
I got out after I said good-bye.

813
00:40:17,938 --> 00:40:20,698
Why would the Monitor let
me see Quentin one last time?

814
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,711
It was a reward for not betraying me.

815
00:40:25,713 --> 00:40:28,297
Didn't really think
rewards were his brand.

816
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:32,209
No. We were wrong about him.

817
00:40:32,211 --> 00:40:35,212
And Lyla was right?

818
00:40:35,214 --> 00:40:37,339
That's annoying.

819
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:39,642
So why did you have to
learn to let Lance go?

820
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:43,837
Because deep down, I still believed

821
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,148
that I could fight my fate.

822
00:40:49,845 --> 00:40:51,404
Now I know I can't.

823
00:40:57,144 --> 00:41:00,520
Lyla said we had one last thing to do,

824
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:02,814
one final mission.

825
00:41:02,816 --> 00:41:05,084
I can't wait to find out what that is.

826
00:41:06,695 --> 00:41:09,839
Where that is.

827
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:11,841
We're not in Star City anymore.

828
00:41:15,162 --> 00:41:16,387
Dad.

829
00:41:19,091 --> 00:41:20,707
You okay?

830
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:22,101
Where the hell are we?

831
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:28,024
We're on Lian Yu.

832
00:41:39,793 --> 00:41:43,918
