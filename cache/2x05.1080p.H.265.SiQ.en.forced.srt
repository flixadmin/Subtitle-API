1
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:39,127
I'm sure you recognise some
of these people, right? Agent Peña?

2
00:00:41,463 --> 00:00:44,216
It looks like you raided
the family album...

3
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,094
Mrs Moncada.

4
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,471
Please, call me Judy.

5
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:52,558
Let me tell you...

6
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:56,395
before this son of a bitch
killed my husband and my brother,

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,439
all these people were my friends.
What do you think of that?

8
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:03,902
Well, it looks to me
like you made some new friends. No?

9
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:08,824
We might say
that we share a common goal.

10
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:13,579
- The same as yours, Agent Peña.
- Is that right?

11
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:14,913
Yes.

12
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:23,463
Wait, Javier.

13
00:01:24,673 --> 00:01:27,759
I'd like you to listen
to what we have to say.

14
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:32,055
You want to catch Escobar,
just like we do.

15
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:35,684
But let's not lie to ourselves.

16
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:38,520
You haven't been able
to get close to him.

17
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:43,859
The only play you had to get to him
was using Carrillo.

18
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:46,737
And we know how that ended, right?

19
00:01:46,862 --> 00:01:51,700
So, you're taking a break
from burning down villages?

20
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:56,788
What we do is fill in
for an absent government.

21
00:01:56,913 --> 00:02:01,752
We're going to kill everyone
close to Escobar one by one.

22
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:05,631
Until he's alone. With nothing.

23
00:02:06,715 --> 00:02:09,301
What we want, Mr Peña,

24
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:13,138
is to make Escobar understand
he is not untouchable.

25
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,015
We want him to be afraid.

26
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,559
There's just one small problem.

27
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:19,895
Just one?

28
00:02:20,562 --> 00:02:27,110
To catch him, we need the satellite
technology and surveillance

29
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:30,238
that your government has, Agent Peña.

30
00:02:30,364 --> 00:02:33,700
And I'm just going to...
hand that over to you?

31
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:37,329
We have been partners for a while now,
Agent Pena.

32
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:40,832
All the information that he gave to you,
I gave to him.

33
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:47,297
We are simply making...
a small adjustment.

34
00:03:00,477 --> 00:03:02,020
Thanks for the drink.

35
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:24,793
Too much stupidity for my liking.

36
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:29,589
The Castaños can be useful.

37
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:32,634
I was talking about you.

38
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:36,388
Yes, Javier.

39
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:39,307
I'm a narco.

40
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:43,520
And I believe in honour and loyalty,
like you.

41
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:46,148
Pablo doesn't.

42
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:49,234
Berna. Go get the car.

43
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:03,498
Are you going to give me a cigarette
or what?

44
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:21,767
Well...

45
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:27,397
we really want you to realise,
Agent Peña,

46
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:30,692
the potential of what we're offering you.

47
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,949
Because, well...
with all the information in the world,

48
00:04:38,074 --> 00:04:40,869
you still have to be a policeman, right?

49
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:48,210
I know what it feels like
when Pablo kills someone close to you.

50
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:53,423
What's that?

51
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:55,884
Information that would be
very valuable to you.

52
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:59,095
That was very easy for us to find.
Take it.

53
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:07,979
She's staying with a friend.
That little girl, Maritza.

54
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:12,067
The woman that betrayed you
and got Carrillo killed.

55
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:13,610
You'll find her there.

56
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:20,909
I told you we have an enemy
in common.

57
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:32,254
If you change your mind,
give us a ring.

58
00:07:58,274 --> 00:07:59,818
LEADER OF SEARCH BLOC KILLED:
COLONEL HORACIO CARRILLO

59
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,411
- Look, Dad.
- Let's see.

60
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,462
- Nine point seven.
- Why?

61
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:04,591
I would've given you a ten,
but here, next to me,

62
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:09,012
is an Argentinian judge
who's very picky.

63
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:12,932
Very picky.

64
00:09:13,058 --> 00:09:15,268
Why don't you jump in here
with me?

65
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:18,646
If I dive in there,
I'd splash all the water out of the pool.

66
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,779
Sir, Fernando Duque is here.

67
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:29,783
And you... And what are you doing,
my little love?

68
00:09:29,908 --> 00:09:33,620
That's it. Little kicks, little kicks.
Like a little pair of scissors.

69
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:35,663
That's right, like a little puppy.

70
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:37,248
That's it, beautiful.

71
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,959
Hey, ladies.

72
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:45,507
My kids are in the pool.
Does someone know how to swim?

73
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:48,843
- Yeah, boss, they call me "Flipper."
- Flipper?

74
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:50,678
You talk so much shit, Blackie.

75
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:53,056
You'd sink like a rock tied
to a heavier rock.

76
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:54,474
Eat shit, Velasco.

77
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,976
- Velasco, I'm putting my trust in you.
- Yes, sir.

78
00:09:57,102 --> 00:09:58,394
Not in Flipper.

79
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:01,064
Flipper.

80
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:05,026
"They call me Flipper."

81
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,825
- What's the score?
- Two to zero.

82
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,077
The National team is winning.
We're killing them!

83
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:15,995
That's it!

84
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:36,224
Careful with that little dance.
You're starting to put ideas in my head.

85
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:39,435
Love, who is picking up Carlos?

86
00:10:39,561 --> 00:10:42,564
La Quica. He's on his way.

87
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:46,234
That smells good.

88
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,822
Pablo, the kids love this place.

89
00:10:50,947 --> 00:10:52,824
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

90
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:12,760
On your feet. Now!

91
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:18,308
I didn't know. I didn't know, I swear.
Limón lied to me.

92
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:22,979
No, please. When they find me,
they're going to kill me.

93
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:24,814
- No!
- Stay still!

94
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:27,025
Please.

95
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:31,237
Do you think I wanted this?

96
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:34,866
They used me
and they're throwing my life away.

97
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:43,416
You're all the same.

98
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,502
You don't listen. Nobody listens!

99
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:49,923
And all those people dying
for no reason.

100
00:11:54,385 --> 00:11:57,180
What's up, Peña?
What should we do with her?

101
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,660
Is that your father?

102
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:26,829
Over there with the president?

103
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,544
That's cool.

104
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:47,350
To all those present,
it is my honour to present

105
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:50,686
the President of the Republic...

106
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:57,777
His Excellency,
Don César Augusto Gaviria Trujillo.

107
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,454
Congratulations, Class of 1992.

108
00:15:09,872 --> 00:15:11,666
Recent events...

109
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:16,254
contrast heavily with today's ceremony.

110
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:23,511
Each one of you has decided to sacrifice
your personal interests...

111
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:29,142
and dedicate your lives
to the service of the nation.

112
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:34,272
There is no higher honour...

113
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:38,443
than to serve your homeland.

114
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,078
- Colonel, how are you doing?
- Very well.

115
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:51,539
I enjoyed your speech very much,
Mr President.

116
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:53,958
I'm glad. It was also for you.

117
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:01,299
Look, Colonel, in the last 24 hours,
I've been discussing with my advisors

118
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:04,177
who should be at the head
of the Search Bloc.

119
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:07,096
They mentioned many names.

120
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:10,641
But I would like it to be you,
Colonel Martinez.

121
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:15,730
That's an honour, Mr President,
but at this point in my career,

122
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:17,648
I'm sure you can find
a better candidate.

123
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:21,068
Colombia wants to end this nightmare.

124
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:24,697
And I know you're the man to do it.

125
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:28,451
The nation deserves someone
better than me.

126
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:35,458
Your son was one of the best
in the academy. He's an excellent cadet.

127
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,835
He worked very hard.
I'm very proud of him.

128
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:43,799
We asked the best in the class
to join the Search Bloc.

129
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,928
And your son happily accepted.

130
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:53,017
I ask that you at least
consider my request.

131
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:55,770
For Colombia.

132
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,039
- Carlos!
- Tata!

133
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:22,421
Come on, come on. Let's see.

134
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:24,590
Go ahead.

135
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:28,135
- I can't believe it. Look at you.
- Slowly.

136
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:30,846
I don't want any more visits
to the doctor.

137
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:33,224
Manuela, you're so beautiful.
Look at me.

138
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,976
Look how tanned he is.

139
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:39,063
- He looks like a movie star, right?
- Yes, boss.

140
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:41,148
- He looks like Tom Cruise.
- Well...

141
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:42,441
Look at her, Pablo.

142
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,403
I can't believe you brought me all the way
from Miami to see my sister like this.

143
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:48,656
No. I'm just so happy to see you.

144
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:52,952
Oh, my God. Carlos!

145
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:58,416
Welcome, sweetie.
I'm so happy to have you home.

146
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,669
Tonight, I am going to make
the best meal this family has ever had.

147
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,756
Well, then...
ready to go for a little walk?

148
00:18:06,674 --> 00:18:09,844
It's incredible how much the children
have grown, Pablo.

149
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:12,763
Manuelita is a princess.
She is beautiful.

150
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:17,101
She's the one who controls everything
around here. I just pay the bills.

151
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:19,895
I heard about Carrillo.

152
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:24,317
If that son of a bitch was still alive,
many more policemen would have died.

153
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:28,362
I did the police a favour.
Believe me.

154
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:31,365
Do you think the police
agree with you?

155
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,783
No one wants war, Carlos.

156
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:35,745
Especially when they know
they would lose.

157
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:38,956
But all that's in the past.

158
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:44,837
And I'm ready to get back to business.
I'm all in.

159
00:18:44,962 --> 00:18:48,341
- Tell me about Miami.
- What can I tell you, Pablo?

160
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:52,178
The demand keeps increasing
and the merchandise keeps on coming.

161
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:55,181
Business hasn't been affected
by what happened at La Catedral,

162
00:18:55,306 --> 00:18:56,849
nor by what you did.

163
00:18:58,476 --> 00:19:01,729
Well, business can always
get better, right?

164
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:40,494
Let's bring the Lion over here.

165
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:44,874
I want to speak to him face to face,
like the old days.

166
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:47,543
- OK.
- Make some new arrangements.

167
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:49,420
Some better ones.

168
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:51,464
Quica.

169
00:20:53,048 --> 00:20:56,552
Give Velasco a call.
Tell him to find the Lion.

170
00:20:56,677 --> 00:20:59,054
Carlos and I want to speak to him
about business.

171
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:05,478
It's time to get back
to making money, brother.

172
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:07,980
- Like the good old days, Pablo.
- Exactly.

173
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:21,952
What's up, Maritza?

174
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:24,497
What happened?

175
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:31,045
The police are looking for me.
They want to put a bullet in my head.

176
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,965
I'm sorry, Maritza. I thought something
good would come from all this.

177
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,550
Something good?

178
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:43,307
Let me come work with you.

179
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,935
No, Maritza, you're crazy.

180
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,731
I have to get this.

181
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:52,107
Give me one second.

182
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:56,612
What's up?

183
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:59,073
Where the fuck are you, Limón?

184
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:01,158
Think you can make me wait around
for you, bitch?

185
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:03,369
I'm close by, man.

186
00:22:03,494 --> 00:22:06,872
I mean, there's a lot of goddamn traffic,
but I'm on my way.

187
00:22:06,997 --> 00:22:10,751
<i>I don't give a fuck if there's traffic.
I need you here now!</i>

188
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:14,547
You have to take this shit with you,
so get your ass over here. Right now.

189
00:22:14,672 --> 00:22:18,467
Yes, I know, I know.
Forgive me. I'm on my way.

190
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:33,816
Maritza, I have to go.
I can't help you right now.

191
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:37,027
We already gave you money.
I'll call you later.

192
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:40,906
And we'll figure it out,
but I can't right now.

193
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:02,363
- <i>Search Bloc.</i>
- It's Peña.

194
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,823
I'm here with Trujillo at the corner
of 38th and 24th streets.

195
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:06,116
We need back up.

196
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:08,661
<i>I'm sorry, but there's no authorisation
to dispatch patrols.</i>

197
00:24:08,786 --> 00:24:13,040
We're watching one of Escobar's guys.
He just entered the building.

198
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:14,750
<i>Return to base with the location.</i>

199
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,753
<i>We can ask for authorisation
from Bogotà.</i>

200
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:19,380
Sure.

201
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:22,633
And you'll show up next Tuesday,
son of a bitch.

202
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:29,640
What time were you supposed
to be here, asshole?

203
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:33,018
You knew you had to make the delivery
before picking up Lion tomorrow.

204
00:24:33,143 --> 00:24:35,688
No, brother, don't get mad.
It's just that...

205
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:36,939
Limón!

206
00:24:37,481 --> 00:24:40,067
You're going to take this goddamn bag
and get out of here now!

207
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,193
I'm watching you.

208
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:43,028
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

209
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:46,407
This is the last time you pull shit
like this, Limón. The last time!

210
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:52,371
- This is the last time you make me wait.
- Come on, man...

211
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:54,331
I told you. Get out of here.

212
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:58,711
Shit. What do we do?

213
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:01,380
We stick with Velasco.
The other one doesn't matter.

214
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:05,009
How many guys
do you think are inside, Peña?

215
00:25:06,844 --> 00:25:08,637
Too many for just us two, no?

216
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:11,598
Yeah. We'd be screwed.

217
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:16,270
Son of a bitch.
We should call for backup, right?

218
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,278
Who are you calling?

219
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:51,847
- What's going on, Peña?
- I'll handle this.

220
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:08,030
This is Trujillo. You can trust him.

221
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,700
You are finally seeing the light, Javier.

222
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:15,329
Let's just see if this works.

223
00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:18,957
You two coming?

224
00:26:22,086 --> 00:26:25,923
OK, then.
You two, in the front with me.

225
00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:29,051
Berna, with his men, around back.
Understood?

226
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:32,930
Just stay clear of the windows.

227
00:26:33,055 --> 00:26:35,182
- Let's go, then.
- Let's move.

228
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,894
- They're everywhere.
- Let's go down.

229
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:23,267
Where were you going,
you filthy son of a bitch?

230
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:39,283
Here it is, Mrs Escobar.

231
00:29:40,742 --> 00:29:43,370
- What's that?
- It's a delivery.

232
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:46,081
- But who told you to buy this?
- It was me.

233
00:29:47,374 --> 00:29:49,042
It's some clothes.

234
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:51,211
Hermilda.

235
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:56,258
Hermilda, for God's sake... you can't
send him out with so much money.

236
00:29:56,383 --> 00:29:58,927
- Oh, Tata!
- They are going to know where we are.

237
00:29:59,052 --> 00:30:01,054
You worry too much.

238
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:06,643
It's going to affect the children. Do you
want Juan Pablo and Manuela to worry?

239
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:12,024
You're right.

240
00:30:16,153 --> 00:30:18,238
When Pablo was a little boy...

241
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:24,286
he came home from school one day,
very angry.

242
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:29,624
A little girl made fun of his shoes.

243
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:33,211
They were ragged.

244
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:37,049
And we didn't have any money
to buy him new ones.

245
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:42,471
But that night, I went into town
and I stole a pair from a store.

246
00:30:42,596 --> 00:30:45,098
The next day,
Pablo went back to school.

247
00:30:49,936 --> 00:30:54,232
Being poor is not an excuse
to look like you are.

248
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:59,780
You've always just taken
what you wanted, right?

249
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:01,573
And Pablo as well.

250
00:32:24,156 --> 00:32:25,407
It worked.

251
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:28,076
We're even.

252
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:33,415
I need you to help me get a visa
and get my family out of Medellin.

253
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,625
Somewhere Pablo can't find us.

254
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:39,129
It doesn't work like that.

255
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:41,089
I'm sorry.

256
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:43,300
So, then...?

257
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:46,303
How am I supposed to be OK?

258
00:33:14,247 --> 00:33:17,083
Is this how things are going to work
from now on, Pena?

259
00:33:18,502 --> 00:33:22,422
Don't worry about it, OK?
It won't happen again.

260
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,259
No. I'm not worried.

261
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:39,105
Leave us.

262
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:48,490
Life's funny, Velasco.

263
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:52,577
This could easily
have ended up in reverse.

264
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,542
Me lying there,
you and your men ready to torture me.

265
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,295
Look how everything's changed.

266
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:17,310
We are both loyal soldiers.

267
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:24,442
Serving our generals.

268
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:27,654
But you know what?

269
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:31,950
When it's time to give up your boss...

270
00:34:35,996 --> 00:34:38,290
we give up our boss.

271
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:50,552
Ma'am, nothing about Pablo, but...
he gave up this.

272
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,107
- Three of his accountants.
- And their addresses.

273
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:08,194
He also told me Pablo
still has a large army and a lot of money.

274
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,865
Yes, but that could be complete bullshit,
no? To scare us off.

275
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,287
Or it could be true.
To scare us off.

276
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:26,713
There lies the key.

277
00:35:27,464 --> 00:35:31,176
If we leave him without money,
we leave him without an army.

278
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,386
Something else.

279
00:35:33,511 --> 00:35:35,555
Velasco was going to the airport
tomorrow

280
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,683
because the Lion will be arriving
in the afternoon from Miami.

281
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:49,694
Excuse me, sir.
It's Judy Moncada.

282
00:35:58,453 --> 00:35:59,871
Mrs Moncada.

283
00:36:01,498 --> 00:36:03,583
How can I help you?

284
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:24,646
How was your trip?
You must be beat.

285
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:27,857
Where's Velasco?

286
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:50,672
There he is.

287
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:53,508
Welcome.

288
00:36:54,718 --> 00:36:57,762
- Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela.
- Lion.

289
00:36:58,722 --> 00:37:00,682
This is my brother, Miguel.

290
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:03,351
And this gentleman is our associate,
Pacho Herrera.

291
00:37:03,476 --> 00:37:07,188
I'm very pleased to meet you, gentlemen.
It's a pleasure.

292
00:37:07,814 --> 00:37:10,483
Lion... May I call you that?

293
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:14,487
- Yes, sir.
- Have a drink. Relax.

294
00:37:16,072 --> 00:37:18,908
They say, over there,
that you like whiskey.

295
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:24,330
Listen, gentlemen,
if I did something to offend you, or...

296
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:30,003
What? Would we offer you a drink
if we were offended?

297
00:37:31,546 --> 00:37:32,547
Have a seat.

298
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,394
Tell me something, Lion.

299
00:37:47,437 --> 00:37:50,064
Do you like working for a thug?

300
00:37:57,113 --> 00:37:58,490
<i>One...</i>

301
00:37:58,615 --> 00:38:02,327
two, three!

302
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:03,995
Very good.

303
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:06,414
Good job.

304
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:07,999
Look after your sister.

305
00:38:13,505 --> 00:38:14,839
What happened?

306
00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:16,591
Hey, boss...

307
00:38:17,884 --> 00:38:20,053
Lion just called, sir.

308
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:23,681
He said Velasco never showed up
at the airport, sir.

309
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:27,852
Lion got scared shitless and left.
He took a plane back to Miami.

310
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:32,315
Fucking Lion.
Is he a little bitch or what, brother?

311
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,694
- And where is Velasco?
- Boss, I have no idea.

312
00:38:38,613 --> 00:38:40,698
Find him for me.

313
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:42,742
Right away, boss.

314
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:55,338
I can't believe you're cooking, Tata.

315
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:58,132
But you know
I always helped my mother.

316
00:38:59,092 --> 00:39:00,760
I helped while you ate.

317
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:08,810
You know, I'm very happy
that Pablo brought me here.

318
00:39:08,935 --> 00:39:10,812
But I'm worried about you.

319
00:39:10,937 --> 00:39:13,815
No. There's no reason to worry.

320
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,775
For God's sake, Tata.

321
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,945
Every cop in the country
is looking for Pablo.

322
00:39:19,612 --> 00:39:22,824
Every drug trafficker
who's not from Medellin wants him dead.

323
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:26,369
And you're telling me there's no reason
to worry? Don't kid yourself.

324
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:30,707
Today is a good day, Carlos.

325
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:33,793
My family is all together.
You're here.

326
00:39:38,006 --> 00:39:42,552
Pablo is a strong man.
He's always had to be.

327
00:39:42,677 --> 00:39:44,721
There's no reason
to change anything now.

328
00:39:55,982 --> 00:39:57,942
I hope you're hungry.

329
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:13,917
Come inside, I'm packing.

330
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:16,586
Are you going to let me go to Medellin
or what?

331
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,422
Is that why you accepted the job?

332
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:21,716
You never should have volunteered.

333
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:26,054
But you can't be reassigned now,
because it would end your career, right?

334
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:28,973
Sure, only now I'm gonna be
"the boss's son."

335
00:40:32,018 --> 00:40:34,604
It appears to me you don't understand
what's happening.

336
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:38,358
I accepted because I wanted
to help my country.

337
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,071
Come here.
I want to show you something.

338
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:49,744
I received this urn with my name.

339
00:40:53,414 --> 00:40:55,875
Look. On behalf of Pablo Escobar.

340
00:40:58,878 --> 00:41:00,630
It's an obituary.

341
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:07,428
Look, son, you're going to do
exactly as I tell you.

342
00:41:07,553 --> 00:41:10,098
I'm going to make sure you survive this.
Understand?

343
00:42:22,003 --> 00:42:26,883
From now on, the Search Bloc is going
to operate in a more systematic fashion.

344
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:32,555
Since we unfortunately cannot rely on
the information given to us

345
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,307
by the people of Medellin...

346
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:39,520
we are going to implement
a quadrant search.

347
00:42:40,855 --> 00:42:43,107
We will position ourselves
in the neighbourhoods

348
00:42:43,232 --> 00:42:46,402
where we believe Escobar
and his allies might be,

349
00:42:46,527 --> 00:42:49,238
proceed to search them...

350
00:42:50,615 --> 00:42:53,076
and if we don't find
what we're looking for,

351
00:42:53,201 --> 00:42:56,996
we'll process anything of value
and continue on to the next one.

352
00:42:57,455 --> 00:43:00,500
- Understood?
- Yes, Colonel!

353
00:44:10,528 --> 00:44:12,572
What did you find out from Velasco?

354
00:44:15,449 --> 00:44:17,243
Not a fucking thing.

355
00:44:17,952 --> 00:44:21,622
That son of a bitch turned out to be
a lot tougher than I thought.

356
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,055
Is that what I think it is?

357
00:44:43,227 --> 00:44:44,896
Rules of the game:

358
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:50,067
we only go after armed people.
<i>sicarios.</i>

359
00:44:51,277 --> 00:44:57,074
There won't be any information
about businesses or labs or shipments.

360
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,038
This isn't about helping Judy.
This is about killing Pablo.

361
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:10,630
Well, then...

362
00:45:12,924 --> 00:45:15,051
here's to killing Pablo.

363
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:27,855
For Colombia!

364
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:13,818
Follow me and cover me!

365
00:47:01,157 --> 00:47:02,408
Boss?

366
00:47:06,287 --> 00:47:11,792
Sorry to bother you, but something bad
is happening in the city, boss.

367
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:15,254
Five of our men, dead.

368
00:47:16,547 --> 00:47:18,049
Who was it?

369
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:22,928
I don't know, boss. If I knew,
I'd kill the son of a bitch that did it.

370
00:47:23,054 --> 00:47:26,766
Boss, I'm so sorry,
but La Quica's on the phone.

371
00:47:39,862 --> 00:47:43,407
<i>- And Velasco?
- It looks like a battlefield, boss.</i>

372
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:51,582
No one's seen Velasco
and no one knows where he is. Boss...

373
00:47:51,707 --> 00:47:54,210
<i>you know that if someone
grabbed Velasco...</i>

374
00:47:55,002 --> 00:47:56,128
Yes.

375
00:48:06,514 --> 00:48:08,474
Start packing.

376
00:48:11,644 --> 00:48:14,772
Your turn, let's do it again.

377
00:48:14,897 --> 00:48:17,400
My little rock made of paper...

378
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:22,988
how much do you want to eat?

379
00:48:23,114 --> 00:48:26,742
Show your grandmother
how you washed your hands.

380
00:48:38,212 --> 00:48:39,839
Looks good.

381
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:42,716
Pardon me.

382
00:48:47,513 --> 00:48:48,806
Should we start?

383
00:48:50,349 --> 00:48:51,892
Dig in, dig in.

384
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,980
So good.

385
00:48:56,105 --> 00:48:57,273
A spoon?

386
00:48:57,398 --> 00:49:00,234
There's no spoon, love.
How about a fork?

387
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,051
The Castaños are very efficient.

388
00:50:07,176 --> 00:50:09,261
But not very discreet.

389
00:50:12,223 --> 00:50:16,227
No one can know
we had anything to do with this.

390
00:50:19,772 --> 00:50:21,315
Excuse me.
