1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,200
Thank you for notifying us
of Detective Hunter's whereabouts.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,240
Now the Legends
are free to fly the skies?

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,840
The Time Bureau
has bigger things to worry about

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,920
than a bunch of idiots.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,480
Mallus is getting stronger,
Captain Lance.

7
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,560
<i>There is a war coming
and history needs you to be ready.</i>

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,120
- Do I know you?
- No, no.

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,240
I'm Marty.

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,000
So, you're Leonard Snart's
doppelganger?

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,320
No, I'm Leonard Snart,
but you can call me Leo.

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,640
I'm asking you to let me die,
so that you may live.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,480
{\an5}<i>Sleigh bells ring</i>

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,200
{\an5}<i>Are you listening?</i>

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,160
<i>In the lane</i>

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,720
This is the last store
in town with the Beebo dolls,

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,120
Clarissa, I... I promise.

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,680
I am not leaving
without one for Lily.

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,520
Professor Stein, Merry Christmas.

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,400
And a Happy Hanukah to you, Chuck.

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,640
Every kid needs a Beebo doll, right?

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,120
So it would seem.

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,200
I got one! I can't believe I got one!

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,640
I don't suppose you can tell me
how many Beebos you have back there?

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,360
Plenty. Don't worry about it.

26
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,760
That was the last one.

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,480
Actually, we just ran out them.

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,680
- But you just said...
- I'm sorry, folks.

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,680
We are expecting
a new shipment in February.

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,800
February?

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,280
Five-year-olds don't wait
until February.

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,880
{\an5}Wait! There's one more Beebo
right there.

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Move!

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,880
Think, Marty.

35
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,800
Distance of about 6m.

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,400
{\an5}Allowing for air resistance.

37
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,160
Breathe in, hold...

38
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,560
Eureka! I've got it!

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,200
<i>Beebo, loves you!</i>

40
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Get him!

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,000
Barbarians!

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,200
<i>Oh Hanukkah, oh Hanukkah</i>

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,360
<i>The festival of joy</i>

44
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
<i>A holly day, a jolly day</i>

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,760
<i>For every girl and boy</i>

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,080
Great Scott.

47
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,480
{\an5}Barbarians?

48
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,520
{\an5}Gideon said
that you wanted to see me.

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,920
Come in. Have a seat.

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,520
You comfortable?

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,120
{\an5}I know the Legends
have lost a friend.

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,440
I've been there.

53
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,320
I wanna help you guys
through the grieving period.

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,280
Oh, that's...
that's very sweet of you.

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,520
{\an5}I wanna give you the chance
to get anything off your chest,

56
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,720
anything at all.

57
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,680
What would you like to say...

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,440
to Professor Martin Stein?

59
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,760
{\an5}I... I think that everyone
copes in their own ways.

60
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,840
{\an5}It's clear the Legends
are ill-equipped to cope at all.

61
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,400
This way? This is wrong.

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
Actually, there is one question

63
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
{\an5}- I never got to ask Marty.
- Great.

64
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,560
{\an5}When I reduce
the Waverider's coefficient

65
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,160
of sinusoidal depleneration,

66
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,520
it seems to inversely hyper-celerate.

67
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,520
Let's hear it again.

68
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,200
{\an5}What would you like
to say to me, Nathaniel?

69
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,560
Still a little too nasally.

70
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,720
Remember, you speak very precisely.

71
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,840
This is therapy, not acting class.

72
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,080
Nice! That's the right level
of frustration.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,480
That's very Stein.
Now just do it with the puppet.

74
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,760
{\an5}My goodness, you're really
working out some rage issues

75
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,160
with Professor Stein.

76
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,120
No, I just hate puppets.

77
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,680
All right, I am,
I am putting the puppet away.

78
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,520
I get it now.
That wasn't the best tactic.

79
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,360
{\an5}Look, Jax. I think that you,
even more so than the others,

80
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,240
must be in pain about this.

81
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,560
He died so I could live.

82
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,920
{\an5}- End of story.
- It wasn't your fault.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,240
{\an5}I should never have given him
that Firestorm cure.

84
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,480
{\an5}I should've been strong enough
for both of us.

85
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,600
I...

86
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,080
All right, you know, no.

87
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,400
We're not doing this.

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,640
What was that?

89
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,760
An Anachronism caused a disturbance

90
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,200
{\an5}in the Temporal Zone,
which created a Timequake.

91
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,560
{\an5}And this is where Marty
would've said, "Fascinating."

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,640
All right, everybody,
I know you're sad,

93
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,160
so this is what we're gonna do.

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,240
{\an5}I want you to take all
of your feelings about Martin

95
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,760
and put it in a box,

96
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,600
and then, I want you
to close the box,

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,080
{\an5}and then,
you're gonna lock the box.

98
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,440
Well, that sounds healthy.

99
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,240
Maybe not,
but we got a job to do.

100
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Gideon, the Anachronism, please.

101
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
Level 12?

102
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,000
<i>Level Ten didn't do it justice.</i>

103
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,240
<i>Leif Eriksson's Vikings
set up a colony</i>

104
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,680
<i>in the New World around 1000 A.D.</i>

105
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,800
Little known fact,
the Vikings "discovered"

106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,360
{\an5}the Americas
492 years before Columbus,

107
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,960
but due to Eriksson's
adoption of Christianity,

108
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,760
the Vikings decided
to pack up their bags

109
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,120
and head home.

110
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,000
Sorry, Gideon, you were saying?

111
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,240
<i>In this version of history,
the Vikings stayed</i>

112
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,880
<i>and conquered all of North America,</i>

113
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,280
<i>or as it's called now, New Valhalla.</i>

114
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,120
{\an5}- Cool hat.
- How many beers is that?

115
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,560
It's not even noon yet.

116
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
You have a problem, Mickey.

117
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,520
{\an5}I don't have a problem.
Now shut up.

118
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,760
All right, let's go.

119
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,400
I don't think the Legends
are ready for the field.

120
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Listen, Leo,
kicking ass is how we heal.

121
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,880
I don't like it, sister.

122
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,960
This land is bountiful.

123
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,920
{\an5}But these people,
these Skraelings,

124
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,120
they're skilled warriors.

125
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,880
We should not challenge them.

126
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,920
{\an5}It's time to return home
to Greenland.

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,880
Brother, this continent is vast.

128
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,560
Who knows how far west it goes,

129
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,560
and what riches it has to plunder.

130
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,680
{\an5}It is our destiny to conquer
all of New Valhalla.

131
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,440
That's Leif Erikkson
and his sister, Freydis.

132
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,720
{\an5}Yeah, this moment
has huge historical significance.

133
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,880
It determines whether or not
the Vikings leave North America,

134
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,600
which, for me,
is very exciting 'cau...

135
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,920
You okay, man?

136
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,280
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

137
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,920
Let's just stay on mission.

138
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
Okay.

139
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,680
The Christian monks
say that endless war

140
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,960
means our people
will never know peace.

141
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,480
It is what the Blue God
has demanded, brother.

142
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
The Anachronism isn't a weapon.

143
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,160
{\an5}Guys, we're dealing
with some kind of Blue God.

144
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
Found him.

145
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,320
Is that...

146
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,480
Martin?

147
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,640
Martin's the Anachronism.

148
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,120
They used his genius
to conquer the New World.

149
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,880
Just... Hey, it's supposed to be
a stealth mission.

150
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Damn it!

151
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,960
<i>Jax, back into position now.</i>

152
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,800
Jefferson?
What are you doing here?

153
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
{\an5}- I... I haven't seen you since...
- 1987.

154
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,480
{\an5}Don't worry, Martin,
I'ma get you out of here.

155
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,920
Wait!
No, no, no, no, no!

156
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Hey.

157
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,560
- You all right?
- Most certainly not!

158
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,680
Look out!

159
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,320
{\an5}I haven't had a bath
or a change of clothes

160
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,440
for over a week.

161
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,200
I... I could've died.

162
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,080
- Was it something I said?
- No, nothing. It's fine.

163
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,280
We just gotta get out of here
before the rest of the clan comes.

164
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,760
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

165
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,360
- We have to go back.
- Go back for what?

166
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,160
- My Beebo.
- What the hell is a Beebo?

167
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,200
As in Cuddle Me Beebo?

168
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,840
It's a Hannukah gift for Lily.

169
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,760
We're not going back
for some damn toy!

170
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,040
You don't understand!

171
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,800
That damn toy is gonna
change history!

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,120
The four-eyed man has escaped.

173
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,240
No matter.

174
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,840
We still have our God.

175
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,640
<i>Beebo hungry.</i>

176
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,560
And our God hungers for battle!

177
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,400
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

178
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,080
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

179
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
All right, let me get this straight.

180
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,000
So, the Vikings think
that Beebo is a God,

181
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,640
Beebo as in,
"Wah, wah, Beebo love you"?

182
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,280
As preposterous as it sounds,

183
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,480
that obnoxious toy
is the only reason I survived.

184
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,160
The Vikings who found me
in the woods

185
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
were about to kill me,
when Beebo spoke.

186
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,680
It... it was like a, a spell
was cast over the barbarians.

187
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,520
Here, this should warm you up.

188
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,200
- Earl Grey?
- With a little bit of brandy.

189
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,920
My favorite.
Thank you, Jefferson.

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,080
It does make sense.

191
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,240
Norse mythology is filled
with creatures like Beebo:

192
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,800
trolls, gnomes, tumptens.

193
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,880
Okay, sure, but thinking he's a God

194
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,560
who wants them
to conquer the New World?

195
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,520
You see, at first,
the Vikings thought that

196
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,720
only I could make Beebo talk.

197
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,960
But it soon became clear
that my translations

198
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,360
were not what Lief's sister
wanted to hear.

199
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,320
Freydis usurped my position

200
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,760
and twisted Beebo's words
for her own agenda.

201
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,360
All right, sounds like
we gotta go get that Beebo,

202
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,640
and send the Vikings packing.

203
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,960
Zari, can you take young Stein
to where he can get cleaned up?

204
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,280
Come on.

205
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,520
I... I can help him,
'cause I've got nothing else...

206
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,080
It's okay. Zari's got it.

207
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,720
Mart... Marty. Mar... Martin...

208
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,960
you're looking young and lively.

209
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,920
- Good to see you.
- You too, Raymond.

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,560
One question: Where's me?

211
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,600
- You...
- At peace.

212
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,680
With your family for the,
for the holidays.

213
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,400
I almost forgot.

214
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Happy Hannukah.

215
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
Happy Hannukah.

216
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,240
I'll drink to that.

217
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,720
That's disgusting.

218
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,320
What's wrong with this beer?

219
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,280
Man, can you believe Sara?

220
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,200
She doesn't trust me
around young Stein.

221
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,400
So you're saying
you weren't planning on

222
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,000
warning Martin about him dying?

223
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,760
Okay, fine. But come on, man.

224
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,600
Grey dies, and then, all of a sudden,

225
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,400
his younger self
gets displaced in time?

226
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,520
Yeah, I know. It's crazy that
we keep bumping into ourselves.

227
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,200
- Yeah.
- I mean, Ray and the baby Dominator,

228
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,840
- and Sir Stein and his killer stash.
- Mick's dad.

229
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,320
I mean, this can't just be
a coincidence.

230
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,280
What if this is fate's way
of saying we should step up?

231
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,000
That we can actually improve things?

232
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,240
Martin made his choice, Jax.

233
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
We should be
honoring his sacrifice,

234
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,120
not trying to undo it.

235
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,400
Yeah, but it's Grey.

236
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,000
I mean, how can we not tell him?

237
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,640
Because what if
knowing about his death

238
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,360
makes young Marty choose not
to create the Firestorm matrix

239
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,720
or meet you
or step foot on this ship?

240
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,400
He never would've wanted you
to risk the present

241
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
to save him in the past.

242
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,640
And how exactly do you know
what he would've wanted, Ray?

243
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,360
You weren't psychically
connected to him for three years.

244
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Gideon!

245
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,440
The beer tastes like sewage water.

246
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,200
<i>Was that a question, Mr. Rory?</i>

247
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,560
Don't get smart, lady.

248
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,400
I adjusted the fabrication settings.

249
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,080
The Waverider's now a dry ship.

250
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,880
No alcohol allowed.

251
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,000
You son of a...

252
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,440
You said your drinking
wasn't a problem.

253
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,480
If you can go a couple of days
without booze,

254
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,680
you've proven your point.

255
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,200
A couple of days?

256
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,480
- Forty-two hours?
- Forty-eight.

257
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,160
So, I checked the lunar calendar,
and today is Yuletide.

258
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,640
Oh, like Christmas?

259
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,760
Well, before Christians rebranded it,

260
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,120
wreaths, trees, elves were
all Norse traditions first.

261
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,880
And tonight, Leif is throwing
a huge Yuletide feast.

262
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,680
Which is the perfect cover for us.

263
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,360
Oh. We could dress up
as Norse Gods

264
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,080
and order
them to head back to Greenland

265
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,600
or face our wrath!

266
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,560
- Worst idea you ever had.
- That's a terrible idea.

267
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,000
<i>Incoming transmission
from Agent Sharpe.</i>

268
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,120
Put her on.

269
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,680
Agent Sharpe,

270
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,960
it's been awhile, thankfully.

271
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,680
<i>- Captain Lance.</i>
- Let me guess,

272
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,360
you saw that there's
a Level 12 Anachronism,

273
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,920
and you're calling
to lecture me on everything

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,080
that we're doing wrong.

275
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
<i>No.</i>

276
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,520
<i>- Okay, yes.</i>
- Hmm.

277
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,840
<i>But I also heard about Martin Stein,</i>

278
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,880
<i>and I'm calling
to express my condolences.</i>

279
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,080
Well, thank you,

280
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,680
but my team and I,
we have it under control.

281
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,160
<i>I hope so, because the Legends
fixing a Level 12</i>

282
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,960
<i>under normal circumstances
would be a Beebo Day miracle.</i>

283
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,160
Did you just say Beebo Day?

284
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,920
<i>December 25th, Beebo Day.</i>

285
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
<i>When families exchange gifts
and sing silly songs</i>

286
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,560
<i>and discover that they can no longer
live under the same roof?</i>

287
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
<i>Beebo Day's part of
the Anachronism, isn't it?</i>

288
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,080
- Yeah.
-<i>Yeah, never felt right.</i>

289
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,120
This Anachronism is cementing fast.

290
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
And to be honest, my team is still
pretty raw from losing Stein.

291
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,720
We could use an outside perspective.

292
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,880
<i>Are you asking for my help?</i>

293
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,000
No.

294
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,160
Okay, yes.

295
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
All right.

296
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,120
What's the plan?

297
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,840
You ready to see
the Legends in action?

298
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,480
The goal is to do this peacefully,
without action.

299
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,080
There's a first time
for everything, I guess.

300
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,760
Hail, Leif son of Erik.

301
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,480
I, Nathaniel Henryson.

302
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,480
Hail, Nathanial son of Henry.

303
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,200
A Yuletide surprise.

304
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,160
Are you sure this is wise, brother?

305
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,280
We know nothing about these people.

306
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,120
We brought booze.

307
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,880
Tell me of your clan.

308
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,120
You certainly are an odd collection.

309
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,400
We're from all over.

310
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,320
But we stick together
the best we can.

311
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,880
Although, recently,
we lost a brother.

312
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,800
That can be difficult.

313
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,320
I've lost far too many
men and women in my own clan.

314
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,320
It has made you soft, brother.

315
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,960
Let's not fight
in front of our guest, sister.

316
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,840
As far as strategy goes,
this would not be my first pick.

317
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,560
Why not? They welcomed us in.

318
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,840
We get Beebo, we get out.

319
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,040
The Bureau has rules
about fraternizing with the locals,

320
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,680
and these costumes are ridiculous.

321
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,040
Nah, you look good.

322
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,360
- Give me that!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

323
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,800
No booze means no booze, Mickey.

324
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,280
- Stop calling me that.
- You have 35 hours left.

325
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,040
Can you handle it?

326
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,200
Are you ready to admit
that you have a problem?

327
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,440
You're the problem!

328
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,440
There you are, you little bastard!

329
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,000
<i>Beebo thirsty.</i>

330
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
You dare to steal from our God?

331
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,280
He's not gonna drink it.

332
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,200
Our Gods do not tolerate
such insolence.

333
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,400
Beebo will decide your fate.

334
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,880
Anyone have eyes on Beebo?

335
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,360
Short, blue, looking for cuddles?

336
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,760
Yep, we're working on it.

337
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
Here we go!

338
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,320
By Odin's Spear, you bested us.

339
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,360
Beautiful,
and they can hold their mead.

340
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,560
Tell us...

341
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,360
which of these clansmen
are your husbands,

342
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,880
and we'll kill them.

343
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,440
I'm not really the husband kind.

344
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,160
Perfect! Me neither!

345
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,880
All right, you guys said if we won,
you'd take us to see your Blue God.

346
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,080
Two out of three.

347
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,880
Fellow warriors...

348
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,360
Our guest has been stealing
mead from the Blue God.

349
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,680
And now,

350
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,720
our God will render judgment.

351
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,320
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

352
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,760
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

353
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,160
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

354
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,000
Beebo! Beebo!

355
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,000
How judge you, Beebo?

356
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,800
<i>Beebo hungry.</i>

357
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,200
Our God demands justice.

358
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,120
To the pyre!

359
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,760
Nate and Amaya, you're on Beebo.

360
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,520
Everyone else, let's make sure
Rory doesn't get burned alive.

361
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,280
Freydis, it's Yuletide.

362
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,680
Let's not ruin it.

363
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,880
More wood, so bright Odin
can see it from Valhalla.

364
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,200
Is it weird that I find her hot?

365
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,160
Weird, but then again,
not surprising.

366
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,240
Leo, can you
take care of the fire?

367
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,760
Copy that, Captain Lance.

368
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,440
I thought you said this was
an undercover operation.

369
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,400
Well, blowing your cover
is half the fun.

370
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,800
Into the flames!

371
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
Now.

372
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,120
It's a sign!

373
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,600
Beebo does not want
our clansman to be burned.

374
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
The Blue God has shown mercy.

375
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,040
<i>I luh-luh-love you.</i>

376
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,760
- I accidentally squeezed him.
- He's so damn huggable.

377
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,000
Unhand him or die!

378
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,080
I am leaving myself wide open,
and you can't land a single punch.

379
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,600
Yeah, I'm just warming up.

380
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,440
Let's up the stakes then.

381
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,160
Loser takes the other's chores
for a month.

382
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,040
Deal.

383
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,720
I know what you're trying to do,
by the way.

384
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,640
- What's that?
- Tying to distract me.

385
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,720
I'm also trying to beat you.

386
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,640
Is the distraction working?

387
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,840
- I still wanna warn Grey.
- So do it.

388
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,200
I would've warned my brother,
if I had the chance.

389
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,680
- Yeah, but Sara...
- Just 'cause she's the Captain

390
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,400
doesn't mean you have to do
everything she says.

391
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,040
Yeah, no, I know, but we're not...

392
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
Jefferson, there you are.

393
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,720
- Game over!
- Come... come on!

394
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,280
- I'm scary good at this.
- You're just okay.

395
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,720
Forgive the interruption,

396
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,720
but I would very much like to return
to my Clarissa and Lily,

397
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,680
with or without
that wretched Beebo.

398
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll take you in the jumpship.

399
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,440
Yo. This is your chance.

400
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,840
Find some loophole,
like I did with Helen of Troy.

401
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,080
You can save your friend's life.

402
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,480
Nathaniel!

403
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,960
<i>Beebo, likes to play!</i>

404
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,360
Nate! Nate! I'm open!

405
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,920
<i>Bee...</i>

406
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
I hate puppets.

407
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,560
<i>Beebo want cuddle...</i>

408
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,760
I know how much
you wanted to believe, sister,

409
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
but Beebo's a false God

410
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,600
full of false promises.

411
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,440
We are Vikings.

412
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,200
This is our land to conquer.

413
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,720
It's time to go home

414
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,360
and abandon this colony.

415
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,400
It seems the Old Gods
have abandoned us.

416
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,600
Well, looks like the Legends
have saved Odin Day.

417
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,960
Odin Day?

418
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
Wait, you mean Christmas?

419
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,000
Doesn't ring a bell.

420
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,680
I thought
we fixed the Anachronism.

421
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,960
My name is Odin,

422
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,920
ruler of Asgard.

423
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,720
Damien Darhk...

424
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,080
You know this guy?

425
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,160
- And his daughter.
- See?

426
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,360
I told you the Norse God
costumes would work.

427
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,000
Bow to the King of the true Gods!

428
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,640
He has left Valhalla
to lead you into battle.

429
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,200
Together, we will conquer
the New World.

430
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,680
Mick, no, we're outmatched.

431
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,320
Let's go.

432
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,720
Kneel before Odin, brother.

433
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
That was unexpected.

434
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,520
I mean, not the Darhks showing up.
They seem to enjoy altering history.

435
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
- You retreating.
- Well, Vikings are one thing.

436
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,760
If we're gonna tangle
with the Darhks,

437
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,160
we have to get our heads on straight.

438
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,720
I, for one, am glad
you're treading cautiously.

439
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,480
<i>We've arrived safely
in the Temporal Zone,</i>

440
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,920
<i>but I'm afraid the Anachronism has...</i>

441
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,280
Let me guess, it's worse.
Thank you, Gideon.

442
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,600
Another Timequake.

443
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,160
We are not letting America go Viking.

444
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,200
Ava, can you call
the Time Bureau for backup?

445
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,160
Wait, wait, wait,
are we really that desperate?

446
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Yeah.

447
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
Well, the last time
we faced Nora Darhk,

448
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,880
- she put Sara in a coma.
- Right.

449
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,520
- I'll speak to Director Bennett.
- Thank you.

450
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,760
Wow, that's quite the getup.

451
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,920
Where's Martin and Jax?

452
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,160
They're on their way
back to Central City.

453
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,320
Gotta get Martin home
for the holidays.

454
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,800
You've been awfully quiet, Jefferson.

455
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,720
My bad. I've just had some...

456
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,120
some things on my mind.

457
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,120
It's good to be home.

458
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,280
I can't wait to see
Clarissa and Lily.

459
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,800
Listen...

460
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,120
this is gonna sound crazy, okay,

461
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,320
but you need to open this letter
on November 28th, 2017.

462
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,320
I've seen "Back to the Future,"
Jefferson,

463
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,800
that mockery of time
travel that Clarissa adores.

464
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,640
I don't suppose this letter
has anything to do with my future.

465
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,120
This letter could save your life.

466
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,520
Then I categorically refuse
to take it.

467
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,400
You know the dangers
of trying to improve history.

468
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,200
No, no, this, this is your future.

469
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,120
And your past.

470
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Give me a little credit.
I... I know the team was lying

471
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,800
when they said I was visiting
family for the holidays.

472
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,400
Then take the damn letter
and stop being so stubborn.

473
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,600
Think about your family.

474
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,680
This letter is a loophole.

475
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,440
Nothing changes until
November 28th, 2017.

476
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,600
Please.

477
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,080
Okay, Jefferson.

478
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,640
Thank you.

479
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,800
Hello, friend.

480
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,200
Looking for booze?

481
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,520
I'm not your friend.

482
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,120
You almost died back there,

483
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,600
and I know you're craving a drink.

484
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,800
That's why it's so important
to resist!

485
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,600
You have to stop numbing yourself
to fear and pain.

486
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,280
That's when the true
transformation begins!

487
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,480
Mickey!

488
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,640
You're right. You're right.

489
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,200
I... I apologize.
That... that was his name.

490
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,600
Your Earth-X doppelganger
was my best friend.

491
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,280
We grew up together
in the Resistance.

492
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,920
And when he died, I...

493
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,240
I was devastated.

494
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,720
But seeing you made me realize,

495
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,080
I was a long way from acceptance.

496
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,600
I didn't come onboard
just to help you process your loss.

497
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,640
I came so I could process mine.

498
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,440
Was that guttural sound
your response?

499
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,560
- To what?
- My heartfelt confession.

500
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,680
I don't care. I wasn't listening.

501
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,960
Well, the Mick Rory I knew did care,
and he did listen.

502
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,600
He was the kindest,
most selfless person

503
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,840
I've ever met.

504
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,720
A far cry from the crude, alcoholic,

505
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,000
oafish waste of space before me.

506
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
I'm a disappointment?

507
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Well, the Leonard Snart that I knew
was a cold, ruthless criminal,

508
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,080
who didn't say boo
about my drinking,

509
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,000
because he knew
I could get the job done!

510
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,400
I don't like you. You don't fit in.

511
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,560
Why don't you go back to
that Nazi hellhole you call home?

512
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,120
Well, if that's how you feel,
then I'll leave,

513
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,240
as soon as we return from Vinland.

514
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,320
- Good.
- Good.

515
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,880
- Good!
- Good!

516
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,440
<i>Are we clear, Agent Sharpe?</i>

517
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,760
Crystal, sir.

518
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,920
Please tell me you have good news.

519
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm afraid Director Bennett
doesn't believe this mission

520
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,680
is the best use of our resources.

521
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,920
So what, the Time Bureau
is just gonna let the Darhks

522
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,960
run around and change history?

523
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,480
The Time Bureau's in disarray.

524
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,680
Ever since Rip
was sentenced to prison, we...

525
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,480
Wait, Rip is in prison?

526
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,720
He was hardly convincing
at the tribunal,

527
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,880
raving about Mallus,
completely unapologetic.

528
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,320
And in his absence,

529
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,960
Damien Darhk has recruited
even more allies.

530
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,120
Gideon, can you pull up

531
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,840
what Director Bennett
showed me, please?

532
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,880
Grodd survived Vietnam.

533
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,000
Darhk secured him
a means of time travel.

534
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,120
Of course.

535
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,960
Darhk and his daughter
are just too powerful.

536
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,360
They have magic
that we don't understand.

537
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,840
We've lost scores of agents
trying to fight them.

538
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,320
So what? What does that mean?

539
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,800
That you're just gonna
throw in the towel?

540
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
We can't afford
to lose anyone else.

541
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,280
- And I can?
- No, I mean...

542
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,440
Do you have any idea
how hard this has been on us?

543
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,840
I really am sorry, Sara.

544
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,880
Director Bennett has ordered me
to return to the Time Bureau.

545
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,440
Screw his orders.

546
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,680
I need you here.

547
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,160
Look, I know Darhk
is personal for you,

548
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,680
and you're the last person
to back out of a fight,

549
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,480
but you asked me to give you
an outside perspective.

550
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,640
If you're concerned
about the safety of your team,

551
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,080
leave Vinland.

552
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,800
This is not a fight
the Legends can win.

553
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,000
Hey.

554
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,840
- You rang?
- Yes.

555
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,760
Heard you took young Stein
back to 1992.

556
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,320
- Yep.
- How'd it go?

557
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,160
He's just glad to be home.

558
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,160
Okay, here's the deal.

559
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,800
Backup is not coming.

560
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,560
The Time Bureau thinks
the Darhks can't be defeated,

561
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,080
and they're probably right.

562
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,240
Leo asked us to talk
about our feelings.

563
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,440
Well, my feeling
is that history needs us

564
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,640
to stop the Darhks.

565
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,560
But after losing Stein,

566
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,640
I can't lose anyone else.

567
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,880
I need you guys to take
the Waverider and leave.

568
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,160
Not without you.

569
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,080
You can't face Darhk alone.

570
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,240
I have a plan.

571
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,040
I'm here to speak to Odin.

572
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,160
Let her pass.

573
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,040
My father will enjoy killing you.

574
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,000
You've come alone.

575
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,560
I'm here to make you an offer.

576
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,040
Oh, this ought to be good.

577
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,680
Leave now, and I'll let you live.

578
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
No.

579
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,200
Hold up.

580
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,840
Your plan sucks.

581
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,720
- Pretty's right.
- Well, I can't do nothing.

582
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,480
Yeah, but you can come up
with a better plan

583
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,080
that, like, doesn't get you killed.

584
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,600
Okay, Z, what's your big plan?

585
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,720
Well, first of all,

586
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,480
you don't enter the Longhouse
by yourself.

587
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,480
My father will enjoy killing you.

588
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,640
You've come alone.

589
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,840
Not exactly.

590
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,240
And then, Darhk will have
some sort of quip.

591
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,320
Something evil,
but not too mustache-twirly.

592
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,200
What, are you gonna huff
and puff till you blow my house in?

593
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,640
What's the matter?
Performance anxiety?

594
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,360
So far, this works,

595
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
but it doesn't solve
our Nora problem.

596
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,360
And what about
the rest of the Vikings?

597
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,960
Odin is under attack!

598
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,920
Defend him,
if you wanna see Valhalla.

599
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,240
You're gonna need backup.

600
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,720
Listen, Sara,

601
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,680
just don't let Grey's death
teach us the wrong lessons.

602
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,360
Either we do this together
or not at all.

603
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,440
Gideon, plot a course for Vinland.

604
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,920
What, are you gonna huff
and puff till you blow my house in?

605
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,040
What's the matter?
Performance anxiety?

606
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,160
Odin is under attack!

607
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,480
Defend him,
if you wanna see Valhalla.

608
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Halt.

609
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,280
<i>It is I, Beebo,</i>

610
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,600
<i>risen from the grave.</i>

611
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,040
Like Christ himself.

612
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,400
Yeah...

613
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,520
Yes, Jesus is
the one true God, which...

614
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,720
<i>doesn't mean science
or evolution isn't real.</i>

615
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,680
<i>Anyway, you need
to return to Greenland,</i>

616
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,800
<i>which will soon be melting
thanks to global warming,</i>

617
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,400
<i>which is also real.</i>

618
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,960
Like a little fire?

619
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,200
How 'bout a little ice?

620
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,640
Nora.

621
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,120
They killed the Valkyrie!

622
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,040
Nora!

623
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,520
Not this time.

624
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,640
<i>Sara Lance.</i>

625
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,840
Who's there?

626
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,120
Who are you?

627
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,800
What is this place?

628
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,360
<i>I am Mallus.</i>

629
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,320
<i>Soon I will be free,</i>

630
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:30,360
<i>and your world will know
unendurable pain.</i>

631
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,480
You came back.

632
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,880
It's like you said, you needed me.

633
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,720
Well, your timing is impeccable.

634
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,400
It's a Christmas miracle.

635
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,640
Yes.

636
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,120
<i>There is nothing physically
ailing you, Captain Lance.</i>

637
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,040
Told you. I'm fine.

638
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,120
You also told me
you visited an alternate dimension.

639
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,000
Well, it wasn't my first time.

640
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Sara.

641
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,400
Tell me exactly
what you saw in there.

642
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,760
Look, I don't know, okay?
It wasn't about what I saw.

643
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,400
It was about what I... felt.

644
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
It was an absence of feeling

645
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,480
no warmth, no love, just a void,

646
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,640
and the only thing filling
the void was...

647
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,240
Mallus.

648
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,320
It seems Rip was right
to be obsessed with him.

649
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,880
I need to tell the Bureau.

650
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,840
Well, aren't you afraid of getting
in trouble for disobeying orders?

651
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,560
It was worth it.

652
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,640
See ya again.

653
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Gideon, how's the ol' timeline?

654
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,240
<i>Records show that
history has been restored.</i>

655
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,480
<i>New Valhalla
is North America again,</i>

656
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,280
<i>and the only war Beebo has incited</i>

657
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,680
<i>is in shopping malls
across the nation.</i>

658
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,800
Sounds like our work here is done.

659
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,680
Gideon, you're sure there are
no other changes to the timeline?

660
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,920
<i>If you're referring
to Professor Stein,</i>

661
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,280
<i>he still died in 2017.</i>

662
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,360
I'm sorry, Jax.

663
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,080
Wait. I... I just don't understand.

664
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,720
The loophole,
it... it should've worked.

665
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,560
That letter told him exactly
how to protect himself

666
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,000
on the day he died.
What happened?

667
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,000
He must not have read it.

668
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,600
Oh! Hey, Lily!

669
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,960
A little birdie told me
you wanted one of these guys.

670
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,400
Beebo! I love him!

671
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,600
Happy Hanukah.

672
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,600
Clarissa, you remember Jefferson.

673
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,920
- You haven't aged a day.
- Neither have you.

674
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,720
Can I get you some Earl Grey?

675
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,360
Yeah, sure.

676
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Come on.

677
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,760
I think I know why you're here.
Come in.

678
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,440
The letter, you never read it.

679
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,280
That's because I already burned it.

680
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
What?

681
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,280
I was tempted, to be sure.

682
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,040
I thought a lot about that date.

683
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
November 28th, 2017.

684
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,680
I'll be 67 then.

685
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,880
I'll have had adventures,

686
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,120
watched my daughter grow up,

687
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,760
and I'll have made a friend,

688
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,560
who was willing to risk far,
far too much for me.

689
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,520
No, I... I am trying to save you.

690
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,440
You need to let me go.

691
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,000
We both know you shouldn't be here.

692
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,120
I... I may have a life ahead of me,
but to you,

693
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,320
- I'm a ghost.
- No, no, to me...

694
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,200
I'm not gonna cheat death, Jefferson.

695
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,520
None of us live forever.

696
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,400
And yet, I clearly live
a wonderful life with many chapters.

697
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,840
And if I had one wish,
it, it wouldn't be for me

698
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,520
to prolong my life.

699
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,840
It... would be for you

700
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,360
to live yours,

701
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,920
and to have all the happiness
you deserve.

702
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,720
Okay.

703
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,800
Goodbye, Grey.

704
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Goodbye, Jefferson.

705
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,440
Did you try to change his fate?

706
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,440
Didn't work, so...

707
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,600
I'm sorry, Jax.

708
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
Me too.

709
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,800
If I stay on this ship,
I'll never be able to move on.

710
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,080
What do you mean? Like...

711
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,080
you wanna leave?

712
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,440
You, you can't leave, Jax.

713
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,000
No, you're, you're not leaving.
You're a part of this team.

714
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,280
Yeah, and I always will be,
but right now...

715
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,760
this is something I gotta do.

716
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,240
I need a different kind of adventure.

717
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,760
Is this what you really want?

718
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,320
Yeah.

719
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,240
I would order you to stay,

720
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,800
but I know you'd just disobey me

721
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,560
and follow your heart,
like you always do.

722
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,840
Hey.

723
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,960
Can you do me a favor?

724
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,240
Don't tell the others until I'm gone.

725
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,640
I don't do goodbyes.
It's... it's not my thing.

726
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,600
Yeah, yeah. Totally, I get it.

727
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,760
Okay.

728
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,600
- Surprise!
- Boo!

729
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,560
You didn't really think
we were just gonna let you

730
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,680
sneak out of here
without saying goodbye.

731
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,120
Yeah,
we can't celebrate the holidays

732
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,320
without the whole family.

733
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Happy Yuletide.

734
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,000
<i>Jingle bell, jingle bell</i>

735
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,120
<i>Jingle bell rock</i>

736
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,320
Well, I think we made
an impressive team out there.

737
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,120
Reminded me of old times.

738
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,640
<i>L'chaim.</i>

739
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,720
<i>Jingle bell, jingle bell</i>

740
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,080
As you can taste,
I reprogrammed Gideon.

741
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,880
I should not have
tried to change you,

742
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,640
and I'm sorry, Mick.

743
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
To the ones we lost,

744
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,440
or left behind.

745
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,040
Speech.

746
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,240
Speech.

747
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,440
- Speech, speech, speech.
- Oh...

748
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,640
Okay, all right.

749
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,320
When Grey first dragged me
onboard this ship,

750
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,920
I thought it was the last place
that I wanted to be.

751
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,960
I mean, you were all
a bunch of screw-ups,

752
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,360
B-list superheroes,

753
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,120
washed up bank robbers, no offense.

754
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,800
- It's true.
- But the thing is,

755
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,440
when you get
a bunch of broken pieces,

756
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
and you put them all together
the right way,

757
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,240
they make something new.

758
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,800
And suddenly,

759
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,520
they don't feel so broken anymore.

760
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,640
And I'm pretty sure
that's what a family is.

761
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,480
So...

762
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,240
I don't know what happens next,

763
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,240
but I know I'll always have
a family here with you guys.

764
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,880
- That's right.
- Damn right, little brother.

765
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,240
Always.

766
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,240
Cheers.

767
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,960
Well...

768
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,920
it's been an honor, Captain.

769
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,280
Come here.

770
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,600
Hey.

771
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,040
I'm sure it's only gonna be
a matter of time

772
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,640
before some Aztecs with jetpacks
invade Central City, so...

773
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,840
And the honor's been all mine.

774
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,480
It's been a long time, love.

775
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
John?

776
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,800
Now, let's see,

777
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,040
the last time we met,

778
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,600
I saved your soul.

779
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,560
Now there's something
you can do for me.

780
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,480
Look, I'd love to help,
but your timing is terrible.

781
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,600
This won't take long.

782
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,120
You see,
there's a demon out there.

783
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,600
It's possessing a little girl.

784
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
And that demon,

785
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,000
he knows your name.

786
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,080
<i>Beebo, loves you!</i>
