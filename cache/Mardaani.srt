1
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,745
Patil, don't move from there.
Be alert.

2
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,447
Yes, Sir. Okay. Out.

3
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:04,345
It's always crowded here.

4
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,653
It's okay, Morey.
We have to go straight.

5
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:08,652
Look at that... you scum!

6
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,560
You get awesome chicken
on the left here.

7
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:15,931
Don't just pay lip service, Morey.
Get it tomorrow.

8
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,011
Morey, stop here. Ma'am...

9
00:01:39,757 --> 00:01:40,451
Jai Hind, Ma'am.

10
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:42,993
Yes, Sir.

11
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:46,887
Yes, Sir. Jai Hind, Sir.

12
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:52,803
Boss is in a bad mood today.

13
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:54,670
He's pissed with everyone.

14
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:56,633
His wife must've screamed at him

15
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,599
Ma'am, his PA was telling me,

16
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:01,441
he forgot to take his wife
shopping for their anniversary.

17
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:05,305
She got so upset she cancelled
their dinner reservations.

18
00:02:05,783 --> 00:02:08,650
We can handle the
toughest of criminals easily...

19
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:12,754
...but when it comes to handling
family, we goof up.

20
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:13,918
So true, Ma'am.

21
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:16,493
That's why Morey is
taking the day off tomorrow.

22
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:19,292
Oh yes. It's your sister-in-law's
wedding on Sunday, right?

23
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,953
Yes, Ma'am.

24
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:21,822
How is your younger
one studying?

25
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,466
Wonder when she studies!

26
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:25,964
She's always glued
to the TV or the computer.

27
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:28,099
That reminds me...

28
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,102
Hello.

29
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:35,370
Hello, Meera.
- Yes, Aunty.

30
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,604
Done with your revision?
- Of course.

31
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:39,778
I can hear the TV.

32
00:02:40,184 --> 00:02:41,617
When are you coming?
- Soon.

33
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:42,480
Have you got it?
- What?

34
00:02:42,587 --> 00:02:43,110
Yes, Ma'am.

35
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:45,314
I was speaking to Jafar.

36
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,184
Okay.

37
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:48,881
Better get done with
your revision till I am back.

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,389
Okay, bye.

39
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:52,355
Have you fed them?

40
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:54,392
They are getting a royal treatment.

41
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:56,960
Morey, is feeding them
cheese since the afternoon.

42
00:02:57,368 --> 00:02:59,393
Who told you mice eat cheese, Morey?

43
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,570
I saw it on Tom & Jerry.

44
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,270
These guys love cheese.

45
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:05,700
Our surveillance team
is already there, right?

46
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,275
I'll confirm, Ma'am.

47
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:09,537
Shinde...

48
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:00,790
The baby's crying...

49
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:50,245
Oh my God!

50
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,014
You son of a...

51
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:55,141
Get up!

52
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:57,344
Bloody rascal!

53
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:02,619
Only a mouse can get
another mouse out of his hole.

54
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,626
Ma'am, please don't shoot me.
Please, Ma'am.

55
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:07,593
We are not going to shoot you.

56
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,527
Please, Ma'am...

57
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:12,402
I don't have orders to shoot you,
you scum.

58
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:14,564
I have to take you in alive.

59
00:05:15,706 --> 00:05:16,900
Jafar...
- Yes, Ma'am.

60
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:19,268
Send the rest of the unit inside.
- Yes, Ma'am.

61
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:23,780
God knows who else is hiding
inside for a threesome.

62
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:25,643
Get him!

63
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:29,818
You son of a...

64
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:36,121
You have dodged us
four times before.

65
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:38,726
You think we'll let
you escape so easily?

66
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:41,856
Ma'am, I am warning you.
Ali Bhai will ruin you.

67
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:43,857
Take him away!

68
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:52,804
Giving refuge to
rats spreads plague.

69
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:07,622
Rehman, you should be
thankful to me.

70
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:12,453
You could at least
make love one last time.

71
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:14,929
Jafar was all set
to spoil it for you.

72
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:18,594
You are ragging me,
aren't you, Ma'am?

73
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:19,895
Sir's call.

74
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:21,463
Yes, Sir.
- You got Rehman?

75
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:23,004
Yes, we are taking
him to the station.

76
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:25,332
I had ordered you to
get him out and nab him...

77
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,068
...not barge right inside the chawl.

78
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,576
You know how sly Rehman is, Sir.

79
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,742
If we had let him come out
he would definitely have escaped.

80
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,713
We would have arrested
him again if he escaped.

81
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,479
But who would be responsible...

82
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:37,952
...if a civilian was
killed in a shootout?

83
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:39,581
We had taken precautions, Sir.

84
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:42,458
Taking rats along
was your precaution?

85
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:43,854
Oh, for God's sake, Shivani!

86
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:45,961
It was a calculated risk, Sir.

87
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:50,797
Your job is to take orders,
not risks. You understand?

88
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,433
Someone please take
Sir's wife for shopping.

89
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:11,077
Go home, Ma'am.

90
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,789
Meera has asked you
to come early, right?

91
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,984
If we don't get this
rascal's paperwork right...

92
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:19,194
...he'll find a loophole
to escape from the law.

93
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,454
No chance, Ma'am.

94
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:22,255
We'll keep the papers
ready by morning.

95
00:07:22,433 --> 00:07:23,297
You have a look at it.

96
00:07:24,435 --> 00:07:25,060
Okay.

97
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,297
Sorry, I am late again.

98
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:01,267
It's okay.

99
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:03,764
Meera, wake up.
Your Aunty is home.

100
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:04,599
Sorry...

101
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,106
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

102
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,038
Aunty! You are so late.
Happy birthday, Aunty!

103
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:10,606
For me?

104
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:14,515
No, Aunty. I stood first
in the orange belt category.

105
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:17,720
Wow! Did you show it to mom and dad?

106
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:18,544
Yes.

107
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:26,696
Happy birthday to you...

108
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:33,794
Happy birthday dear Shivani...

109
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:37,471
Happy birthday to you.

110
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,313
This is for Meera.

111
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,285
And for me? Come on...

112
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:53,813
Fast, fast, fast.

113
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:56,750
And this is for you.

114
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:20,740
Wow! It looks great on you, Ma'am.

115
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:22,886
Just like John Abraham
(Indian film star).

116
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,988
Wear these goggles
and ride a bike in style...

117
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:28,623
Hey, hey!

118
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:31,952
If I look like John Abraham,
then girls will chase me.

119
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:33,385
Show me something else.

120
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:35,690
Of course, Ma'am.
I'll show you something else.

121
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:37,324
I have a lot of variety.

122
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:38,466
Try this one.

123
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,964
Chulbul style.
Dabang (Indian film).

124
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:44,338
He was a cop just like you.

125
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:46,805
Roam around in style with these.

126
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,648
That one Chulbul Pandey is enough.
We don't need another.

127
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:57,286
Ma'am, I also have
a Sunny Leone style goggle.

128
00:09:58,255 --> 00:09:59,620
But that one doesn't have a glass.

129
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:02,351
It's a see through.
That's why I am not offering it.

130
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,451
But don't worry Ma'am.

131
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,927
I know exactly
what you are looking for.

132
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:09,725
Hang on a second.
I have a lot of variety...

133
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:15,300
What the hell is going on there?

134
00:10:15,606 --> 00:10:16,300
Go check Morey.

135
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:18,441
Ignore it, Ma'am.
We are from the Crime Branch.

136
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:20,099
Why do we need to get into it?

137
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:23,474
Morey, we are from
the Crime Branch later.

138
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:25,237
We are cops first. Let's go.

139
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,339
Let's go.

140
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,043
Ma'am, goggles...

141
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,460
How dare they celebrate
Valentine's Day!

142
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,764
Enough! Enough of this destruction!

143
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:56,407
Ma'am, please don't come in our way.
Let us do our job.

144
00:10:56,814 --> 00:10:57,781
Get lost!

145
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:02,448
Only one of us can
do our job right now.

146
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,754
And right now, I am on duty.

147
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,416
So, you stop working
and let me work.

148
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,721
Don't act smart.
Shut up and get lost.

149
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:10,951
You guys keep going!

150
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:13,324
Last warning.

151
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,029
You and your bloody last warning!

152
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,857
You...!
I will screw your happiness!

153
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,026
Start counting, Morey.

154
00:11:19,436 --> 00:11:21,301
Section 143 - unlawful assembly.

155
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:23,128
Section 147 - rioting.

156
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,365
Section 132 - abetment of mutiny.

157
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:27,837
Section 504 - intentional
insult with intent...

158
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:29,105
...to provoke breach of peace.

159
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:31,814
Section 506 - criminal intimidation.

160
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,512
Get up!

161
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,780
Two more sections left. Get up!

162
00:11:38,956 --> 00:11:41,857
Section 188 - disobedience
to order given by public servant.

163
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:44,956
And Section 353 - assault
or criminal force...

164
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,623
...to deter public servant
from discharge of duty.

165
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,197
Anybody else wants a lesson in law?

166
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:57,406
Jafar, did you get
record the video?

167
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:58,471
Yes, Ma'am.

168
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,277
Make sure your boss
gets my name right.

169
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:07,750
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

170
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:09,981
Senior Inspector, Crime Branch,

171
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:11,710
Unit 3.

172
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:13,780
Do whatever the hell you want!

173
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:14,647
Get lost!

174
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:26,925
Aunty, it's only for fifty bucks.

175
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:29,237
How much?
- Aunty, fifty bucks.

176
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,340
No, no. Give it for thirty.

177
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:31,767
No, Aunty. Take it for fifty.

178
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,103
Okay, let's settle
at thirty-five. Okay?

179
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:34,439
Okay.

180
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:35,869
Pyaari!

181
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,042
Pyaari! Come here!

182
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:39,308
Hang on. Aunty, please hurry.

183
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:41,311
Here's a twenty... thirty...

184
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:44,311
Pyaari, come quickly!

185
00:12:44,354 --> 00:12:45,321
Coming!

186
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:46,748
Keep the change.

187
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:50,591
Pyaari, get in.

188
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:53,686
How are you?

189
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:01,794
There it is.

190
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:03,936
Read later, Pyaari. Eat first.

191
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,635
I am going to treat
both of you this Friday.

192
00:13:08,212 --> 00:13:09,270
Really? Why?

193
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:10,341
It's my birthday.

194
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:12,110
Really?
- No.

195
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:14,644
I thought I'll celebrate my birthday
along with Ganpati's (Hindu God).

196
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:15,807
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

197
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:17,085
Very smart.

198
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:18,921
If the whole of India
will celebrate...

199
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:20,854
...then even we must too, right?

200
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,953
Right. I'll get the cake.
Which flavour do you like?

201
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:25,018
Kaalakhatta.

202
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:28,290
Aunty, kaalakhatta...

203
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,494
No problem.
If that's what Miss Pyaari wants.

204
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:33,292
Done. Kaalakhatta cake.
How old will you be?

205
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,764
How old are you?
- Twelve.

206
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:35,671
Me too.

207
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,301
You too? Same pinch.

208
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:41,641
What a stroke of luck
it was that I found you!

209
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,672
Remember how you were standing
at the railway station?

210
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:49,786
If it wouldn't have been for me,
your uncle would have sold you off.

211
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:51,852
Aunty, but you met me, right?

212
00:13:52,322 --> 00:13:54,347
My Ganpati selected you for me.

213
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:55,583
And me?

214
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:57,316
You, I have selected myself!

215
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,260
Shivani, please put
these eye drops for me.

216
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:07,465
Just a second. I am on my last set.

217
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:08,797
Again?

218
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:16,809
Hurry up please.
I have to go to the clinic.

219
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,707
What happened?

220
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:24,275
Your Kaku never lets
me work out in peace.

221
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:26,278
Really.

222
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:33,292
Why are there so many
boxes of cake in the fridge?

223
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,722
There will be one more today.

224
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:35,421
Why?

225
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,423
These are Pyaari's birthday cakes.

226
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,102
It's been three days,
I just can't find her.

227
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:42,169
So a new cake every day?

228
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,474
We can't feed her a stale
cake on her birthday, can we?

229
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:47,873
Just you wait! I'll pull her ears
and get her home today.

230
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:48,668
Very good.

231
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,312
Yes, Jafar.

232
00:14:58,822 --> 00:14:59,811
I'll handle that.

233
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:02,615
You keep the charge sheet ready.

234
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:03,789
I'll come in some time.

235
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,094
Yes, Jafar.

236
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:08,955
Ma'am, I want to meet Pyaari.

237
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:09,823
Who are you?

238
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:11,894
Tell Pyaari, Shivani Aunty is here.

239
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:13,462
Who is Shivani Aunty?

240
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:20,403
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
Crime Branch, Senior Inspector.

241
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:25,444
Did you find her?

242
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:27,750
Who?
- Her.

243
00:15:28,785 --> 00:15:29,342
Who's her?

244
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,211
You just asked for her.
Pyaari. Did you find her?

245
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:37,851
Find Pyaari? Where is she?

246
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:42,623
I thought since you are
a cop you might have found Pyaari.

247
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:44,593
Who let these kids inside?

248
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:47,133
What's wrong with her?

249
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:49,338
She's missing since
the last four days.

250
00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:52,769
Usually we wait for two days
before we file a missing complaint.

251
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,335
These kids wander off sometimes.

252
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:57,746
But they come back
in a couple of days.

253
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,447
Pyaari didn't come
back till last evening...

254
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:01,306
...so we filed a missing complaint.

255
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,242
Where? At the D. N.
Nagar Police Station?

256
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,512
This is D. N. Nagar...

257
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:06,812
...so we'll obviously go to
D. N. Nagar Police Station, right?

258
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,246
When did you see her last?

259
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:09,287
Four days back.

260
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,949
I want to meet these kids.

261
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,558
Ma'am, please wait. Tambe!

262
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,525
She was with us
three days ago. And...

263
00:16:16,066 --> 00:16:18,728
You fool! We even ate wadapaav.

264
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:21,527
Kids get lost but
they also come back.

265
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:24,005
You come after a few days.
You'll find her.

266
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,302
We played together at bed time.
Hide and seek.

267
00:16:27,577 --> 00:16:29,306
I haven't seen her after that.

268
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,747
I saw her when I came
in the morning.

269
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:33,071
Don't know where she
disappeared later.

270
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:35,848
She was carrying her bag of books.

271
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:38,783
I even asked her
where she was going.

272
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,818
But she didn't say anything.
She just left.

273
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,125
Six months ago even Yashoda
Didi disappeared in the same way.

274
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:54,301
One cup of tea

275
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:58,833
Since when do you
have your stall here?

276
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:00,872
What's the matter Ma'am?
Is anything wrong?

277
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:03,309
Just answer my question.

278
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:05,442
I regularly bribe Mr. Pawar, Ma'am.

279
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:08,517
You won't have to pay,
if you work for me.

280
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:10,283
What's the job?

281
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:14,282
You have to keep an
eye on this shelter home.

282
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,255
Who comes in, who goes out.

283
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,521
You want me to be
an informer, right?

284
00:17:19,129 --> 00:17:20,187
You are very smart, huh?

285
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:26,730
A girl called Pyaari
is missing from here.

286
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:28,733
Give me all the
information you can get.

287
00:17:28,905 --> 00:17:29,599
Clear?

288
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,829
Write my number down.

289
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,604
9-8-2...

290
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,744
Meera, are you ready?

291
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,547
I have made your
favourite breakfast today.

292
00:17:38,615 --> 00:17:39,843
Sharda Bai, one more
cup of tea please.

293
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:40,574
Yes, Sir.

294
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:43,549
Let me comb your hair today.

295
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:47,283
Sir, tea.
- Clear this.

296
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:51,356
You need a good hair-cut.

297
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:55,563
We'll go to a posh salon
in Bandra this Sunday...

298
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:58,230
...and get you a nice haircut. Okay?

299
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:02,031
How can you be so normal, Aunty?

300
00:18:02,506 --> 00:18:04,235
Pyaari is missing since five days.

301
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,532
And we are behaving
as if it never happened.

302
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:08,109
She has been kidnapped.

303
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:14,980
Wonder where Pyaari is now...

304
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,440
Hello, Ma'am.
- Hello.

305
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,117
There's no network inside.

306
00:19:25,255 --> 00:19:26,745
So he comes out to take his calls.

307
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,049
Something about dealings...

308
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,516
He bought a new cell
phone a few days ago.

309
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:32,962
He is obsessed with
clicking snaps on his phone.

310
00:19:33,263 --> 00:19:34,252
He has clicked mine too.

311
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:35,523
Where would he be right now?

312
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:38,632
Ogling at girls outside
Chaaya restaurant.

313
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:02,550
Kapil!

314
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:05,855
What are you up to?

315
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:09,093
Nothing much.
I was just heading home.

316
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,228
Heading home? I'll drop you.

317
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:12,660
No, Ma'am, don't bother.

318
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:15,301
It's no bother. Come, sit.

319
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:17,306
Come.

320
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,669
Come sit.

321
00:20:28,818 --> 00:20:32,310
Half our life is spent
waiting in this Mumbai traffic.

322
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:40,661
Whose call is it? Answer it.

323
00:20:41,164 --> 00:20:43,860
It's from home.
I am going home anyway.

324
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:50,863
Your family is missing you, huh?

325
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:56,840
Well... my wife gets worried
if I don't reach home on time.

326
00:20:57,847 --> 00:20:58,643
Anyway...

327
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:00,840
May I take a snap with you, Sir?

328
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:02,641
Yes, of course.

329
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,980
Take a good one.

330
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:07,987
Done? Show me.

331
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:10,582
What a phone you have there!

332
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:11,616
Ma'am, take a look.

333
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:13,296
Latest mobile.

334
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:14,286
Wow!

335
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:19,732
Jafar, what did you earn in
so many years with the police force?

336
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:20,436
Peanuts!

337
00:21:22,372 --> 00:21:25,933
We should also quit
our jobs and join an NGO.

338
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:29,508
Pick little girls
from the shelter home...

339
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,242
...sell them and buy
expensive cell phones.

340
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:35,375
Get home on time and enjoy life.
Right, Kapil?

341
00:21:39,322 --> 00:21:41,483
Don't play dumb. We know.

342
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:49,120
Jafar, let's start his
interrogation here itself.

343
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:53,895
If we wait for the traffic to
move Kapil won't get home on time.

344
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:55,065
Good idea, Ma'am.

345
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:58,531
Speak up. Who do you work for?

346
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:02,641
I don't understand what
you are talking about, Sir.

347
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:05,114
Why are you stretching it?

348
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:06,779
We are in an 'instant' era.

349
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:09,808
The quicker you answer,
the quicker you get home.

350
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:11,554
Come on speak up.

351
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:13,846
On whose instructions
did you kidnap Pyaari?

352
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:14,847
Where is she?

353
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:17,586
Speak up, you scum!

354
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:24,163
He's just pretending.

355
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,835
You are messing with my head now!

356
00:22:29,606 --> 00:22:30,630
Are you done?

357
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:34,576
He's been shot, Ma'am!
- What?!

358
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:38,973
There they are!

359
00:22:39,315 --> 00:22:41,476
Morey, call the control
room and get reinforcement.

360
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:42,482
Quick!
- Okay, Ma'am.

361
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:44,051
Morey keep his mobile.

362
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:53,391
Move aside!

363
00:23:03,273 --> 00:23:03,898
Move!

364
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,296
The other shooter.

365
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:34,631
Jafar, this matter
is getting complicated.

366
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,600
Damn!

367
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:40,608
Pyaari, where are you my child!

368
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,508
Come here.

369
00:23:52,322 --> 00:23:52,845
Move.

370
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:58,316
Stop fooling around, guys!

371
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:01,089
Come on.

372
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:03,793
Go there. Who's next?
- She.

373
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:05,935
What's the matter, baby?
Having fun, aren't you?

374
00:24:07,637 --> 00:24:08,899
Will you rip it or should I?

375
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,536
Come on.
- No, please no!

376
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:12,742
Come here.

377
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:13,804
No!

378
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,710
Get her.

379
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:21,280
Come on. Stand straight, you!

380
00:24:57,654 --> 00:24:59,747
I am telling you for the last time.

381
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:02,257
Don't do this to me.

382
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,692
Please!

383
00:25:06,095 --> 00:25:07,824
Easy, Mattu!

384
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,530
Take it off!

385
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,440
Take a good look. She's a virgin!

386
00:25:25,748 --> 00:25:26,840
In spite of you around?

387
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,316
Don't you find anyone
else to pick on!

388
00:25:30,787 --> 00:25:31,754
Put her in No. 2.

389
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,811
Baby Doll!

390
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:36,816
Come here to Papa. Come.

391
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:38,817
Hey!

392
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:45,434
Don't come near me rascals.
Don't come.

393
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,325
Are you insane?!

394
00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:49,161
Who will you kill
with that splinter?

395
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:51,370
Myself. I will slash myself.

396
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,468
Don't slash your wrists.

397
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,806
It'll hurt more
and will take more time.

398
00:25:58,615 --> 00:25:59,809
Loretto School, Kolkata, huh?

399
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:02,173
Her school is very famous.

400
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,778
I was in Hindu College.

401
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:08,189
Dropped out in the second year.

402
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,888
But that I can help you with.

403
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:13,452
No really.

404
00:26:14,564 --> 00:26:18,330
If you really want to die
then cut this vein of your neck.

405
00:26:18,835 --> 00:26:20,393
It'll be quick and
it'll be painless.

406
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:25,339
And if you still want to run
I really suggest you drop that idea.

407
00:26:25,642 --> 00:26:27,269
Because you have seen me.

408
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:29,533
What's her name?

409
00:26:30,413 --> 00:26:31,107
Mrunal.

410
00:26:33,016 --> 00:26:36,577
Mrunal, now it leaves
us with two options.

411
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:38,916
You either work for me...

412
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:41,314
Don't come, don't come.

413
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:43,549
Chill. It's okay.

414
00:26:45,295 --> 00:26:46,626
Or I will have to kill you.

415
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,788
What were you about to do?

416
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:52,564
Yeah. I would have
also done the same.

417
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:54,960
Slash your wrist slightly from here.

418
00:26:55,338 --> 00:26:57,363
It would have taken five to seven
days for you to die.

419
00:26:58,341 --> 00:26:59,808
In front of all the girls.

420
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,602
Is that what you want?

421
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,111
But what to do?

422
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:08,081
A bit of drama is required
to control so many of you.

423
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:11,310
And that leaves us
with our last option.

424
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:14,078
If you want to stay alive...

425
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:17,783
...and lead a good life
I can help you with that too.

426
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:20,095
You are quite hot, you know.

427
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,430
I can get you the best clients.

428
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:28,197
5 star hotels, fine dining,
beaches, clubs, foreign trips.

429
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:30,706
Think about it.

430
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:36,941
But the way I look at it, you don't
really have a choice. Do you?

431
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,302
Mattu, keep her for Hong Kong.

432
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:08,104
Come on, Charlie's Angel.

433
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:32,896
Put her in No. 1

434
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:39,139
The shooter has been identified.
He's Hanif Hatela's man.

435
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:41,975
Hanif, the hired assassin?
- Yes, Ma'am.

436
00:28:43,212 --> 00:28:43,769
Look at this.

437
00:28:44,747 --> 00:28:46,840
We found a treasure in Kapil's phone.

438
00:28:47,483 --> 00:28:49,212
All the notorious ones together?

439
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:53,281
Ma'am most of them are
members of the Ali Gang.

440
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,450
This one is Balu Kotian...

441
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:58,218
...and this one is Dhapna Khalid.

442
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:00,592
Go back.

443
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:02,696
Just a moment.

444
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:06,796
This...

445
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,904
Who's this?

446
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:13,898
I have never seen him before.

447
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,240
Kapil loved to flaunt
his connections.

448
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:19,943
He's surely a member of some gang.

449
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:24,181
This is definitely a huge syndicate.

450
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:30,088
To pick up a girl so smoothly,
and then shoot him...

451
00:29:30,693 --> 00:29:33,924
Only an organised gang
can operate with such finesse.

452
00:29:39,469 --> 00:29:43,098
There is one man,
who keeps track of such things.

453
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,540
Is this a new style
of interrogation?

454
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,903
Feed meat and extract information?

455
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:55,946
Tell me, Rehman,
is anything free in life?

456
00:29:56,652 --> 00:29:58,279
If everything was without a price...

457
00:29:58,554 --> 00:29:59,714
...then would you
have become a gangster?

458
00:30:01,023 --> 00:30:01,717
You are right.

459
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:11,291
Do you know him?

460
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:14,593
Are you kidding me?

461
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:16,564
You want me to be an
informer at my stature?

462
00:30:18,741 --> 00:30:19,605
You idiot!

463
00:30:20,376 --> 00:30:21,866
When I had come to arrest you...

464
00:30:22,311 --> 00:30:25,303
...you were begging
me not to shoot you.

465
00:30:26,315 --> 00:30:27,646
And now you talk about stature?

466
00:30:28,017 --> 00:30:30,986
Don't waste my time.
I have loads of other work.

467
00:30:32,688 --> 00:30:33,347
Katyal.

468
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:36,318
He is Sunny Katyal.

469
00:30:37,493 --> 00:30:38,391
He's not from Mumbai.

470
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:40,661
He started operating here
around three years ago.

471
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,764
He has fifteen car showrooms now.

472
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:50,532
But the real dough comes from
drugs and trafficking.

473
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,773
Whenever a girl between
8 to 18 years disappears...

474
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,979
... more often than
not he is involved.

475
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:05,345
You can call him
the wholesaler of trafficking.

476
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,022
No matter where a girl disappears
from, she ends up in his net.

477
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:11,991
Why is he not on our radar yet?

478
00:31:13,095 --> 00:31:15,290
Your radar? He is not
even on our radar yet.

479
00:31:15,565 --> 00:31:17,931
It's impossible to crack
how he smuggles drugs and girls.

480
00:31:18,968 --> 00:31:21,095
How do the other
gangs let him operate?

481
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:23,465
He is a very smart man.

482
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,168
Keeps everyone happy.

483
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:26,935
Has no enemies.

484
00:31:27,577 --> 00:31:30,740
But I have a strong doubt that
he is the brain behind all this.

485
00:31:31,113 --> 00:31:33,308
There is someone
bigger supporting him.

486
00:31:33,983 --> 00:31:37,180
You gave me a lot of information
in return for a Mutton Kolhapuri.

487
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,989
I did it for the girl.
Not for the food.

488
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:49,192
Thanks for the meat.

489
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:57,965
Katyal.

490
00:31:58,808 --> 00:31:59,467
Sunny Katyal.

491
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:01,570
I want to know about
every message...

492
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:02,967
...every call that's
made from his cell phone.

493
00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:06,338
What time he wakes up in the morning
to who he bangs in the night!

494
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:07,716
I want to know everything.

495
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:08,439
Got it?

496
00:32:08,818 --> 00:32:09,307
Yes, Ma'am.

497
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:35,307
Check the angle of the video.
- Yes, Sir.

498
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:36,737
I want it clear.

499
00:33:13,983 --> 00:33:15,814
Hello, Vakil Sir.
It's a mess here.

500
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:18,352
The Crime Branch people
have made my life hell.

501
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,278
I think they'll very soon
monitor me in the loo!

502
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:23,782
How did they get to know about you?

503
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:25,618
How do I know that Vakil Sir?

504
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:28,586
I just know that they are
behind my life with a vengeance.

505
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:29,661
What will you do now?

506
00:33:29,965 --> 00:33:31,296
I am thinking of talking
to the commissioner.

507
00:33:31,767 --> 00:33:32,563
Moron!

508
00:33:33,336 --> 00:33:36,169
Why inform the commissioner about
things that he doesn't know yet!

509
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:37,565
Then please tell
me what I should do.

510
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:40,567
Find out the price of the inspector
who's leading this operation.

511
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,174
Throw some money at him.

512
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:44,136
That's the problem, Vakil Sir.

513
00:33:44,246 --> 00:33:44,940
It's some woman.

514
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:46,743
She has a track record
of not accepting bribes.

515
00:33:47,616 --> 00:33:49,743
Woman? Tell me her name.

516
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:53,053
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
From the Crime Branch.

517
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:55,054
Do one thing.

518
00:33:55,391 --> 00:33:57,951
Get me her number.
I'll call her tomorrow.

519
00:34:00,029 --> 00:34:04,125
Get me the number!
Like it's a piece of cake.

520
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:07,197
Where the hell am I sitting!

521
00:34:07,636 --> 00:34:09,399
Just when some money
was on its way...

522
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,801
...this moron has made plans
to ruin it.

523
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:18,979
I have a feeling this inspector
is going to ask for a huge price.

524
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:21,444
Has Mr. Singh's payment come?

525
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:22,476
Yes.

526
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:27,949
The batch of girls
this time is superb.

527
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:30,553
Really?

528
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:32,791
What did he say?

529
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:35,097
He signed a 200,000 deal.

530
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:39,460
The foreigners loved the
service that our girls gave.

531
00:34:40,302 --> 00:34:41,667
What is the status of the girls
from Bangladesh?

532
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
It's getting delayed.

533
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:46,303
The security at the border
has become very stringent.

534
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:47,471
It will take a week more.

535
00:34:48,244 --> 00:34:52,305
You are very lenient with them,
Vakil Sir.

536
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,182
They are very prompt
at collecting their payments.

537
00:34:59,655 --> 00:35:01,748
But when it comes to delivery,
a week's delay?

538
00:35:02,258 --> 00:35:02,917
Not done.

539
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:06,454
What was her name?

540
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:07,955
Shivani Roy.

541
00:35:08,597 --> 00:35:11,259
Wow! She's hot.

542
00:35:13,202 --> 00:35:15,067
Let it be, Vakil sir.

543
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:18,596
You are too old to
deal with women like her.

544
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,277
I'll talk to her.

545
00:35:24,713 --> 00:35:26,476
Tell Katyal to get
all information on her.

546
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:28,408
A week has passed
and no leads yet.

547
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,582
Either he is smart
or our information is wrong.

548
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:34,612
Yeah, Mr. Sinha (Boss) too
is getting impatient.

549
00:35:35,658 --> 00:35:36,989
Let's wait for a few more days.

550
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,291
I am sure he will
commit some mistake.

551
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,365
Come on. I have got dinner.

552
00:35:58,581 --> 00:35:59,343
Hello?

553
00:35:59,882 --> 00:36:01,042
You reached home, Ma'am?

554
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,046
Who's this?

555
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:03,047
Doesn't matter.

556
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,754
How come you picked dinner
from Aaswaad tonight?

557
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:07,517
Sharda bai didn't
come to work today?

558
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,786
Yes. Aaswaad has lovely food.

559
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,755
Want to join us for dinner?
- I had heard right about you.

560
00:36:12,828 --> 00:36:13,760
Aunty, what have you got?

561
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:15,387
Someone else would
have been rattled.

562
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:18,055
Set the plates.
I am very hungry. Call Kaku.

563
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:19,596
Go, quick, quick.

564
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,401
Tell me.

565
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,999
Why are you watching me?

566
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:28,273
If you keep a watch on my men then
I will have to watch you, right?

567
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,644
Oh! So you are Katyal's daddy!

568
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,282
You sound like his son though.

569
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,710
How does it matter?

570
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:38,111
It's the same family.

571
00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:40,951
The whole family seems twisted.

572
00:36:41,724 --> 00:36:44,284
You are calling me from VOIP
so I can't trace your call?

573
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:46,758
To deal with a sharp
officer like you...

574
00:36:47,229 --> 00:36:48,856
...one needs to be prepared, right?

575
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:51,996
No point tracing the IP address...

576
00:36:53,302 --> 00:36:53,996
You won't find anything.

577
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,630
Enough bragging.

578
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,469
Get to the point.
My food is getting cold.

579
00:36:59,308 --> 00:37:01,776
Stop watching my people
and quote your price.

580
00:37:02,278 --> 00:37:03,575
I want my daughter back.

581
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:05,941
Daughter?

582
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:08,383
You have a daughter?

583
00:37:09,084 --> 00:37:12,110
The girl you picked up
from the Andheri shelter home...

584
00:37:12,388 --> 00:37:13,377
...is like my daughter.

585
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,822
Oh! That's why you
are behind my life.

586
00:37:20,896 --> 00:37:23,228
It might have been possible
if you had asked earlier.

587
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,329
It's difficult now.

588
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:27,831
Fine. Then the surveillance
will continue.

589
00:37:29,104 --> 00:37:32,403
You are stretching this
a bit too much.

590
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:36,707
She was like your daughter,
but not your real daughter, right?

591
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,144
Let's do one thing.

592
00:37:39,415 --> 00:37:43,215
There's a 35 story skyscraper
coming up in Wadala.

593
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:46,083
The top floor is yours.

594
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:51,853
No thanks. If the elevator
breaks down, who'll climb 35 floors!

595
00:37:54,597 --> 00:37:55,291
Then tell me what you want.

596
00:37:55,631 --> 00:37:57,360
I told you I want Pyaari back.

597
00:37:59,368 --> 00:38:01,529
Shivani ji, you
aren't listening to me.

598
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,396
That girl has seen too much.

599
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:08,436
I don't take such
a risk in my business.

600
00:38:09,878 --> 00:38:10,936
It's too late now.

601
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:12,911
Aunty, hurry up!

602
00:38:15,317 --> 00:38:16,682
Listen, kid.

603
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:20,311
I'll come hunting to
your house to rescue Pyaari.

604
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:21,250
But rescue I will.

605
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,054
That's a lot of anger Ma'am.

606
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,318
Chill. Don't get worked up.

607
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:27,762
It doesn't suit you.

608
00:38:27,997 --> 00:38:28,622
Anything else?

609
00:38:30,966 --> 00:38:34,697
Don't do this.
Think about it please.

610
00:38:35,537 --> 00:38:37,562
You need to think about it Junior.

611
00:38:38,073 --> 00:38:40,132
I won't take too
long to reach Pyaari...

612
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:43,278
...but the day I reach her you
won't be capable of even thinking.

613
00:38:46,215 --> 00:38:48,809
Okay, Ma'am.
You do your job and I'll do mine.

614
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,347
Let's just both do
what's best for business.

615
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,548
But I have to admit
it was fun talking to you.

616
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,584
Bye Ma'am.

617
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:04,732
Hello. Mattu, put that
girl Pyaari in tonight's lot.

618
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,902
Jafar, pick Katyal from his house.

619
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,268
I'll finish dinner and come.
Yes, right now.

620
00:39:12,174 --> 00:39:13,266
How dare you touch me?

621
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:17,274
You can't harass a responsible
and innocent citizen this way.

622
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,943
Please, please, Sir, speak in Hindi.
I do not understand.

623
00:39:23,252 --> 00:39:24,685
I will speak to the Human Rights
Organisations...

624
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:25,720
...and feed you to the dogs.

625
00:39:26,055 --> 00:39:27,044
Sure.

626
00:39:27,623 --> 00:39:28,749
Jafar?
- Patil?

627
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:37,264
You feed us to the dogs
and we will feed you jalebis.

628
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:38,925
Jalebi?

629
00:39:40,469 --> 00:39:44,906
You will eat the jalebis, feel very
sleepy but we won't let you sleep.

630
00:39:46,308 --> 00:39:47,104
I don't eat jalebis.

631
00:39:47,409 --> 00:39:48,569
Shut up and eat! Or I'll...

632
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:53,280
Eat it. He hits very hard. Eat it.

633
00:39:54,149 --> 00:39:55,844
I will eat it. Hang on a second.

634
00:39:56,085 --> 00:39:56,642
Eat.

635
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:09,423
Gentlemen, please key in your
bids on your iPad screens now.

636
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:16,832
For the sweet and spicy No. 104.

637
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:20,297
She looks grown, but is just a child.

638
00:40:21,777 --> 00:40:26,680
100% virgin. 100% pure. Guaranteed.

639
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,054
No!

640
00:40:44,633 --> 00:40:46,760
I thought I'd celebrate
my birthday with Ganpati.

641
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:48,163
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

642
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:51,067
How are you?

643
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,331
How old will you be?
- How old are you?

644
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,509
Twelve.
- Me too.

645
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:55,366
You too?

646
00:40:57,346 --> 00:40:59,075
Pyaari, come quickly.

647
00:41:05,354 --> 00:41:08,448
You met me, right, Aunty?
My Ganpati selected you for me.

648
00:41:08,657 --> 00:41:09,715
What will you become
when you grow up?

649
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,016
An airplane driver.

650
00:41:11,426 --> 00:41:11,949
What?

651
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:15,930
It's called a pilot,
not a driver, you fool!

652
00:41:16,465 --> 00:41:17,295
Same thing.

653
00:41:17,466 --> 00:41:21,459
I'll fly the plane very high,
right in the middle of clouds.

654
00:41:33,382 --> 00:41:36,317
Ma'am, have your ginger
tea and fix your mood.

655
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:37,676
Thank you, Jafar.

656
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,487
He's a seasoned player.

657
00:41:46,195 --> 00:41:47,890
We stuffed him with
a kilo of jalebis...

658
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:49,821
...didn't give him
even a drop of water...

659
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,133
...but he still
didn't open his mouth.

660
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:55,661
Ma'am I'll continue for the
next four hours. You go on home.

661
00:41:57,539 --> 00:41:59,507
Ask Morey and Pawaskar
to continue later.

662
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:01,437
Don't let him sleep
even for a second.

663
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,542
Yes, Ma'am.

664
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:03,935
Thank you.

665
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,747
I am coming. Two minutes.

666
00:42:15,624 --> 00:42:17,751
Aunty, you are so late!

667
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:23,128
Sorry. But I think
we'll soon find Pyaari.

668
00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:26,465
Really, Aunty? You are the best,
Aunty. You are the best.

669
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,164
It won't hurt after
a couple of times.

670
00:43:03,538 --> 00:43:04,334
Here...

671
00:43:05,707 --> 00:43:06,401
...cupcake.

672
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:09,208
For both of you.

673
00:43:10,779 --> 00:43:12,838
Every girl gets it
after her first night.

674
00:43:13,749 --> 00:43:14,579
Have it.

675
00:43:18,287 --> 00:43:21,450
I too blew my past away
after my first night.

676
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,816
That's the only way to survive here.

677
00:43:24,293 --> 00:43:27,160
Otherwise your life will be hell.

678
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:31,993
Come on, now blow the candle
and move on.

679
00:43:34,169 --> 00:43:34,863
Come on.

680
00:43:41,877 --> 00:43:44,812
It's a great idea to teach
that nosy cop a lesson.

681
00:43:45,113 --> 00:43:47,775
But we'll have to
pay a fat price for it.

682
00:43:49,351 --> 00:43:51,512
This guy will do our job for free.

683
00:43:52,888 --> 00:43:53,786
Here.

684
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,052
Call Riyaz.

685
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:58,822
Tell him that this job must be done.

686
00:44:01,063 --> 00:44:02,758
Performance bonus guaranteed.

687
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:11,233
Shivani ji, you will
stop nosing around after this.

688
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,142
Sometimes... I feel scared of you.

689
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,275
It's good that way.

690
00:44:22,718 --> 00:44:24,345
Fear gets work done faster.

691
00:44:34,363 --> 00:44:36,593
Morey... 21 missed calls!

692
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:47,767
Ma'am, come quickly.

693
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:48,735
Why?

694
00:44:48,877 --> 00:44:50,310
Ma'am, come quickly please.

695
00:45:00,188 --> 00:45:01,780
Get the pervert doctor!

696
00:46:24,773 --> 00:46:26,434
In a shocking incident in Mumbai...

697
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:28,573
...a female patient
accused a doctor...

698
00:46:28,643 --> 00:46:30,338
...of inappropriate behaviour.

699
00:46:30,445 --> 00:46:32,572
Runa, that's my Kaku!

700
00:46:34,282 --> 00:46:35,146
What's going on?

701
00:46:38,453 --> 00:46:40,011
A few hours after the allegations...

702
00:46:40,322 --> 00:46:42,290
...the members of
Maharashtra Seva Mandal...

703
00:46:42,657 --> 00:46:47,356
...attacked the dispensary
and defamed the doctor.

704
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,026
We had no intentions of
taking the law in our hands.

705
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,467
But the people are
fuming with anger...

706
00:46:54,669 --> 00:46:56,603
...because of the growing
exploitation of women.

707
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:59,231
The anger found its vent this way.

708
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,372
That doctor must be punished.

709
00:47:04,913 --> 00:47:05,811
Please eat.

710
00:47:46,855 --> 00:47:47,651
Hello?

711
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:50,981
It's the 'kid' speaking, Ma'am.

712
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:56,124
I am genuinely sorry
for what's happened.

713
00:47:56,965 --> 00:47:59,763
In fact I even had tears
when I heard the news.

714
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:02,799
But I hope this doesn't
change things between us.

715
00:48:04,105 --> 00:48:06,300
Because I am just
starting to like you.

716
00:48:07,075 --> 00:48:09,703
There was nothing personal
about this, Ma'am.

717
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:12,707
It's just business.

718
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:16,240
Please don't harbour
any misunderstanding.

719
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:17,509
Please.

720
00:48:19,254 --> 00:48:22,883
You know what, Junior,
I grew up in a village.

721
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:26,752
There was a dense
forest near my house.

722
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,928
That's why from early on
in life I knew animals very well.

723
00:48:32,634 --> 00:48:36,468
Maybe that's the reason why Kamat
Sir took me in the Crime Branch.

724
00:48:37,272 --> 00:48:39,706
To trap a mouse you
have to act like one.

725
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,971
To catch a dog you
have to think like one.

726
00:48:42,444 --> 00:48:44,537
To hunt a tiger you
have to become one.

727
00:48:45,647 --> 00:48:46,739
You know what you are?

728
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:52,083
You are that poisonous
snake near the river...

729
00:48:52,354 --> 00:48:58,293
...who can't be seen but bites
oblivious kids swimming in the river.

730
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,595
You should have been with
the Discovery Channel, Ma'am.

731
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,859
What are you doing
in the police force?

732
00:49:08,036 --> 00:49:10,596
You are the one who's
about to be discovered, kid.

733
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:13,439
I don't know what your name is.

734
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,108
I don't know
where you are speaking from.

735
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:19,702
Who your boss is
or where you have kept Pyaari.

736
00:49:21,049 --> 00:49:23,040
But I've figured your type

737
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:28,616
No matter how far you
try to stay away...

738
00:49:28,923 --> 00:49:31,323
...your nature will compel you
to come closer to me.

739
00:49:32,394 --> 00:49:33,258
30 days.

740
00:49:34,462 --> 00:49:35,986
I will hunt you down in 30 days.

741
00:49:36,531 --> 00:49:41,093
And then with a lot of love and
patience I'll squish you to pulp.

742
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,197
Mark my words. 30 days.

743
00:49:59,853 --> 00:50:02,822
Tandon Sir, I have heard there's
a high command meeting next week.

744
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:05,822
You hear everything, Mattu.
But you do nothing.

745
00:50:06,193 --> 00:50:07,922
Sir, first you don't give
me an opportunity to work...

746
00:50:07,995 --> 00:50:10,293
...and then you call me useless.
This is unfair, Sir.

747
00:50:11,165 --> 00:50:13,827
Big announcements are to be made
in the party meeting this time.

748
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:16,668
Now you are making me drool.

749
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,132
Mr. Taneja is coming this time.

750
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:22,534
Really? That means
it's going to be huge.

751
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:23,674
That's awesome, Sir.

752
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:26,502
The contract for Taneja's
personal party must come to us.

753
00:50:26,714 --> 00:50:28,272
Why should I get you the contract?

754
00:50:28,716 --> 00:50:32,550
Name the drug and you'll get it,
Sir. Indian, South American.

755
00:50:33,187 --> 00:50:37,453
And as far as girls go,
look at the choice, Sir.

756
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:39,686
Film star or porn star.

757
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:42,519
You are still not getting me, Mattu.

758
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:45,988
Why should I get you the contract?

759
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:50,062
Oh! I have been
blabbering like a fool.

760
00:50:51,038 --> 00:50:52,869
The list will obviously
begin with you, Sir.

761
00:50:53,073 --> 00:50:56,736
And shame on me if you
have to tell me your list.

762
00:50:59,546 --> 00:51:03,277
Hey, Jennifer! Come here, baby.
Come here. Take Sir...

763
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:09,252
Oh! Good choice, Sir.
Hey, Julia Roberts!

764
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:11,122
Darling, baby, come here.

765
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:13,185
Don't be shy. Come here.

766
00:51:16,296 --> 00:51:16,921
Good girl.

767
00:51:17,131 --> 00:51:19,998
Keep the tray here and
take Sir to the washroom.

768
00:51:22,436 --> 00:51:23,801
Call me on Monday.

769
00:51:24,438 --> 00:51:26,030
Maybe this time you'll get lucky.

770
00:51:29,843 --> 00:51:30,810
Don't forget, Sir!

771
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:32,437
Come, baby...

772
00:51:40,988 --> 00:51:41,750
Hey, Mattu.

773
00:51:42,656 --> 00:51:45,352
You really do appear out of nowhere!

774
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:46,818
I have been watching you.

775
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,552
How long does it
take to crack a deal?

776
00:51:48,762 --> 00:51:50,093
I am not selling water purifiers.

777
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:52,495
I am trying to crack a deal
worth crores. It takes time.

778
00:51:52,766 --> 00:51:54,393
If he doesn't call on Monday...

779
00:51:54,535 --> 00:51:56,662
I swear I'll go to Katra
and sell religious CDs.

780
00:51:57,004 --> 00:51:58,164
If this deal doesn't come through...

781
00:51:58,272 --> 00:52:00,934
I won't even leave you capable
of selling porn CDs at Palika.

782
00:52:01,108 --> 00:52:02,541
I am at it.

783
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:04,902
Please don't threaten unnecessarily.

784
00:52:05,112 --> 00:52:06,773
Okay. You crack this deal.

785
00:52:06,847 --> 00:52:08,974
I'll send you to Mumbai
to look after our set up there.

786
00:52:09,249 --> 00:52:10,113
Mumbai?

787
00:52:10,651 --> 00:52:12,516
But Katyal is looking
after Mumbai, right?

788
00:52:13,153 --> 00:52:15,144
Left... left... Very good.

789
00:52:16,123 --> 00:52:17,351
Good Job.

790
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,622
You fool! Be careful.

791
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:21,424
The packet will break.

792
00:52:21,995 --> 00:52:22,962
Be careful.

793
00:52:24,932 --> 00:52:27,298
Guggu, will the car
be fixed by evening?

794
00:52:27,668 --> 00:52:28,965
Yes, Sir. It'll be ready.

795
00:52:32,172 --> 00:52:33,571
Hello, Vakil Sir.

796
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:36,032
This time the consignment is superb!

797
00:52:36,276 --> 00:52:38,039
Forget the consignment.
Listen to me.

798
00:52:38,445 --> 00:52:41,539
That cop chick has lost it.
She will pick you up again.

799
00:52:42,049 --> 00:52:44,711
Vakil Sir, she is after my life!

800
00:52:45,152 --> 00:52:46,141
Should I fix her?

801
00:52:46,453 --> 00:52:48,853
Don't be stupid, Katyal.

802
00:52:49,323 --> 00:52:52,156
You want the entire Mumbai
Police force to come behind you?

803
00:52:52,493 --> 00:52:53,221
What should I do then?

804
00:52:53,694 --> 00:52:55,025
Go underground for a few days.

805
00:52:55,596 --> 00:52:56,893
One of my men will
come in the evening.

806
00:52:57,164 --> 00:52:58,426
Go with him to the safe house.

807
00:52:59,132 --> 00:53:00,963
He will make arrangements
for you there.

808
00:53:01,268 --> 00:53:02,929
What nonsense is this, Vakil Sir?

809
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,501
Don't crib so much!

810
00:53:05,005 --> 00:53:06,768
Pack your bag and
be ready in the evening.

811
00:53:07,107 --> 00:53:08,506
Go with my man.

812
00:53:09,977 --> 00:53:10,636
Bye.

813
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:14,243
Pour it in my mouth!

814
00:53:14,948 --> 00:53:15,915
Get lost!

815
00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:17,980
I am surrounded by duck heads!

816
00:53:20,487 --> 00:53:21,977
What's going on?

817
00:53:26,727 --> 00:53:29,958
Vakil Sir has sent
such an atrocious car!

818
00:53:32,266 --> 00:53:33,062
Good bye, Sir!

819
00:53:37,504 --> 00:53:39,335
Hello? Hello?

820
00:53:42,843 --> 00:53:46,745
The network conks off
at the slightest disturbance.

821
00:53:48,348 --> 00:53:51,875
Nobody cheats the people more
than these cell phone companies.

822
00:53:53,086 --> 00:53:57,682
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me, Sir?

823
00:53:58,525 --> 00:53:59,514
Hello?

824
00:54:01,161 --> 00:54:02,958
What's wrong?
Why did you stop the car?

825
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:05,990
Everything is bloody jinxed!

826
00:54:06,533 --> 00:54:07,431
Get out of the car.

827
00:54:10,237 --> 00:54:10,794
Get out.

828
00:54:11,772 --> 00:54:13,034
Vakil Sir!

829
00:54:13,407 --> 00:54:15,102
Get out of the car
or I'll shoot you.

830
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:17,174
I am getting out!

831
00:54:18,912 --> 00:54:19,970
Listen to me.

832
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,004
Why are you doing this? For money?

833
00:54:22,482 --> 00:54:23,449
I'll give you double.

834
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:24,544
Move!

835
00:54:25,819 --> 00:54:27,252
Listen to me once.

836
00:54:27,487 --> 00:54:30,183
I'll give you all the money
you want right away.

837
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,188
Your life will be made.

838
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:32,622
What's happening with me!

839
00:54:34,962 --> 00:54:36,190
Isn't there a chance?

840
00:54:39,266 --> 00:54:42,064
Vakil, what a way
to repay my loyalty!

841
00:54:43,203 --> 00:54:45,364
Let me tell you one
thing before I die.

842
00:54:45,806 --> 00:54:48,798
Don't ever be overtly
loyal to anybody in life.

843
00:54:50,677 --> 00:54:51,541
It screws you.

844
00:54:52,479 --> 00:54:53,446
Look at me.

845
00:54:53,981 --> 00:54:54,709
Fifteen years...

846
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,621
The Hanif you hired to kill Kapil...

847
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:14,825
...eventually took the contract
to kill you.

848
00:55:15,769 --> 00:55:17,430
What a business you guys run!

849
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:20,399
May I ask you something?

850
00:55:22,943 --> 00:55:24,672
How did you know about this?

851
00:55:26,613 --> 00:55:28,774
I am beginning to know
your boss a little bit.

852
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:35,652
He knew that if he didn't
pick you up I would have.

853
00:55:36,456 --> 00:55:40,324
You would always remain a risk
to him even if he saved you.

854
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:42,155
When you sat in the car,

855
00:55:42,262 --> 00:55:45,026
Morey recognised that
your driver was Hanif's man.

856
00:55:45,999 --> 00:55:48,297
Hanif has a brick factory
here in Kharegaon.

857
00:55:48,702 --> 00:55:50,795
It makes it easier
to dispose bodies.

858
00:55:51,705 --> 00:55:52,501
True.

859
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:55,697
I won't leave that rascal.

860
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:57,304
Nor will I.

861
00:55:58,245 --> 00:56:00,236
So tell me. Where does the kid stay?

862
00:56:01,915 --> 00:56:03,815
Kid? Which kid?

863
00:56:04,151 --> 00:56:05,209
Your boss.

864
00:56:05,919 --> 00:56:07,216
He sounds like a kid on the phone.

865
00:56:07,387 --> 00:56:08,581
What are you saying, Ma'am.

866
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:10,586
Vakil is at least 50 or 55 years old.

867
00:56:11,224 --> 00:56:12,316
He is not a kid.

868
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:13,650
You scum!

869
00:56:14,027 --> 00:56:15,927
If you waste our time again...

870
00:56:16,096 --> 00:56:18,758
...I'll make you a eunuch
and sell you off.

871
00:56:18,965 --> 00:56:20,626
I swear by God I am not lying.

872
00:56:21,034 --> 00:56:22,023
If I am lying...

873
00:56:22,436 --> 00:56:24,267
...then do whatever
you want to do with me.

874
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:27,439
Vakil got me to
Mumbai four years ago.

875
00:56:28,308 --> 00:56:29,707
I am working with him since then.

876
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:31,467
Keep talking.

877
00:56:31,778 --> 00:56:32,938
I know Vakil very well.

878
00:56:33,447 --> 00:56:34,311
He stays in Delhi.

879
00:56:34,614 --> 00:56:35,012
Hello?

880
00:56:35,248 --> 00:56:37,648
Damn! Katyal escaped.

881
00:56:37,984 --> 00:56:38,678
How?

882
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,677
Hanif's man was found dead.

883
00:56:41,955 --> 00:56:42,649
How did he die?

884
00:56:42,989 --> 00:56:43,956
He was shot.

885
00:56:44,124 --> 00:56:44,852
Where?

886
00:56:46,293 --> 00:56:48,659
Tell me, where was Hanif shot?

887
00:56:49,996 --> 00:56:50,724
On the body.

888
00:56:50,964 --> 00:56:53,865
Where on the body?
Front? Behind? Where?

889
00:56:56,837 --> 00:56:57,997
He was shot in the head from behind.

890
00:56:58,772 --> 00:56:59,568
Where did they find the dead body?

891
00:56:59,773 --> 00:57:00,967
Near Kharegaon in a brick factory.

892
00:57:04,945 --> 00:57:06,207
Hang up the other phone.

893
00:57:08,415 --> 00:57:09,074
Hung up.

894
00:57:09,783 --> 00:57:13,150
Someone saved Katyal exactly
where he was supposed to be killed.

895
00:57:13,887 --> 00:57:14,683
But who saved him?

896
00:57:15,088 --> 00:57:15,952
Who else?

897
00:57:16,423 --> 00:57:18,220
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

898
00:57:19,526 --> 00:57:21,687
It's time to send her another gift.

899
00:58:06,072 --> 00:58:07,437
Congrats Ma'am.

900
00:58:08,241 --> 00:58:10,732
Someone has dared to point
a finger at me for the first time.

901
00:58:11,378 --> 00:58:12,970
Every time you point
a finger at me...

902
00:58:13,246 --> 00:58:15,146
...you will get this gift from me.

903
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:17,814
Your Kid.

904
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:43,336
Hunt this guy down.
No matter what.

905
00:59:04,865 --> 00:59:05,524
Hello!

906
00:59:05,966 --> 00:59:08,264
I have left from the hotel.
I am going to office now.

907
00:59:08,568 --> 00:59:12,197
Be calm. You are the most
dangerous when you are calm.

908
00:59:20,747 --> 00:59:22,271
Me and Sinha go back a long way.

909
00:59:22,582 --> 00:59:24,015
He was my senior in the institute.

910
00:59:24,284 --> 00:59:25,979
We used to have
fun times those days.

911
00:59:26,686 --> 00:59:28,153
He praises you very highly.

912
00:59:29,022 --> 00:59:32,583
He is my teacher and guide
otherwise I behave like a wild bull.

913
00:59:32,959 --> 00:59:35,325
You know what.
Good officers like you...

914
00:59:35,662 --> 00:59:37,152
May I?
- Yes, come in.

915
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:40,828
Sir...
- Take a seat.

916
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:44,469
Meet Sub-Inspector
Balvinder Singh Sodhi.

917
00:59:44,771 --> 00:59:45,760
A very efficient officer.

918
00:59:46,306 --> 00:59:47,034
Shivani Roy.

919
00:59:47,307 --> 00:59:49,502
Ma'am...
- Senior Inspector, Mumbai Crime Branch.

920
00:59:50,477 --> 00:59:52,468
She has come with information
on a huge child...

921
00:59:52,545 --> 00:59:54,775
...and drug trafficking
syndicate in Delhi.

922
00:59:55,482 --> 00:59:58,815
You guys have my full support
to go the whole yard on this, okay?

923
00:59:59,185 --> 00:59:59,708
Thank you, Sir.

924
01:00:00,353 --> 01:00:02,287
Where are we going?
- To meet my source.

925
01:00:02,455 --> 01:00:04,116
Your source? Here?

926
01:00:04,424 --> 01:00:07,052
I have got him here
with Sinha Sir's help.

927
01:00:07,494 --> 01:00:08,791
Mind if we take my motorcycle?
- Sure.

928
01:00:09,329 --> 01:00:11,297
Right! This is exactly how he looks.

929
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:14,456
The same curls, light eyes.
He is the one.

930
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:17,297
The whole world knows him as Vakil.

931
01:00:17,837 --> 01:00:19,327
But nobody knows his real name.

932
01:00:19,973 --> 01:00:21,702
He sometimes deals
as Devinder Pasricha.

933
01:00:21,942 --> 01:00:23,933
Or opens an office
in the name of Aakash Pandey.

934
01:00:24,077 --> 01:00:27,342
But he keeps no name
or office for more than six months.

935
01:00:27,814 --> 01:00:31,272
We haven't heard of him ever.

936
01:00:31,718 --> 01:00:33,345
He takes pride in that.

937
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:35,515
He always boasts that
he will never get arrested.

938
01:00:35,956 --> 01:00:37,480
Is there a way of reaching him?

939
01:00:37,657 --> 01:00:39,056
Of course there is.

940
01:00:39,659 --> 01:00:41,684
One is drugs and the other is girls.

941
01:00:42,095 --> 01:00:44,188
And that too because
he is getting senile with age.

942
01:00:45,732 --> 01:00:47,996
We can't go posing
as customers for girls.

943
01:00:48,368 --> 01:00:50,598
He will be expecting me
to do something like this.

944
01:00:50,904 --> 01:00:52,895
We'll have to play him
in such a way...

945
01:00:53,106 --> 01:00:55,574
...that lures him to us
instead of us approaching him.

946
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:00,641
Usually drug suppliers
deal only in one kind of drug...

947
01:01:00,914 --> 01:01:03,007
...but he deals
in all kinds of drugs.

948
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,409
If he has his way he'll sell
cough syrup as drugs.

949
01:01:05,552 --> 01:01:06,644
He is that greedy.

950
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,553
As far as I know, Sodhi...

951
01:01:09,055 --> 01:01:11,250
...South American drugs
are hard to get, right?

952
01:01:11,524 --> 01:01:13,458
Right. And even if you get it,
it's very expensive.

953
01:01:15,929 --> 01:01:17,692
That means a higher profit margin.

954
01:01:19,265 --> 01:01:21,426
He will do anything for business.

955
01:01:22,836 --> 01:01:26,135
If we can get this news to Vakil
that we are not buyers...

956
01:01:26,473 --> 01:01:30,000
...but suppliers of such high-end
cocaine, he's bound to approach us.

957
01:01:30,977 --> 01:01:33,036
Bob. There's a guy called Bob.

958
01:01:33,513 --> 01:01:36,539
If he comes to know
then it is sure to reach Vakil.

959
01:01:38,084 --> 01:01:41,281
But our drug supplier
should look genuine.

960
01:01:49,029 --> 01:01:50,087
Why should we do it?

961
01:01:51,031 --> 01:01:53,295
Because it's a question
of somebody's life Mbangwa.

962
01:01:53,566 --> 01:01:55,397
But it's a matter of our life too.

963
01:01:55,702 --> 01:01:56,828
And what if we get killed?

964
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:58,332
Who will kill you?

965
01:01:58,605 --> 01:02:00,402
We are here to protect you. Relax.

966
01:02:01,241 --> 01:02:02,333
Stupid policeman.

967
01:02:04,411 --> 01:02:05,002
No.

968
01:02:06,946 --> 01:02:08,345
Listen to me Mboso.

969
01:02:09,949 --> 01:02:12,179
Don't forget
you don't have any passport.

970
01:02:12,786 --> 01:02:15,186
So either I will make
papers to deport you back...

971
01:02:15,422 --> 01:02:17,185
...or I will arrange
for your stay in Tihar Jail.

972
01:02:17,357 --> 01:02:19,120
You decide.

973
01:02:34,074 --> 01:02:35,268
Where's Bob?
- What?

974
01:02:35,508 --> 01:02:38,170
Where Bob? Bob?
- Bob? Down there.

975
01:02:38,278 --> 01:02:38,937
Okay.

976
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:44,739
Hail Almighty!

977
01:02:45,885 --> 01:02:47,853
Mindblowing stuff!

978
01:02:48,955 --> 01:02:50,013
Very good, very good.

979
01:02:50,156 --> 01:02:51,953
Hey, Bob!
- Baby!

980
01:02:53,726 --> 01:02:54,954
Having fun?
- Yeah!

981
01:02:55,028 --> 01:02:55,995
Go enjoy!

982
01:02:59,466 --> 01:03:00,899
So, big guy, how much do you have?

983
01:03:01,634 --> 01:03:02,157
Five.

984
01:03:02,535 --> 01:03:03,695
Five what?

985
01:03:04,504 --> 01:03:05,095
Five kilos.

986
01:03:05,905 --> 01:03:06,929
Are you crazy?

987
01:03:07,407 --> 01:03:10,808
I want 100 grams only.

988
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:15,642
Hey listen.
It's either full or nothing.

989
01:03:15,982 --> 01:03:16,710
Let's go.

990
01:03:19,319 --> 01:03:21,651
Listen, come here.

991
01:03:23,523 --> 01:03:27,118
I will tell you one thing. I have
one customer who will take it all.

992
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,291
The whole material. Okay?

993
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:32,193
How much longer? Please hurry.

994
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:36,564
What should I tell Bob?

995
01:03:38,004 --> 01:03:38,834
Who's Bob?

996
01:03:39,672 --> 01:03:41,799
Our Bob. Bobby Kukreja.

997
01:03:45,044 --> 01:03:46,204
He met those Nigerians.

998
01:03:46,813 --> 01:03:48,838
How much is he demanding?
- 50 lakhs.

999
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:52,083
Give me some onions.

1000
01:03:52,986 --> 01:03:55,011
The material will be
good if Bob has checked it.

1001
01:03:55,555 --> 01:03:57,887
Besides the cricket season
is beginning from next month.

1002
01:03:59,425 --> 01:04:01,256
How much longer?

1003
01:04:01,661 --> 01:04:02,889
It's been a long time now.

1004
01:04:08,234 --> 01:04:12,170
Tell all our people that
if someone demands girls...

1005
01:04:12,972 --> 01:04:16,703
...especially young girls,
then don't entertain.

1006
01:04:17,644 --> 01:04:20,408
Our cop chick will surely
send someone as a customer.

1007
01:04:21,614 --> 01:04:22,672
Not to take any new customers?

1008
01:04:23,516 --> 01:04:24,847
I said no.

1009
01:04:25,518 --> 01:04:27,110
This is the limit now!
How much longer?

1010
01:04:27,654 --> 01:04:29,986
Taste from my plate
if you are in such a rush.

1011
01:04:32,192 --> 01:04:33,318
What else to say!

1012
01:04:34,427 --> 01:04:37,487
Call the Nigerian.
But in our manner.

1013
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,989
Yeah, Bob.

1014
01:04:43,002 --> 01:04:45,470
The call has come. I am leaving.

1015
01:04:46,306 --> 01:04:47,000
Okay.

1016
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:53,205
Mathur, I'll wait at Babur Road.

1017
01:04:53,346 --> 01:04:55,314
Tell me the position
of Mboso's car later.

1018
01:04:55,882 --> 01:04:56,644
Let's go.

1019
01:05:11,965 --> 01:05:14,092
Auto!
- Lajpat Nagar, please.

1020
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:17,261
Ma'am, what are you doing?
We called for it first.

1021
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:19,165
Shut up! Or I'll call the police.

1022
01:05:19,305 --> 01:05:21,170
Ma'am we are the police.

1023
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:23,002
We are going to raid a place.
Want to come along?

1024
01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:24,435
Ma'am, let's go.

1025
01:05:25,011 --> 01:05:25,807
Sit. Quick.

1026
01:05:25,912 --> 01:05:27,846
I am leaving. Have patience.
Let me take my bag.

1027
01:05:28,014 --> 01:05:30,175
The cops are riding autos
these days.

1028
01:05:30,917 --> 01:05:31,542
Please hurry.
- Auto!

1029
01:05:31,918 --> 01:05:34,011
Tell Sodhi Mboso's location.
- Right away Ma'am.

1030
01:05:50,737 --> 01:05:52,637
We have got a biker
who's asking us to follow.

1031
01:05:53,006 --> 01:05:53,665
Follow him.

1032
01:05:54,374 --> 01:05:58,310
Sodhi, a biker is guiding Mboso.
Be alert.

1033
01:06:45,992 --> 01:06:46,822
Sodhi, stop.

1034
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,521
Stop following Mboso.
They are watching.

1035
01:06:56,736 --> 01:06:58,260
Come, Sodhi. They have left.

1036
01:07:01,941 --> 01:07:03,374
Mathur...
- Yes, Ma'am.

1037
01:07:03,776 --> 01:07:05,676
Track the car on
GPS and let me know.

1038
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,205
Okay?
- Right, Ma'am.

1039
01:07:12,251 --> 01:07:12,876
Go.

1040
01:07:19,225 --> 01:07:20,590
Yes, Mathur.

1041
01:07:21,494 --> 01:07:22,654
Sodhi, take a left.

1042
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:27,021
Vakil sir, is everything fine?
Should I come up?

1043
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,768
All okay. You can come up.

1044
01:07:31,838 --> 01:07:32,497
Okay.

1045
01:07:37,243 --> 01:07:39,438
Sodhi, Stop. That's Mboso's car.

1046
01:08:12,278 --> 01:08:13,074
The cops are here.

1047
01:08:14,147 --> 01:08:15,614
Get out from the back door.

1048
01:08:17,216 --> 01:08:19,309
Sodhi, there'll be a back door.

1049
01:08:19,652 --> 01:08:20,516
Cover from there.

1050
01:08:21,287 --> 01:08:23,278
Bloody swine! You got the cops!

1051
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,391
Ratan, they'll come
up if they hear a gun shot.

1052
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:26,887
You leave from the back door.

1053
01:08:58,825 --> 01:09:00,520
Vakil Sir, leave!
The cops have surrounded us.

1054
01:09:00,793 --> 01:09:02,124
You've deceived Vakil!

1055
01:09:02,628 --> 01:09:04,926
Leave, Vakil Sir.
Hurry! The police is here.

1056
01:09:05,364 --> 01:09:07,798
Leave from the back door. Hurry!

1057
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:17,869
Ratan, you escape from the roof.

1058
01:09:17,977 --> 01:09:19,376
What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

1059
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:20,070
Okay.

1060
01:09:28,721 --> 01:09:29,346
Break it.

1061
01:09:33,993 --> 01:09:35,051
Yes, Vakil Sir?
Are you out of there?

1062
01:09:39,465 --> 01:09:40,363
Come, you...

1063
01:09:41,901 --> 01:09:42,868
You conned us!

1064
01:09:52,612 --> 01:09:53,909
In the Nehru Place office...

1065
01:09:54,013 --> 01:09:58,177
...there's a black diary
beneath my chair.

1066
01:09:58,451 --> 01:10:00,180
It has the numbers and
addresses of our clients.

1067
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:02,412
Keep that carefully.

1068
01:10:05,625 --> 01:10:07,252
I don't have time.

1069
01:10:09,562 --> 01:10:13,362
If they arrest me they'll reach you.

1070
01:10:14,634 --> 01:10:16,124
And I won't ever let that happen.

1071
01:10:17,336 --> 01:10:18,462
What are you talking about,
Vakil Sir?

1072
01:10:18,538 --> 01:10:21,302
We'll get you out somehow.
You just leave now.

1073
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:25,341
Okay, Tiger. I got to go. Bye.

1074
01:10:25,711 --> 01:10:27,338
Hello? Vakil Sir?

1075
01:10:30,483 --> 01:10:31,279
Vakil Sir?

1076
01:10:50,236 --> 01:10:52,227
Move, move. Sodhi.

1077
01:11:19,031 --> 01:11:19,622
Fuck!

1078
01:11:51,864 --> 01:11:54,025
You piece of trash!

1079
01:12:30,002 --> 01:12:31,629
Hello?
- Good morning, Ma'am.

1080
01:12:32,872 --> 01:12:33,736
Did you sleep well?

1081
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:37,475
You are up so early?
Do you work in a call centre?

1082
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:38,999
What to do Ma'am!

1083
01:12:39,712 --> 01:12:42,306
I couldn't sleep wondering
how to kill you.

1084
01:12:42,815 --> 01:12:45,750
So have you decided
how you'll kill me?

1085
01:12:46,452 --> 01:12:50,388
I won't kill you.
You will kill yourself.

1086
01:12:52,191 --> 01:12:54,284
I am just going to
lie back and watch you.

1087
01:12:55,528 --> 01:12:58,622
Wow! That's some style you got kid!

1088
01:12:59,632 --> 01:13:00,758
Are you done wishing good morning...

1089
01:13:00,966 --> 01:13:02,228
...or is there anything
else you want to say?

1090
01:13:03,903 --> 01:13:04,961
What is there to say?

1091
01:13:06,939 --> 01:13:08,804
Now, I will show you what I can do.

1092
01:13:10,676 --> 01:13:13,008
You are sharp I must admit.

1093
01:13:14,513 --> 01:13:15,980
You killed Vakil Sir...

1094
01:13:17,616 --> 01:13:19,607
...hid your family safely.

1095
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,315
But now you can't harm me anymore.

1096
01:13:24,857 --> 01:13:25,687
Because I am still alive.

1097
01:13:25,825 --> 01:13:27,793
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1098
01:13:29,428 --> 01:13:31,293
But you are in my territory.

1099
01:13:33,466 --> 01:13:34,364
Beware.

1100
01:13:46,645 --> 01:13:48,875
Don't chew. Swallow!

1101
01:13:49,682 --> 01:13:52,048
Hey, Bengalan!
Don't you want to go to London?

1102
01:13:52,318 --> 01:13:53,945
You just have to eat this pellet.

1103
01:13:54,353 --> 01:13:55,843
Even the grapes are here.

1104
01:13:56,021 --> 01:13:57,818
Will you practice with grapes?

1105
01:13:58,257 --> 01:14:00,088
I won't.
- What do you mean, I won't?

1106
01:14:00,793 --> 01:14:01,953
You better!

1107
01:14:01,994 --> 01:14:02,983
Open your mouth.

1108
01:14:03,095 --> 01:14:04,653
Give me some other work.

1109
01:14:05,164 --> 01:14:07,826
Enough of your nonsense.
Eat or I'll slap you!

1110
01:14:09,101 --> 01:14:11,228
Mattu is here.
Open your mouth and swallow it.

1111
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:13,961
Stop your drama.
- Why don't you ask her to swallow?

1112
01:14:14,006 --> 01:14:16,236
She got Ratan and Sunny arrested.

1113
01:14:16,442 --> 01:14:17,909
Rest of our men are hiding, right?

1114
01:14:17,977 --> 01:14:19,171
Yes, they are.

1115
01:14:19,278 --> 01:14:20,506
You worry too much.

1116
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:22,008
By the way when are you
sending me to Mumbai?

1117
01:14:22,114 --> 01:14:23,547
I'll take care of our set up there.

1118
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:26,282
Forget Mumbai.
What's the report here?

1119
01:14:26,952 --> 01:14:29,614
6 girls are leaving for London
and 3 for Texas.

1120
01:14:29,688 --> 01:14:32,486
Their domestic help visas
and documents are ready.

1121
01:14:33,159 --> 01:14:34,683
Last time on the way
to the airport...

1122
01:14:34,794 --> 01:14:36,694
...a pellet burst
in one girl's stomach.

1123
01:14:36,996 --> 01:14:37,792
Remember?

1124
01:14:38,264 --> 01:14:39,731
Is anyone else
going to die this time?

1125
01:14:39,832 --> 01:14:41,925
No. This time Alka
has taken all precautions.

1126
01:14:42,001 --> 01:14:43,628
Right, Alka?
- Yes, Sir.

1127
01:14:43,869 --> 01:14:45,632
This time I have used
the safest coatings.

1128
01:14:46,038 --> 01:14:47,369
The pellets won't burst.

1129
01:14:47,573 --> 01:14:48,870
Chill. Everything is under control.

1130
01:14:49,141 --> 01:14:49,698
Yes.

1131
01:14:50,476 --> 01:14:53,468
Keep the No. 1 and 2 categories.
Get rid of the rest.

1132
01:14:53,846 --> 01:14:55,006
We must have only
the best in the party.

1133
01:14:55,147 --> 01:14:56,273
Alka.
- Yes.

1134
01:14:56,515 --> 01:14:58,142
Have you sent our man
to the police headquarters?

1135
01:14:58,317 --> 01:15:00,808
Yes. He's been waiting
since the morning.

1136
01:15:00,986 --> 01:15:02,453
She will definitely go there.

1137
01:15:02,521 --> 01:15:04,819
You don't worry.
Dinesh will handle her.

1138
01:15:05,658 --> 01:15:08,092
That girl with dengue...
do something about her.

1139
01:15:10,629 --> 01:15:12,324
Angelina, baby...

1140
01:15:13,632 --> 01:15:14,963
...what's wrong with you?

1141
01:15:15,501 --> 01:15:16,695
Nothing...
- Nothing!

1142
01:15:16,936 --> 01:15:18,961
She hasn't slept well last night.

1143
01:15:19,138 --> 01:15:21,504
Is your name Julia or Angelina?

1144
01:15:22,908 --> 01:15:23,636
Julia...

1145
01:15:23,843 --> 01:15:26,107
Then let me talk to Angelina.

1146
01:15:28,814 --> 01:15:31,282
Look at your condition.
Why don't you do something about it?

1147
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:33,450
I am just tired...

1148
01:15:34,954 --> 01:15:36,512
Tired, huh?

1149
01:15:37,056 --> 01:15:40,184
That's why you have this
strip of cloth on your forehead.

1150
01:15:41,627 --> 01:15:42,651
I understand.

1151
01:15:42,995 --> 01:15:45,293
Come on.
I'll take you to the doctor.

1152
01:15:45,998 --> 01:15:48,296
Dr. Brad Pitter for Angelina.

1153
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,330
No, no, no...

1154
01:15:49,535 --> 01:15:51,696
Let it be, Mattu.
I'll take care of her. Let her go.

1155
01:15:51,804 --> 01:15:55,205
No, Alka.
The doctor is waiting. Hurry.

1156
01:15:56,876 --> 01:16:00,312
Please let her stay. Please.

1157
01:16:01,614 --> 01:16:03,445
Come on.
- I am alright.

1158
01:16:04,783 --> 01:16:06,751
Alka!
- Coming. Come...

1159
01:16:11,957 --> 01:16:15,518
No! Please let her stay. Please.

1160
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:19,461
Hurry.
- Yes.

1161
01:16:23,135 --> 01:16:23,965
Runa...

1162
01:16:25,804 --> 01:16:26,600
Runa...

1163
01:16:29,108 --> 01:16:30,166
Get her quickly!

1164
01:16:32,177 --> 01:16:33,610
Runa... No! Runa!

1165
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:34,805
Take her away. Come on!

1166
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:35,976
Runa!

1167
01:16:36,916 --> 01:16:39,180
Please don't take her. Please stop!

1168
01:16:48,727 --> 01:16:52,925
Shivani, don't stretch
this case too much.

1169
01:16:53,365 --> 01:16:55,856
We have got the man
we were looking for.

1170
01:16:56,001 --> 01:16:57,298
But we didn't, Sir!

1171
01:16:57,503 --> 01:16:59,733
The mastermind of this
syndicate is still roaming free!

1172
01:17:00,139 --> 01:17:02,903
This is what you think, Shivani.
We don't know that for sure.

1173
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:06,234
I know that for sure, Sir.
I have spoken to him myself.

1174
01:17:06,812 --> 01:17:07,904
And not just drugs...

1175
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,607
...but he also is the kingpin
of sex trafficking.

1176
01:17:10,749 --> 01:17:13,513
Shivani, trafficking is
altogether a different matter.

1177
01:17:13,953 --> 01:17:16,945
We have a trafficking
department to investigate that.

1178
01:17:17,423 --> 01:17:18,390
Department?

1179
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:23,617
There's a department to lodge
an FIR in every police station, Sir.

1180
01:17:24,029 --> 01:17:26,793
In spite of that why is just one out
of every twenty complaint registered?

1181
01:17:27,766 --> 01:17:29,529
Sir, you don't need
the law to do something.

1182
01:17:29,702 --> 01:17:30,794
You need intent.

1183
01:17:31,036 --> 01:17:34,028
And you are determined to find
that girl all by yourself, right?

1184
01:17:34,306 --> 01:17:36,672
She has a name too. Pyaari.

1185
01:17:37,643 --> 01:17:43,411
All these girls who need our
help just end up being 'that girl'.

1186
01:17:44,817 --> 01:17:46,478
No name, no ties.

1187
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:50,554
It's very easy to give up on them.

1188
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:53,788
You know what, Shivani. You
are being unnecessarily emotional.

1189
01:17:53,993 --> 01:17:56,689
So one should get emotional
only after girls are raped?

1190
01:17:57,062 --> 01:18:00,930
What's the point of holding a candle
march after everything's over?

1191
01:18:02,201 --> 01:18:04,897
After all these days, I don't know
what state I'll find Pyaari in.

1192
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:08,471
I don't even know if I'll ever
find her. Or if she'll be alive.

1193
01:18:08,774 --> 01:18:10,207
But that doesn't mean that...

1194
01:18:10,376 --> 01:18:13,971
...I forget about all these
girls like the rest of us.

1195
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,143
And that too after
being a police officer.

1196
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:18,515
You know what, Sir...

1197
01:18:18,984 --> 01:18:22,681
The day our police force gets
emotional and works for these girls,

1198
01:18:23,155 --> 01:18:25,385
...nobody will dare
to harm them.

1199
01:18:25,457 --> 01:18:26,287
Enough, Shivani!

1200
01:18:26,925 --> 01:18:29,758
I agree that we have
arrested a drug dealer...

1201
01:18:30,162 --> 01:18:32,255
...and drugs worth lakhs
because of you.

1202
01:18:32,898 --> 01:18:35,230
But now allow us
to take over from here.

1203
01:18:35,467 --> 01:18:36,491
Is that clear?

1204
01:18:36,935 --> 01:18:37,833
Sir, why us all the time?

1205
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:40,336
Shivani, please don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

1206
01:18:40,973 --> 01:18:42,270
I will see you soon in Mumbai.

1207
01:18:42,441 --> 01:18:43,169
Thank you, Sir.

1208
01:19:25,084 --> 01:19:27,018
Since when do you drive an auto?
- What, Ma'am?

1209
01:19:27,286 --> 01:19:29,584
I asked since when do you
drive an auto.

1210
01:19:29,688 --> 01:19:31,451
Past four or five years.

1211
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:34,221
Can you see that guy there?
- Where?

1212
01:19:34,393 --> 01:19:36,588
There, the white building.
- Where Ma'am?

1213
01:19:57,916 --> 01:19:59,247
She escaped!

1214
01:20:33,552 --> 01:20:34,143
Hello?

1215
01:20:34,453 --> 01:20:36,478
Hello, I wanted to discuss an idea.

1216
01:20:36,722 --> 01:20:38,280
About what, Miss Shivani?
The case is shut.

1217
01:20:38,724 --> 01:20:40,658
Hear me out.
- Okay.

1218
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:44,288
We share the smallest
details of our life...

1219
01:20:44,596 --> 01:20:47,565
...with our girlfriend
boyfriend or spouse, right?

1220
01:20:48,066 --> 01:20:49,829
Yes, it's a natural human tendency.

1221
01:20:50,035 --> 01:20:50,558
Correct!

1222
01:20:50,769 --> 01:20:52,066
So Vakil will also
have someone like this.

1223
01:20:52,504 --> 01:20:54,062
Nobody came to claim his body.

1224
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,772
Because of fear of interrogation.

1225
01:20:56,175 --> 01:20:57,836
Tell me what's your point.

1226
01:20:59,111 --> 01:21:00,669
Vakil must surely have someone.

1227
01:21:00,979 --> 01:21:02,173
Maybe not a wife. But someone.

1228
01:21:02,948 --> 01:21:05,542
She will surely know
whom Vakil worked for.

1229
01:21:07,152 --> 01:21:09,120
It seems possible.
But how will we find her?

1230
01:21:09,821 --> 01:21:11,948
Whatever you found
on Vakil's body...

1231
01:21:12,124 --> 01:21:14,490
...gun, pant, shirt,
wallet, anything.

1232
01:21:14,726 --> 01:21:15,454
Get everything.

1233
01:21:17,129 --> 01:21:18,426
We'll definitely find a clue.

1234
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:20,320
But Miss Shivani this is evidence.

1235
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:21,928
How can get it out of the office?

1236
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,628
Sodhi, you said you would help.

1237
01:21:25,637 --> 01:21:27,070
You will get me
in trouble Miss Shivani.

1238
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:30,932
I was so worried getting
these things out of the office.

1239
01:21:31,543 --> 01:21:34,569
Honestly whatever
we are doing is illegal.

1240
01:21:35,547 --> 01:21:36,741
Always by the book.

1241
01:21:37,683 --> 01:21:41,210
How will you arrest criminals
if you keep working by the law?

1242
01:21:42,054 --> 01:21:45,217
On a serious note, Ma'am, I can't
get involved in this any further.

1243
01:21:46,058 --> 01:21:48,959
I understand.
But what if we find something?

1244
01:21:49,161 --> 01:21:50,093
Please, Ma'am.

1245
01:21:51,029 --> 01:21:53,497
Okay, okay. We'll cross
the bridge when we get there.

1246
01:21:53,699 --> 01:21:56,327
What bridge? There's nothing here!

1247
01:22:04,176 --> 01:22:05,973
Modern Tailors, Chandani Chowk.

1248
01:22:08,013 --> 01:22:08,843
That's surprising.

1249
01:22:09,014 --> 01:22:11,847
In an era of readymade,
this guy wore stitched clothes!

1250
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:13,347
Classic old school.

1251
01:22:13,819 --> 01:22:16,913
Someone who has his trousers and shirt
stitched by the same tailor...

1252
01:22:17,256 --> 01:22:19,281
...is most likely to get
all his clothes stitched by him.

1253
01:22:19,358 --> 01:22:21,121
Where is Modern Tailors?

1254
01:22:21,193 --> 01:22:22,683
Modern Tailors... Liyaqat Ali?
- Yes.

1255
01:22:22,794 --> 01:22:25,354
Go straight and take a right.
First floor.

1256
01:22:25,564 --> 01:22:27,054
From here?
- Yes.

1257
01:22:27,633 --> 01:22:28,861
Thank you.
- You are welcome.

1258
01:22:30,836 --> 01:22:34,567
I am a social worker.
I am attached with AIIMS.

1259
01:22:35,474 --> 01:22:38,807
I wanted to enquire about Mr. Vakil.

1260
01:22:39,077 --> 01:22:42,046
I know him for the past 23 years.

1261
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:45,712
Was this an accident
or some police case?

1262
01:22:46,218 --> 01:22:47,742
I don't know that.

1263
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:51,148
My job is to find out
if he has any relatives.

1264
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:55,590
I don't know of any relatives.

1265
01:22:56,361 --> 01:22:58,886
But there is a lady with
whom he was acquainted with...

1266
01:22:58,964 --> 01:23:00,454
...for the past many years.

1267
01:23:02,934 --> 01:23:06,700
Minu Rastogi.
She was a prostitute in Paharganj.

1268
01:23:08,006 --> 01:23:11,169
Mr. Vakil's acquaintance
with her was still strong.

1269
01:23:12,144 --> 01:23:14,635
Then she should
know about his death.

1270
01:23:14,913 --> 01:23:15,777
Where does she stay?

1271
01:23:16,248 --> 01:23:19,615
Where is D-40?
- The second house.

1272
01:23:22,454 --> 01:23:23,182
Yes?

1273
01:23:23,522 --> 01:23:24,489
Is Minu Rastogi here?

1274
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:25,615
Who are you?

1275
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:28,358
Mumbai Police.
I want to speak with her.

1276
01:23:28,927 --> 01:23:29,552
Please come in.

1277
01:23:30,028 --> 01:23:32,019
Hello!
- Hello! Please have a seat.

1278
01:23:33,298 --> 01:23:34,026
Harish...

1279
01:23:34,633 --> 01:23:35,998
Yes, Ma'am.
- Come here.

1280
01:23:42,441 --> 01:23:43,635
Get this medicine.

1281
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:46,072
Yes, Ma'am.

1282
01:23:46,445 --> 01:23:47,742
Please sit.

1283
01:23:49,448 --> 01:23:51,279
Sugar?
- One spoon.

1284
01:23:53,352 --> 01:23:54,341
I have diabetes.

1285
01:23:55,354 --> 01:23:57,686
My doctor has completely
banned sugar for me.

1286
01:23:58,890 --> 01:23:59,788
You are young.

1287
01:24:02,494 --> 01:24:03,620
Here...
- Thank you.

1288
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:09,696
How did Mr. Vakil's
fame reach the Mumbai police?

1289
01:24:11,536 --> 01:24:12,332
It's a long story.

1290
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:15,599
I have a lot of time.

1291
01:24:17,542 --> 01:24:19,407
Got the medicine?
- No, Ma'am.

1292
01:24:20,145 --> 01:24:21,703
Did you look properly?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1293
01:24:21,813 --> 01:24:24,714
If I find it later,
you know I'll shoot you, right?

1294
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:25,473
Yes.

1295
01:24:25,717 --> 01:24:28,185
I keep my servants on a tight leash.

1296
01:24:30,789 --> 01:24:31,813
Go do your work.

1297
01:24:36,795 --> 01:24:38,126
Actually...

1298
01:24:39,431 --> 01:24:41,729
I hadn't sent Harish
to get medicine.

1299
01:24:43,735 --> 01:24:46,135
I had sent him to see
if there are cops outside.

1300
01:24:46,972 --> 01:24:48,530
No, no, I have come alone.

1301
01:24:53,311 --> 01:24:56,803
O God, strange are your ways!

1302
01:24:58,316 --> 01:25:01,479
The person my son is looking
for in the whole city...

1303
01:25:02,087 --> 01:25:04,749
...is sitting right here in his
own house. And that too all alone!

1304
01:25:09,494 --> 01:25:13,954
That boy who calls you,
is my son. Karan.

1305
01:25:16,334 --> 01:25:18,097
What do you call him?

1306
01:25:18,670 --> 01:25:22,162
The kid.

1307
01:25:24,476 --> 01:25:25,408
This is his house.

1308
01:25:27,612 --> 01:25:29,011
What's happening to you?

1309
01:25:29,781 --> 01:25:30,645
Feeling dizzy?

1310
01:25:31,316 --> 01:25:35,343
Oh yeah... I put
sedatives in your tea.

1311
01:25:40,058 --> 01:25:42,618
Now you won't be capable
of doing anything.

1312
01:25:43,695 --> 01:25:47,290
And my Karan will
be back in some time.

1313
01:25:50,135 --> 01:25:52,069
You killed Vakil, right!

1314
01:25:54,473 --> 01:25:57,203
My Karan will torture you to death.

1315
01:26:00,512 --> 01:26:01,604
What fun it'll be!

1316
01:26:14,693 --> 01:26:16,786
Hello, Ma'am! How are you?

1317
01:26:22,634 --> 01:26:23,157
Hey...

1318
01:26:26,972 --> 01:26:27,961
I am Walt.

1319
01:26:30,509 --> 01:26:32,101
Actually my name is Karan.

1320
01:26:33,111 --> 01:26:35,238
But I have changed it to Walt.

1321
01:26:37,949 --> 01:26:40,543
It's the name of the
hero in an American show.

1322
01:26:41,953 --> 01:26:43,921
So you did keep your promise.

1323
01:26:44,723 --> 01:26:46,987
You found me on the 27th day.

1324
01:26:47,692 --> 01:26:49,785
That's amazing.

1325
01:26:52,631 --> 01:26:53,655
Congratulations!

1326
01:26:54,566 --> 01:26:57,330
I will keep my promise too.
I won't kill you.

1327
01:26:59,304 --> 01:27:00,896
I'll just bring you to a state...

1328
01:27:00,972 --> 01:27:03,304
...where you'll beg me
to kill you.

1329
01:27:05,944 --> 01:27:06,933
You!

1330
01:27:27,098 --> 01:27:28,998
Mom, what's for lunch?

1331
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:34,970
Are all the girls ready?

1332
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:38,104
Alka, you are on WhatsApp again!

1333
01:27:38,476 --> 01:27:39,773
Sorry, Ma'am.
- They will be here soon.

1334
01:27:39,844 --> 01:27:41,607
I'll get them ready
in just five minutes.

1335
01:27:42,714 --> 01:27:46,650
How many times have I told you
that don't doll them up like kids?

1336
01:27:47,185 --> 01:27:50,985
Those rascals should see
their lovers in them not daughters.

1337
01:27:51,423 --> 01:27:53,186
Honey, please. Thank you.

1338
01:27:53,358 --> 01:27:54,120
Open your mouth...

1339
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:56,327
Properly...

1340
01:27:57,996 --> 01:27:58,894
Good girl!

1341
01:28:04,135 --> 01:28:05,124
That's good.

1342
01:28:05,971 --> 01:28:08,235
And don't behave like a fool there.

1343
01:28:08,807 --> 01:28:09,967
Be sexy!

1344
01:28:10,575 --> 01:28:11,405
Good girl!

1345
01:28:11,476 --> 01:28:13,239
Did you get what Ma'am is saying?

1346
01:28:13,578 --> 01:28:15,205
No, no, don't tie her hair.

1347
01:28:15,747 --> 01:28:18,910
Remove the pins. Quick. Quick.

1348
01:28:19,150 --> 01:28:20,139
Thank you.

1349
01:28:20,986 --> 01:28:22,214
Look at that.

1350
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:27,683
Aren't you looking ravishing now!

1351
01:28:27,993 --> 01:28:29,221
Go put on your shoes.
- Be careful.

1352
01:28:29,294 --> 01:28:31,660
And put on a smile.
- Keep it down.

1353
01:28:31,763 --> 01:28:33,162
Did you get that woman!
- Yes.

1354
01:28:33,264 --> 01:28:34,390
Yes, Ma'am.
- Very good.

1355
01:28:34,466 --> 01:28:35,694
She's very strong.

1356
01:28:35,967 --> 01:28:38,265
Look how she's still fighting.
- Wait!

1357
01:28:39,671 --> 01:28:40,968
Who is she?

1358
01:28:41,773 --> 01:28:42,637
I don't know.

1359
01:28:43,408 --> 01:28:45,968
Wait!
- Get back to work everybody!

1360
01:28:46,778 --> 01:28:49,474
Is everyone ready?
Alka, anyone left?

1361
01:28:49,814 --> 01:28:51,111
No, Ma'am, all are ready.

1362
01:28:51,182 --> 01:28:52,843
Should I take them downstairs?

1363
01:28:52,951 --> 01:28:54,942
No, no! I am going
to perform here now.

1364
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:56,180
Everybody please wait and watch.

1365
01:28:56,655 --> 01:28:58,987
Come on. Get out and be ready.

1366
01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:00,851
Off you go! Come on!
- Yes, go on.

1367
01:29:00,959 --> 01:29:02,426
Come on. You foreigner, come on.

1368
01:29:02,794 --> 01:29:03,556
Get out.

1369
01:29:04,963 --> 01:29:07,454
Look at her desperate attempts!
- Let her try!

1370
01:29:07,532 --> 01:29:08,829
She's not asking you.

1371
01:29:09,801 --> 01:29:12,361
Julia, there's no movie
being shown here.

1372
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:14,199
Go.

1373
01:29:14,806 --> 01:29:16,000
Go, or else I'll slap you! Go!

1374
01:29:16,041 --> 01:29:16,700
Go!

1375
01:29:19,377 --> 01:29:22,346
We still have to deck her up.
Get her out of the sack.

1376
01:29:22,447 --> 01:29:23,471
Open it.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1377
01:29:25,183 --> 01:29:29,142
Ma'am, please co-operate.
Why are you fighting so much?

1378
01:29:29,688 --> 01:29:32,486
Hang on, hang on. There, it's open.

1379
01:29:33,058 --> 01:29:35,959
Hold it Madam. Cool down.

1380
01:29:36,327 --> 01:29:37,021
Get lost!

1381
01:29:37,228 --> 01:29:38,559
Listen girl!

1382
01:29:39,397 --> 01:29:42,594
I have been doing this since
before you were even born!

1383
01:29:42,967 --> 01:29:45,299
I know exactly how to
tame the likes of you!

1384
01:29:45,904 --> 01:29:47,030
Just untie my hands and see...

1385
01:29:47,505 --> 01:29:51,339
...you won't have a tongue
left to speak or eyes to see!

1386
01:29:51,776 --> 01:29:53,971
Hit her!
There's no use talking to her!

1387
01:29:54,379 --> 01:29:55,311
Don't hit the face.

1388
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:57,247
Aunty!
- Pyaari!

1389
01:29:57,882 --> 01:29:59,008
Hey! Wait!

1390
01:30:00,118 --> 01:30:01,244
Aunty! Please!
- Pyaari!

1391
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:05,048
Please, please! Let her go!
Let me meet her.

1392
01:30:05,423 --> 01:30:06,788
Once, just once.

1393
01:30:07,258 --> 01:30:09,783
I'll do whatever you say.
Do my make-up.

1394
01:30:10,695 --> 01:30:13,789
Saw Mattu!
That's how you fix such dames!

1395
01:30:15,033 --> 01:30:15,863
Get your make-up done.

1396
01:30:16,534 --> 01:30:17,262
Pyaari!
- Aunty!

1397
01:30:25,343 --> 01:30:27,038
I slapped her hard.

1398
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:29,876
Pyaari...

1399
01:30:40,892 --> 01:30:42,484
All this is because of me.

1400
01:30:44,229 --> 01:30:45,161
No, Aunty!

1401
01:30:47,031 --> 01:30:48,999
I am alive because of you.

1402
01:30:54,072 --> 01:30:57,337
Enough of this nonsense!
Enough! Stop it!

1403
01:30:59,110 --> 01:31:01,772
Stop this emotional
melodrama. Come on!

1404
01:31:03,314 --> 01:31:04,042
Aunty, no!

1405
01:31:04,182 --> 01:31:06,013
You have to get your make-up done.
- Take her away!

1406
01:31:06,551 --> 01:31:07,415
Aunty!

1407
01:31:11,322 --> 01:31:12,516
Now, it's looking beautiful.

1408
01:31:15,260 --> 01:31:16,249
Hi, darling!

1409
01:31:20,698 --> 01:31:22,461
Oh hi! Long time.

1410
01:31:24,969 --> 01:31:26,197
Take good care of them, sweety.

1411
01:31:28,473 --> 01:31:29,303
Please come, Sir!

1412
01:31:29,507 --> 01:31:31,270
The whole arrangement
is especially for you.

1413
01:31:31,576 --> 01:31:32,270
Thank you.

1414
01:31:32,477 --> 01:31:33,501
Everything is ready, Sir.

1415
01:31:33,745 --> 01:31:34,370
Sir...

1416
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,269
Hi, good evening.

1417
01:31:36,581 --> 01:31:38,572
Sir, when will Mr. Taneja come?

1418
01:31:39,017 --> 01:31:42,214
He will come at his own time.
- Oh yes. Of course!

1419
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:43,579
You first show me your arrangements.

1420
01:31:43,688 --> 01:31:45,053
Please come, Sir.
- Sir, your phone...

1421
01:31:45,156 --> 01:31:48,353
Angie, baby, wait. Right
now he's just checking things out.

1422
01:31:48,726 --> 01:31:49,715
He'll come later.

1423
01:31:50,461 --> 01:31:50,984
Come, Sir.

1424
01:31:51,029 --> 01:31:52,394
Security is very tight.

1425
01:31:52,697 --> 01:31:54,528
It's for your benefit, Sir.

1426
01:31:54,866 --> 01:31:57,300
Only when there's no fear
of being photographed...

1427
01:31:57,869 --> 01:31:59,894
...can a person enjoy freely.

1428
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:03,766
Julia, come, baby.

1429
01:32:04,409 --> 01:32:07,003
Come, come, for Sir.

1430
01:32:07,612 --> 01:32:09,045
Don't be shy. Sir...

1431
01:32:17,322 --> 01:32:19,688
Girls get abducted
in our cities for free...

1432
01:32:20,425 --> 01:32:21,323
In broad day light.

1433
01:32:23,728 --> 01:32:27,687
But when one guy sets up
a small organised business...

1434
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:29,359
...and everyone gets upset!

1435
01:32:31,669 --> 01:32:33,466
Why did you do all of this?

1436
01:32:34,505 --> 01:32:35,529
What did you get?

1437
01:32:39,477 --> 01:32:42,071
You women get personal too soon.

1438
01:32:44,382 --> 01:32:47,681
I agree that you are a cop,
from the Crime Branch.

1439
01:32:47,852 --> 01:32:50,218
But to obsessively chase
just one criminal?

1440
01:32:50,321 --> 01:32:52,289
What kind of professionalism
is this?

1441
01:32:53,458 --> 01:32:54,652
Where did you learn this?

1442
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:56,690
Nonsense.

1443
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:05,095
That's why we men climb on top and
you women just stare at the ceiling.

1444
01:33:06,037 --> 01:33:08,164
You know what I am saying,
Miss Shivani?

1445
01:33:11,643 --> 01:33:12,940
The night is young.

1446
01:33:13,544 --> 01:33:15,944
Stare at the ceiling
and scream your lungs out.

1447
01:33:16,781 --> 01:33:17,805
Scream?

1448
01:33:23,521 --> 01:33:24,180
Scream.

1449
01:33:35,033 --> 01:33:36,000
That's right.

1450
01:33:37,869 --> 01:33:38,858
There's no point.

1451
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:45,141
Crime Branch!

1452
01:33:56,988 --> 01:33:57,852
Sir has come.

1453
01:34:03,294 --> 01:34:05,387
Good evening, Sir. This is Mattu!

1454
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:06,756
Welcome, Sir!
- God bless you.

1455
01:34:06,831 --> 01:34:07,991
How are you?
- All good.

1456
01:34:08,099 --> 01:34:09,828
Everything's ready for you.

1457
01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:13,437
Welcome, Sir!

1458
01:34:14,038 --> 01:34:15,835
All well?
- With your blessings.

1459
01:34:16,107 --> 01:34:17,335
Please come, Sir.
- Tandon...

1460
01:34:17,909 --> 01:34:18,603
Wait here.

1461
01:34:23,848 --> 01:34:24,542
Come, Sir.

1462
01:34:26,017 --> 01:34:26,915
Come, Sir.

1463
01:34:27,185 --> 01:34:29,346
Tandon, have you checked
everything personally?

1464
01:34:29,487 --> 01:34:30,317
Yes, Sir.

1465
01:34:30,421 --> 01:34:32,685
You are bound to be happy
with the arrangements.

1466
01:34:35,259 --> 01:34:36,248
Come, Sir.

1467
01:34:37,462 --> 01:34:38,986
Everything's ready.
- This way, Sir.

1468
01:34:40,198 --> 01:34:41,290
Sir, to your left.

1469
01:34:49,807 --> 01:34:51,434
The arrangements look great.

1470
01:34:52,343 --> 01:34:54,868
Yes. You are the one who gave
us the opportunity to serve you.

1471
01:34:55,213 --> 01:34:57,579
There's a special gift
for you in the suite upstairs.

1472
01:34:57,849 --> 01:34:59,441
You should check it
out if you are in the mood.

1473
01:34:59,951 --> 01:35:00,975
Everybody knows.

1474
01:35:01,419 --> 01:35:03,478
Be it the opposition or women...

1475
01:35:04,022 --> 01:35:06,217
...I am always in a mood to crush!

1476
01:35:07,325 --> 01:35:10,817
Spoken like a true leader!
Brilliant, brilliant, I say!

1477
01:35:20,705 --> 01:35:21,399
Hello!

1478
01:35:23,674 --> 01:35:25,039
I have heard a lot about you.

1479
01:35:27,712 --> 01:35:28,303
You?

1480
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:31,539
Yes, I am who you think I am.

1481
01:35:33,117 --> 01:35:35,312
Everybody has their own hobbies.

1482
01:35:35,987 --> 01:35:37,420
I am sure even you do.

1483
01:35:38,356 --> 01:35:39,323
My hobby is this.

1484
01:35:40,725 --> 01:35:42,556
Have you really come to rape me?

1485
01:35:42,994 --> 01:35:45,519
I don't know how
one pretends to rape.

1486
01:35:45,997 --> 01:35:49,262
You fight with all your strength.
Only then it'll be fun.

1487
01:36:07,952 --> 01:36:09,010
You want to rape me!

1488
01:36:11,089 --> 01:36:13,319
Get up! Come on!

1489
01:36:17,495 --> 01:36:18,655
Stop this party!

1490
01:36:18,963 --> 01:36:20,260
Get out!

1491
01:36:20,465 --> 01:36:21,489
What is happening?

1492
01:36:21,833 --> 01:36:23,528
Walt, where the hell are you?

1493
01:36:23,768 --> 01:36:24,894
Get out!
- What is going on, Mattu!

1494
01:36:25,036 --> 01:36:26,503
Where did she come from!

1495
01:36:26,971 --> 01:36:27,960
She has lost it!

1496
01:36:30,608 --> 01:36:34,169
Karan Rastogi, do you want
this minister alive or not?

1497
01:36:34,912 --> 01:36:36,436
Tandon! Do something, Tandon!

1498
01:36:36,514 --> 01:36:37,242
Mattu, wait!

1499
01:36:37,849 --> 01:36:39,783
Karan, if anything happens to Sir...

1500
01:36:39,984 --> 01:36:42,475
...you and your mom
will die a miserable death.

1501
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,649
One second, Ma'am. What do you want?

1502
01:36:45,189 --> 01:36:47,623
I want all the girls out.

1503
01:36:48,192 --> 01:36:50,057
What are you staring at, Alka?
Send all the girls out.

1504
01:36:50,328 --> 01:36:51,124
Girls, go out.
- Come on!

1505
01:36:51,329 --> 01:36:52,193
Mattu, are you dead!

1506
01:36:53,131 --> 01:36:54,996
Come on, Julia.
Angie, baby, hurry up. Scarlett, go.

1507
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:55,824
Hurry up!

1508
01:36:55,967 --> 01:36:56,865
Fast.

1509
01:36:57,502 --> 01:36:58,400
Fast, girls! Fast!

1510
01:36:58,769 --> 01:36:59,633
Hurry up, Alka.

1511
01:37:00,638 --> 01:37:01,662
Pyaari, wait.
- Aunty.

1512
01:37:02,507 --> 01:37:03,405
Mattu!
- Yes?

1513
01:37:03,574 --> 01:37:05,508
Give the key of the
mobile locker to Pyaari.

1514
01:37:05,743 --> 01:37:06,903
Give her the damn key.

1515
01:37:11,015 --> 01:37:12,209
You got the girls.

1516
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:13,378
What else do you want?

1517
01:37:13,885 --> 01:37:14,476
You.

1518
01:37:15,086 --> 01:37:15,984
You will come with me.

1519
01:37:20,024 --> 01:37:21,514
Chill, Ma'am.
Chill. Chill, it's okay.

1520
01:37:21,626 --> 01:37:23,389
Step back. Step back.
- Help!

1521
01:37:23,761 --> 01:37:26,229
Help!
- Raise your hands.

1522
01:37:27,632 --> 01:37:31,227
Tell them that no one moves
from here till you get back.

1523
01:37:31,469 --> 01:37:33,437
Nobody moves from here.
Tandon, keep him in check.

1524
01:37:33,704 --> 01:37:34,170
You wait.

1525
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:36,664
Everybody, we have got
a bit of a situation.

1526
01:37:36,807 --> 01:37:38,104
I am going to sort
it out and be right back.

1527
01:37:38,509 --> 01:37:39,976
Raise your hands! Move!

1528
01:37:40,945 --> 01:37:41,707
Move!

1529
01:37:43,114 --> 01:37:43,705
Come on.

1530
01:37:46,184 --> 01:37:48,049
Move quickly! Look ahead.

1531
01:37:52,190 --> 01:37:53,919
Damn! She has locked the door!

1532
01:37:54,859 --> 01:37:55,553
Come on quickly.

1533
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:57,491
Aunty, but the exit
is this side.

1534
01:37:57,828 --> 01:37:58,658
We are not going out.

1535
01:37:59,397 --> 01:37:59,920
Open it!

1536
01:38:04,202 --> 01:38:06,261
Open! Get in.

1537
01:38:07,205 --> 01:38:09,264
Come on, girls. Get in.

1538
01:38:11,742 --> 01:38:12,367
Be there.

1539
01:38:14,879 --> 01:38:15,811
Pyaari, close the door.

1540
01:38:17,448 --> 01:38:19,507
Lock the door. Lock it!

1541
01:38:30,695 --> 01:38:31,992
Okay, okay.
- Get in!

1542
01:38:32,463 --> 01:38:33,225
Get in!

1543
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:38,498
Not bad, Ma'am. Not bad at all.

1544
01:38:38,970 --> 01:38:41,962
You guys think we cops
are morons, right?

1545
01:38:44,809 --> 01:38:46,003
But how did you manage to do this?

1546
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:48,943
When I got the address
to your place...

1547
01:38:49,447 --> 01:38:51,472
...I had no clue
that it is your house.

1548
01:38:52,049 --> 01:38:55,485
Where is D-40?
- Second from the front.

1549
01:38:55,786 --> 01:38:58,186
In Crime Branch we are trained to...

1550
01:38:58,556 --> 01:39:02,549
...carefully scan a place
before entering.

1551
01:39:02,994 --> 01:39:06,361
Does Minu Rastogi stay here?
- Yes, she does.

1552
01:39:08,366 --> 01:39:09,526
Who else stays with her?

1553
01:39:09,734 --> 01:39:11,725
Her son and a servant.

1554
01:39:12,370 --> 01:39:13,337
How old is the son?

1555
01:39:13,571 --> 01:39:14,970
Around 25 or 26.

1556
01:39:15,139 --> 01:39:19,007
I was wondering what to do next
when I heard a sound.

1557
01:39:21,512 --> 01:39:24,003
Maybe God was trying
to tell me something.

1558
01:39:24,649 --> 01:39:27,641
I had heard this Azaan before.

1559
01:39:28,052 --> 01:39:28,984
But where?

1560
01:39:29,654 --> 01:39:31,019
Then I remembered.

1561
01:39:31,555 --> 01:39:33,455
But you can't do any harm to me.

1562
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:35,022
Because I am still alive.

1563
01:39:35,092 --> 01:39:36,821
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1564
01:39:37,595 --> 01:39:43,534
That is the first time I wondered
if you are Minu Rastogi's son.

1565
01:39:45,102 --> 01:39:46,899
But then who will take
a risk with you?

1566
01:39:47,238 --> 01:39:50,105
I began watching your house.

1567
01:39:50,541 --> 01:39:52,031
I spotted you the next day.

1568
01:39:52,677 --> 01:39:53,905
Although, I hadn't seen you before.

1569
01:39:56,013 --> 01:39:58,106
But one look at your sly face...

1570
01:39:58,616 --> 01:39:59,548
...and I knew it had to be you.

1571
01:40:00,251 --> 01:40:03,243
The first thing I did was
put a GPS tracker in your car.

1572
01:40:05,489 --> 01:40:07,957
48 hours went by...

1573
01:40:12,496 --> 01:40:15,021
...you didn't go to any
of your hostels or warehouses.

1574
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:17,061
I wanted to reach Pyaari...

1575
01:40:17,368 --> 01:40:18,960
...and also the other girls.

1576
01:40:20,004 --> 01:40:23,030
Even if we did arrest you,
what could we charge you with?

1577
01:40:24,041 --> 01:40:26,635
That's when I decided that
there's no point wasting time.

1578
01:40:26,944 --> 01:40:28,639
Now you yourself
will take me to Pyaari.

1579
01:40:29,547 --> 01:40:32,846
I entered your house
but I was fully prepared.

1580
01:40:33,184 --> 01:40:35,379
I just had to make the move
at the right time.

1581
01:40:42,093 --> 01:40:43,958
Now I just need to inform Sodhi.

1582
01:40:44,295 --> 01:40:47,458
He'll track us on the GPS
and come here with the police unit.

1583
01:40:48,733 --> 01:40:50,701
Pyaari, get the phone.

1584
01:40:51,869 --> 01:40:53,734
And what if I would have
killed you right then?

1585
01:40:55,573 --> 01:40:57,370
I had to take that risk.

1586
01:40:59,043 --> 01:41:01,705
Like I said,
I knew your type.

1587
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,345
You wouldn't kill
me that easily.

1588
01:41:04,815 --> 01:41:07,511
You would want to exploit me
like other women.

1589
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,715
I must give it to you. But what now?

1590
01:41:11,922 --> 01:41:13,822
Sodhi, come.

1591
01:41:15,626 --> 01:41:19,062
The police will take at
least 25 minutes to get here.

1592
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:22,363
Your freedom lies behind that door.

1593
01:41:23,134 --> 01:41:26,661
And I am standing in
between you and your freedom.

1594
01:41:28,305 --> 01:41:29,966
Kill me and claim your freedom.

1595
01:41:32,743 --> 01:41:34,711
Women... women...

1596
01:41:36,447 --> 01:41:38,574
Take everything personally, right?

1597
01:41:39,517 --> 01:41:40,279
Come on.

1598
01:41:41,218 --> 01:41:45,882
Let me see how far
on top a man can climb.

1599
01:41:46,991 --> 01:41:47,685
As you wish.

1600
01:42:09,947 --> 01:42:10,413
Aunty!

1601
01:42:20,624 --> 01:42:21,921
Get up! Get up!

1602
01:42:58,963 --> 01:43:01,955
Hit me, Ma'am.
How much will you hit me?

1603
01:43:05,903 --> 01:43:10,169
You will me hit me a little
and then arrest me, right?

1604
01:43:12,977 --> 01:43:15,002
You are forgetting one thing, Ma'am.

1605
01:43:17,114 --> 01:43:18,240
This is India.

1606
01:43:20,851 --> 01:43:23,684
Over here,
if you have the right contacts...

1607
01:43:23,954 --> 01:43:27,185
...the biggest of scandals
can be buried.

1608
01:43:28,692 --> 01:43:30,683
This is trivial in comparison.

1609
01:43:31,929 --> 01:43:34,625
So till then you
hit me and have fun.

1610
01:43:35,666 --> 01:43:36,826
Hit me, Ma'am.

1611
01:43:37,868 --> 01:43:39,358
There is nothing else you can do.

1612
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:41,137
This is India.

1613
01:43:47,378 --> 01:43:49,505
This one thing you are right about.

1614
01:43:50,447 --> 01:43:51,379
This is India.

1615
01:43:52,016 --> 01:43:53,313
'This' is what goes on here.

1616
01:43:58,155 --> 01:44:01,989
These people sitting outside
will bury your crime?

1617
01:44:02,526 --> 01:44:06,519
They can do it only if you
reach the police station.

1618
01:44:07,498 --> 01:44:11,332
But you won't reach the police
station because this is India.

1619
01:44:11,602 --> 01:44:14,799
Here, if you don't want
to bother the court too much...

1620
01:44:14,972 --> 01:44:17,031
...issues can be settled this way.

1621
01:44:20,611 --> 01:44:21,339
Get up!

1622
01:44:25,349 --> 01:44:27,544
Some people call it an 'Encounter'.

1623
01:44:29,053 --> 01:44:31,021
Some call it 'Teaching a lesson'.

1624
01:44:33,791 --> 01:44:34,621
Get up!

1625
01:44:44,068 --> 01:44:46,298
Some also call it the 'Lokpal Bill'.

1626
01:44:49,473 --> 01:44:50,531
What's your plan?

1627
01:44:53,477 --> 01:44:54,637
Are you going to murder me?

1628
01:44:56,647 --> 01:44:58,205
In front of everyone?

1629
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:02,411
This is India.

1630
01:45:03,153 --> 01:45:05,644
In India, if 50 people
take the law in their hands...

1631
01:45:05,756 --> 01:45:08,589
...and kill someone, then
it's not called a murder.

1632
01:45:09,026 --> 01:45:10,755
It's called 'Public outrage'.

1633
01:45:24,308 --> 01:45:28,938
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1634
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:34,273
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1635
01:45:44,495 --> 01:45:49,125
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1636
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:54,369
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1637
01:45:54,638 --> 01:45:59,075
Touch my heart and I promise
you will mean the world to me

1638
01:45:59,276 --> 01:46:01,744
But if you ever mess with me

1639
01:46:01,812 --> 01:46:04,372
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1640
01:46:06,884 --> 01:46:09,648
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1641
01:46:24,902 --> 01:46:29,771
If you think being a man gives you
the right to sell me like cattle

1642
01:46:29,973 --> 01:46:34,637
I will in that same place
destroy your entire race

1643
01:46:34,978 --> 01:46:39,312
Hold my hand and walk with me
and I will never leave your side

1644
01:46:39,783 --> 01:46:42,149
But if you ever mess with me

1645
01:46:42,252 --> 01:46:44,846
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1646
01:46:47,324 --> 01:46:50,054
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1647
01:47:05,075 --> 01:47:10,138
In a skirt or a saree, at day
or at night I will not walk afraid

1648
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:15,317
I won't lead a life
full of fear and regret

1649
01:47:20,491 --> 01:47:25,326
In a world where mothers and sisters
are not a blessing but a curse

1650
01:47:25,496 --> 01:47:30,331
I will break all shackles of rules
belonging to this world

1651
01:47:30,601 --> 01:47:35,163
Change the way you look at me and
I will shield you from the evil eye

1652
01:47:35,339 --> 01:47:37,705
But if you ever mess with me

1653
01:47:37,841 --> 01:47:40,639
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1654
01:47:47,117 --> 01:47:50,018
Walt died on his way
to the hospital.

1655
01:47:50,521 --> 01:47:53,979
Mattu became a prosecution witness.

1656
01:47:54,458 --> 01:47:57,723
He revealed everything about Walt,

1657
01:47:57,828 --> 01:48:00,194
Minu and Vakil along with
Tandon's involvement to the court.

1658
01:48:01,932 --> 01:48:04,492
First, the girls made up
Minu's face.

1659
01:48:04,935 --> 01:48:06,197
And then God did.

1660
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:08,495
Minu later suffered
a paralysis attack.

1661
01:48:13,010 --> 01:48:15,808
Taneja survived
and is now in Tihar jail.

1662
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:19,738
His scarred face is an
amusement to most in the jail.

1663
01:48:25,022 --> 01:48:28,958
Today, we could bring back
the smile on Pyaari's face.

1664
01:48:29,259 --> 01:48:32,695
But there are many like Pyaari that
have to be rescued from this muck.

1665
01:48:33,096 --> 01:48:36,088
Many others like Karan Rastogi
who are still scot-free...

1666
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,594
... must be stopped.

1667
01:48:37,968 --> 01:48:39,936
The Mardaani (Fighter)
that's hidden within...

1668
01:48:40,103 --> 01:48:42,833
... has to be discovered by
every woman, every girl herself.

1669
01:48:43,307 --> 01:48:45,241
The war goes on.
