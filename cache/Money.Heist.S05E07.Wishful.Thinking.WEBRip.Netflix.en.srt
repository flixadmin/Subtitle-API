1
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:12,291
Assault unit is approaching.

2
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:16,250
Move! I want a clean intervention.

3
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,625
They're armed and extremely dangerous.

4
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:20,958
Let's go, fast!

5
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,291
First floor, clear.

6
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,208
I want every floor cleared. Let's go!

7
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,083
Watch all the exits.

8
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:28,916
Second floor, clear.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,250
Please…

10
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,666
-Police!
-Let's go!

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,875
-Hands up!
-Police!

12
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,375
Colonel, are you okay?

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,750
My wife.

14
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,833
Let's go!

15
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,083
Luis!

16
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,125
No one's here.

17
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:06,625
How long has it been?

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,083
I don't know. A few minutes.

19
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,000
It's Sierra. She's carrying a baby.

20
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,625
No one has left the building.

21
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,875
Check every apartment.
If nobody opens, break the door down.

22
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,583
Set up a cage operation

23
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,375
with a one-mile perimeter
no one can get out of.

24
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,541
Bravo 41 calling all available units.

25
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,916
Cage Operation, Chamberí district.
Limits, Valdebebas, and Canillas.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,958
I repeat, Bravo 41
calling all available units.

27
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,416
Listen, ma'am.

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,166
Everything's going to be okay,
but you can't scream.

29
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,166
Give me the baby.

30
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,750
And my glasses. I need my glasses.

31
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:50,958
Let's go, quick.

32
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,291
-Open the door!
-Police!

33
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,416
You're bleeding.
You're not going to go, are you?

34
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
I have to go back.
This is the final stretch.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,666
But I promise you one thing.

36
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,833
This is my last stretch.

37
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,583
Call in the army. Declare martial law.

38
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,375
We're going to search the neighborhood
door to door.

39
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,250
No, please--

40
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,083
Calm down.

41
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,416
Open the door now!

42
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,208
Police! Open the door!

43
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,708
Let's go!

44
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,833
Police! Open the door!

45
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,833
Police! Open the door!

46
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,083
Police! Come on! Let's go!

47
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,125
See you later.

48
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,250
-What's going on?
-Move over.

49
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,166
What the hell?

50
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,750
Police!

51
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,750
Open the door! Police!

52
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,916
The baby.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,375
The baby's asleep.

54
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,291
Let's go!

55
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,125
-The baby.
-The baby's fine.

56
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,833
Good evening.

57
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:40,958
Let's go!

58
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,041
Clear!

59
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,875
They escaped through the courtyard.

60
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,791
-Go!
-Let's go!

61
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,375
Everyone go to the courtyard!

62
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,666
-Your glasses.
-What?

63
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,958
Your sunglasses. It's dark out.

64
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,750
So what? Who cares?

65
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,583
-Take them off.
-Shut up.

66
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,208
They're coming.

67
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,291
-Shut up.
-They're coming.

68
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:30,250
Calling all units.
They left through the restaurant.

69
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,375
-Turn around!
-Legs apart!

70
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,958
We'll get there faster
if we take the subway.

71
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,083
Turn around! Hands against the wall!

72
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,625
Professor?

73
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,041
Professor, do you copy?

74
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,125
Quiet, boys.

75
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,041
-Professor?
-Professor?

76
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,208
-Marseille to Benjamín.
-Copy.

77
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,416
The Professor's gone.

78
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,333
Come again?

79
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,250
I think Alicia Sierra
kidnapped him, again.

80
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,833
My men are here. What should we do?

81
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,000
Do as the Professor asked. Take command.

82
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,375
I'll take the three cars
to the stormwater tank.

83
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,708
I have to tie up all loose ends.

84
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,166
What?

85
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,375
Let's go to 2B.

86
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,083
Come on.

87
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,583
There.

88
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,916
No one's home.

89
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,500
Come on.

90
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,375
Clear.

91
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,083
Fuck, it's a cat.

92
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,625
"Plants, twice a week.
Cat, one bowl a day."

93
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,291
"Thanks, Herminia."

94
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,916
The plants were watered today.

95
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,875
So Herminia won't be back until tomorrow.

96
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,416
The government has declared martial law.

97
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,666
We're here to protect you.

98
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,583
Quick!

99
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,833
Let's go!

100
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,375
This is starting to look like
the Warsaw ghetto.

101
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,125
They're going to search every house.

102
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,375
Come here.

103
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,291
Is it possible my illness
is starting to get to you?

104
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,333
It is, isn't it?

105
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:22,666
No.

106
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,916
-No.
-Yes.

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,250
It's just that I'm moved
by this wonderful plan with the gold.

108
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,750
There are a few details I still…

109
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,416
-Go on.
-Yeah.

110
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,875
-How to get the gold out, for instance.
-Grit.

111
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,875
We're going to turn
90 tons of gold into rice.

112
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,666
And then, jet propulsion.

113
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,000
We'll get it out of the building
using a pressure pump.

114
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,500
-With a pump?
-Yes.

115
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,083
Through the pipes?

116
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,333
Is there a pressure pump in the bank?

117
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,500
-Of course not.
-Right.

118
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,583
We had to go to Norway to get one.

119
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,875
From an oil platform.
What do you think about that?

120
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,541
There was also one in Saudi Arabia,
but I was too lazy to go that far.

121
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,583
Of course.

122
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:10,791
What matters, Sergio,

123
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:15,208
is that we're going to have a geyser
of golden light flowing through the pipes.

124
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,791
There's no margin for error.

125
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,416
Andrés, the whole plan
is a margin for error.

126
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,041
How old are those pipes?
Fifty, 70 years old?

127
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,291
A hundred.

128
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,291
Do you think they were designed to support
the flow of gold under pressure?

129
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,833
They'll hold!

130
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,750
Where will the gold be delivered?
To a sewer?

131
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:39,666
No!

132
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:44,291
I love this.
In the biggest stormwater tank in Europe.

133
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,791
In a stormwater tank? What if it rains?

134
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,416
What if it starts pouring that day?
It would collapse!

135
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,416
You can kiss your plan and life goodbye,
simply because it rained.

136
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,125
No, it's not science, it's…

137
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:58,875
wishful thinking.

138
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,583
It's optimistic science!

139
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,083
What are you talking about?

140
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,083
-It's hopeful science.
-Who's talking?

141
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:07,458
The brain of someone planning a heist
or the brain of a child?

142
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,041
A child's.

143
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,166
I'm proud of that.

144
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,458
-I'm Peter Pan himself.
-I see.

145
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,500
No one's going to make me lose hope,
not you or anyone else.

146
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,750
Because only then,
through willful immaturity,

147
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,416
can one achieve great things.

148
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,375
The sort of things that other,

149
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:31,250
mature people, serious people,
can never achieve.

150
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,541
They can't even imagine it
because they're all so very sensible!

151
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:43,125
And for those of us who think,
is there anything we can hold onto?

152
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,291
Anything?

153
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,625
Because I'd love to check the facts.

154
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:52,875
Martín has it all figured out.
Every last detail.

155
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,166
And he'd be delighted
to share it with to you.

156
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,041
Come on, guys, let's go.

157
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,375
The waterwheel goes last, okay Darko?

158
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,041
The waterwheel goes last.

159
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,041
Benjamín, are you there?

160
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,291
Yes, Miss Lisbon.

161
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,500
The Professor has disappeared.

162
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,500
Wait a minute.

163
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,000
What do you mean
"the Professor has disappeared"?

164
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,916
Is he in the Bermuda Triangle?

165
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,208
How would I know? I don't know.

166
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:36,791
Fuck…

167
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:41,083
But we have to make a decision right now.
What should we do with the gold?

168
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,708
I'm sorry, are you planning a referendum?

169
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,333
Because I don't give a shit
about democracy.

170
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:52,666
We're getting the gold out.

171
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,041
There's no room for debate.

172
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,750
If you let them debate,
they'll draw their weapons.

173
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,083
Let me draw mine first.
Don't fuck with me, we know each other.

174
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,041
The police might be
at the gold's exit point.

175
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:10,541
The police aren't in the stormwater tank.
The plan is still on, understood?

176
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:15,083
If that were the case, we'd be committing
the stupidest robbery in the world.

177
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,833
Melting 90 tons of gold
to hand it over to the police.

178
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,625
I said the police aren't
at the stormwater tank.

179
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:24,208
The gold is worth nothing to us here.
Do you get it, sweetie?

180
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,083
We're holding the gold hostage.

181
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:27,791
Great.

182
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,208
We take the hostage,
offer it to Tamayo, and negotiate.

183
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,875
Is that your master plan?
Are you the genius?

184
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Yes, honey, I'm a fucking genius,

185
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:42,000
and I have the machinery
down there to prove it, don't worry.

186
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,708
Is that all you care about?

187
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,000
Proving that your wonderful plan works?

188
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,083
Yes, but also about saving your lives.

189
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,000
We're going to do that
by getting the gold out of here.

190
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,500
Palermo is right.

191
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,541
There are only two people out there

192
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:59,458
who can tell them
how we're getting the gold out.

193
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:03,416
The Professor, and he's not going to tell,
and Alicia Sierra.

194
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,875
She'll use that information
to negotiate and get off the hook.

195
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,875
And I assure you

196
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:13,041
that negotiating
with Intelligence will be tough.

197
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,666
It'll take hours.

198
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,416
We'll have time to get the gold out.
That's what we're going to do.

199
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,958
This woman has sex appeal and balls.

200
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,291
We're going to get the gold out of here!

201
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,291
We're going to get it out.

202
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,958
Just then,
Palermo recovered his enthusiasm.

203
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,958
The last time he had
that sparkle in his eyes

204
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,583
was five years ago,

205
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:41,083
when someone woke him up
in the middle of the night.

206
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,500
I told him the plan.

207
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,000
What did he say?

208
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,291
Let's say he thought it was

209
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,125
a real wonder.

210
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,958
Let me be precise.

211
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,541
He said it's the most beautiful thing
he's ever heard.

212
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,083
Don't fuck with me. Are you serious?

213
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,041
Martín,

214
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,250
I told him the gist of it.

215
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,416
He wants you to explain
all the technical details.

216
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,916
So, it's your turn.

217
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,916
No shit.

218
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,166
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

219
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,416
Let's see.

220
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,583
Houndstooth? Tartan?
Something that exudes intellect.

221
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,833
I'd say that's a bit sophisticated
for 3:00 a.m.

222
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,750
A touch of genius would be good,
but go for something casual.

223
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,083
For Palermo and Berlin,
"maturity" meant the same thing,

224
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,291
the end of hopes and dreams,

225
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,625
and starting to approach life
with a certain bitter awareness.

226
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:56,750
After all, maturing, like growing old,
consists of gradually discarding dreams.

227
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,166
Bogotá, get in the water!

228
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,458
-Bogotá!
-What?

229
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,583
Get in the water!

230
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:19,041
You didn't have to get him out of bed now.
We could have done it tomorrow morning.

231
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,583
It's a great privilege for me to be here.

232
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,833
What do your curiosity
and sharp intellect require?

233
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:25,958
Tell me.

234
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,125
Let's say we've turned
the 90 tons into grit.

235
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,416
-Yes?
-Now what?

236
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:36,083
Now we put the diver back in the water,
only, this time, with two hoses.

237
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,666
Having completely ransacked the vault
like King Tut's tomb,

238
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,750
the diver will make the key connection.

239
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,041
That will allow us
to move the gold off-site.

240
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,041
-How?
-We have the vault, right?

241
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,458
There's 3,170 gallons of water.
That will be our driving force.

242
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,416
Through this black pipe,
the water goes into this pump,

243
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,083
where it'll mix with the gold.

244
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:03,333
And the 90 tons of grit will flow
through this red hose,

245
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:07,000
smoothly, towards the drainage system.

246
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,583
-Diameter of the hose?
-Five inches.

247
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,125
You can't get enough pressure
to get the gold out with that hose.

248
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,125
Exactly.

249
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:19,500
Because, for now, the gold will be
sleeping peacefully in the drainpipes.

250
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,041
The real pressure

251
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,791
will come a little later.

252
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,000
We will proceed to open every door.

253
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,500
We are prepared to use force,
and will not allow…

254
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,041
Delta Unit entering.

255
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,375
What are you doing?

256
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,041
We're going to hide.

257
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,625
Let's go, move it!

258
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,375
Let's go!

259
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,000
Armed forces. Open the door, please.

260
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,291
Hurry up.

261
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,208
Open the door!

262
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,541
Open the door!

263
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,666
Armed forces! Open the door!

264
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,333
Open the door, please!

265
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,541
Open the door! Armed forces!

266
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,333
Open the door!

267
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,000
Get the doorkeeper.

268
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,000
Open the door!

269
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,833
-Open the door!
-Hurry up!

270
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:39,875
What's going on?

271
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,791
-No one's home. They're on vacation.
-Open it anyway.

272
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,416
Everyone on guard.

273
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,625
-This isn't it, 2A…
-Come on, man. Hurry up.

274
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,208
These things take time.
It's not that easy.

275
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,041
Come on.

276
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,375
Come here, baby girl.

277
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,250
Don't you know which one it is?

278
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,416
Get down.

279
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,041
Delta Unit entering.

280
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,250
Alfa Unit standing by.

281
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,541
Bravo Unit, first floor checked and clear.

282
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,375
Clear!

283
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,208
Delta Unit,
send the doorkeeper to the third floor.

284
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,500
Bedroom clear. Let's go.

285
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,250
It's all clear. Let's go.

286
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,791
They're gone.

287
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,583
They're gone.

288
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:57,375
Gentlemen! Today we're making our mark
on the universal history of larceny!

289
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,833
Let's go, boys!
Let's make history together.

290
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:03,375
-Come on!
-Let's go!

291
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:09,208
This is where the next stage begins.

292
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:13,083
When we move the gold
that was sleeping in the drainpipes.

293
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,583
That would cause the pipes to clog.

294
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:19,208
That's why we have a second pump,
the one we stole in Norway.

295
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,458
Connect the pump!

296
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,250
Let's go, gentlemen!

297
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,541
Isn't she beautiful? I love her.

298
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:31,791
It's a technical marvel,
5,300 kilowatts of power.

299
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:36,166
Sergio, that means we'll move the gold
at 10.7 feet per second. That's crazy!

300
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,625
There's one problem.

301
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,458
Now he's wondering about…?

302
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,791
The loss of pressure due to friction.

303
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,208
Darcy-Weisbach equation.
It's measured to the millimeter.

304
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,041
-The only problem we might have…
-Is too much pressure.

305
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,166
Open the valves!

306
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,875
The pump has a pressure regulator.
We'll control it ourselves.

307
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,208
I'll activate the pump.

308
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,875
The pump will gain traction
and push the gold.

309
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,458
And 91 minutes and 37 seconds later,

310
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:09,083
our booty will have traveled
the 11.1 miles between the gold vault

311
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:12,833
and point B, commonly referred to
as the "stormwater tank."

312
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:16,583
And there, manna will rain down

313
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,250
from heaven.

314
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,333
Am I crazy
or am I the only one who sees this?

315
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:28,208
Bogotá, pressure!

316
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,916
Three thousand kilopascals!

317
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,625
Three thousand five hundred!

318
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:40,958
Let's go, darling.

319
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,375
Four thousand!

320
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,708
Come on, precious.

321
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,416
-Let's go, for God's sake!
-Four thousand five hundred!

322
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,750
Five thousand! Now!

323
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,250
Nothing yet.

324
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:11,375
Relax, we still have a few seconds.
Don't get anxious, man.

325
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,375
We're getting there.

326
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,041
Ten.

327
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:21,750
Nine.

328
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,625
Eight.

329
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:29,666
Seven.

330
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:32,708
Six.

331
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,041
Five.

332
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:41,250
Four.

333
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,333
Three.

334
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:47,958
Two.

335
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:50,958
One.

336
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,500
Now!

337
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,500
Benjamín, do you copy?

338
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:10,458
Nothing yet.

339
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:28,041
I repeat, there's nothing here, Palermo.
Maybe there was a miscalculation.

340
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:30,416
God damn it!

341
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:35,375
Science doesn't live on numbers
and calculations alone.

342
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,125
Have a little faith.

343
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,833
A little love too.

344
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,750
Come on, darling.

345
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,791
It's not just about the gold.

346
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,916
It's all the nights
we spent planning together.

347
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:02,875
The hours and hours

348
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,333
we spent stuck on the same problems.

349
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:11,625
The joy and euphoria on the days
when we found the solution.

350
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:16,166
Those were the best times of my life.
I'm begging you.

351
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,625
Please don't let all this be a mistake.

352
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,416
Don't make it all an illusion.
I'm begging you.

353
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:25,625
Please, my dear, come on.
Please, let's go, damn it.

354
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,791
Come on, damn it. You can do it.
Come on, dear God. Come on!

355
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,708
Let's go!

356
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:50,916
It's coming out!

357
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,333
The gold is coming out!

358
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:55,041
-We did it!
-Yeah!

359
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,583
Guys, set up the waterwheel.

360
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,333
Benjamín, start making the ingots.

361
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:28,125
Let's go! Start making ingots!

362
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,333
We did it, Tokyo.

363
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,083
We did it.

364
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:51,708
A rate of 14,582 gallons of water
and gold per minute, brother.

365
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:54,416
It's poetry. It's pure poetry.

366
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:08,791
How was your shower?

367
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,833
Too bad there's no men's clothes here,
right Victoria?

368
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,000
When did you last eat?

369
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:33,375
What day is it today?

370
00:29:36,291 --> 00:29:38,208
I'll try to cook something hot.

371
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:01,958
This Harris's Hawk,
a bird of prey, is an expert hunter.

372
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:09,916
As soon as it detects its prey,
it swoops down at full speed.

373
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,458
This will do you good.

374
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,583
I can't remember the last time
someone took care of me.

375
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,458
Actually, I can.

376
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,708
My husband.

377
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,291
I didn't shed a tear at his funeral.

378
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:40,666
I felt nothing
while torturing Aníbal Cortés.

379
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,583
Nothing.

380
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:48,041
My career is ruined. Still, nothing.

381
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,125
All I've done is…

382
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,083
chase you.

383
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,041
I didn't feel the nausea

384
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,875
or the exhaustion,

385
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:16,833
because I…

386
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,416
I thought if I chased you fast enough…

387
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,750
…the sadness wouldn't catch me.

388
00:31:31,625 --> 00:31:32,500
And now, look.

389
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,291
Here we are.

390
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:39,750
Here we are.

391
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,625
Can we…

392
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,000
…pretend you're a friend who came over
to cook and see the baby.

393
00:31:56,083 --> 00:32:00,208
This may be the last normal day
we have in the next 25 years.

394
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,375
Let's pretend the police aren't out there.

395
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:09,125
And we'll eat,
and you can ask me silly things,

396
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:11,833
things about the baby,
until she falls asleep,

397
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:13,083
while we watch TV.

398
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,083
Is that okay?

399
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:24,625
Of course.

400
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,083
Don't get me wrong.

401
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:28,916
I'm not your friend.

402
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,000
I never will be.

403
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,875
I'll never be your friend.

404
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,583
I see us as a marriage of convenience.

405
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:46,083
Or something like that.

406
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:49,833
Eat.

407
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:53,875
It's good. Thanks.

408
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,083
Say something.

409
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,791
Over the last few hours…

410
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:12,875
…I've lost two…

411
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,500
very important people.

412
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,791
Not for the plan, not for the heist.

413
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,500
They were important to me.

414
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,416
In my personal life.

415
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,500
And I'm not going to let

416
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:35,791
anyone else go down

417
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:37,875
for this heist.

418
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,250
I won't let you go down.

419
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,208
Okay.

420
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:58,083
So,

421
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:03,875
you'd better get used
to this sort of situation.

422
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:09,416
I won't allow Victoria to grow up
in a prison maternity ward.

423
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:26,291
I won't arrest you either.

424
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:31,583
Sounds good.

425
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:49,000
Like a velociraptor,
it chases its prey on the ground.

426
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,041
Sergio…

427
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,875
We need to get you some new shoes.

428
00:34:57,125 --> 00:35:00,625
The kangaroo rat runs for its life,
but the chicks…

429
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:06,166
We need to rebuild the bone,
and anchor it to a titanium plate.

430
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,000
You need general anesthesia.

431
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:08,958
What?

432
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,583
No way. I'm not going to sleep.

433
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:18,166
From the waist up, I'm a watchman.

434
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,791
From the waist down, I'm a patient.

435
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:26,833
Doctor, you do your job, I can take it.

436
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,541
Use an epidural.

437
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:38,750
He'll be crippled.

438
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,041
Cripples scare people.

439
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:44,958
If we're going to go to prison,
scaring people isn't all that bad.

440
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:49,875
To tell you the truth,
I can't even imagine what prison is like.

441
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:53,958
A cell? A cell is a horrible experience.

442
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:55,916
Horrible.

443
00:35:56,583 --> 00:36:00,208
But I think that the worst part
isn't losing your freedom.

444
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,125
It's being deprived of affection.

445
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,291
I don't know. Physical touch,

446
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,791
wanting to hug your child,
or wanting your mom to hug you,

447
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:14,250
and not having them there.

448
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,083
Then there's Sergio.

449
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,958
Now that I've finally found
something passable…

450
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,041
My God.

451
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:26,958
Twenty-five years in prison
will wipe it all away,

452
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:30,958
because no relationship
can withstand that absence.

453
00:36:33,708 --> 00:36:39,166
Or you can spend 25 years thinking
that everything will be the same,

454
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,708
and suddenly, when you have the chance
to be with that person and kiss them,

455
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:44,958
shit, you realize

456
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,833
how much time has passed, right?

457
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:53,041
And that you've spent years romanticizing
about something that isn't…

458
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,125
that isn't there, that doesn't exist.

459
00:36:59,625 --> 00:37:01,833
You need to know I kissed Denver,

460
00:37:01,916 --> 00:37:05,750
and I swear I'm telling you this now
because it meant nothing.

461
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:09,500
I know I shouldn't have done it,
but I just couldn't help it.

462
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:14,250
I've been obsessed with him for years.
Today I realized there's nothing there.

463
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:21,833
Hey.

464
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,375
Do you have anything for stress, Doctor?

465
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:45,625
An antipsychotic would be better.

466
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:28,916
I passed the service corridors.
I'm at the junction.

467
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,291
Listen, go left.

468
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:39,291
In 65 feet, on your left
will be a trapdoor, and you're there.

469
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,291
Every single ingot must be marked.

470
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,291
Any problems with smelting?

471
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:49,791
This is fun, isn't it?

472
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,000
Giddyap! Let's go!

473
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,666
Quickly! Come on, let's go guys!

474
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,041
Let's go!

475
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,583
We're on the first batch of ingots.

476
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:25,833
Perfect. We're almost done here.

477
00:40:25,916 --> 00:40:27,875
For the love of God, let's go.

478
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:28,916
Hey.

479
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,166
-Is Lisbon single?
-What?

480
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,458
Does she have anyone on the outside?

481
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:43,916
Why the fuck do you ask?

482
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,583
It's just that I saw her
twisting Rio's arm, and…

483
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,916
And what?

484
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,625
Ballsy chicks like her
get me hotter than the fucking forge.

485
00:40:53,875 --> 00:40:57,791
Well, she was in
a really fucked up relationship.

486
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,875
She needs someone
to restore her faith in men.

487
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,458
Yes. You need to just go for it,
but aggressively.

488
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,166
She's got a big personality.
No beating around the bush.

489
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,208
No strolls in the park.

490
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:11,458
-Exactly.
-Got it?

491
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:15,166
Gloves off, no beating around the bush,
knife between your teeth.

492
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,541
I recommend you do the following.

493
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:21,083
As soon as you get the chance,
make out with her.

494
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:25,458
In an elevator, the bathroom, wherever.
Remember, she just got out of jail.

495
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:27,958
Do you know what I mean? Do you?

496
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:28,958
Show no mercy.

497
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,708
What's up with you?

498
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,000
It's that…

499
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:45,791
I was unfaithful to my wife.

500
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:50,125
With a hostage?

501
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:52,708
With Manila.

502
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:56,375
With Manila.

503
00:41:58,708 --> 00:42:00,333
And did you go all the way?

504
00:42:00,416 --> 00:42:04,375
Well, I didn't go all the way,
but I kissed her on the mouth.

505
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:05,916
I moved first.

506
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,708
Heat of the moment, no big deal.

507
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,666
Let's go, guys. It's time to shine!

508
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,375
How is it "no big deal"?

509
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:21,916
A few seconds later,
I kissed Stockholm in the same place.

510
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,916
One's spit got in the other's mouth.

511
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,166
She's shooting up morphine
to overcome post-traumatic stress

512
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,250
while I've been an ass.
I don't know how to tell her.

513
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:35,666
Stop right there, okay?

514
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:39,375
Never, ever, in your fucking life,

515
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:41,916
do you admit you cheated.

516
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:45,625
Especially not half an hour
after doing it.

517
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,333
If you feel guilty,
you fucking deal with it.

518
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:55,083
Don't think with your dick next time.
You're going to keep quiet.

519
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:58,208
Even if she catches you naked in bed
with another woman,

520
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,375
tell her she's hallucinating.

521
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:03,375
Keep your mouth shut.

522
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,125
Hey, look at me.

523
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,083
Because once you confess,

524
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:11,583
that's written in stone,
it's like confessing to the police.

525
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,916
And then, my friend,

526
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,291
there's no way to fix things.

527
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:31,166
The baby.

528
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:40,791
Honey.

529
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,125
Sergio.

530
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,333
-What are you doing?
-I found a cell phone.

531
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,208
It's charging. It's at two bars.

532
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:17,083
It's a little old, but it'll work.

533
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,750
INCOMING CALL

534
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,125
Hello?

535
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,833
-Who are you?
-I'm Shakir.

536
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,958
-I support the Professor from Asia.
-Holy moly.

537
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:53,750
I'm Benjamín.

538
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:54,958
I'll put you through.

539
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:55,958
Yes, of course.

540
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:03,458
-Professor.
-Listen.

541
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:05,833
We're out of time. Call the Serbians.

542
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:07,041
They're here.

543
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:11,000
I made them come
to guard the outer perimeter.

544
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,916
That's great, Benjamín.

545
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,583
You put me in charge.
I'm taking things as they come.

546
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:16,916
I'm doing the best I can.

547
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:20,125
In that case, you have a mission now.

548
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:26,166
Marseille, let's go.

549
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:29,041
We have a mission. Tell the Serbians.

550
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:31,083
Boris, with us. Get the circular saws,

551
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:34,875
the thermal lances,
the welding machine, mops, and a few guns.

552
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:40,666
And the rest of you, keep making ingots
like there's no tomorrow!

553
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,458
Let's go!

554
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:05,541
Get out, and get changed.

555
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,541
Deep down,
Berlin and the Professor were a lot alike.

556
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,875
They both designed plans
based on one powerful concept…

557
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:44,916
Thrill.

558
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,833
Stop right there.

559
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,166
For the Professor, "thrill" meant
disguising the extraordinary

560
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,291
as something completely ordinary.

561
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:54,000
A garbage truck.

562
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:02,250
For Berlin, "thrill" meant
believing the impossible was possible.

563
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:04,750
And although he didn't think so,

564
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:07,250
in that way,
the Professor was like his brother.

565
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:10,333
Because only with that childlike fantasy

566
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:13,875
can one play hide-and-seek
on a street guarded by soldiers.

567
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:17,958
A garbage truck is asking for permission
to enter at control point 1-2-6.

568
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:26,291
Berlin's Peter Pan pride radiated
over the most important escape of all…

569
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:27,791
Crossing clear.

570
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:31,166
…an all-or-nothing gamble
in a magical moment.

571
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:36,000
Like when they discovered
the heist was technically possible.

572
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:40,333
It was as if they knew how to get to Mars,
but not how to return.

573
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,583
But they celebrated enthusiastically,
as only children can.

574
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:05,166
One, two, three…

575
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,875
hide-and-seek.

576
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,583
That's how it happened.

577
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:11,750
In an instant of complete normalcy.

578
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:17,333
The truck swallowed the garbage.

579
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:20,041
But it was much more than that.

580
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:23,500
Professor.

581
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:27,000
It was putting the heist's brain
back in charge of the game,

582
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,375
with a new brain by his side.

583
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And more importantly…

584
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:36,916
…the Professor realized

585
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
the enthusiasm for the heist
his brother had infected him with

586
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,041
had now infected his entire team.

587
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:48,416
That while he had been in technical KO,
lying on the canvas…

588
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,958
You'll see, Professor.

589
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:53,208
-We did the best we could.
-That's good.

590
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:55,291
…the machinery had kept running.

591
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:58,333
The gold was outside,

592
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:02,000
and the exterior foundry
was in full swing.

593
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,875
The dream was more alive than ever.

594
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:30,750
They did it.

595
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:40,958
They did it.

596
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,791
Palermo, they did it.

597
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,791
There's a foundry in the stormwater tank.

598
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:49,500
Of course it's out, brother!

599
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,958
Isn't it the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

600
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,416
The gold is coming out.

601
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:03,000
The gold is coming out!

602
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:09,208
This one's for you, Andrés.

603
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:13,125
With a pump this powerful,
they'll hear the suction or the pumping.

604
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:16,416
It'll be easy for them
to figure out we're using the pipes.

605
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,250
Why won't they be waiting for us?

606
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:26,041
That's an excellent question, Sergio,
but we do have the answer.

607
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:29,333
And the answer is the difference
between a white-collar thief

608
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:30,708
and us.

609
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:33,541
The difference between
being good and being a genius.

610
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:35,875
And we aspire to genius.

611
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:08,833
