1
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:18,996
STOP FRAUD

2
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,713
TRAITORS

3
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,581
They're attacking the bank.

4
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,706
They're attacking the bank.

5
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,583
Seal off the building!

6
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,746
I repeat,
seal off the building!

7
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,173
Red protocol, sealing the doors.
I repeat,

8
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,880
we're sealing the bank doors.

9
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,788
Everyone, put on your vests.
All of you!

10
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,828
And then the Bank of Spain
will be sealed.

11
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,538
Even when sealed off,

12
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,921
the building is very big,
Professor.

13
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,131
Too many windows,
not enough men.

14
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,210
We can't defend the whole thing.

15
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,253
Good point, Helsinki.

16
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,416
A really good point, but...

17
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,375
this building...

18
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,325
has its own secrets.

19
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,213
This is the part of the Bank of Spain
that interests us.

20
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,081
The structure is covered
with concrete walls

21
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,326
and steel sheets
180 centimeters thick.

22
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,416
From the outside,

23
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,995
it is a true safe.

24
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,463
From the inside,
it's an impenetrable fort.

25
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:49,075
Once red protocol is activated,
nobody, and I mean nobody,

26
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,626
will be allowed to go in or out
for one hour.

27
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:57,001
That's the time we need
to obtain a key piece

28
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,575
for stage two of our plan.

29
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,131
What piece?

30
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,750
The Governor of the Bank of Spain.

31
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,705
He'll be in his office,

32
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,631
escorted by
five personal bodyguards

33
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,248
with a poor sense of humor.

34
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,460
I call that the ghost train.

35
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,581
Everyone knows
something weird is going on

36
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,126
and things will jump out,

37
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,500
but no one really knows
from where.

38
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:33,291
Governor, sir,
I'm Lieutenant Lorenzo.

39
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,625
You must come with us.

40
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,918
We need to evacuate you
immediately.

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,040
Thank you, Amanda.

42
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,375
For now,
I'm not leaving my office.

43
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:44,496
Sir.

44
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,583
It's a direct order
from General Salas Núñez.

45
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,956
- It comes from above.
- I received it,

46
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,670
but I'm not following it.

47
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,043
I'm not leaving the Bank until
the last employee has left.

48
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,881
So, if you want to protect me,

49
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:02,038
you'll have to sit down and wait.

50
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:03,786
Coffee, anyone?

51
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,171
Amanda, if you please.

52
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,378
Come in, come in.

53
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:15,495
At that moment, I wondered
what Nairobi might be thinking.

54
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,418
I only had one thought my mind.

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,750
To draw my gun
and rain hell down on them.

56
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,246
Get some rest.

57
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,205
Take a seat.

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,580
May I ask what regiment
you belong to?

59
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,205
We're airborne sappers

60
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,421
from BRIPAC,

61
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,326
sixth brigade.

62
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,251
With demining missions in Mali,
Lebanon,

63
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,173
Afghanistan.

64
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,540
There were five bodyguards.

65
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,665
We had two guns each,

66
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,540
so we could each
take out two men.

67
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,751
It was still one too many.

68
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,711
Very risky business.

69
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,630
By the way,

70
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,328
how do you deactivate
an anti-personnel mine?

71
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,673
It depends.

72
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,706
There are many types of mines

73
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:25,001
and each one
has a different mechanism.

74
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,923
There are the Green Parrots,
the Butterfly, the PMF1...

75
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,208
Some are activated by methods

76
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,291
that would defuse others.

77
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,375
Some explode due to movement.

78
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,288
Some...

79
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,495
explode when being opened.
Some even explode

80
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,963
when you get too close to them.

81
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,331
May I go to the toilet?

82
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,915
By all means.
You can use mine.

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,830
Excuse me.

84
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,001
Amanda, if you please.

85
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,746
This way.

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,920
The worst are the Russian.

87
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,576
The Professor had prepared us
for any event.

88
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,961
But let's be honest.

89
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,918
Theory is one thing.

90
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,081
The actual action, another.

91
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,666
Go!

92
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,250
Move!

93
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,208
You'll be safe here.

94
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,288
Nothing to worry about
among writers and poets.

95
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:52,746
Stay calm.

96
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,833
Hands in the air.

97
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,035
Like this.
Like in a robbery.

98
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:05,955
Come on.

99
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:07,746
Very good.

100
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,125
Ladies and gentlemen,

101
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,418
my name is Palermo.

102
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,461
And I have two
pieces of news for you.

103
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,673
Good and bad.

104
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:22,455
The bad one is that the Bank of Spain
is under attack.

105
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,170
The good one...

106
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,826
We are the attackers!

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,420
Keep calm! Keep calm!

108
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,630
Keep calm!

109
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,328
Everyone, keep calm!

110
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,171
VP13.

111
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,246
VP13?

112
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,285
They have an electronic fuse

113
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,535
controlled by a seismic sensor.

114
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,128
Touch them...

115
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,133
and you're fucked.

116
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,421
Afghanistan was full of them.

117
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,541
I see you're well trained.

118
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:24,875
Sir, do not move.

119
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,878
Are you OK, Lieutenant?

120
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,580
Lieutenant!

121
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,630
Governor, sir...

122
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,125
Now you must come with us.

123
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,205
Get up.

124
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:07,881
Come with me.

125
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,211
What are you doing?

126
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Don't move.

127
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,461
Guns down!

128
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,875
Don't move!

129
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,535
Don't move!

130
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:54,788
Well...

131
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,875
This doesn't look good
for either of us.

132
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,748
Let's call it quits.

133
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,328
Quits? You think
we've reached a draw?

134
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,213
You won't shoot the governor,

135
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,285
but I'll do this bitch in.

136
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,625
I'll do it.

137
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:21,881
Gandía!

138
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,416
Release the girl.

139
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,578
Calm down, Amanda.

140
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,666
It's okay.

141
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,501
- Gandía, release the girl.
- No.

142
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,333
I don't want anyone harmed.
That is an order.

143
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,460
Gandía, release the girl!

144
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,751
I'm going with them.

145
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,955
And I don't want you
to do anything.

146
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:51,881
That's right.

147
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,960
I don't know what you want,
but there's no way out.

148
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,381
Then we stay.

149
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,706
Fire!

150
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,673
Shit!

151
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,580
What the fuck!

152
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,496
Shit!

153
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,793
What just happened?

154
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,245
What just happened?

155
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,253
- Shit! Okay...
- What are you doing?

156
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,543
They're going down.
We need to go up.

157
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,711
- We're going down.
- Going down?

158
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,581
If we stay here, they shoot us.
Better to get out.

159
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,286
Let's gate-crash it, Tokyo style.

160
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,456
Shit's about to hit the fan.

161
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,923
Now you belong to
our wonderful hostage family.

162
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,670
We'll enjoy some days
of complete disconnection.

163
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,746
Take the masks and put
them on, please.

164
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,875
Put the fucking masks on!

165
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,035
So that nobody feels inclined
to be a hero,

166
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,165
hand in your mobile phones
to my mate, Denver.

167
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,710
Let's do it this way.

168
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,711
Raise your hands
if you're parents.

169
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:36,538
Okay.

170
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,878
We'll tag your mobile
phones in red,

171
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,128
so you can make
one phone call a day.

172
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,331
Where's that coming from, moron?

173
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,535
Because I say so
and I'm the hostage coordinator.

174
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,750
Did you take a course?

175
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,626
Are you daddy of the year?

176
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,878
Hand in your mobile phones now!

177
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,540
What about this white strawberry?

178
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,035
Oh, my God!
You're such a snob, Tokyo!

179
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,745
He's such a cutie.

180
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,883
What's his name?

181
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,126
Ask his father.

182
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:13,881
Cincinnati.

183
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:14,958
No, come on!

184
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,921
The love of my life seated here

185
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,750
wanted Cynthia when we thought
he was a girl.

186
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,673
However...

187
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,326
They misread the ultrasound.

188
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,536
- Why?
- I only had the first one done.

189
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,995
Do you remember where that was?

190
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,633
- Yes.
- In Sulawao.

191
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,578
- In Sulawesi.
- Sulawesi.

192
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,956
- Sulawesi.
- That one.

193
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,831
It looked like a filthy
bike garage.

194
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,080
Unbelievable!

195
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,536
And we never went back.

196
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:42,165
They took a bullet out of me
during the war in a tractor garage.

197
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,630
- You never told me that, cub.
- For real.

198
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,628
- Where?
- In the ass. Wanna see?

199
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,503
- No...
- No!

200
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,713
Show them your pet,
come one, Helsi.

201
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,631
- No.
- Come on! Show them your pet, come on.

202
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,128
They're family.

203
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,288
OK. Check this out.
I have a new...

204
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,745
No way!

205
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,883
Don't look!

206
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,208
What are you doing?

207
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,250
- It can talk.
- Hey, big man,

208
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,133
want me to train your bear?

209
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,125
I'm good at training animals.

210
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,630
- Did you prefer a girl or a boy, Mónica?
- We didn't care.

211
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:27,293
We didn't care. You love him or her,
not matter what comes out, right?

212
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,131
It's a boy.

213
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,423
What?

214
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,078
A boy?

215
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,080
It's a boy.

216
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,923
It's a boy!

217
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,130
It's a boy!

218
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,168
It's a boy! A boy!

219
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,076
Boy!

220
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,496
Boy!

221
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,753
It's a boy!

222
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,173
Boy!

223
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,253
What can I say? I was happy.

224
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,173
It's a boy!

225
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,960
You could hear him screaming.
It's a boy!

226
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,381
So that's it! From Cynthia...

227
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,923
Cinthy...

228
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,460
Cincy-nati. Cincinnati.

229
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,421
You're insane.

230
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,540
It's pure logic.

231
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,375
He's got a city name.

232
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,503
Like the whole family.

233
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,753
This family.

234
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,666
Cincinnati.

235
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:47,955
Right?

236
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,633
It's okay, my love.
My little boy.

237
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,705
- To him.
- To Cincinnati!

238
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,671
- Well wishes!
- Here, here.

239
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,960
Cheers! To everyone!

240
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:06,881
Come on.

241
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:07,788
Guys.

242
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,325
I want to thank you
for what you're doing.

243
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,826
In Rio's name and in mine.

244
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,788
- Thank you.
- To Rio!

245
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,035
To Rio! Cheers.

246
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,785
Cheers.

247
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,288
We're doing this for Rio,
Tokyo, but...

248
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,326
also for all of us.

249
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,916
Right now,
they think they can only win.

250
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,330
Chasing us like animals
and prying us from our holes...

251
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,331
Torturing us. Violating
every human right. Anything goes.

252
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,996
If we hide like rats,

253
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,463
they'll strike again.

254
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,001
One by one.

255
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,171
There's only one way to avoid it.

256
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,918
To face them.

257
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,961
Listen.

258
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,543
In this world...

259
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,075
everything is weighed
on a simple pair of scales

260
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,455
what you can win

261
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,496
and what you can lose,
and right now...

262
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,920
they think
they have nothing to lose.

263
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,171
And when you think
you have nothing to lose,

264
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,833
you get stronger.

265
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,080
Well...

266
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,461
we will...

267
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,078
show them...

268
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,626
how much they have...

269
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,501
to lose.

270
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,130
Where's the governor?

271
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,748
Where is he?

272
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,536
Palermo!

273
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,455
We have a problem.

274
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:09,705
Tokyo.

275
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,331
Take it easy.

276
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,166
- Tokyo.
- Take it easy.

277
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,380
On the count of three,
shoot and duck.

278
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,575
One...

279
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:36,955
Two...

280
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,753
Guns down, you rats!

281
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,790
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me introduce myself.

282
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,288
I'm Palermo and I'm the one
in charge of this robbery.

283
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,875
So, please, aim at my chest.
I'm your most valuable target.

284
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:54,958
Aim at her!

285
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,041
At her.

286
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:56,955
Okay...

287
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,828
We have a few seconds
before all the shooting starts,

288
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,996
so let's talk about anatomy.

289
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,210
Human beings have two eyes.

290
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,881
And unlike chameleons,

291
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,625
their eyes are located
in the front of the head and are fixed.

292
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,833
This is clearly a handicap for you
in a shoot-out.

293
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,036
Shoot and your girls will be dead.

294
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,541
I'm talking to you, Gandía.

295
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,788
I know that you go to the firing range
every Sunday,

296
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,035
that you like reading about armaments.

297
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,125
You've been waiting your whole
fucking life for this,

298
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,578
to be a hero.

299
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,376
Let me give you some advice.

300
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,423
Think of Marisa,

301
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,330
imagine your son
Juanito's angelic face...

302
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,078
and put your fucking gun
down very slowly.

303
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,538
Okay.

304
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,830
Okay.

305
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,918
At that moment,
the Professor realized

306
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,830
that this job would be very different
from the one at the Royal Mint.

307
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,541
This one didn't come from his head

308
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:43,038
and he hadn't had the time
to make it his own.

309
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,380
Had he had a rewind button,
he would have pushed it right then.

310
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,456
But he didn't have one.

311
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,996
Are you okay, Tokyo?

312
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,083
Say something!

313
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,381
Are you okay?

314
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,828
Go check on Palermo!

315
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:02,376
We fired all our bullets at their vests,
following the Professor's instructions.

316
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,498
- Help Palermo!
- But we were too late.

317
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,420
Wake up!
Where's the governor?

318
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,880
We have to get him out of here.
Find a stretcher!

319
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,458
Everything's gone to hell!

320
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:52,331
His eyes are full of glass!

321
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,246
Shit!

322
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:01,538
Help me!

323
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,330
Move!

324
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,666
Up against the wall!
Against the wall!

325
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,330
Come on! Move!

326
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,420
Come on! Hurry up!

327
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,830
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Move!

328
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,456
- Almost there.
- Careful.

329
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:20,708
It's okay.

330
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:22,998
Painkillers!

331
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:27,786
Calm down.
I'm taking this off very slowly.

332
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,075
Slowly... Easy...

333
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,126
Very good.

334
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,713
Okay.
Open your eyes now. Slowly.

335
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,285
Come on.

336
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:43,881
Very good.

337
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,416
I can't keep them open for too long.
I can't.

338
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,580
Can you see?

339
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:50,746
I can't see shit.
What's happening?

340
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,083
Shit.

341
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,630
Okay. Okay.

342
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:55,575
How about the light?

343
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,535
As if I were in Maracanã Stadium.

344
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:01,495
Does that mean anything to you?
You think you're an eye doctor now?

345
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,383
He needs an ophthalmologist!

346
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,878
Call the Professor.

347
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:05,998
I see the glass.

348
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,383
Okay. Stockholm,
first aid kit number 4.

349
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,708
- The surgical one.
- OK.

350
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:10,831
Hurry up.

351
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,878
- What are you going to do, Tokyo?
- I'm going to remove them.

352
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,828
- Really? How?
- With tweezers.

353
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,496
I wouldn't do that, Tokyo.

354
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,503
Call the Professor
and release three hostages

355
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,423
- for an eye doctor.
- Denver!

356
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,420
- Shut up and leave!
- Okay.

357
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,880
Listen to me, Palermo.

358
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,748
My hand is steadier than
a Swiss watchmaker's.

359
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:32,753
I'm getting that glass out.

360
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:35,503
Do you know
why they use lasers for eye surgery?

361
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,173
- Yes.
- For just a tiny detail.

362
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,250
Precision. Eye operations need
to be precise to the micrometer.

363
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,133
Check this out, Denver.

364
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,168
Tokyo wants to use
the same tweezers she uses

365
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,500
to trim her jungle down there.

366
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,003
Come on!

367
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,003
Nonsense!

368
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:53,915
Say it again.

369
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,580
Say it again.

370
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,501
How was it?

371
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:03,575
I'm sure your peach
down there is all silky.

372
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,706
Now say, I will never mention

373
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,381
my colleagues' pussies
ever again.

374
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,328
I will never mention
my colleagues' pussies again.

375
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:12,576
I didn't get that.

376
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:16,878
- I'll never mention your pussy, bitch.
- Fucking great, Palermo.

377
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,576
At your service.

378
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,786
Okay.
We'll deal with my eyes later.

379
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,253
- Denver, on my right.
- What's up?

380
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:27,383
Give me your arm.
You're my second in command now.

381
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:30,038
- I'm your damn guide dog now?
- Silence!

382
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,880
- Tokyo!
- What?

383
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,875
We have 14 tons of steel below.
Tell me Nairobi is with Bogotá.

384
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:36,788
That's right.

385
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,463
Let's go.

386
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,541
Listen.
What are you doing?

387
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,328
Are you going to tie us up
like dogs?

388
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,286
I'm not.

389
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:49,625
We're all family here,
in case you need to take a piss.

390
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,875
I'm going to kill you.

391
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,503
Governor, I beg your pardon.

392
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:02,126
I'll hold onto this for you.

393
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,746
Your attention, please.

394
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:08,753
We have placed
460 kilos of explosives

395
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,633
on doors, windows,

396
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:14,498
at every entrance and exit, so in case
anyone tries to escape...

397
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:15,633
Boom!

398
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,628
They would do so in pieces.

399
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,250
It's not worth it.

400
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:27,745
We must all stay here together
for a few days, that's right,

401
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,326
but during all this time,

402
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:32,625
we will

403
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,250
protect you all.

404
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,250
And you will protect us all.

405
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:40,205
How wonderful!

406
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,375
And now, whenever you want,
you can take the masks off.

407
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,463
Now!

408
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:51,995
How's that?

409
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:53,878
How are you?

410
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,383
Now that we can see each other,

411
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:59,208
let me introduce you
to Mr. Bogotá.

412
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:01,251
He's going to pick
four volunteers.

413
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,665
My name is Bogotá and I came
to do the hard part of the job.

414
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,375
We're going to work in
over 65 degrees Celsius.

415
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:13,038
It's going to feel like
a fucking crematorium.

416
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,130
We'll be doing shifts
of 12, 14, 16 or 24 hours.

417
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,710
As many as you can handle.

418
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,375
Who's in?

419
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:34,455
Name!

420
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,205
Agustín.

421
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,793
- Agustín Montero.
- Why are you here?

422
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:39,705
I was...

423
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,576
exchanging currency.

424
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,291
Step forward.

425
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,785
Congratulations,
you're our first volunteer.

426
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:47,881
Next.

427
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,878
Miguel Talanilla. From Murcia.

428
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:52,208
- Okay.
- What do you do, Miguel?

429
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,461
I intern at the Operations
and Systems Department.

430
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:57,501
IT.

431
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,171
- Unsuitable.
- Unsuitable. Next!

432
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:02,923
Name. Why are you here?

433
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:04,631
Alfonso.

434
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:08,286
I have... I had an appointment
at the Public Debt Department.

435
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:13,671
Step forward. Congratulations,
you're our second volunteer. Next!

436
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,170
Name. Why are you here?

437
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,000
Amanda.
I'm the Governor's secretary.

438
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,333
Unsuitable. Come on, next!

439
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,246
Name!

440
00:28:21,916 --> 00:28:22,916
Matías Caño.

441
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,878
Suitable! Step forward.

442
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,963
- No, ma'am.
- Don't ma'am me.

443
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,881
You're our next volunteer.

444
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,883
I'm no volunteer.

445
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,250
Okay.
Can you see this finger?

446
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:38,503
This finger points at the volunteers

447
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,753
and it is pointing
at you over and over again.

448
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,923
So, please, step forward
because you're now a volunteer.

449
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:47,791
Ma'am, I'm no volunteer.

450
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,170
What was your name?

451
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,130
Matías Caño.

452
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,038
What?

453
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,285
Matías Caño.

454
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,875
Okay, Matías Caño.

455
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,498
You're coming with me
right fucking now.

456
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,883
Let's go. Move!

457
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:07,131
Come on!

458
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,418
Go to the elevator!

459
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,285
Don't move!

460
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:19,003
Go in!

461
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,213
What was that about?

462
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:30,541
Are you stupid?

463
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:33,131
What the fuck was that about?

464
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,498
To seem more credible.

465
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:37,383
More credible? Do you think
you're fucking Anthony Hopkins now?

466
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,415
I had to act
like a hostage, right?

467
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,630
You're joking. From the producers
of coming with me right fucking now,

468
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,668
coming soon to a blacksmith
workshop near you.

469
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,170
I think I did a good job.
It went smooth.

470
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,960
I'll slap your face smooth.

471
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:53,955
Six years!

472
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,961
Six fucking years
working with this guy

473
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:00,291
and six times I've wanted to slam
his head against a wagon.

474
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:29,833
My dears.

475
00:30:31,583 --> 00:30:33,253
In the next few minutes,

476
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,921
even your balls are at stake.

477
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:42,423
Sergio!

478
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:45,076
The CNI has arrived.

479
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:18,956
Get them bugged.

480
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,923
Colonel Tamayo.

481
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,830
Inspector.

482
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,420
- Time of explosion.
- 12:04.

483
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,460
We heard shooting
and they put explosives everywhere.

484
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,001
- How were they detonated?
- We're not sure.

485
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,211
Plastic explosive, RDX.
Flawlessly made.

486
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,291
They're bluffing.

487
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:37,165
It doesn't seem like it.

488
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:39,540
They're at the front, the roof,
inside...

489
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:42,415
I studied them.
They wouldn't blow it up.

490
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,920
Respectfully,
they're capable of anything.

491
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,790
I take a piss and nothing happens.
They're scum.

492
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,375
- Listen to me.
- Please!

493
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:57,538
Alfonso.

494
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,290
How are you doing?

495
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,915
I'm fucked big time, Luis.

496
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:03,746
I can't.

497
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,213
I'm sorry. You're in charge.

498
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,248
Don't worry.

499
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,080
Get some rest.

500
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:14,955
Luis.

501
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,830
Call her.

502
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,963
I sent her to interrogate
Aníbal Cortés.

503
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:25,916
Call her.

504
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,958
Gentlemen,

505
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,501
we know everyone here.

506
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,713
I'm Colonel Tamayo, Intelligence.
I'm in charge here.

507
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,581
First, I want the queen bitch here.

508
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:46,126
Get me Alicia Sierra.

509
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:48,376
Get her on the phone now.

510
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,920
Back to work.

511
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,040
Get me Inspector Sierra
right now.

512
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:57,825
It's her.

513
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,250
Inspector Sierra, you've got
a phone call from Colonel Tamayo.

514
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,423
Talk to me.

515
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,170
Alicia, Tamayo here.

516
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,875
Get something out of him?

517
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,708
Nothing that can help us, Luis.

518
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,285
Send him to his mommy,
to fix him some soup.

519
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:25,535
He's gone limp
from all the drugs and chats.

520
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,131
Put him on a plane
and come with him to Madrid.

521
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:29,498
You've got work here.

522
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:32,128
Let me be part of this, Luis.

523
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:35,706
Tell me you want me
to get the fucking shepherd

524
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,793
and his sheep out of the bank.

525
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:39,881
Exactly.

526
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:41,791
Fuck, yeah...

527
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:44,461
I'm so happy,
my water could break!

528
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:58,826
I feel uneasy...

529
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,080
in front of all this beauty,

530
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:07,206
but I've got some pretty
unpleasant news.

531
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:14,876
I've been diagnosed
with mom's illness.

532
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,080
How long?

533
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:31,746
Three years.

534
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,961
At the least.
You know how alarmist doctors are.

535
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,501
In the end, it'll be six.

536
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,043
Or seven.

537
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,630
Like a stray cat's life.

538
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,421
Andrés.

539
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:04,041
We'll call it all off
and find a treatment abroad.

540
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:05,455
First, there's no cure.

541
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:09,253
And, secondly,
I enjoy stealing much more.

542
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:13,213
Do you want to risk spending
the time you have left behind bars?

543
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:16,251
If a painter told you
he had three years left to live,

544
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,081
would you ask him
to stop painting?

545
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,206
Andrés, please...

546
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,670
Look.

547
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:28,495
Would you have told Michelangelo
to stop sculpting his David?

548
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:30,995
No. Of course not.

549
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:34,543
You'd have said...
Forza, Michelangelo!

550
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,580
Continue doing your passion.

551
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,166
A painter? A poet?
It's the same thing.

552
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,830
Gentlemen,

553
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,166
continue creating beauty.

554
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,083
And this job, Sergio,

555
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,205
is an apologia for beauty.

556
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,788
It's our masterpiece.

557
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,710
Sixteen minutes...

558
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,881
and 15 seconds.

559
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,000
Sixteen minutes...

560
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,996
and 15 seconds.

561
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:18,881
That's what it is.

562
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:22,625
The moment you touch that door,

563
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,708
the vault will be flooded.

564
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,786
Sixteen minutes and 15 seconds.

565
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:30,038
The time it takes the water
to reach here.

566
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,168
Either we make a hole

567
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,920
and weld the interconnection tube
in that time,

568
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:40,131
or that's it,

569
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,535
we all end up in prison

570
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:44,705
for nothing.

571
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:47,713
For breaking a door.

572
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:50,625
But that...

573
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:53,166
that's not...

574
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,326
going to happen to us.

575
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:59,633
And that's not going to happen
to us because... Bogotá.

576
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,830
What are we?

577
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:04,041
The fucking best.

578
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,173
What are we?

579
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:07,881
The fucking best.

580
00:37:09,416 --> 00:37:11,416
No... Not like that.

581
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,170
You can't melt a 14-ton
door like that.

582
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,460
What are we?

583
00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:18,001
The fucking best!

584
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,173
What are we?

585
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,750
The fucking best!

586
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,293
What are we?

587
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,455
The fucking best!

588
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,001
That's much better!
Grab your lances!

589
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,831
This is not a door.

590
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,753
This is butter.

591
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,003
And you...

592
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,210
You're going to melt it down.

593
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,671
Burnt butter!
Take your positions!

594
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,495
Come on, Sergio.

595
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,748
Don't be mean. Imagine it.

596
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,746
Imagine it. You can do it.

597
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,503
Imagine it with me now.

598
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,383
A 14-ton steel door.

599
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,035
And right there,

600
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,461
the best blacksmiths
in the world.

601
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:08,711
Ready?

602
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:11,791
Tick-tock!

603
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:12,705
Now!

604
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:25,248
The moment we touch that door,
water will pour in, 7,500 liters/minute.

605
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,423
Tick-tock!

606
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,000
Come on! Hurry up!

607
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:40,458
Don't stop!

608
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,880
Once it's full,

609
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,328
you'd be crushed

610
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,503
if you opened that door.

611
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:49,706
But we're not going to open it.

612
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,830
Exactly.

613
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,996
We're going to penetrate it.

614
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:58,826
Bring the ram!

615
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,666
Go!

616
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:11,626
Now!

617
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:16,831
Tube!

618
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:19,666
Go! Lead the way!

619
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,880
In the 16 minutes it takes
the vault to fill up, we'll play

620
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,995
Jacques-Yves...

621
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,746
Cousteau.

622
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,250
One, two, three.

623
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,463
Push!

624
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,830
Ready!

625
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,170
Without opening that door,
a welder will go in.

626
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,080
Here.

627
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,290
Okay, we're ready.

628
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,251
Our fate is in your hands.

629
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,420
The oxygen comes first.

630
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:21,291
- Let me be.
- What are you doing?

631
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,205
- I've got time!
- What the fuck?

632
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,291
Put your oxygen on, Bogotá!

633
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:28,955
Shit! Why? Why the hell does someone
always have to be the hero?

634
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:31,751
There's always someone
who has to play the hero!

635
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:36,076
And right there,
with water rising by the second,

636
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:39,206
begins the real fantasy
of the new millennium.

637
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,631
Welding a small
interconnecting chamber

638
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:44,208
to both sides.

639
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:57,375
With water rising by the minute,
it's better than a Bond movie.

640
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:01,628
Not even James Bond could weld
the antechamber in such a short time.

641
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:02,538
Exactly!

642
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:05,955
That's why we'll hire
the best welder in the world.

643
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:14,791
If the water level is over the welding,
or this welding isn't perfect...

644
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,380
the water will push
with such pressure

645
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:25,128
that we'd need four or five days
to get him out.

646
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,498
So, he'd die!

647
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:29,673
He'd die!

648
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,705
But what robbery is without risk?

649
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,040
Go!

650
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,285
Don't waste time!

651
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:49,916
Anyway, brother,
let's not think about that just now.

652
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,750
Come on!
Just one more minute!

653
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:58,166
Just give me one more minute!

654
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,130
Who would imagine that?

655
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:09,746
Who?

656
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:21,535
I'm going in.

657
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,785
An interconnecting antechamber.

658
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:31,211
Just like a bathyscaphe!

659
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,460
So then,

660
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:45,246
my dearest brother,
there come the bubbles.

661
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,880
You used to love
ocean documentaries.

662
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,458
Well, now comes
your most wonderful moment.

663
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:59,421
As the flotation levels out...

664
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Bogotá!

665
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:12,583
You're alive!

666
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,325
You turn around...

667
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:21,671
see the bubbles...

668
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:25,831
sparkling bubbles,

669
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:30,003
because of the gold ingots,

670
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:32,673
and bursting against the roof.

671
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:47,881
You'll think
you're in the Space Station.

672
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:55,376
But you aren't.

673
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:08,583
You're in the vault
of the Bank of Spain.

674
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:16,168
There... floating...

675
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:25,420
It'd be like entering a sunken galleon
in the middle of the ocean.

676
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:28,131
Ninety tons of 24K pure gold.

677
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:31,746
What do you think?

678
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,998
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever heard.

679
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:48,746
I told you!

680
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Compay!

681
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,250
<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

682
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,130
<i>Guantanamera</i>

683
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:18,878
<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

684
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:21,748
<i>Do not leave me in the dark</i>

685
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:25,288
<i>To die like a traitor</i>

686
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,880
<i>Do not leave me in the dark</i>

687
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:32,995
<i>To die like a traitor</i>

688
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:36,625
<i>I am good and good as I am</i>

689
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:40,168
<i>I will die facing the sun</i>

690
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,880
Facing the sun, brother.

691
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:46,076
I want to die on a beach.

692
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:50,825
When the judge comes to pick up my body,
I want him to say, that bastard!

693
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,285
<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:56,205
Let's dance.

<i>Guajira guantanamera</i>

697
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:04,538
Dance with me.

698
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:14,376
My babies...

699
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:16,711
Look what I brought.

700
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:22,535
Look at these little earrings I've found.
Would you look at that?

701
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:25,211
Golden! Sweet gold!

702
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:37,288
That's right!
