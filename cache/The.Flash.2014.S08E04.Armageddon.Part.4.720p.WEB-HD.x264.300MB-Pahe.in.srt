In my timeline, a demon was

but you switched places
with her.

Luke designed it the last time

a certain lady in red tried

working on it since I got home.

355
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:59,023
Every time I think
about my future with Eobard,

356
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,374
my mind just...

357

It goes blanker than that page.

I love Eobard. I do.

361

But when I think
about what Allen said,

362
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,521
I mean, I just, I can't.

363
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:21,524
I can't get it out of my head.
It's like it's haunting me.

364
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,484
Ryan, I've won two Pulitzers.

365
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:27,138
Why can't I write
my own wedding vows?

366
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:34,581
- Iris, tonight you told me
to stop thinking so much

367
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:36,452
and listen to my heart.

368
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:37,845
- Yeah, okay, I get it.

369
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,368
That's what I'm supposed
to do now--

370
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:41,718
- 'Cause it works.

371
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:45,896
Look, tonight I saved
a kid living in their van

372
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,247
near the waterfront,
just like I was

373
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,553
before I found the Batsuit.

374
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,686
Some lowlifes were mugging her,

375
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:56,167
and as I was kicking
their asses,

376
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:58,735
my heart told me what I want.

377
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:01,956
I want to save a kid
like Cora saved me.

378
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:06,439
So after I dropped
their sorry asses off

379
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:10,181
at the nearest precinct,
I called Sophie.

380
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:12,358
We're gonna adopt.

381
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:16,013
- Ryan.

382
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,017
I'm so happy for you.

383
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:22,324
- Take your own advice.

384
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:26,415
Trust me, if Eobard's the one,

385
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:28,287
the vows will come.

386
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,114
- And what if he isn't?

387
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:32,943
- Then I will get you out
of here in a hot minute.

388
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,815
My car drives really fast.

389
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:46,043
- That's good work.

390
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,394
- Martini?
- Dude.

391
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:50,787
- Right, you don't
drink alcohol.

392
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:54,617
- Hey, Chester,
why did you ghost Allegra?

393
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,011
- Well, I-I never--
- Oh, here we go.

394
00:21:57,054 --> 00:21:59,796
- Ten years ago, the morning
after you two hooked up,

395
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,929
you snuck out
while she was sleeping.

396
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:03,539
- First of all,
that's not ghosting.

397
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,149
That's called the French exit.

398
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,064
- I never ghosted anyone, okay?

399
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:10,416
I went to get coffee
and blueberry muffins.

400
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:11,852
- Wait, what?

401
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:15,638
- Yeah, I wanted
to have breakfast in bed,

402
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,032
watch the sun come up.

403
00:22:18,075 --> 00:22:19,816
I had the whole day planned

404
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,341
because I knew even
after one night that I wanted

405
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,168
to spend the rest
of my life with her.

406
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:25,909
- Dear God.

407
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:28,216
When I got back,
she was gone, Alex,

408
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:30,305
so Allegra ghosted me.

409
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,655
- Which is why we always abide

410
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:35,049
never return to the scene
of the crime.

411
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,834
- Why didn't you ever tell her?

412
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:39,619
- I wanted to.

413
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:42,361
But we were attacked
by the Legion of Doom.

414
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:45,494
That week was
seriously chaotic,

415
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:48,454
and when the dust settled,

416
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:50,717
I tried bringing it up again.

417
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:55,069
But she cut me off,

418
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:57,985
told me that night
was a huge mistake

419
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:00,074
and that we were
better off as friends.

420
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:07,081
Think I'm gonna get some air.
Yeah.

421

when you try and play Cupid.

422
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:18,614
- What is your problem?

423
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:21,095
Why don't you love "love"?

424
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:25,404
- Okay, love is just a chemical
flood of dopamine and oxytocin,

425
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:28,450
giving people an addictive
dependence like a bad drug.

426
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:29,538
- Science.

427
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:30,800
- It's taken me years

428
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,802
to help Chuck feel happy
without Allegra.

429
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,065
- By telling him
to hide his heart?

430
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,241
- Now you're gonna give me
a whole greeting card

431
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:39,505
inspired speech
about your perfect wife

432

and how she's the love
of your life.

433
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:44,945
- Okay, all right.
All right, fine.

434
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:49,036
But one day,
you're gonna wake up alone,

435
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,299
and you're gonna realize
that you missed out

Despero says
I cause Armageddon.
