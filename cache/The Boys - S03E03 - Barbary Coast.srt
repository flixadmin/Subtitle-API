1
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,553
All right, remember,

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,889
loose shoulders,
let your diaphragm do the rest,

3
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,812
and don't tense up
when you hit the high notes.

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,976
Mom, I can't. It hurts.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,979
- It's just a little tummy ache.
- It's not my tummy.

6
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,315
- It's my side.
- What am I gonna say to you?

7
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:27,861
Pain is weakness leaving the body.

8
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,821
That's right. We are winners.

9
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,241
And that means that we do
whatever it takes to win.

10
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,451
So you go out there and just keep smiling.

11
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,744
Okay, baby?

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,540
All right.

13
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,042
You look beautiful.

14
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,462
Next up,
from des moines, Iowa...

15
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,130
Contestant 15,

16
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,883
starlight.

17
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,635
J" oh, baby, babyj'

18
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,890
j" oh, baby, babyj'

19
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,352
j " how was I supposed to know j"

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,940
J" that something wasn't right here? J“

21
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,527
j” my loneliness is killing me j”

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,112
j'andlj'

23
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,824
j" I must confess, I still believe j“

24
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,158
j" still believe j”

25
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,412
j” when I'm not with you, I lose my mind j”

26
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,207
j " give me a sign j"

27
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,377
j" hit me, baby, one more time j”

28
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,060
My whole life,
rich people, powerful people

29
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,439
tried to muzzle me, cancel me,

30
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:49,318
keep me-me impotent and-and obedient,
like I'm a puppet.

31
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,254
You know what? It worked.

32
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,006
Hey, Ashley, what's crisis management
saying about this?

33
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,239
Sorry, starlight, not now!

34
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,825
And guess what.

35
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,996
If they can control me, then you can
bet your ass they can control you.

36
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,165
They're already doing it.
You just don't realize it.

37
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,209
I'm done.

38
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,712
I am done apologizing.

39
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,007
I am done being persecuted
for my strength.

40
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,761
Done being persecuted for my strength.

41
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,181
Persecuted for my strength.

42
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,850
Persecuted...
Persecuted... persecuted...

43
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,286
You're up!

44
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,436
You're up!

45
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,564
- No knock?
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.

46
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,442
Um, I'm... yeah, I'm gonna come back later.

47
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,735
Wait.

48
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,195
What do you mean, I'm up?

49
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,656
Twenty-one points with your base.

50
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,620
What did you just say to me?

51
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,999
Twenty-one points.
They loved your speech.

52
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:50,087
A massive 44% uptick
with white males in the rust belt.

53
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,757
- Yes.
- I know.

54
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,093
Fuck yes. Yes!

55
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,179
They're saying you're confident
and unapologetic

56
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,889
and that you're not afraid to...

57
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,476
Keep fucking going, Ashley. Don't stop.

58
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,103
- Um, I'm sorry, sir.
- What?

59
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,979
Um...

60
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,524
Uh... That's got
nothing to do with you.

61
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,527
- Just keep going. Not afraid to what?
- Not afraid to be yourself.

62
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,242
They want me to be myself?

63
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,451
Now, um...

64
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:27,791
You did slip seven points
with urban-area adults 18 to 34.

65
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,251
But it's not bad. It's good.

66
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,337
Because ultimately, everybody
loves you and starlight as a team.

67
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:36,383
Together, you have a o rating of 98%.

68
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,009
No one's ever been that high.

69
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,763
Not soldier boy, not anyone.

70
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,016
Ninety-eight.

71
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,548
J" express yourself j”

72
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,550
j” I'm expressing
with my full capabilities j'

73
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,261
j” and now I'm living
in correctional facilities j'

74
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,638
j" 'cause some don't agree
with how I do this j“

75
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,602
j" I get straight
meditate like a Buddhist... j“

76
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,684
I'm-a be back,
you got to police your shit.

77
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,728
This is the flatiron building.

78
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,371
It's a historic motherfucking building.

79
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,815
We got to put some respect
on the building's name.

80
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,567
- Look at this.
- Uh-uh-uh.

81
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,944
- What?
- Use a plate.

82
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,740
But I don't use a plate when I eat
your mother's sweet and savory vagin.

83
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,453
What is kimiko doing?

84
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,015
- Are you kidding me? Come on.
- Oh, hey, hey. Come on.

85
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,376
Come on. She's been suffering
the dreary sting of ennui, okay?

86
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,753
You give her some space.

87
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,490
- The prodigal son returns.
- What the fuck?

88
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,098
Hey, man.

89
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,476
Yeah, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you t... are you back?

90
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,602
We'll see.

91
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,522
Don't get me wrong,
I'm happy, but are-are you sure?

92
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,625
What the fuck happened here, kid?
You jacking off with razors again?

93
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,068
You know, you should see the other guy.
Other guy's my penis.

94
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,548
- I missed you, kid.
- I missed you, too, man.

95
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,782
Come on, man.

96
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,055
Look, I know what
you're gonna say, and I just...

97
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,289
No, no, mate. I'm just chuffed

98
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,625
to have all the boys back
under the same roof, all right?

99
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,752
- Really?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,507
I mean, there he was, right?
In his fancy pants,

101
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,302
lording it over us
like the viceroy of vought square, eh?

102
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,429
And that whole time, he weren't nothing

103
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,223
- but a supe's bootlick, eh?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,493
That, my son, is a lifetime achievement

105
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:53,061
- at the cunt of the year awards, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

106
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,272
It is a lifetime achievement.

107
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,606
- Are you done?
- No, mate,

108
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,441
I am just getting started, believe you me.

109
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,236
Great, listen, we need to get
Ryan somewhere safe.

110
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,738
Vicky knows where he is,
because we fucking told her,

111
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,198
which means Stan Edgar knows, too.

112
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,408
Yeah, one step ahead.

113
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,251
Colonel's already
done a runner with the boy.

114
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,995
They're well out of sight.

115
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,206
In fact, we were gonna
pay them a little visit.

116
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,499
We are?

117
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,335
Uh, monsieur charcutier, uh, I cannot go.

118
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,088
- I have a matter of great importance.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

119
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,757
I must've forgot to run it
by your bleeding secretary.

120
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,802
- It's an emergency.
- I-I'll go instead.

121
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,888
Nah, you skive off today,

122
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,515
and that congresswoman
might split your pretty little buns.

123
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:31,892
Yeah, thought of that.

124
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,602
Uh, kimiko.

125
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,646
Kimiko? Hi.

126
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,609
Uh, can you please... uh, break my arm?

127
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,069
Vicky will smell it if I fake being sick,

128
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:47,699
so it's got to be real,
and it's got to last for days.

129
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,869
Fucking hell, hughie.

130
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,663
At least take something
for the pain. I got opium.

131
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,083
Government employees
can't fail a piss test.

132
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,668
Let's just get this over with, okay?

133
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,587
Just do it pretty fast.

134
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,049
H-Hold, hold, hold up.

135
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,843
Have a seat, please.

136
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,846
Only been here three minutes,
and it's already the bold and the batshit.

137
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,265
All right. Go ahead.

138
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,936
Okay.

139
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,563
Right here. Clean break.
No permanent damage.

140
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,152
Yeah?

141
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,907
One, two...

142
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,787
What the shit?

143
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,039
I'm the first super in a hijab, aren't I?

144
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,584
So if! Can get myself
into the seven, lit, man.

145
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,586
So, we're thinking slot one
goes to supersonic.

146
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,672
For girls 11 to 14,
he's a real panty—dropper.

147
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,466
That's horrifying.
Please never say that again.

148
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,593
He's also a slam dunk
for the latinx market.

149
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,179
We are desperate to get
into central and South America.

150
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,324
Did you know that salsa
is more popular than ketchup?

151
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,559
Is supersonic an ambitious
second-generation Mexican American

152
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,979
chasing his lifelong suefio
ofjoining the seven?

153
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,899
Or is he chasing
a rekindled pas/on with starlight?

154
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,903
Okay, you do know
that I have a boyfriend, right?

155
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:09,489
Love triangles, they generate a 47% surge
in trending topics on social platforms.

156
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,409
Fans will ship the fuck out of you.

157
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,537
Let me talk to him first.

158
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,664
Amazing. Uh, what do you think
of our second choice?

159
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,207
- Moonshadow.
- She's body positive

160
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,376
- but not too body positive.
- Still fuckable.

161
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,836
So fuckable.

162
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,212
No one asked you, Ashley.

163
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,338
Sorry, Ashley.

164
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,216
Okay, that's also horrifying,

165
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,136
but I'm thinking silver Kincaid.

166
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,847
But she's, uh...

167
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,057
She's from Afghan...

168
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,726
- She's from england.
- Istan?

169
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,812
And she has the highest rescue stats
of any of the finalists,

170
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,897
and she's a unicef ambassador.

171
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,316
She's the most qualified.

172
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,694
Well, we're gonna have to run
all of this past homelander,

173
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,112
- of course.
- Of course.

174
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,740
Actually, according to my contract
with Mr. Edgar,

175
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,409
I get final say over the two slots.

176
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,955
So, why don't you run that
past homelander, hmm?

177
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,553
Bonjour, cherie.

178
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,680
Did you bring the passports?

179
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,399
Hey.

180
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,027
What is wrong?

181
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,529
Serge, I fucked up.

182
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,785
I went back to work for little Nina.

183
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,121
Merde, cherie.

184
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,624
Some of us can't get cushy jobs
at the CIA.

185
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,627
I was moving weight for her,

186
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,088
and these fucking assholes boosted it.

187
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,756
Can you find them?

188
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,674
They wore masks.
I don't know who they were.

189
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,636
And I was high.

190
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,143
Okay. How much?

191
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,187
Eleven kilos.

192
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,943
We pay her back.
We pay her back. We beg...

193
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,195
No, you know it's the principle
of the thing with Nina.

194
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,114
You remember Olivier?

195
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,036
How many pieces did she cutoff him
while he was still alive?

196
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,957
Come with me.

197
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,001
We can go some place warm.

198
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,672
Just you and me.

199
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,882
Huh?

200
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,431
Sorry.

201
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,188
Oh, Marvin. What are you doing here?

202
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,064
Poorjudgment, ma'am.

203
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,570
Butcher!

204
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,697
Hi.

205
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,781
Oh!

206
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,742
Oh, easy does it, lad.

207
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,410
Bloody death grip you got there.

208
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,623
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

209
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,832
Right as rain.

210
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,292
Come on in.

211
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,629
The fuck was that?

212
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,130
Didn't know he had it in him.

213
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,842
So, why did you come back?

214
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,681
Soldier boy killed my family.

215
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,188
Are you sure
this place is secure?

216
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,732
We'll have to keep moving,
but for now, yes.

217
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,485
The only thing that might give us away

218
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,529
is this clown show of yours
shambling onto my driveway.

219
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,743
Well, I wouldn't be here
if this was just a phone call.

220
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,629
Hey, Alex, just, um,
come here for a second.

221
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,926
Um, why are you playing my shitty song?

222
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,511
So he can't hear us.

223
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,014
They want to pick you
as one of the winners tonight.

224
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,391
J" I first saw you... j“

225
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,725
- are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,269
And you need to say no.

227
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,812
- What? Why?
- Okay, listen.

228
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,399
I really wish someone told me
what I'm about to tell you.

229
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,153
There's something wrong with homelander.

230
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:00,822
Something broken.

231
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,549
He's threatened to murder me
more than once.

232
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,243
He's murdered other people,
and it's only getting worse.

233
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,746
And you're just gonna be putting yourself
and your family in danger.

234
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,624
And pretty much the rest of them, too.
They're so fucking cruel.

235
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,210
Trust me, you don't want this.
Just say that you can't do it.

236
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,254
Say that your family
is having an emergency.

237
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,922
- Don't do it.
- Annie, Annie, stop.

238
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,549
You just told me that...

239
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,176
All the shit I swallowed for years...

240
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,989
I mean, the band, vought's racism,
it's all for, it's all for nothing, right?

241
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,490
- Look, I'm 30...
- Look, I need a second.

242
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,266
I'm really sorry, but, please,

243
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,560
you need to promise me that you will leave

244
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,104
and you'll never look back. Please.

245
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:37,150
J" kick off those uggs
and slide up next to me, all right j'

246
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,035
So they chauffeuring you around now, huh?

247
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,453
Like you Rihanna.

248
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,331
Never needed a license, always just ran.

249
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,500
- How'd you know I'd be here?
- I'm your brother.

250
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,878
And I still know a few people.

251
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,007
So... how bad is it?

252
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,552
Doctors say it's like playing
Russian roulette.

253
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,180
If I ever run again, maybe nothing,

254
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,474
but maybe my heart...

255
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,353
You still on that blue shit?

256
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,116
That shit'll probably kill me even faster.

257
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,982
Good. Then we can skip to the part
where I accept your apology

258
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,443
and you can come back to the crib with me.

259
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,779
Sure the boys would love to see you, man.

260
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,461
Butcher said you have powers.

261
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,676
Me, too.

262
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,598
Do you like yours?

263
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,355
Do you ever get scared of them?

264
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,823
Me, too.

265
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,411
Aunt grace wanted to get me a dog, but...

266
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,995
I told her no.

267
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,622
I was afraid I'd hurt it.

268
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,594
I'm sure you didn't mean it.

269
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,108
Yeah.

270
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,236
Me, too.

271
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:50,366
Neuman's head of the bureau
because I said so.

272
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,702
I tried to save her
from the attack on congress

273
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,245
that she fucking caused.

274
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,849
Well, at least you didn't spend
the last year getting her oat milk lattes

275
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,000
and every piece of intel she asked for.

276
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:03,212
I would very much like to know
the plan to eliminate her.

277
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:07,049
Well, that depends on what you can tell us

278
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,761
about your little holiday
down in Nicaragua.

279
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,682
- I've never been to Nicaragua.
- Really?

280
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,684
'Cause a little birdie told me

281
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,644
you were payback's
case officer down there,

282
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,605
on a classified job

283
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,733
that soldier boy never come back from.

284
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,195
Colonel?

285
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,864
Whatever it is William
thinks he may have heard,

286
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,450
he's mistaken.

287
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,289
Is he?

288
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,959
You know that safe
you got in your home office?

289
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,630
The one behind the picture
of bush number one?

290
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,507
Well, I borrowed a ledger from it,

291
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,676
the one with all your assets
around the world.

292
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,764
How long do you think them
and their families will last

293
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,475
when I put every one
of their fucking names on Facebook?

294
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,311
You'd sign the death warrants
of dozens of innocent people

295
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,687
who had nothing to do with this?

296
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,649
I'm embarrassed for the both of us
that you're asking.

297
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,238
Nicaragua's ancient history.

298
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,407
Not to mention I could be killed
just for telling you.

299
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,202
And all your agents
will get killed if you don't.

300
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,287
Blimey.

301
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,458
What a pickle.

302
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,842
It was part of operation charly.

303
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,514
Operation... charly?

304
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,058
Reagan's pet project, off the books.

305
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,562
Help the contra rebels fight
the Russian-backed sandinistas,

306
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,480
but we needed a way to pay for it.

307
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,234
Some of the cash
came from selling arms to Iran,

308
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,152
Oliver north's epic fuckup.

309
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,071
But the rest?

310
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,825
If there's one thing that the contras
had plenty of, it was cocaine.

311
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,120
I was in charge of trafficking
the coke into the us

312
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,206
and then using the profits
to buy more weapons.

313
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,127
In the fight against the reds,
whatever it took.

314
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,297
That's some self-justifying bullshit.

315
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,257
Were you part of that other thing, too?

316
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,800
What other thing?

317
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,093
She knows.

318
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,053
Tell him.

319
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,517
The unwritten policy

320
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,895
was to sell the cocaine strictly
to minority neighborhoods.

321
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:28,107
Destabilize, demoralize,
while staying out of white ones.

322
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,030
Late in '84, we were gearing up
for a major offensive,

323
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,199
so the higher-ups,
in their infinite wisdom,

324
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,763
decided it was the perfect time
to throw a wrench in the works.

325
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,295
J'herelamj'

326
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:54,342
j" rock you like a hurricane j'

327
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,471
j " my body is burning... j"

328
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,680
Fucking payback.

329
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,350
Each more ridiculous than the next.

330
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,518
Crimson countess, mindstorm,

331
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,979
swatto, the tnt twins,

332
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,939
noir, gunpowder,

333
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,359
and the most idiotic of them all...

334
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,986
What do you say, gunpowder?
Give them the fourth of July?

335
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,404
Let's light them up, soldier boy.

336
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,073
Please put that down.

337
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,827
Ah, well, didn't realize they made
case officers as pretty as you.

338
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,830
We're just having some fun.

339
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,042
Our munitions dump is in that direction.
You're about to blow up half the camp.

340
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,669
Put it down.

341
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,753
Now.

342
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,132
I do like the assertive type.

343
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,761
You know, with a figure like yours,
you are wasted down here.

344
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,139
J" here I am
rock you like a hurricane... j'

345
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,516
my humblest apologies.

346
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,978
I'm sure this is... disorienting.

347
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:51,065
Let's start over.
Officer grace Mallory, isn't it?

348
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,983
- Mmm.
- Stanford Edgar.

349
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,194
I'm an associate with vought American.

350
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,837
Do you want to explain what the fuck
this freak show's all about?

351
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,952
Vought American has entered
into a partnership with the us government

352
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,755
- in the global war against communism.
- Oh.

353
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:08,833
Payback will embed themselves
and fight alongside the contra rebels.

354
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,960
Think of it as a trial run.

355
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,503
A trial run for what?

356
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,339
Superheroes in the military, of course.

357
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,216
For the first time in over 30 years.

358
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,969
Just imagine how dominant we'd be.

359
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,596
Jesus Christ. Get down!

360
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,645
What's the problem?

361
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,647
The... problem

362
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,941
is that the enemy might spot
a fucking flying man

363
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,818
above the tree line and find our position.

364
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,069
She's right, swatto.

365
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,155
No flights without
officer Mallory's clearance.

366
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,116
Is this a joke?

367
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,492
Supes aren't soldiers.

368
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,495
They're undisciplined dipshits.
Untrained and untested.

369
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,080
They do not belong in a war zone.

370
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,582
They belong on that's incredible!

371
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,791
Tell that to soldier boy.

372
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,002
He's a living, breathing American hero.

373
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,920
I'm not allowing this.

374
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,882
I'm sure director Casey will address
any concerns you may have.

375
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:04,680
Oh, and, uh, we need a couple of your men
to fetch water for our tents.

376
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,224
Thank you so much.

377
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:15,900
Claudio.

378
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,988
Senorita, fuck the Yankees.

379
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,415
Will the others go along?

380
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,501
Everyone but gunpowder.

381
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,503
Good luck, earving.

382
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,714
Can you please stop
eating those in front of me. I'm allergic.

383
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,591
So, listen,

384
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,635
if I'm gonna take a more
central role on the team,

385
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,094
then I want to lose the mask.

386
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,889
Silent ninjas score extremely high
with boys seven to ten years old.

387
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,682
The mask lends a certain mystique.

388
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,142
Well, fuck mystique.

389
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,703
People don't even know
it's me under this thing.

390
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,038
I got to wear it just to get a cab.

391
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,147
Payback is the country's
premier superhero team.

392
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,315
The whole country.

393
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,958
Sadly, a black member's still a nonstarter
below the Mason-Dixon.

394
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,654
Well, I could be bigger than that.
I could be Eddie Murphy.

395
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,285
I'm not wearing the mask.

396
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,871
Your choice.

397
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,166
Though, once you're farmed out
to Minneapolis-St. Paul,

398
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,709
you'll want the mask

399
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,629
simply for... warmth.

400
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,969
You should smile more.

401
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,515
- I bet it's a beautiful smile.
- Okay, look,

402
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,851
as an ambassador
from planet actual woman,

403
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,644
I just... I got to tell you,

404
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,205
I know that you think
these lines work, but...

405
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,314
Oh, they do. Just ask loni Anderson.

406
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,108
They don't, and they never have.

407
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,444
The women are either humoring you,
or they're scared of you,

408
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,197
but none of them like you.

409
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,619
You know, if you were a little nicer,
maybe you'd find a man,

410
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,290
instead of out here playing captain lesbo.

411
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,084
Hey, senorita Mallory...

412
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,004
Hold that thought.

413
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,349
What the hell is going on with him?

414
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,019
Ah.

415
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,228
- There she is.
- You mind?

416
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,789
- I'm just grabbing a bite... to eat.
- Nope.

417
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,441
I do not mind at all. So...

418
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:24,445
Ashley tells me
that you chose silver kinca...

419
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:25,905
- Kincaid.
- Mm-hmm.

420
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,198
- I have notes.
- Mm-hmm.

421
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,700
I mean, I'm a cocaptain.

422
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,952
It's only fair I have a say
in the new recruits, right?

423
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,122
No, actually, I choose the new members.

424
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,167
But I am pitching the craziest twist.

425
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,961
The audience will never
see it coming, right?

426
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,630
Well, I've made my decision.

427
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,049
Oh, come on.
You haven't even heard it yet.

428
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,932
Seriously, you're-you're
gonna love it. Ready?

429
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,262
Return of the deep.

430
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,139
- Hey.
- _ Hey.

431
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,475
What's up, guys? How are you?

432
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,978
No, no, no, no, starlight,
before you say anything,

433
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,023
doesn't Christ tell us
to turn the other cheek?

434
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,363
I really want us to be sisters.

435
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,489
Mmm.

436
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,699
I had something
made for you, starlight.

437
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,576
It's a peace offering.

438
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,328
It's 24-karat gold

439
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,039
with certified conflict-free diamonds.

440
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,165
I've put in the work,

441
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,335
and I realize that when you've
made an unforgivable mistake,

442
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,922
the first person you have to forgive
is yourself.

443
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:33,639
What makes you think
that I want a daily reminder

444
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,433
of the guy who fucking mouth-raped me?

445
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,020
I need a word.

446
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,731
Let's let these two chat, shall we?

447
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,525
Okay. I'll just...

448
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,030
Absolutely not.

449
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,158
Do you really think I'm gonna let
a fucking Muslim in the seven?

450
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:55,703
Captain ai-qaeda? We're Americans.

451
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,622
- I'm taking this to Mr. Edgar.
- My speech last night?

452
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,333
38.6 rating and a 59 share.

453
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,919
Oh, and they're saying
that the live-plus-threes

454
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,671
are gonna be even bigger.

455
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,383
Edgar said it himself,
popularity is power.

456
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,176
He won't die on this hill.

457
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:19,518
Do I need to remind you
of the flight 37 video?

458
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,583
Go ahead. Release it.

459
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,003
Let's light this candle, huh?

460
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:49,089
I mean, sure, I'll lose everything,
but then...

461
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,009
I'll have nothing to lose.

462
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,139
First, I'll take out the nerve centers...

463
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,641
White house, Pentagon,

464
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,686
then any domestic defense capabilities,

465
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,897
and then critical infrastructure...

466
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,941
Like cellular, Internet,
that kind of thing.

467
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,486
And then...

468
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,363
Well, I think then...

469
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,284
I'll just wipe New York
off the fucking map...

470
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,536
For fun.

471
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,164
I'll even throw in des moines

472
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:26,376
and that little cousin-fucker hick town
that Maeve's from, 'cause why not?

473
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:31,799
See, starlight, I'd prefer to be loved.

474
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,969
I would, but if you
take that away from me,

475
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:42,017
well, being feared
is a-one okey doke by me.

476
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,690
Go ahead, partner.

477
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,361
Do it.

478
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,621
You don't want to do it?

479
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,582
Well, then I would have to say

480
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,210
that you have absolutely
no fucking leverage

481
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,922
because I am the homelander.

482
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,510
And I really can do
whatever the fuck I want.

483
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:24,726
Okay.

484
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,564
- Okay, so tomorrow...
- Uh-huh.

485
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,649
You have the
"recontextualizing feminism" panel

486
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,192
with Rose mcgowan and Alyssa Milano.

487
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,443
Ooh, I love charmed.

488
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,279
- Hey, babe, I'm serious.
- Yeah?

489
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,739
We need to cover your ass...

490
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,592
In case that bitch starlight
comes after you again.

491
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,952
Thanks, babe. I couldn't
have done this without you.

492
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,996
You're telling me.

493
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,834
Yeah.

494
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,228
Oh, yeah?

495
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,939
- Yeah, you like that?
- Oh, fuck yeah.

496
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,107
Oh, yeah.

497
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,234
Oh, god.

498
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,070
- You're so fucking wet.
- Oh, it's all you, baby. It's all you.

499
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,614
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

500
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,990
What are you gonna do?

501
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,742
Gonna jerk me off with all your arms?

502
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,035
All my arms?

503
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,661
Yeah.

504
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,607
Butcher, are you okay?

505
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,860
Yeah, mate. It's all good.
Just give us a minute, yeah?

506
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,196
Do you need any help?

507
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,406
Don't come in.

508
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,958
- Hey, Annie.
- Homelander's had a breakdown.

509
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,168
He's lost his fucking mind.

510
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,420
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Slow down, slow down. What?

511
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,298
He's bringing the deep
back into the seven,

512
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,260
so I brought up the video,
and he said to go ahead

513
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,053
and release it. You were right.

514
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,013
Cocaptain was a bad idea.

515
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,348
I have to leave.

516
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,160
Look, I-I know I should tell you
to run out of there like a house on fire,

517
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,519
and I want to...

518
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,022
But you got to stick it out.

519
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,237
Listen, I'm-i'm-I'm back with butcher.

520
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,656
Why?

521
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,700
We're onto something
that could kill homelander.

522
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,202
What? What is it?

523
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,037
Some kind of weapon. Uh...

524
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,890
I'm not sure,
but you got to buy us some time.

525
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,291
Keep your eyes on him.

526
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,625
How much time?

527
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,588
You don't know.

528
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,966
So, for god knows how long,

529
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,926
I have to paste on a smile,

530
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,679
with homelander growing more unstable

531
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,222
by the hour,

532
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,641
hoping that he doesn't kill me or worse.

533
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,856
If that's what it takes, then yeah.

534
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,363
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just...

535
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,325
Homelander and-and Vicky,
they-they're running laps around us

536
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,702
because... because we keep tlying
to do it the right way.

537
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,287
The high road just doesn't work.

538
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,999
W-We have to be as mean
and fucked-up as they are.

539
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,893
- Now you sound like...
- Like butcher, I know,

540
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,337
but, Annie, he's... he's right.

541
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,546
He's been right all along.

542
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,466
I'm just so tired of losing.

543
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:47,888
Okay.

544
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,057
You better pull this off, hughie, but...

545
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,892
Okay.

546
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,069
I used to destroy you in slapsies.

547
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,362
You had super speed.

548
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,281
Khamari.

549
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,700
Put another hand on your brother,
you see what happens.

550
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,827
Hey, uncle reg, what's up with that suit?

551
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,704
- Oh, you like it, huh?
- That shit's corny.

552
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,165
Hey, khamari, that's not
how you talk to your uncle.

553
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,517
Nah, it's-it's all right.

554
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,293
Young men just don't understand
the history.

555
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,812
Oh, no, the suit's ridiculous.

556
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,963
But he shouldn't be using
that kind of language.

557
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,591
All right, inside. Both y'all.

558
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,218
All right? And wash your hands.

559
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,469
For real this time.

560
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,056
I didn't want to say nothing, but...

561
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:34,601
Just trying to show the community
I'm down for the cause.

562
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,562
Since when you been
down with any cause?

563
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,065
Come on, man.

564
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,275
I mean, I can't run, I can't do shit.

565
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,362
So I got to rebrand.
Stay in the game somehow.

566
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:49,199
Or you don't. You could just be
my pain-in-the-ass little brother reg.

567
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,451
Yeah.

568
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,037
Let me tell you, man,
I'm happier coaching these kids

569
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,415
than I ever was working at vought.

570
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,459
You should come down to the track.

571
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,836
They'd love to see you.

572
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,755
Yeah.

573
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,800
Okay.

574
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,596
Since you want to be down
with the cause so much...

575
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,725
I was walking home,
and this mugger came up behind me.

576
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,978
I was terrified.

577
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,206
And that's when
Dana whitmyre says blue hawk

578
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,440
came [0 her rescue.

579
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,525
At approximately 7:15 pm,

580
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,485
I spotted a black male
following the victim

581
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:27,404
southbound on marin boulevard.

582
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,990
I intercepted him, at which point

583
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,284
the suspect became aggressive.

584
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,873
Brother lived a few houses up the street.

585
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:39,583
Three kids.

586
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,960
He was just walking home from work.

587
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,423
Blue hawk curb-stomped him so hard,
it cracked the pavement.

588
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,342
- That's fucked-up.
- Yeah.

589
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,265
Maybe I can throw his family
some cash or something.

590
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,017
They don't need a handout.

591
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,477
They need you to speak up.

592
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,270
You're in the motherfucking seven.

593
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,856
Yeah, but, I mean...

594
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,276
I... listen, I'm Michael Jordan.

595
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,320
I'm not Malcolm X.

596
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,158
Everybody loves the a-train, right?

597
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,712
Sergei.

598
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,758
- Nina wants to see you.
- Yevgenny.

599
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,176
How's your wife?

600
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,222
She still enjoy getting
her salad tossed by a frenchman

601
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,224
while her husband tosses nothing?

602
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,061
Another time.

603
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,614
Get in.

604
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,994
[Grunting, breathing sharpm

605
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,205
Come on. Fucking knock it off.

606
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,985
All right, mate?

607
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,781
- Are you sick?
- No, no.

608
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,576
I had a dodgy kebab, didn't I?

609
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,035
Went straight through me.

610
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,537
Try these.

611
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,706
Well, I'll be.

612
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,419
Your mum used to give me these
when I was under the weather.

613
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,296
Same.

614
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,383
- I hated them.
- I used to crush them up

615
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,802
and put them in the bird feeder
when she wasn't looking.

616
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,304
Well, I don't blame you.

617
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,681
They done off leave your mouth
drier than a nun's...

618
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,144
You were gonna say "vagina."

619
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,022
Yeah. Something like that.

620
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,072
It's not just your stomach, though.

621
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,241
Your heart's racing. I can hear it.

622
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,453
And your blood smells funny, too.

623
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,125
Don't you worry, son.

624
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,794
Nothing a good night's kip won't sort.

625
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,387
Sorry about that.

626
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,056
What the hell did you drink last night?

627
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:44,976
Right.

628
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,729
Where were we?

629
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:49,898
To the surprise of no one,

630
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,233
that moron swatto
went for another joy flight,

631
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,693
giving away our position.

632
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:57,572
Even better, the sandinistas
brought Russian special forces with them.

633
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,866
Though that didn't matter much
to the supes.

634
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,704
Those are my men!

635
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,215
You, stay with me! Go!

636
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,222
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

637
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,543
Oh, yeah!

638
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:59,968
Gunpowder! Will you please fucking stop?

639
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,897
[Yeldsi

640
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,062
Oh, god.

641
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,480
They killed soldier boy.

642
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,398
- What? Who?
- The Russians.

643
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,944
They had some kind of gun
or-or weapon or something.

644
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,529
- That's impossible.
- No!

645
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:45,573
We saw it. We saw it.

646
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,033
They took his body.

647
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,215
I lost 116 men.

648
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,092
And vought got full immunity.

649
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,804
That was the day
I decided to make them pay.

650
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,099
Well, ain't that a wonderful story.

651
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,726
Tell me, grace,

652
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,271
where did the ivans take this...

653
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,815
Supe gun?

654
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,609
The trail went cold
behind the iron curtain.

655
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,152
It's the truth.

656
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,154
My reach only goes so far.

657
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,491
You knew what soldier boy did
to my family,

658
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,787
but you didn't think
I needed to know the truth?

659
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,248
It wasn't that simple.

660
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,507
Marvin, Hugh, give us the room.

661
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,368
You came to me after Becca disappeared

662
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,662
and promised me homelander's head.

663
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:15,997
And all this time,

664
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,000
you knew there was something
that could do the job,

665
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,002
and you never said a fucking word.

666
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,754
Whatever this weapon is,

667
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,340
it probably won't work on homelander.

668
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,775
- And what if it does?
- Even worse.

669
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,426
Because it wouldn't end with him.

670
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,971
You'd go after another supe,
then another, then all of them.

671
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,655
If you'd have told me about this sooner,

672
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,725
homelander might already be dead.

673
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,479
Ryan wouldn't be running
from one safe house to the next,

674
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,982
wondering when his nutter dad's
gonna drop out of the sky.

675
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,485
And Becca...

676
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,573
Becca might still be alive.

677
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,203
And for that...

678
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,333
I'll never fucking forgive you.

679
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,753
This was never about Ryan or Becca.

680
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,089
It was always selfish.

681
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,091
Always and only for you.

682
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:11,219
For the hate inside
that you want to let loose on the world.

683
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:15,139
I thought maybe you changed,
but I was wrong.

684
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,141
You are your father.

685
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,769
Always have been.

686
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,650
- What happened?
- We're off.

687
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,821
Butcher, wait up.
Where-where are you going?

688
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,198
- The city.
- When will I see you again?

689
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,783
You won't. Ain't safe for you.

690
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,076
Wait!

691
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,830
- What are you talking about?
- I got to go.

692
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:45,837
- Ryan, let go.
- No.

693
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,839
You said you'd always watch out for me.

694
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,717
- You promised!
- Ryan, let go.

695
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,200
- I won't let you!
- Well, maybe I don't want to look at you.

696
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,723
After what you done to my Becca.
Did you ever think about that?

697
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,286
I hate you.

698
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,120
Sorry if yevgenny got a little rough.

699
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,498
He's still a bit bitter
you ate his wife's anus.

700
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,299
Why am I here, Nina?

701
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,345
Do you remember mikhail Petrov?

702
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,889
You wait for him to come home.
He step out of his minivan.

703
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,475
You attack. He knocks the blade
from your hand,

704
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:26,312
so you slam this Honda odyssey
minivan sliding doors

705
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,980
on his neck over and over

706
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,691
until he's...

707
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,068
Decapitated.

708
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,987
Art. Who can define it?

709
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,033
Then you discovered his young bride
in the passenger seat,

710
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:42,745
and my Sergei
does not leave a witness behind.

711
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,625
Where is cherie?

712
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,378
I don't know.

713
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,301
She had a place in bayonne

714
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,595
last time I saw her.

715
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,347
Why?

716
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,563
'Cause nobody stole heroin from her.

717
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,525
She stole it from me.

718
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:18,489
I will give her a quick death, pazhalsta,

719
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,075
and I will make this worth your while.

720
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,830
I don't do that shit anymore.

721
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,544
Nobody changes, hmm?

722
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,380
What was your safe word again?

723
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:38,092
When I used the dog collar
and the strap-on? What was it?

724
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,095
Vincent cassel.

725
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,269
You are like rabid little doggy

726
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,605
but loyal to whoever holds this chain.

727
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,400
Before William butcher, it was me.

728
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,278
Before me, it was your daddy.

729
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,824
But you always heel, Sergei.

730
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,620
Not Sergei.

731
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:07,997
Serge.

732
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,209
And that was a long time ago.

733
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:15,046
Who I am now is someone
who works for the CIA, Nina.

734
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,342
So unless you want the full weight
of the government up your ass...

735
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,137
I'm leaving.

736
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:28,643
We both have had bigger things
than the government up our asses.

737
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,320
Just think about my offer.

738
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,866
Go on, scamper away, little doggy.

739
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,254
- Deep, welcome home, brother.
- Hear! Hear!

740
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,964
Oh, thanks, homelander.

741
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,275
This literally means everything to me.

742
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,634
- To us.
- To us.

743
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,177
Ah! Here we are.

744
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,679
- Ooh.
- Excellent.

745
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,974
Okay, so, I took the Liberty
of ordering for all of us,

746
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,851
but I'm pretty sure
you're gonna love my selection. Okay?

747
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,688
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Yes, sir.

748
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,443
Mmm.

749
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,153
Could I just get some... some bread?

750
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,738
Come on, now.

751
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,658
You're back in the big leagues, buddy.

752
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,451
Nothing but the best for you.

753
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,086
I'm so hungry.

754
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,592
Know who
I've been reading up on lately?

755
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,762
Dr. Martin Luther King.

756
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:52,059
Well, my relationship with king
has deepened of late.

757
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,687
He was, uh, villainized.

758
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,274
Persecuted. Spoke truth to power.

759
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,734
Just like me. It's crazy. But...

760
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,653
We've both been to the mountaintop,

761
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:05,072
and we've seen the promised land.

762
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:10,578
I showed people the real me,
and they loved me for it.

763
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,417
I mean, they fucking loved me.

764
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,463
If only I'd known that sooner.

765
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,885
There's always been
so, so many things I want to do,

766
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,803
and now I can do them all, finally.

767
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:31,557
And no one can stop me.

768
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,226
Nobody.

769
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,398
Free at last.

770
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,276
Free at last.

771
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,112
Oh! Excellent.

772
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:49,283
- Deep, that's for you, big guy.
- Me?

773
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,411
- Thank you, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

774
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,747
Wonderful.

775
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,457
Chef's specialty.

776
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,418
It is a South Korean delicacy.

777
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,838
Holy shit, it's Timothy.

778
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:04,507
Oh, my god.

779
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,884
That's timoth... he's my friend.

780
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,637
I, uh, I can't eat him.
I'm not gonna eat him. I can't...

781
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,573
- Oh, yes, you can, deep.
- No, I'm not gonna...

782
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,725
Timothy is fucking delicious.

783
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,356
He's-he's-he's begging for his life.

784
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,608
He has kids.

785
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,862
He has kids.

786
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,331
- Hey, deep?
- What?

787
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,166
Eat fucking Timothy.

788
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,983
I'm so sorry.

789
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,577
He's praying. He's praying.

790
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,872
Mmm.

791
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,724
Wasn't that delicious?

792
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,691
Come on.

793
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,714
Monsieur charcutier?

794
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,555
You work for him, too.

795
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,700
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

796
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,798
All right, let's have it.

797
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,550
Where the fuck you been all day?

798
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,347
I was, uh, detained by little Nina.

799
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,103
Little Nina?

800
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,483
And what does that Russian slag
want with you?

801
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,860
It's a long story.

802
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,237
Hang about.

803
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:17,116
This is a fucking gold mine, frenchie.

804
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,453
Set up a meeting
with you, me and little Nina.

805
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:24,623
No, no, no. This is a very,
is a very bad idea.

806
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,792
No, frenchie,
it's a very fucking good idea.

807
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,003
Go on. Get on the phone,

808
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,089
give her a call right now.

809
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,097
Oui, monsieur.

810
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,891
And what are we doing this for?

811
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,230
'Cause, my son, we're going to Russia.

812
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,282
- Hey. Do you have a sec?
- Hey. Hey.

813
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,783
Yeah, yeah. Come in.

814
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,327
Thanks. Um...

815
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:03,829
So I went to talk to the producers,

816
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,998
to tell them that I had a family emergency

817
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,207
and I have to bow out.

818
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,378
Good. That's... that's really good.

819
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,965
But, uh, you know, when I got there, I...

820
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,344
I told them I was thrilled
to join the team.

821
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:21,555
No. Alex, Alex, that's... that's a mistake.

822
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,600
I was in rehab, would've
killed my mother for some oxy.

823
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,644
Manager bailed on me, vought, everyone.

824
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,688
But you didn't leave.

825
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,193
So do you really think
I'm gonna bail on you now?

826
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:38,614
I'm an asshole, but I'm not
that much of an asshole.

827
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,035
Are you sure?

828
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,706
Someone's got to have your back.

829
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,642
Come on, then.

830
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,187
Let's hear it.

831
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,943
I'm a fucking monster
for what I done to the kid.

832
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,037
The others don't get it, but I-I do.

833
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,249
The gloves are off.

834
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,838
If there's anything that I've learned...

835
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,018
What the fuck?

836
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:58,318
Well, this has been
quite a long road for all of you.

837
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,363
You've shown us the best
of what heroes can be.

838
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,824
The first of the two selections,

839
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:09,079
and the newest member of the seven is...

840
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,290
Supersonic.

841
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,792
J" you can be my favorite girl j'

842
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:15,836
j" and you can rock my world j“

843
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,464
j” I never felt like this... j'

844
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:19,798
thank you.

845
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,134
Welcome.

846
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,594
Thank you, sir.

847
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,476
J" rock my kiss j“

848
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,103
well... this is it.

849
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:37,107
The final new member of the seven is...

850
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,866
Lord of the seven seas, the deep.

851
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,140
- Get up here, you.
- All right.

852
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:53,457
Welcome back.

853
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,877
Thank you, sir.

854
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,504
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

855
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,422
- Congratulations, bro.
- You, too.

856
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,509
All right, well, unfortunately,
it won't be either of you two.

857
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:06,220
I'm sure you understand,
you just can't put a price on experience.

858
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,472
Please hang up your capes and go.

859
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:13,352
Now, deep, I got to say, I am, uh...

860
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,395
Well, frankly, I'm moved and inspired

861
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,898
that starlight here
has chosen to forgive you.

862
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,942
I accept your apology, deep.

863
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,027
You deserve a second chance.

864
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,613
Thank you, starlight.
Looks like we've all grown.

865
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,906
Just to be clear,

866
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,075
it wasn't my idea
to bring you back, buster.

867
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,494
Not at all. Starlight here insisted on it.

868
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,371
But you keep your distance, pal,

869
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,414
because, uh, well...

870
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,918
She's my girl now.

871
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,799
Sorry, I-I can't keep it a secret anymore.

872
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,425
It's time we let the world know.

873
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:49,513
Starlight and I are in love.

874
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,475
#homelight.

875
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,894
- Cut! Incredible.
- Huh?

876
00:55:55,978 --> 00:55:57,247
- That fucking plays, man.
- Oh, my god!

877
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,689
That plays like hell.

878
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,625
- That was perfect. Yeah, yeah.
- People are gonna love it.

879
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:03,235
Incredible! Yes!

880
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,046
Okay, that was perfect, uh,

881
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:08,031
but, starlight,
I need you to be not so shocked.

882
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,826
All right, well,
uh, let's go again.

883
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,078
Starlight?

884
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,080
We good?

885
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,000
We ready?

886
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,920
Yeah. Let's, uh, let's go again.

887
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,648
- Okay. Going again.
- Yeah, one more. Great.

888
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:25,841
Uh, take it
from your line, homelander.

889
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,051
You got it. All right.

890
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:31,054
- That a girl.
- And... action.

891
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,141
I just can't
keep it a secret anymore.

892
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,351
- Hmm.
- Come on, it's time we let the world know.

893
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,062
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

894
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,690
Um, everybody,

895
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,153
starlight and I are in love.

896
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:49,698
#homelight.

00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,204
