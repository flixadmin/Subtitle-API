1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,600
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,760
That's for Reggie. Now I don't know
what you want with Master Bruce.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,840
But I'm certain

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,360
that his life's gonna be damn
slight better without you in it.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,160
I would be honored if you would
consider endorsing me for Mayor.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,840
If you can give me your word,
we won't have to face it alone.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,360
You'll have my endorsement.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,160
It's been sometime
since I had a meal like this.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,480
You should come over more often.

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,480
- We can, like, hangout or whatever.
- I'd like that.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,320
Let go of me you freak.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,600
Listen to me!

13
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,880
I did it for you.

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,640
Kristen.

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,960
And I've been following the goings on
at Wayne Enterprises.

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,480
- What have you learned?
- That your father was a good man

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,960
and in spite of that bad things
happen at this company.

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,800
You were looking
for Penguin's mother, weren't you?

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,800
I have to obey him in all things.

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,040
Penguin has brain washed
this poor soul.

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,640
Can we help?

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,960
I'll leave you two to it.

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,960
Father Creal.

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,920
- You have the Wayne boy?
- Not yet. But soon.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,040
- I found your mother.
- Where?

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
In a warehouse, down by the port.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,760
You're sure this is it?

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,720
I'm sure, boss.

29
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,840
Once my mother is safe,
we go after Galavan and his sister.

30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,880
They're going to pay for what
they've done.

31
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,040
Mother?

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
Mother!

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
You're okay.

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,600
Thank God.

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,960
Oswald?

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,720
Is that really you?

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Your sweet face.

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,960
Like a vision.

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,640
I'm taking you home.

40
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,600
Okay?

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,840
No, no, no.

42
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,840
And there I was thinking

43
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,160
you understood
the meaning of consequences.

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,000
Consequences, yes.

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,000
I assure you that my understanding
of consequences

46
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,360
will be made quite clear
once my mother is outside.

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,360
But we've had so much fun together.

48
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,840
My sister gets attached
to her playthings,

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,640
so I must insist she stay.

50
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,000
And those bolt cutters, useless.

51
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,520
The only way out of there...

52
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,520
is with this.

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Very well. Butch?

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,040
Shoot them both in the head
and grab the key.

55
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,040
- Oswald!
- Mother, I'm sorry.

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,920
But what they've done to you
will not stand!

57
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,720
I gave you an order!

58
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,080
Shoot them both in the head!

59
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,960
No.

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,560
No, no, no. That's not possible.

61
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,400
You have to obey me.

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,600
You have to!

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,040
That time has passed.

64
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
They fixed me.

65
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,920
Tabi is well versed in the protocols
of conditioning.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,800
There's always a trigger word
implanted during the process.

67
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,440
All I had to do is get Butch
to remember what it is.

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,240
I'll admit, it took a few tries.

69
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,680
And now...

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,480
here we are.

71
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,120
Please.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,720
I can still be valuable.

73
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,320
You'll see.

74
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,360
I so wish that were true.

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,520
Then kill me
if you must but let her go.

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,440
I'm begging you.

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,440
Doesn't look like begging to me.

78
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,240
Indeed. Half-hearted at best.

79
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,480
Please.

80
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,040
I'll do anything.

81
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,880
Perhaps she has served a purpose.

82
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,240
Don't pout.
You still have the former Mayor.

83
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,960
He's so dull.
He just moans all the time.

84
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,040
I told you everything would be okay.

85
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Didn't I?

86
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,920
And it will be.

87
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,960
No!

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,720
Oswald?

89
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,080
What is wrong?

90
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,640
You look so sad.

91
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
Nothing's wrong, mother.

92
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,440
Nothing at all.

93
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,920
We're together now.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,400
That's all that matters.

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,080
That's all that's ever mattered.
Right?

96
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,720
Ever since, you were a little baby.

97
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,560
My little Cobblepot.

98
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,160
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,200
This is my fault.

100
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,280
Please forgive me. I'm so sorry.

101
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
For what?

102
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,240
You were always such a good boy.

103
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,440
No.

104
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
Kill him.

105
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,280
Dump the bodies...

106
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,000
anywhere.

107
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,360
You don't have the stomach
to kill me yourself?

108
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,760
No wonder your family
was run out of town.

109
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,400
You come from a long line of cowards!

110
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,560
Fine, fine.

111
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
Any last words?

112
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,280
Yes.

113
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,480
I am going to kill you.

114
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,680
You are a psychopath.

115
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,760
I am not the man you think I am.

116
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,600
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

117
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,680
Rise and shine.

118
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,560
{\an5}What are you doing here?

119
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,080
- I banished you for good.
- Almost.

120
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,120
{\an5}Love of a good woman and all that.

121
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,320
{\an5}Though we both know
how that turned out.

122
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,520
{\an5}Yikes.

123
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,160
{\an5}That was an accident.

124
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
{\an5}I'm not that man.

125
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,320
{\an5}I'm gonna make this right.

126
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,240
{\an5}See, I knew you'd wake up
all boo-hooey.

127
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,360
{\an5}You probably have half a mind
to turn yourself in.

128
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,080
{\an5}Luckily, I have the other half.

129
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,600
- Do you like magic tricks?
- What?

130
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,080
{\an5}Of course you like magic tricks,
after all, I do.

131
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,840
{\an5}Well, guess what?

132
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,440
{\an5}I can make a body disappear.

133
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,920
{\an5}Where is she?

134
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,080
{\an5}Where is Ms. Kringle's body?

135
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,080
{\an5}Open the envelope.

136
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,400
{\an5}<i>"I hid her body
while you were catching some Z's,</i>

for her initials down at the GCPD."</i>

138
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,280
You went to my work last night?

139
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,560
Well, technically, you did.

140
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,800
{\an5}I was just in the driver's seat,
so to speak.

141
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,920
{\an5}How?
You're a figment of my imagination.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,320
{\an5}A projection of impulse.

143
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,040
{\an5}Nothing more!

144
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,400
That is uncalled for.

145
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,560
Uncalled for?

146
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,400
You high-jacked my body
while I was asleep

147
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,720
and you stole my dead girlfriend!

148
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,040
{\an5}Okay, yes.

149
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,160
{\an5}It's true.

150
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,800
{\an5}But I'm doing this for your own good.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
{\an5}If I was you.
Which, again, I sort of am.

152
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
{\an5}I'd get cracking.

153
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,480
{\an5}You do want to find the body first,
right?

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,360
{\an5}When are we gonna unleash
a little hell?

166
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,960
{\an5}There'll be plenty of time
for unleashing hell and parties,

167
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,280
{\an5}once Bruce Wayne
has signed over his company

168
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,120
and met his unfortunate destiny.

169
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,680
Until then, I need focus.

170
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,560
Young Bruce has become fond of you.

171
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
His trust will be crucial
when the time comes.

172
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,640
I need you to ensure that no one else
is whispering in his ear

173
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,120
until I make my offer.

174
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,960
See this finger?

175
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,920
I've got little Bruce wrapped tight
around it.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,360
What a vixen you've become.

177
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,840
You make me very proud.

178
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,520
And we have Penguin to deal with.

179
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,640
- I'm on it.
- No.

180
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,200
I'm about to become mayor.

181
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,640
I'm gonna have an army
at my disposal.

182
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,840
Time to use it.

183
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,880
Looks like you backed
the right horse.

184
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,040
- You trust him?
- A Gotham politician?

185
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,400
About as far as I can throw him.

186
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,760
But if he gives the GCPD
what it needs, he's all right by me.

187
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,360
You know, Selina said Penguin was
behind the Wayne Enterprise fires.

188
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,760
So?

189
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,320
So first, he's going after Mayoral
candidates, next thing you know,

190
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,520
he's burning down buildings.

191
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,680
It doesn't make any sense.

192
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,960
Guy's an abacus of crazy.

193
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,000
Nothing he does surprises me.

194
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,960
What the hell happened?

195
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,280
Penguin.

196
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,200
He tried to kill our next Mayor.

197
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,480
Mr. Cobblepot knew that I was poised
to win the election today

198
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,240
and he came to me
seeking an alliance.

199
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,840
And you refused.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,360
I politely declined, yes.

201
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,560
So he stabbed you in the neck?

202
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,320
That seems like a pretty extreme
reaction. Even for Penguin.

203
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,960
We've been trying to build a case
against Penguin since I got here.

204
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,160
We assume that he's
behind the earlier attacks

205
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,840
on the other candidates as well.

206
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,480
And this is the second time
he's tried to kill me.

207
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,760
The man is a menace.

208
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,160
And one that I fully intend
to put behind bars.

209
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,320
I assume you have something for me?

210
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,520
Arrest warrant for Oswald Cobblepot,

211
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,040
as well as search and seizures on all
his properties and known associates.

212
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,400
Quite a list.

213
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
We'll get right on it.

214
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,440
- Anything else?
- Yes.

215
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,920
In light of recent events,

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,080
Judge Turnball has declared
a state of emergency

217
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,680
and granted the mayor's
office additional powers.

218
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,160
Meaning what, exactly?

219
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,480
The moment I'm sworn in,
I'm implementing a curfew

220
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,520
and I'm ordering your Strike Force
to begin door-to-door searches

221
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,800
until Mr. Cobblepot is apprehended.

222
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,000
You're talking about martial law.

223
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,840
We're talking about bringing
a dangerous fugitive to justice.

224
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,520
We'll be acting
within our legal rights.

225
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,000
- Am I right, Mr. Dent?
- Absolutely.

226
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,280
You'll have our full support, sir.

227
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Thank you, Captain.

228
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,800
Captain Barnes.

229
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,760
Detective Gordon?

230
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,200
You seem hesitant.

231
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,320
Cautious.

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,240
You, you told me we needed to use
every method at our disposal to go

233
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
after men like Penguin.

234
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,280
Men who don't play by the rules.

235
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,160
Desperate times
call for a strong measure.

236
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,360
I have no problem going after Penguin
with everything we've got

237
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,400
but if we start kicking down
the doors of average citizens

238
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,520
and policing through fear,
we're no better than he is.

239
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,000
People still need to trust us.

240
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,440
And they will.

241
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,920
Because at the end of the day
all people want is to feel safe.

242
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,360
Just remember, Detective.

243
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,640
You came to me.

244
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,280
Congrats Mr. Mayor.

245
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
<i>It is official.</i>

246
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
<i>Theo Galavan will be the Mayor
of Gotham.</i>

247
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,520
<i>A crowd has gathered outside
and the excitement is brimming.</i>

248
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,800
<i>And in just a moment we'll also be
talking to many of the supporters</i>

249
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,120
<i>that gave up their time
and effort to support...</i>

250
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,240
What do you have against
the front door?

251
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,680
Nothing.

252
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,920
It's the ape who opens it
who I could live without.

253
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,840
I haven't seen you in a month.

254
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,480
Selina, what are you doing here?

255
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,000
You wouldn't believe
the week I've had.

256
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,200
This friend of mine, Bridgit,
decided to build this fire suit...

257
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,520
- Selina.
- Some people just don't...

258
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,280
Whose is that?

259
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,320
Sorry.
I got lost on the way back from...

260
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,640
Hello?

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,440
Hi.

262
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,480
Silver St. Cloud,
this is my friend Selina.

263
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,760
Selina this is Silver.

264
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,720
Nice to meet you.

265
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,640
You too.

266
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Are you staying for lunch?

267
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,120
- No.
- Please say you are.

268
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,840
I just moved here
and don't know many people.

269
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,160
Bruce, go tell Alfred
to set another place for lunch.

270
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,280
Come on. It'll be fun! Go.

271
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Shoo.

272
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,280
While it's just us girls,
let me give you a little advice...

273
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,840
you come around here again.

274
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, that would be bad...

275
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,800
for you.

276
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,200
Who the hell are you?

277
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,840
I'm Bruce's friend.

278
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,040
His only friend.

279
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,920
And you're a piece of gutter trash.

280
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,760
Now tell me something, would anyone
miss you if one day you were just...

281
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,440
gone?

282
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,720
I didn't think so.

283
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,840
I told Alfred.

284
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,680
What are you guys talking about?

285
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Nothing.

286
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,080
Just girl stuff.

287
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,960
"You'll need a helping hand...

288
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,240
Look for her initials
down at the GCPD.

289
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,040
Look for her initials
down at the GCPD.

290
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,200
Look for her initials
down at the GCPD."

291
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,880
Kristen Kringle. K-K.

292
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,560
K-K. K-K...

293
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Come on.

294
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,080
Hey, Mike, can you give me
a hand with this?

295
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,640
Putting Penguin in the crosshairs
of the GCPD

296
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,160
will drive him underground.

297
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
We can't kill him
if we can't find him.

298
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,680
We won't have to find him.

299
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,600
He's going to deliver himself to us.

300
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,840
And why would he do that?

301
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,760
Penguin's rage will consume
his better judgment,

302
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,400
leaving him with an insatiable
craving for revenge.

303
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,760
All we have to do is keep him hungry
and invite him to dinner.

304
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,200
And then I get to kill him.

305
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,800
Yes, kitten.

306
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,680
Then you get to kill him.

307
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,280
<i>First, I want to thank this city</i>

308
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
<i>for the immense trust it
has placed in me.</i>

309
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,720
<i>I'm eager to get to work.</i>

310
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,760
<i>I'd also like to address
the recent attempt on my life</i>

311
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,760
<i>by the man known as Penguin.</i>

312
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,960
<i>It is true that he attacked me
and as of now, he is still at large.</i>

313
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,200
<i>Men such as Penguin
will no longer be tolerated.</i>

314
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,680
<i>These are men who scurry</i>

315
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,600
<i>from the light of decency
like cockroaches.</i>

316
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,440
<i>Men who not even a mother could love.</i>

317
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,160
He dies.

318
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,360
Tonight.

319
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,440
Yeah. Got it.

320
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,240
Gilzean's holed up
in a booze joint downtown.

321
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,840
- Penguin?
- And get this.

322
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,560
Word on the street is,
Gilzean's started his own crew.

323
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,520
Sounds like they had a falling out.

324
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,760
Maybe he's ready to talk.

325
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,240
Yeah.

326
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,160
Hey. I heard about what happened
to our new Mayor.

327
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,640
- Never a dull moment, huh?
- No kidding.

328
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,360
You left your keys again
this morning.

329
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,240
What's this one?

330
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
A key to my apartment.

331
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,520
- Oh?
- I'll be in the car.

332
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
What? It's just a key.

333
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,920
Yeah. I know.

334
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,440
Do you want a key to my place?

335
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,800
Not even a little bit.

336
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,440
Wait. Do you have a place?

337
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,560
I think so.

338
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,760
Sorry. Caught me off guard.

339
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,240
I guess I do spend most nights there.

340
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,520
Which I love.

341
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,920
What I don't love is hauling ass
out of bed at 2.00am

342
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,720
when you come home from a stakeout
smelling of chili dogs.

343
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,040
I love to watch you squirm.

344
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,760
I was not squirming.

345
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,880
Little squirm.

346
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,000
I had no idea we were entertaining
today, Master Bruce.

347
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,280
Anyone else popping by?

348
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,680
No. Thank you, Alfred.

349
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,280
This is marvelous, Alfred.

350
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,400
I fell in love with Lapsang souchong
when I lived in Fujian.

351
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,120
Driving through the Wuyi region,

352
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,440
all you could smell is the burning
cedar they use to smoke leaves.

353
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,000
Right, well technically
it's, pinewood, miss

354
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,800
but I appreciate the enthusiasm.

355
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,040
That smell really does slap you
in the face.

356
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,240
Doesn't it? Alfred.

357
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
So, Selina?

358
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Tell me about yourself.

359
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,280
Any family?

360
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,040
You're really buying her act?

361
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,680
I beg your pardon?

362
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,160
Let me ask you a question.

363
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,640
How long have you been
a two-faced slut?

364
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,600
- Selina!
- No seriously, what are you after?

365
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,800
It's the money, right?

366
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,800
I mean it's not his wacky sense
of humor.

367
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,000
- Think I should go.
- No wait.

368
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,320
Is that a tear?

369
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,280
You're good.

370
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,080
I'm sorry. Goodbye, Bruce.

371
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Silver.

372
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,560
What did you just do!

373
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,360
I know you're not the best judge of,
like, you know, people.

374
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,800
But that girl is bad news.

375
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,600
I just did you a favor.

376
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
I want you to leave.

377
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,120
Fine.

378
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,680
- Whatever.
- Maybe you're right.

379
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,840
Maybe I'm not the best judge
of people.

380
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,040
Because all this time
I thought you were my friend.

381
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,640
But clearly you have no idea
what that means.

382
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,480
<i>"I'm tired of hiding
and want to be free.</i>

383
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,080
<i>To locate her body
find the two things missing from me."</i>

384
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,520
Back of her head kind of looks funny.

385
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,520
It's like the top of a pencil.

386
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,520
Why are you doing this?

387
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,920
Because it's fun!

388
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,160
And it's good for you.

389
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,600
How is it good for me to be tortured?

390
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
To be driven insane?

391
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,640
I'm trying to show you who you are.

392
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,480
How have you not realized that yet?

393
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,800
Though, to be honest,

394
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,600
I'm surprised you haven't
figured out this riddle yet.

395
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,920
Should I have made it easier?

396
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,720
You could start
by using proper grammar.

397
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,560
A period at the end
of a sentence is standard...

398
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,600
<i>"Find the two things missing
from me."</i>

399
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,840
M period, E period.

400
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,080
Oh, God.

401
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,280
"M.E." Medical Examiner.

402
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,240
You didn't!

403
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,640
I did.

404
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,400
I say we wait and see
if someone can walk us inside,

405
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,960
try and keep things civil.

406
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,960
Did I tell you I was thinking
about getting a cat?

407
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
- What?
- Hey, how are you?

408
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,160
Why don't you get your head
in the game here?

409
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,840
Sorry. It's just...

410
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,920
Do you believe Galavan's story?

411
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,960
Questions like that are above my pay
grade and below my sense of wonder.

412
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,200
Penguin's a pragmatist.

413
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,120
Hitting Galavan
for refusing an alliance,

414
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,840
that doesn't get him anything
but heat.

415
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,880
So, what really happened, you think?

416
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,760
Few months ago, nobody knew
who Galavan was, right?

417
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,760
Now, all of a sudden, he's Mayor?

418
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,560
Doesn't happen by accident.

419
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,000
It takes planning.

420
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,320
And it takes help.

421
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,560
Guys like Galavan
are born on third base.

422
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,520
Stealing home
is practically a birthright.

423
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,480
Think about the timing.

424
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,560
He shows up just after Mayor James
disappears.

425
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
A massacre at the gala turns him
into a hero.

426
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,000
Penguin's assassination attempts
on mayoral candidates

427
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,680
launched his campaign.

428
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,440
Everything that's gone down
up to this point

429
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,600
you could argue was orchestrated.

430
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,720
Look, what you're talking
about is Machiavellian-level crazy

431
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,160
even by Gotham's standards.

432
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
Yeah.

433
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,960
Here's our door pass.

434
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,280
Yeah, so your mother tells you.

435
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,040
Yeah, his mama stopped talking
to me ages ago.

436
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,160
Finally.

437
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,320
- Hey, hey!
- I wouldn't.

438
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,920
- Come on.
- I really wouldn't.

439
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,080
That's a lot of firepower
there, Butch.

440
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,960
You expecting company?

441
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Neighborhood ain't
what it used to be, Jim.

442
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,200
Where's Penguin?

443
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,440
- How should I know?
- You're the boss's lap dog

444
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,040
and you don't know
where your owner is?

445
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,840
I ain't nobody's lap dog.

446
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,040
- Not anymore.
- Prove it.

447
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,040
Tell us why the hell Penguin
went after Galavan.

448
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,400
I ain't telling you anything
and unless you have a warrant

449
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,080
I'm gonna have to ask
you boys to leave.

450
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,480
Yeah, see the thing is,

451
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,800
our newly elected Mayor
kind of wants results on this.

452
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,800
So we drag you in, chances
are that's where you're gonna stay.

453
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,960
I'm here for Gilzean.

454
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,560
Anyone who leaves now, leaves alive.

455
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,240
Anyone who stays, dies.

456
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,920
You have 60 seconds to do the math.

457
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,200
Sorry, Butch.

458
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,040
Seriously?

459
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,200
No honor among scumbags, huh?

460
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,200
Hey, don't shoot. I'm out of here.

461
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,520
What are you doing?

462
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,400
You tell us what the hell
is going on with Penguin

463
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,000
or we leave you with Zsasz.

464
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
You can't do that.

465
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,160
- Bullock?
- We can totally do that!

466
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,040
Galavan was telling Penguin
what to do.

467
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,200
Knocking off the candidates.
Torching the buildings.

468
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,800
It all came down from Galavan.

469
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,600
Why the hell was Penguin
taking orders?

470
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,920
Kidnapped Penguin's mother.

471
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,160
He was keeping her for leverage.

472
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,520
Kidnapped?

473
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,720
Jim?

474
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,160
I think we need to go.

475
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,520
I didn't think Galavan would actually
go through with it...

476
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,080
Go through with what?

477
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,760
Go through with what?

478
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,000
GCPD!

479
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,200
Put down your weapons!

480
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,680
We're outmanned here
big time, partner.

481
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,880
Yeah.

482
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,440
But not outgunned.

483
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,680
Oh, hell, yeah.

484
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,200
<i>I'll take that as a no.</i>

485
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,920
<i>See you later, Butch.</i>

486
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,040
That's a new one.

487
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,600
You think he was telling the truth?

488
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,720
Nobody's telling the truth.

489
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,880
This is Gotham.

490
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,560
Bruce.

491
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
What a lovely surprise.

492
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,960
Hello, sir. I was looking for Silver.

493
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,120
She's here.

494
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,840
Seemed a bit upset when she came in.

495
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,320
Yes, sir. A friend of mine stopped
by the house while Silver was there.

496
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,000
- They...
- Say no more.

497
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
I was your age once.

498
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,880
Your feelings do you credit.

499
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,000
I never met your father

500
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,600
but it's clear that he instilled
in you a sound moral compass.

501
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,800
He did.

502
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,160
You know we're both very alike.

503
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,680
Born into wealth and privilege.

504
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,880
Yet forced to walk our lives alone.

505
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,000
Haunted by loss.

506
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,880
Driven to prove ourselves worthy
of those who came before.

507
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,320
Be careful, Bruce.

508
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,960
That way of thinking, the need
to fill the void, it can consume you.

509
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Does it ever go away?

510
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,200
No.

511
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,000
But you can find closure.

512
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,520
A way to move on without letting go.

513
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,680
How?

514
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,960
Well, I don't want
to make any promises

515
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,720
but when the time is right
we'll talk again.

516
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,920
I, need to get ready for the party.

517
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,080
Excuse me.

518
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,120
I knew you'd come.

519
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,240
No one is to kill Galavan but me.

520
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,840
- Understand?
- Boss, I got what you're feeling.

521
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,000
Mother's love, it's the most
beautiful, most simple...

522
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,880
Gabe!

523
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,880
Cops aren't gonna let you
within a 100 feet of Galavan.

524
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,560
Let us whack him for you.

525
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,680
Please.

526
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,000
No.

527
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
He's mine.

528
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,560
Now, let's get dressed.

529
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,640
We've got a party to attend.

530
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,160
Listen up, people.

531
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,080
Our newly elected Mayor
is going ahead

532
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,280
with his victory celebration tonight.

533
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,680
He will be exposed.

534
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,120
He will be vulnerable.

535
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,880
And he will be protected by you.

536
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,440
The brave men and women
of this police force.

537
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,560
You all have your assignments.

538
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,000
Detective Gordon here
will be running point.

539
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
Detective.

540
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,160
Penguin has already made one attempt
on Galavan's life today.

541
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,760
We should be ready for anything.

542
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,280
Let's show this city
what it means to carry a badge.

543
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,520
As you were!

544
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,000
I want check-ins from perimeter teams
every five minutes.

545
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,120
Martinez, how's the Avenue looking?

546
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,680
<i>All clear.</i>

547
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,200
Sniper teams Alpha and Bravo report
all clear as well.

548
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,560
Copy that.

549
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,720
What'd you find out?

550
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,240
Spoke to the Super
at Gertrud Kapelput's building.

551
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,680
Turns out, no one has seen her
for two weeks.

552
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,240
Timeline matches Gilzean's story.

553
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,560
Maybe. Or maybe the old broad
is on a sunset cruise.

554
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,920
You know, there's something
that Gilzean said that I can't shake.

555
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,960
He said he never thought Galavan
would go through with it.

556
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,240
Go through with what?

557
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,000
I don't think Gertrud Kapelput
is on a cruise.

558
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:00,080
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me be the first

559
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,880
to officially introduce you
to the Honorable Theo Galavan.

560
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,600
The new Mayor of Gotham!

561
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,200
Ed?

562
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,040
- Oh, my...
- What are you doing?

563
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,000
Dr. Thompkins? Hello.

564
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,600
I'm just double-checking notes
for a Jane Doe case I'm working.

565
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,840
Do you need help?

566
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,760
No. No, no, no. She's all gone.

567
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,280
She's, I'm sorry. I'm, I'm all done
with checking my notes.

568
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,400
What notes?

569
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,920
It's all up here.

570
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,720
Do you realize that by assigning
simple mnemonic devices

571
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,920
to case files
you can produce recall capacity

572
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,880
equal to that of photographic
or even eidetic memory?

573
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,520
Ed? What's going on?

574
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,480
Okay. Sorry.

575
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,000
Truth be told...

576
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,440
I was hoping to run into you here.

577
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,120
Alone.

578
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,440
It's Ms. Kringle.

579
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,080
Just...

580
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,240
We had a fight.

581
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,520
I'm sorry.

582
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,520
Every relationship hits a rough patch
now and then.

583
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,840
And you've been so supportive

584
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,160
and I was hoping that maybe
we, we could go grab a coffee

585
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,680
and you could give me some advice.

586
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,880
Do you want to finish up
what you were doing first?

587
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,280
No, no, no.
No, I, I can come back another time.

588
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,520
It's not like they're gonna go
anywhere, right?

589
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,960
- You'd think so.
- Yeah, okay.

590
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,120
- Detective Gordon.
- Okay. That's it, sir.

591
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,440
Perfect. Thank you so much.

592
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,160
I, heard about your shootout today.

593
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,720
Something about one of Penguin's
former Lieutenants, a Butch Gilzean?

594
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,440
Some men ambushed us
as we were questioning him.

595
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,800
He escaped.

596
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,120
Did you get anything
out of him before the attack?

597
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,720
No.

598
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
It's a pity.

599
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
Well...

600
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,440
Mayor, Mayor.

601
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,000
Mr. Mayor!

602
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,760
Detective, I have a large group
of men approaching

603
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,360
from off the main road.

604
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,680
I have eyes on the target.

605
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,720
Appears to be Cobblepot, sir.

606
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,120
Hold your fire.

607
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,760
Perimeter units, prepare to engage.

608
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,480
- The target is down!
- Martinez! I said hold your fire!

609
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,160
It wasn't us.

610
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,840
We have an unknown shooter
on the roof.

611
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,560
<i>I repeat we have an unknown shooter
on the roof.</i>

612
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,160
Martinez? Is Penguin dead?

613
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,880
No. It wasn't him.

614
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,280
Find the other shooter
and find Penguin!

615
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,520
We need him alive!

616
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,520
Detective, all the targets
are dressed as Penguin

617
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,640
and all are heavily armed.

618
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,400
Positive ID is impossible.

619
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,600
Martinez, you're clear to engage.

620
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,000
All perimeter units crash
our location. Now.

621
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,560
Drop it.

622
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,000
Turn around.

623
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,320
Hands above your head. Now.

624
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,960
So forceful.

625
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,160
I like a strong, confident man.

626
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,200
Help!

627
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,760
Oh, my God!

628
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,000
We got to get you out of here.
Radio his driver.

629
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,880
Have him pull the car around
to the back service entrance.

630
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,160
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

631
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,680
- Cover us?
- No problem.

632
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,440
<i>Southeast building.</i>

633
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,360
<i>Remaining officers stay inside
and clear the lobby.</i>

634
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,320
<i>Confirmed. Primary is on the move.</i>

635
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,840
<i>Initiating exit plan
near the south entrance.</i>

636
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
<i>Roger that.</i>

637
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,240
<i>Detective Gordon is en route
to the rear entrance with the Mayor.</i>

638
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,960
<i>Need their limo at the back service
entrance, stat.</i>

639
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,160
<i>Copy that.</i>

640
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,920
Get him out of here!

641
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,280
Go!

642
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Hello, Jim.

643
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,920
Please step aside.

644
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,360
You know I can't do that.

645
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,240
You would if you knew what
kind of man you were protecting.

646
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,080
Shoot him, Detective.

647
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,520
Oswald, listen to me.

648
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,440
You have to put the gun down!

649
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,080
He killed my mother, Jim.

650
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,560
I know.

651
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:39,960
Detective Gordon, I am ordering you
to put that man down! Now!

652
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,360
He had her murdered in front of me.

653
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,560
I held her.

654
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,760
Watched her die.

655
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,800
Do you know what that's like?

656
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,560
It changes a person.

657
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,400
I'm sorry about your mother, Penguin

658
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,240
but I'm gonna need you to put
the shotgun down on the ground.

659
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,440
Slowly. Now.

660
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,280
One of us is going to die tonight.

661
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,920
I have made my peace with that.

662
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,840
I suggest the new Mayor does as well.

663
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,400
Don't make us shoot you.

664
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,000
Shoot me and you have no idea
what his endgame is, Jim!

665
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,840
And you should.

666
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,040
Because it concerns someone you know.

667
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,200
Someone you care about.

668
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Shoot him.

669
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Duck!

670
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,000
Jim! Oswald!

671
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,280
Penguin smashed the Mayor's ride
through the main checkpoint.

672
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,640
The good news is, with the gunshot
wound to the shoulder and the APB,

673
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,080
I doubt he'll make it
out of the city.

674
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,600
He won't be trying to make it out.

675
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,240
We lost more people tonight,
good people, including Martinez.

676
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,240
Sometimes the good guys
have a bad night.

677
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,400
This ain't your fault.

678
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
I know.

679
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,520
It's his.

680
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,560
My ancestors were swordsmiths.

681
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,200
They knew that to make good steel
it had first to be forged.

682
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,560
I look at tonight...

683
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,880
{\an5}<i>I look at tonight
as a baptism of fire.</i>

684
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,320
<i>A fire from which we will emerge
stronger.</i>

685
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,000
{\an5}<i>Our resolve forged to bring
about a new day in Gotham!</i>

686
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,560
I've felt pretty alone
since moving here.

687
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,000
Until I met you.

688
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,880
But...

689
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,800
I don't want to come
between you and a friend.

690
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,160
You won't.

691
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,920
Selina's never going to like me.

692
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,800
I don't care.

693
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,840
I like you.

694
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,360
Detective Gordon.

695
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,480
Mr. Mayor.

696
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,160
You catch my speech?

697
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,760
I think I've heard enough speeches.

698
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,320
I had high hopes for you.

699
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,200
I thought you were prepared
to make the hard choices.

700
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,760
To do whatever it takes
to rid Gotham of its monsters.

701
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
I am.

702
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,520
I've just decided...

703
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,040
I'm going to start with you.

704
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,960
Dangerous words when addressing
the man who now controls this city.

705
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,360
Desperate times.

706
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,480
They are indeed.

707
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,360
I want to know why you did this.

708
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,520
When Doctor Thompkins walked
in the room.

709
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,440
How did it feel?

710
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,520
I was terrified.

711
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,000
She could have discovered the body.

712
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,440
But she didn't.

713
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,960
You got away with it.

714
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,640
That's not the point!

715
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,640
That is absolutely the point!

716
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,160
You can still feel the rush,
can't you?

717
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Coming so close to getting caught.

718
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,720
Knowing what you would
have been forced to do

719
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,360
if she had discovered the body.

720
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,240
Discovered what you had done.

721
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,400
The pulse of that moment.

722
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,720
Standing, standing
at the edge of uncertainty

723
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
and peering into the void.

724
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,120
Now tell me.

725
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,240
How did it feel?

726
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,040
Beautiful.
