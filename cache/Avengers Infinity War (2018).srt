1
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,195
Asgardian: (On radio)
This is the asgardian

2
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,739
refugee vessel statesman.

3
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,409
(People whimpering
and screaming)

4
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,785
We are under assault.

5
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,954
I repeat,
we are under assault.

6
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:40,666
The engines are dead,
life support failing.

7
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,794
Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.

8
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,964
We are 22 jump points
out of asgard.

9
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,592
Our crew is made up
of asgardian families.

10
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,177
We have
very few soldiers here.

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,221
This is not a warcraft.

12
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,306
I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.

13
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,781
Ebony maw:
Hear me and rejoice.

14
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,201
(Groans)

15
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,829
You have had the privilege

16
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,582
of being saved
by the great titan.

17
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,754
You may think
this is suffering.

18
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:28,964
No.

19
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,342
It is salvation.

20
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,933
Universal scales
tip toward balance

21
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,769
because of your sacrifice.

22
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,813
Smile.

23
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:45,981
-(Blade swishes)
-(Man grunts)

24
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,150
For even in death,

25
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,694
you have become
children of thanos.

26
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,170
I Know what it's like to lose.

27
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,300
To feel So desperately
that you're right...

28
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,804
Yet to fail, nonetheless.

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,685
(Thor groaning)

30
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,522
It's frightening.

31
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,817
Turns the legs to jelly.

32
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,071
But I ask you, to what end?

33
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,075
Dread it, run from it...

34
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,662
Destiny arrives all the same.

35
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,706
And now, it's here.

36
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,125
Or should I say...

37
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,003
I am.

38
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,300
(Choking)

39
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,760
You talk too much.

40
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,471
The tesseract.

41
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,015
Or your brother's head.

42
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,562
(Low growl)

43
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,064
I assume you have
a preference.

44
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,608
Oh, I do.

45
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,360
(Thor continues choking)

46
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,028
Kill away.

47
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,990
-(Crackling)
-(Groaning)

48
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,244
(Thor screaming)

49
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,420
All right, stop!

50
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,923
(Thor gasping)

51
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,967
We don't have the tesseract.

52
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,927
It was destroyed on asgard.

53
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,608
(Panting) You really are
the worst brother.

54
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,573
I assure you, brother...

55
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,742
The sun will shine
on us again.

56
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,118
(Thanos chuckling)

57
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,622
Your optimism is misplaced,
asgardian.

58
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,751
Well, for one thing,
I'm not asgardian.

59
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,127
And for another...

60
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,797
We have a hulk.

61
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,382
(Hulk roars)

62
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,510
(Roars)

63
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,305
(Thanos grunting)

64
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,853
-(Thanos groans)
-Let him have his fun.

65
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,941
(Grunting)

66
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,155
(Groans)

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,328
(Hulk grunting)

68
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,962
(Grunting)

69
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,807
(Clattering)

70
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,600
(Grunts)

71
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,569
(Panting)

72
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,615
Allfathers...

73
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,409
(Panting)

74
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,745
Iet the dark magic flow
through me one last...

75
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,664
Time.

76
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,341
(Panting)

77
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,972
That was a mistake.

78
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,769
(Groans)

79
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,521
No!

80
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,283
You're going to die for that.

81
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,620
Shh.

82
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,296
My humble personage...

83
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,008
Bows before your grandeur.

84
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,514
No other being
has ever had the might...

85
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,600
Nay, the nobility...

86
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,688
To wield not one,
but two infinity stones.

87
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,571
The universe lies
within your grasp.

88
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,889
(Thanos groaning)

89
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,571
There are two more stones
on earth.

90
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,535
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on titan.

91
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,245
Father, we will not fail you.

92
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,913
Loki: If I might interject.

93
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,376
If you're going to earth,
you might want a guide.

94
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,963
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.

95
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,298
If you consider
failure experience.

96
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,218
I consider
experience experience.

97
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,929
Almighty thanos...

98
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,892
I, loki, prince of asgard...

99
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,897
Odinson...

100
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,736
The rightful king
of Jotunheim...

101
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,239
God of mischief...

102
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,616
Do hereby pledge to you...

103
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,913
My undying fidelity.

104
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,967
Undying?

105
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,390
You should choose your words
more carefully.

106
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,309
-(Loki grunts)
-(Blade clatters)

107
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,353
(Choking)

108
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,782
(Breathing heavily)

109
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,954
(Straining) You...

110
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,665
Will never be...

111
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,502
A god.

112
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,008
(Bones crack)

113
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,805
(Muffled) No!

114
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,281
No resurrections this time.

115
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,057
No. Loki.

116
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,765
Dr strange: Seriously,
you don't have any money?

117
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,977
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

118
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,437
I'll tell the guys
at the deli.

119
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,480
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.

120
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,482
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.

121
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,650
Dollars?

122
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,152
-Rupees.
-Which is?

123
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,154
-Uh, buck and a half.
-(Sighs)

124
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,530
What do you want?

125
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,325
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.

126
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,209
(Banner groaning)

127
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,756
Thanos is coming.

128
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,549
He's coming.

129
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,013
Who?

130
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,106
Stark: Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.

131
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,191
Pepper:
You're totally rambling.

132
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,317
Stark: No, I'm not.
Pepper: You lost me.

133
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,526
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,

134
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,736
and in the dream
you gotta pee.

135
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:35,904
-Yeah.
-Okay.

136
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,197
And then you're like,
"oh, my god.

137
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,448
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?

138
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,532
-"Oh, someone's watching."
-Right.

139
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,617
"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."

140
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,785
And then you wake up
and in real life

141
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,911
you actually have to pee.

142
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,995
-Yes.
-Yeah.

143
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,205
-Okay.
-Everybody has that.

144
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,082
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.

145
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,419
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.

146
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,213
It was So real.

147
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,923
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.

148
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,007
Uh, what was his name?

149
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,426
-Right.
-Morgan! Morgan.

150
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,220
-So you woke up...
-Naturally.

151
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,971
...and thought that we were...

152
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,139
-Expecting.
-Yeah.

153
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,224
-Yes?
-No.

154
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,809
I had a dream about it.
It was So real.

155
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,310
If you wanted to have a kid...

156
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,396
You wouldn't have done that.

157
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,940
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.

158
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,525
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.

159
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,110
You're not helping
your case, okay?

160
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,319
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...

161
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,946
You don't need that.

162
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,364
I Know, I had the surgery.

163
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,532
I'm just
trying to protect us...

164
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,325
And future usses
and that's it.

165
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,993
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.

166
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,079
-Instead of, you know...
-Shirts.

167
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,207
You know me So Well.

168
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,001
-(Sighs) God.
-You finish all my sentences.

169
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,421
You should have shirts
in your closet.

170
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,797
Yeah.

171
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,341
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.

172
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,717
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.

173
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,970
-Show off this Harry Winston.
-(Chuckles)

174
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,389
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.

175
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,598
I should promise you.

176
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,058
-Yes.
- I will.

177
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,520
Thank you.

178
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,813
Dr strange: Tony stark.

179
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,983
I'm doctor Stephen strange.
I need you to come with me.

180
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,571
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.

181
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,531
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?

182
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,116
We need your help.

183
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,493
It's not overselling it
to say that

184
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,162
the fate of the universe
is at stake.

185
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,746
And who's "we"?

186
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,541
Hey, Tony.

187
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,709
Bruce.

188
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,502
-Banner: Pepper.
-Hi.

189
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,132
-Banner: Oh.
-You okay?

190
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,094
Wong: At the dawn
of the universe,

191
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,138
there was nothing. Then...

192
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,806
Boom.

193
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,685
The big bang sent
six elemental crystals...

194
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,688
Hurtling across
the virgin universe.

195
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,274
These infinity stones

196
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,277
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

197
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,404
Dr strange: Space.

198
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,698
Reality.

199
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,493
Power.

200
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,870
Soul.

201
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,164
Mind.

202
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,334
And time.

203
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,094
Tell me his name again.

204
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,471
Thanos.

205
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,931
He's a plague, Tony.

206
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,891
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

207
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,185
He wipes out
half the population.

208
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,062
He sent loki.

209
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,607
The attack on New York,
that's him.

210
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,317
This is it.

211
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,486
What's our timeline?

212
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,780
No telling. He has
the power and space stones.

213
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:24,948
That already makes him

214
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,574
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.

215
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,994
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...

216
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,246
He could destroy life

217
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,373
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.

218
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,375
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of'?

219
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,585
Are you seriously leaning
on the cauldron of the cosmos?

220
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,295
-Is that what it is?
-(Clangs)

221
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,925
I'm going to allow that.

222
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,595
If thanos needs all six,
why don't we just

223
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,055
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?

224
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,223
No can do.

225
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,101
We swore an oath to protect
the time stone with our lives.

226
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,435
Stark:
And I swore off dairy...

227
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,980
But then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavour after me.

228
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,606
-Stark raving hazelnuts.
-Not bad.

229
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,149
A bit chalky.

230
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,859
A hunk of hulk of
burning fudge is our favourite.

231
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,152
-That's a thing?
-Whatever.

232
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,404
Point is, things change.

233
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,323
Our oath to protect
the time stone cannot change.

234
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,534
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against thanos.

235
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,702
Yeah, So conversely,

236
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:10,784
besides making
balloon animals.

237
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,579
It may also be
his best chance against us.

238
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,122
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

239
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,290
What is your job exactly?

240
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,670
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.

241
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,339
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?

242
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,383
The fact is
we have this stone.

243
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,759
We know where it is.

244
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,470
Vision is out there somewhere
with the mind stone...

245
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,347
And we have to find him now.

246
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,558
Yeah, that's the thing.

247
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,767
What do you mean?

248
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,978
Two weeks ago, vision turned
off his transponder.

249
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,104
He's offline.

250
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,522
-What?
-Yeah.

251
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,608
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?

252
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,027
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.

253
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,653
Who could find vision then?

254
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,657
Stark: (Quietly) Shit.

255
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,326
Probably Steve Rogers.

256
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,660
Oh, great.

257
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,329
Maybe.

258
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,955
But...

259
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,334
(Sighs)

260
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,543
Call him.

261
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,587
It's not that easy.

262
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,465
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?

263
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,633
No.

264
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,384
The avengers broke up.
We're toast.

265
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,094
Broke up?

266
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,890
Like a band?
Like... like the Beatles?

267
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:15,975
Cap and I fell out hard.

268
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,144
We're not on speaking terms.

269
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,106
Tony, listen to me.

270
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,525
Thor's gone.

271
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,403
Thanos is coming.

272
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,113
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

273
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,413
(Sighs)

274
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,382
Stark: Flip phone.

275
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,885
(Scoffs)

276
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,391
(Distant rumbling)

277
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,355
(Objects rattling)

278
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,696
Say, doc, you wouldn't
happen to be

279
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,947
moving your hair, would ya?

280
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,117
Not at the moment, no.

281
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,202
(Rumbling continues)

282
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,922
(Muffled screaming)

283
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,593
(Screaming continues)

284
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,765
-(People screaming)
-(Horns honking)

285
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,271
(Sirens wailing)

286
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,651
-You okay?
-(Yelping)

287
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,778
-Help him!
-Wong: Banner!

288
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,530
-Wong! Look alive!
-Go, go! We got it!

289
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,740
Friday, what am I looking at?

290
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,158
Friday: Not sure.
I'm working on it.

291
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,368
Hey! You might wanna
put that time stone

292
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:58,661
in your back pocket, doc!

293
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,037
Might wanna use it.

294
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,749
(Whooshing)

295
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,553
(Electrical buzzing)

296
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,776
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

297
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,235
Holy shit.

298
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,070
We're all gonna die!

299
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,447
There's a spaceship!

300
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,324
Boy: What's going on?
Ned: Oh, my god!

301
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,201
(Panicked chatter)

302
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:45,958
What's the matter
with you kids?

303
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,835
You never seen
a spaceship before?

304
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,433
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd street.

305
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:03,518
Notify first responders.

306
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,852
Friday:: Will do.

307
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,784
(Sirens wailing in distance)

308
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,133
Hear me and rejoice.

309
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,970
You are about to die

310
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,097
at the hands
of the children of thanos.

311
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,724
-(Speaks alien language)
-Be thankful...

312
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,435
That your meaningless lives
are now contributing...

313
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,564
I'm sorry,
earth is closed today.

314
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,441
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

315
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,734
Stonekeeper.

316
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,946
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?

317
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,906
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.

318
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,784
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

319
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,245
He means get lost, squidward.

320
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,580
He exhausts me.

321
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,707
-(Speaks alien language)
-Bring me the stone.

322
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,250
(Speaks alien language)

323
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,793
Banner, you want a piece?

324
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,170
Mmm, no, not really.

325
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,547
But when do I ever get
what I want?

326
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,715
That's right.

327
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,633
Okay. Push!

328
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,260
It's been a while.

329
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,928
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.

330
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,096
Okay. Shh.

331
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,932
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.

332
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,392
Come on, come on, man.

334
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,105
Where's your guy?

00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,440
(Sighs)

336
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,900
I Don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.

337
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,109
-It's no time for a thing.
- I Know.

338
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,736
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.

(Grunting)

341
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,119
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

342
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,204
Tony, I'm sorry. (Stammers)
Either I can't or he won't.

343
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,289
It's okay.

344
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,750
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

345
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,251
-I have him.
-Damn it.

346
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,295

(Grunts)

349
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,113
Where'd that come from?

350
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,323
Iron man: It's nanotech.

351
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,449
You like it?
A little something |i...

352
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,497
Doctor banner, if the rest
of your green friend

353
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,748
won't be joining us...

354
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,124
(Yelps, grunts)

355
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,676
Iron man: Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.

356
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,135
It stays with me.

357
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,220
Exactly. Bye.

358
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,189
Banner: Tony, you okay?

359
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,316
-How we doing? Good? Bad?
-Really, really good.

360
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,526
Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?

361
00:21:58,693 --> 00:21:59,986
I'm trying. He won't come out.

362
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,947
Iron man: Hammer.

364
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:13,582
Come on, hulk!
What are you doing to me?

365
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,876
Come out! Come out! Come out!

366
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,254
(In hulk's voice) No!

368
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,926

What do you mean, "no"?

00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,054
(Grunting)

370
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,308
Spider-man: Hey, man.
What's up, mr stark?

371
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,270
-Kid, where'd you come from?
-A field trip to moma.

372
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,773
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, mr stark?

373
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,942
Uh, he's from space.

374
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,986
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.

375

-(Roars)

00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:05,383
Your powers are quaint.

(Both grunt)

381
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,308
You must be popular

(Groans)

383
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,063
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

384
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,190
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

(Grunting)

388
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:37,333
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.

389
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,210
You'll only wish
you were dead.

Iron man: Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.

00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,867
Gotcha!

397
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,078
Wait!

(Straining)

399

Uh, mr stark,
I'm being beamed up.

to my wedding.

Give me a little juice,
Friday.

Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

410
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,731
Spider-man: But you said
save the wizard!

411
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,149
I can't breathe.

We're too high up.
You're running out of air.

414
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,322
Yeah. That makes sense.

415
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,507
Mr stark, it smells
like a new car in here!

Are you all right?
What's going on?

422
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,777
Iron man: Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think

423
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,153
we might have to push
our 8:30 res.

424
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,321
Pepper: Why?

425
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,906
Iron man: Just 'cause
I'll probably

426
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,407
not make it back for a while.

427
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,743

you're not on that ship.

you're not on the ship.

I'm sorry,
I Don't know what to say.

Come back here, Tony.
I swear to god.

-Come back here right now.

we're losing her.

00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,108
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

Where you going?

440
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,500
The time stone's been taken.

The sanctum remains unguarded.

What will you do?

443
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,132
I'm gonna make a call.

Why are we doing this again?

It's a distress signal,

What?

496
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,753
Gamora, do you think i'm...

497
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,634
He is anxious, angry.

498
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,679
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.

499
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,308
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.

500
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,476
Peter: Wow.

501
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,436
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.

502
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:15,314
I'm gonna get a bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.

503
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,523
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

504
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:17,941
Rocket: You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?

505
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,318
Gamora: It's like his muscles

506
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,320
are made
of cotati metal fibres.

507
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,197
Stop massaging his muscles.

508
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,907
(Thud)

509
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,991
Wake him up.

510
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,078
(Softly) Wake.

511
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,206
-(Thor yells)
-(All exclaim)

512
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,790
(Clattering)

513
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,918
(Grunts)

514
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,338
(Panting heavily)

515
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,932
Who the hell are you guys?

516
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:56,355
The entire time I knew thanos,
he only ever had one goal.

517
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:58,232
To bring balance
to the universe

518
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,484
by wiping out
half of all life.

519
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,612
He used to kill people
planet by planet,

520
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,072
massacre by massacre.

521
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,740
Including my own.

522
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,492
If he gets
all six infinity stones...

523
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:10,869
He can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.

524
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,456
You seem to know
a great deal about thanos.

525
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,418
Gamora
is the daughter of thanos.

526
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,550
Your father killed my brother.

527
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,093
Oh, boy.

528
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,928
Stepfather, technically.

529
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,013
And she hates him
as much as you do.

530
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,269
Thor: Families can be tough.

531
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,770
Before my father died,

532
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,605
he told me
that I had a half-sister...

533
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,024
That he imprisoned in hel.

534
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,152
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.

535
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,612
So I had to kill her.

536
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,823
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.

537
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,157
Goes round and round and...

538
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:50,993
I feel your pain.

539
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,453
I feel your pain as Well,
because...

540
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,788
I mean,
it's not a competition,

541
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,998
but I've been through a lot.

542
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,833
-My father killed my mother.
-(Slurping)

543
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,126
And then I had to kill
my father.

544
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,711
-That was hard.
-(Sighs)

545
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,755
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.

546
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,175
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...

547
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,052
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

548
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,974
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...

549
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,060
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.

550
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,522
-Uh, what are you doing?
-Taking your pod.

551
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,898
(Peter clears throat)

552
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,025
(In deep voice)
No, you're not.

553
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:29,031
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.

554
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,909
Uh... quill, are you making
your voice deeper?

555
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,455
-No.
-You are.

556
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:39,333
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

557
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,667
No, I'm not.

558
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,878
-(Gasps) He just did it again!
-This is my voice.

559
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,052
Are you mocking me?

560
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,430
-Are you mocking me?
-Stop it. You did it again.

561
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,931
He's trying to copy me.

562
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,016
I need you to stop doing that.

563
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,809
-Gamora: Enough!
-He's doing it first.

564
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,353
We need to stop thanos.

565
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,063
Which means
we need to find out

566
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,147
where he's going next.

567
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,565
Knowhere.

568
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,400
He must be going somewhere.

569
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,569
(In normal voice)
No, no. Knowhere?

570
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,405
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.

571
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,991
-Excuse me, that's our food.
-Not any more.

572
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,578
Thor, why would he
go to knowhere?

573
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:17,913
Thor: Because for years...

574
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,248
The reality stone's been
safely stored there

575
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,750
with a man
called the collector.

576
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,502
Peter: If it's with the
collector, then it's not safe.

577
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,379
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.

578
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,922
-Or a genius.
-Gamora: How do you know...

579
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,633
He's not going
for one of the other stones?

580
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,177
There are six stones
out there.

581
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,554
Thanos already has
the power stone...

582
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,016
Because he stole it last week
when he decimated xandar.

583
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,519
He stole the space stone
from me...

584
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:43,355
When he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

585
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,148
The time and mind stones
are safe on earth.

586
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,233
They're with the avengers.

587
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,819
-The avengers?
-Earth's mightiest heroes.

588
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,112
Like Kevin bacon?

589
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,571
He may be on the team.
I Don't know.

590
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:52,656
I haven't been there
in a while.

591
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,033
As for the soul stone, Well,
no one's ever seen that.

592
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,827
No one even knows where it is.

593
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,745
Therefore thanos can't get it.

594
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,288
Therefore he's going
to knowhere.

595
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,874
Hence he'll be getting
the reality stone.

596
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,084
You're welcome.

597
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,460
Then we have to go
to knowhere now.

598
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:09,297
Wrong. Where we have to go
is nidavellir.

599
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,591
-That's a made-up word.
-All words are made up.

600
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,845
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

601
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,638
That place is a legend.

602
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,223
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons

603
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,350
(chuckling)
To ever torment the universe.

604
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,561
I would very much like
to go there, please.

605
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:23,729
The rabbit is correct

606
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:24,855
and clearly the smartest
among you.

607
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:25,981
Rabbit?

608
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,400
Only eitri the dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.

609
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,776
I assume
you're the captain, sir.

610
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:30,944
You're very perceptive.

611
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,320
You seem like a noble leader.

612
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,989
Will you join me
on my quest to nidavellir?

613
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:36,950
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!

614
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,869
-Yeah. I'll go.
-Wonderful!

615
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,162
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.

616
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,246
Thor: Quiet.

617
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,914
-That's my backpack.
-Rocket: Go sit down.

618
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,708
Peter: Look, this is my ship.

619
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,626
And I'm not goin' to...

620
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,713
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?

621
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,131
The thanos-killing kind.

622
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,467
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

623
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,677
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.

624
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,928
Your bodies would crumble

625
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,180
as your minds collapsed
into madness.

626
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,265
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?

627
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,600
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

628
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,018
If we don't go to knowhere

629
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,686
and thanos retrieves
another stone...

630
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,396
He'll be too powerful to stop.

631
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,732
-He already is.
- I got it figured out.

632
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,609
We got two ships

633
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,068
and a large assortment
of morons.

634
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,489
So me and groot will go
with the pirate angel here.

635
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,823
And the morons
will go to knowhere

636
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,492
to try to stop thanos.

637
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,577
-Cool? Cool.
-So cool.

638
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,037
Peter: For the record...

639
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,122
I Know that
you're going with him

640
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:25,290
because it's where
thanos isn't.

641
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,958
You know, you really shouldn't

642
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,169
talk that way
to your captain, quill.

643
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,463
Come on, groot.

644
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,716
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

645
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,134
(Video game continues beeping)

646
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,264
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.

647
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,557
Bye.

648
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,986
-(High-pitched trilling)
-(Gasps)

649
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,490
Vis?

650
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,826
Is it the stone again?

651
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,619
It's as if
it's speaking to me.

652
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,955
What does it say?

653
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,208
I Don't... I Don't know,
but something.

654
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,670
-(High-pitched trilling)
-Hey.

655
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,015
Tell me what you feel.

656
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,733
I just feel you.

657
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,827
Wanda: So there's a 10:00 A.M.
to Glasgow...

658
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,996
Which would give us more time
together before you went back.

659
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,622
Vision: What if
I miss that train?

660
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,790
There's an 11:00.

661
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,376
What if I missed
all the trains?

662
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,462
What if this time
I didn't go back?

663
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,964
But you gave stark your word.

664
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,299
I'd rather give it to you.

665
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,426
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.

666
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:00,927
We both made promises.

667
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,804
Not to each other.

668
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,222
Wanda.

669
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,517
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...

670
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,728
Trying to see
if this could work and...

671
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,479
I Don't know. (Stammers)

672
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,607
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.

673
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,483
(Stammers) I think...

674
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,735
-Wanda: It works.
-It works.

675
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,194
It works.

676
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,907
Stay.

677
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,492
Stay with me.

678
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,500
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

679
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,506
(Wanda gasps)

680
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,301
What are they?

681
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:44,054
What the stone
was warning me about.

682
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,357
I have to go.

683
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,441
No, vision.

684
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,318
Vision, if that's true,

685
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,196
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.

686
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,323
Wanda, I...

687
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,533
-Vision!
-(Groaning)

688
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:08,662
(Growls)

689
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,167
(Grunting)

690
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,086
(Screaming)

691
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,381
(Grunts)

692
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,807
(Grunts)

693
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,356
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.

694
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,234
-Is that even possible?
-It isn't supposed to be.

695
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,028
(Distorted)
My systems are failing.

696
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,615
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.

697
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,160
Vis!

698
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,874
(Grunting)

699
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,631
Give up the stone,
and she lives.

700
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:02,924
(Grunting)

701
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,473
(Grunting)

702
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,980
(Grunting)

703
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,574
(Groans)

704
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,577
(Vision screaming)

705
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,375
(Vision groaning)

706
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:40,962
Hands off.

707
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:50,472
(Wanda gasps)

708
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,726
(Both grunting)

709
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,686
(Both groaning)

710
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,021
Come on. Come on.

711
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,981
Come on, you gotta get up.

712
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,358
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.

713
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,861
Hey. We have to go.

714
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,279
(Sighs)

715
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,365
Please. Please leave.

716
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,284
You asked me to stay.

717
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,703
-I'm staying.
-Please.

718
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,179
(Train horn blaring)

719
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,271
(Grunts)

720
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,324
(Falcon grunts)

721
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,543
(Grunting)

722
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,586
(Screams)

723
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,886
(Yelling)

724
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:18,017
(All grunting)

725
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,609
-Get up.
-I can't.

726
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,487
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.

727
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,823
You'll never get
the chance again.

728
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,340
Can you stand?

729
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:50,717
(Vision grunts)

730
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,513
Thank you, captain.

731
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,851
Let's get you on the jet.

732
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,233
Now, I thought we had a deal.

733
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,112
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.

734
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,614
Wanda: I'm sorry.

735
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,574
We just wanted time.

736
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,536
Sam: Where to, cap?

737
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,874
Home.

738
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,377
-(Girl sobbing)
(Woman shushing)

739
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,504
Woman: We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.

740
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,423
-(People screaming)
-(Guns firing)

741
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,511
-(Explosion)
-(Screams)

742
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,181
(Alien speaks alien language)

743
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,310
(Both screaming)

744
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,521
(People screaming)

745
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,113
Ebony maw: (On loudspeaker)
Zehobereians.

746
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,032
Mother! Where's my mother?

747
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,533
Ebony maw:
Choose a side or die.

748
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,160
Girl: Mother!

749
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,496
Ebony <i>maw: One side
is a revelation...</i>

750
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:04,707
The other an honour
known only to a few.

751
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,085
What's wrong, little one?

752
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,130
My mother. Where is my mother?

753
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,136
What's your name?

754
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,139
Gamora.

755
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,767
You're quite the fighter,
gamora.

756
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,311
Come.

757
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:26,688
Let me help you.

758
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,327
Look.

759
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,289
(Clinks)

760
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:46,666
Pretty, isn't it?

761
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,878
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.

762
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,799
Too much to one side
or the other...

763
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,639
Here. You try.

764
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,479
Ebony maw: Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.

765
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,816
-(People screaming)
-Thanos: Uh-uh.

766
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:15,278
Concentrate.

767
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,113
(Screaming continues)

768
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,034
There. You've got it.

769
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:28,916
(Clinks)

770
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,627
Peter: Gamora.

771
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:33,796
Do you know if these grenades

772
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,049
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?

773
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,300
Because I was thinking about

774
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,968
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.

775
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,136
But I Don't want to
if they're the...

776
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,471
Gamora: I need to ask a favour.

777
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,723
Yeah, sure.

778
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,351
Gamora: One way or another,

779
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,686
the path that we're on
leads to thanos.

780
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,939
Which is what
the grenades are for.

781
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,193
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favour?

782
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,529
If things go wrong...

783
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,283
If thanos gets me...

784
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,790
I want you to promise me...

785
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,958
You'll kill me.

786
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,710
What?

787
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,257
I Know something he doesn't.

788
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:23,012
And if he finds it out,

789
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,472
the entire universe
could be at risk.

790
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,224
What do you know?

791
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,434
If I tell you, you'd know too.

792
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,314
If it's So important...

793
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:34,440
Shouldn't I?

794
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:35,817
Only if you wanna die.

795
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,568
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

796
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:39,987
Just...

797
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:45,410
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.

798
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,912
I mean, I'd like to.

799
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,914
- I really would. But you...
-(Sighs)

800
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,290
Swear to me.

801
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,376
(Shudders)

802
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,088
Swear to me on your mother.

803
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,096
Okay.

804
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,311
Okay.

805
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,405
(Loud crunching)

806
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,660
(Continues crunching)

807
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,579
-Oh.
-Dude.

808
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,205
How long have you been
standing there?

809
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,290
An hour.

810
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,083
An hour?

811
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,918
Are you serious?

812
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,254
I've mastered the ability

813
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,007
of standing
So incredibly still...

814
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,802
That I become
invisible to the eye.

815
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,429
Watch.

816
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,934
You're eating a zarg-nut.

817
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,811
But my movement...

818
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,272
Was So slow...

819
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,941
That it's imperceptible.

820
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,109
Mmm, no.

821
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:02,528
(Crunching)
I'm sure I'm invisible.

822
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:03,863
Mantis: Hi, drax.

823
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,575
Damn it.

824
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,222
This place looks deserted.

825
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,141
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.

826
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,227
Peter: Yep,
I'm picking that up too.

827
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,104
Let's put down right here.

828
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,409
The collector:
I Don't have it.

829
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,247
Thanos: Everyone
in the galaxy knows

830
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,748
you'd sell your own brother...

831
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,542
If you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...

832
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,627
To your pathetic collection.

833
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,845
I Know you have
the reality stone, tivan.

834
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:14,267
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

835
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,644
(Groans)

836
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,105
The collector: (Strained)
I told you.

837
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,898
I sold it.

838
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,778
Why would I lie?

839
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,155
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.

840
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,700
Like suicide.

841
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,368
You do understand.

842
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,330
Not even you would surrender
something So precious.

843
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:37,873
I didn't know what it was.

844
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,835
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.

845
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,211
It's him.

846
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,838
Thanos: Last chance,
charlatan.

847
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,298
(Wheezing)

848
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,341
Where's the stone?

849
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,509
Today...

850
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,927
(Whispering) Drax. Drax.

851
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,054
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

852
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,180
Drax, wait.

853
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,058
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

854
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:57,476
Drax.

855
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,608
Drax, drax, drax.
Listen to me.

856
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,027
He doesn't have the stone yet.

857
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,820
If we get it,
then we can stop him.

858
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,824
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.

859
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,075
No.

860
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:16,287
No. For ovette, for camaria.

861
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:18,039
(Softly) Sleep.

862
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,207
(Thud)

863
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,759
(Groans)

864
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:29,966
Gamora, mantis, you go right.

865
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,968
(Whispering) Okay.

866
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,850
The other right.

867
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,728
(Yells)

868
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,275
(Groans)

869
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,070
(Groaning)

870
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,823
(Gurgling)

871
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,876
Why?

872
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:09,382
(Groaning)

873
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,932
Why you, daughter?

874
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,686
(Sobbing)

875
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,020
(Blade clatters)

876
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,901
(Continues sobbing)

877
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,576
That was quick.

878
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:48,254
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!

879
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,300
Thanos: Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?

880
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:58,931
In my heart,
I knew you still cared.

881
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,567
But one never knows for sure.

882
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,620
Reality is often
disappointing.

883
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,042
That is, it was.

884
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,463
Now...

885
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:35,259
Reality can be
whatever I want.

886
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,262
You knew I'd come.

887
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,055
Thanos: I counted on it.

888
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,768
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

889
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,438
(Gamora grunts, screams)

890
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,107
Thanos!

891
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,741
No!

892
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:01,827
(Groans)

893
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,705
Let her go, grimace.

894
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,165
Gamora: Peter.

895
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,876
I told you to go right.

896
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,836
Now? Really?

897
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,421
You let her go!

898
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,548
-Ah, the boyfriend.
-(Groans)

899
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,051
Like to think of myself

900
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:15,716
no.

901
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,595
More as a titan-killing,
long-term Booty call.

902
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,806
-Let her go.
-Peter.

903
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:27,269
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.

904
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,771
Not him.

905
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,484
(Panting)

906
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,952
You promised. You promised.

907
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,332
Thanos: Oh, daughter.

908
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,293
You expect too much from him.

909
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,465
She's asked, hasn't she?

910
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,428
Do it.

911
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,517
Mmm.

912
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,355
-(Gamora yelps)
-Do it!

913
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:12,773
(Shuddering)

914
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,361
I told you to go right.

915
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,283
I love you more than anything.

916
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,912
I love you too.

917
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,709
(Breathing rapidly)

918
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,261
I like him.

919
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,835
Secretary Ross: (On speaker)
Still no word from vision?

920
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:17,671
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

921
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,340
On a stolen quinjet

922
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,216
with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.

923
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,260
You know they're
only criminals because

924
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:24,845
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?

925
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,138
My god, rhodes.

926
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:29,516
Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.

927
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,809
If it weren't
for those accords,

928
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,269
vision would've been
right here.

929
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,231
I remember your signature
on those papers, colonel.

930
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:37,733
That's right.

931
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,570
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.

932
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:42,947
You have second thoughts?

933
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,823
Not any more.

934
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:52,247
Mr secretary.

935
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,462
You got some nerve.

936
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,756
I'll give you that.

937
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,675
You could use
some of that right now.

938
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:09,640
The world's on fire.

939
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:10,224
And you think all is forgiven?

940
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,101
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

941
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,311
And I'm way past
asking permission.

942
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,315
Earth just lost
her best defender.

943
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,025
So we're here to fight.

944
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,529
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

945
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,448
We'll fight you too.

946
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:30,703
Arrest them.

947
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,414
All over it.

948
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,419
(Computer beeps)

949
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,878
That's a court-martial.

950
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,340
It's great to see you, cap.

951
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,218
-You too, Rhodey.
-(Rhodes chuckles)

952
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,302
Hey.

953
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,931
(Sighs) Wow. You guys...

954
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,767
Really look like crap.

955
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,519
Must've been
a rough couple years.

956
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,355
Yeah, Well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

957
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,983
Banner: Uh, I think
you look great.

958
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,404
Uh...

959
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:07,990
(Chuckles)

960
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,117
Yeah, I'm back.

961
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,786
Hi, Bruce.

962
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,334
Nat.

963
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:24,298
This is awkward.

964
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,343
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?

965
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,678
And they can clearly find us.

966
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:32,056
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

967
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,807
After the whole
accords situation,

968
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,434
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough

969
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,144
on their families.
They're on house arrest.

970
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:38,562
-Banner: Who's Scott?
-Ant-man.

971
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,189
There's an ant-man
and a spider-man?

972
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,149
Okay, look.

973
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,069
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...

974
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,655
And he is not gonna stop
until he gets...

975
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:51,533
Vision's stone.

976
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,951
Then we have to protect it.

977
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,745
No, we have to destroy it.

978
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,207
I've been giving
a good deal of thought

979
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,291
to this entity in my head.

980
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,959
About its nature.

981
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,670
But also its composition.

982
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,839
I think if it were exposed

983
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,758
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...

984
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,762
Something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...

985
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,516
Its molecular integrity
could fail.

986
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,310
Yeah, and you with it.

987
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,229
We're not having
this conversation.

988
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,397
Vision: Eliminating the stone
is the only way

989
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,483
to be certain that
thanos can't get it.

990
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,236
That's too high a price.

991
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,118
Only you have
the power to pay it.

992
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,415
Thanos threatens
half the universe.

993
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,127
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.

994
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,711
But it should.

995
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,590
We don't trade lives, vision.

996
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,717
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...

997
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,678
To save how many
millions of people?

998
00:57:52,845 --> 00:57:54,888
Tell me,
why is this any different?

999
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,349
Banner: Because you might
have a choice.

1000
00:57:58,642 --> 00:57:59,977
Your mind is made up

1001
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,437
of a complex construct
of overlays.

1002
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:06,191
Jarvis, ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.

1003
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,110
All of them mixed together,

1004
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,695
all of them
learning from one another.

1005
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,822
You're saying vision isn't
just the stone?

1006
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:15,075
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...

1007
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,660
There's still a whole lot
of vision left.

1008
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,203
Perhaps the best parts.

1009
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:19,872
Can we do that?

1010
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:21,623
Not me, not here.

1011
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:31,300
Rhodes: Well,
you better find someone

1012
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:24,250
I Know somewhere.

1013
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,419
And somewhere fast.

1014
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:26,962
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys

1015
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,255
have your old rooms back.

1016
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,775
Okoye: The kingsguard

1017
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,152
and the dora milaje
have been alerted.

1018
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:51,862
And the border tribe?

1019
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:53,906
Those that are left.

1020
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,325
Send word
to the Jabari as Well.

1021
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,577
M'Baku likes a good fight.

1022
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,912
(Speaks xhosa)

1023
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,581
(In English)
And what of this one?

1024
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,334
This one may be tired of war.

1025
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,712
But the white wolf
has rested long enough.

1026
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,945
Where's the fight?

1027
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,280
On its way.

1028
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,289
(Groans softly)

1029
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,587
(Gasps)

1030
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:56,260
In all the time
I've served thanos...

1031
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,138
I have never failed him.

1032
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:08,313
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on titan...

1033
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,065
With the time stone
still attached

1034
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,317
to your vaguely
irritating person...

1035
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:15,070
There would be judgement.

1036
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:22,577
(Grunting softly)

1037
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:25,205
Give me...

1038
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,041
(Grunts)

1039
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,043
The stone.

1040
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,890
Wow, you're a seriously

1041
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,058
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?

1042
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,269
Spider-man: Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...

1043
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:48,812
Stark: What the...

1044
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,731
-I Know what you're gonna say.
-You should not be here.

1045
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:51,940
-I was gonna go home.
-I Don't wanna hear it.

1046
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,108
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought

1047
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,443
-about you on the way...
-And now I gotta hear it.

1048
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,527
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.

1049
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,738
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

1050
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,905
God damn it.

1051
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,867
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.

1052
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:03,368
-What did you just say?
-(Stutters) I take that back.

1053
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:04,828
And now, I'm here in space.

1054
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,414
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.

1055
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,666
This isn't coney island.
This isn't a field trip.

1056
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,084
This is a one-way ticket.

1057
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,711
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.

1058
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:13,795
No, I did think this through.

1059
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,505
You could not have possibly
thought this through.

1060
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,174
You can't be a friendly
neighbourhood spider-man...

1061
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:18,925
If there's no neighbourhood.

1062
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,220
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,

1063
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:23,638
but you know
what I'm trying to say.

1064
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:28,643
(Breathes shakily)
Come on. We got a situation.

1065
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,645
See him down there?
He's in trouble.

1066
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:31,730
What's your plan?

1067
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:32,981
-Go.
-Um...

1068
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,067
Okay, okay... uh...

1069
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:38,570
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, aliens?

1070
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,655
(Screaming)

1071
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,368
Ebony maw:
Painful, aren't they?

1072
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,121
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.

1073
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:50,874
-And any one of them...
-(Thud)

1074
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,173
Could end your friend's life
in an instant.

1075
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,384
Iron man: / gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.

1076
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,220
Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.

1077
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,765
You've saved nothing.

1078
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,643
Your powers
are inconsequential

1079
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,936
compared to mine.

1080
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,979
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

1081
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,567
(Yelps)

1082
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,778
(Grunting)

1083
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,282
(Grunts)

1084
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,329
Spider-man: Yes! Wait.
What are those?

1085
01:02:32,124 --> 01:02:33,708
(Yelling)

1086
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,549
(Grunts)

1087
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,680
Spider-man: Hey,
we haven't officially met.

1088
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,057
Cool.

1089
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,519
We gotta turn
this ship around.

1090
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,688
Stark: Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.

1091
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:56,231
No, I want to protect
the stone.

1092
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,607
Stark: And I want you
to thank me.

1093
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,192
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

1094
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,070
Dr strange: For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?

1095
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,489
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.

1096
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:05,657
I seriously don't know

1097
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,908
how you fit your head
into that helmet.

1098
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,327
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.

1099
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,996
I tried to bench you.
You refused.

1100
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:13,081
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I Don't work for you.

1101
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,833
And due to that fact,

1102
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,251
we're now
in a flying doughnut...

1103
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,086
Billions of miles from earth
with no backup.

1104
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,172
-I'm backup.
-No, you're a stowaway.

1105
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,339
The adults are talking.

1106
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,092
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.

1107
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,886
What is he, your ward?

1108
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,053
No.

1109
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,431
-I'm Peter, by the way.
-Doctor strange.

1110
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:31,308
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...

1111
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,518
I'm spider-man, then.

1112
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:35,937
This ship is
self-correcting its course.

1113
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,022
Thing's on autopilot.

1114
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:38,899
Dr strange:
Can we control it?

1115
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,984
Fly us home?

1116
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:44,988
-Stark?
-Yeah.

1117
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,406
Can you get us home?

1118
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,824
Yeah, I heard you.

1119
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,578
I'm thinking I'm not
So sure we should.

1120
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,747
Under no circumstances

1121
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,374
can we bring
the time stone to thanos.

1122
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,709
I Don't think
you quite understand

1123
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,793
what's at stake here.

1124
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,296
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...

1125
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,216
That thanos has been
inside my head for six years.

1126
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,967
Since he sent an army
to New York

1127
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:07,594
and now he's back.

1128
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:09,679
And I Don't know what to do.

1129
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,014
So I'm not So sure

1130
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,891
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...

1131
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:16,686
But you saw what they did,
what they can do.

1132
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,064
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.

1133
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:21,983
So I say we take
the fight to him.

1134
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,151
Doctor.

1135
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,530
Do you concur?

1136
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,576
All right, stark.
We go to him.

1137
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:34,704
But you have to understand...

1138
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,540
If it comes to saving you

1139
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,084
or the kid
or the time stone...

1140
01:04:39,251 --> 01:04:42,087
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.

1141
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:46,591
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.

1142
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,053
Nice. Good, moral compass.
(Pats arm)

1143
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:53,974
We're straight.

1144
01:04:53,974 --> 01:04:55,475
(Sighs) All right, kid.

1145
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:57,811
You're an avenger now.

1146
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,683
Thanos: I thought
you might be hungry.

1147
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,405
I always hated that chair.

1148
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,616
Thanos: So I've been told.

1149
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:57,203
Even So, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

1150
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,497
I hated this room.

1151
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,666
This ship.

1152
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,627
I hated my life.

1153
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:10,300
Thanos: You told me that too.

1154
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,846
Every day.

1155
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,601
For almost 20 years.

1156
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,564
I was a child
when you took me.

1157
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,775
I saved you.

1158
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,279
No.

1159
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:36,326
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

1160
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,661
Going to bed hungry...

1161
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,871
Scrounging for scraps.

1162
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,916
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.

1163
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,085
I'm the one who stopped that.

1164
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,379
Do you know
what's happened since then?

1165
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,172
The children born...

1166
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:53,176
Have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.

1167
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,594
It's a paradise.

1168
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,140
Because you murdered
half the planet.

1169
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:02,185
A small price to pay
for salvation.

1170
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,353
You're insane.

1171
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,480
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.

1172
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,441
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.

1173
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,987
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

1174
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:14,489
It needs correction.

1175
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,032
You don't know that!

1176
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,619
I'm the only one
who knows that.

1177
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:24,624
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

1178
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,210
For a time...

1179
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:34,050
You had that same will...

1180
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,054
As you fought by my side.

1181
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,973
Daughter.

1182
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,559
I'm not your daughter.

1183
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:47,731
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.

1184
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,941
And, in doing So,

1185
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,277
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.

1186
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:58,032
That's why I trusted you
to find the soul stone.

1187
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,872
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1188
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,331
(Thanos sighs)

1189
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:07,208
I am disappointed.

1190
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,462
But not because
you didn't find it.

1191
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:15,800
But because you did.

1192
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,012
And you lied.

1193
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,238
Gamora: Nebula.

1194
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:45,830
Don't do this.

1195
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,207
Thanos: Some time ago,

1196
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,001
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.

1197
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,169
Please don't do this.

1198
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,546
Thanos:
And very nearly succeeded.

1199
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:55,673
So I brought her here.

1200
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:58,468
To talk.

1201
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:02,096
(Screaming)

1202
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,520
Stop. Stop it.

1203
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,736
I swear to you on my life.

1204
01:09:17,237 --> 01:09:19,531
I never found the soul stone.

1205
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,245
Nebula:
Accessing memory files.

1206
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,746
You know
what he's about to do.

1207
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,499
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.

1208
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:30,792
-All of them.
-He can never get them all.

1209
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:31,918
Nebula: He will!

1210
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,962
He can't, nebula.

1211
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,464
Because I found the map
to the soul stone...

1212
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:39,425
And I burned it to ash.
I burned it.

1213
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:46,266
You're strong.

1214
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,310
Me.

1215
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,481
You're generous.

1216
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:55,817
Me.

1217
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,238
But I never taught you to lie.

1218
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:03,032
That's why
you're So bad at it.

1219
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:09,789
Where is the soul stone?

1220
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:15,420
(Screaming)

1221
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,553
(Continues screaming)

1222
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,182
Vormir!

1223
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,146
(Gasping weakly)

1224
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:47,911
The stone is on vormir.

1225
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,207
Show me.

1226
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,836
Groot: I am groot.

1227
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,129
Rocket: Tinkle in the cup.

1228
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,547
We're not looking.
What's there to see?

1229
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,883
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.

1230
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,134
I am groot.

1231
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:04,344
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1232
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:05,929
out into space
and go in the cup again.

1233
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,430
You speak groot?

1234
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,390
Yes, they taught it on asgard.
It was an elective.

1235
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:10,600
I am groot.

1236
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,769
You'll know when we're close.

1237
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:14,520
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1238
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,814
the blazing power
of a neutron star.

1239
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,653
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.

1240
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:24,113
It's truly awesome.

1241
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:33,289
Okay, time to be the captain.

1242
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,837
So, dead brother, huh?

1243
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:42,340
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1244
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,717
Well, he's been dead before.

1245
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:48,721
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.

1246
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,516
And you said
your sister and your dad?

1247
01:11:51,683 --> 01:11:52,976
Both dead.

1248
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:55,269
But still got a mom, though?

1249
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,021
Killed by a dark elf.

1250
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,189
A best friend?

1251
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,649
Stabbed through the heart.

1252
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:06,197
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?

1253
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:09,909
Absolutely.

1254
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:13,579
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...

1255
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,331
They're all
tremendous motivators.

1256
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:16,416
They really clear the mind.

1257
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,209
So I'm good to go.

1258
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:21,045
Yeah, but this thanos
we're talkin' about...

1259
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,798
He's the toughest there is.

1260
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:26,009
-Well, he's never fought me.
-Yeah, he has.

1261
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,719
He's never fought me twice.

1262
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,096
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.

1263
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,515
It better be some hammer.

1264
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,059
(Chuckling)

1265
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:41,899
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1266
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:39,688
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,

1267
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,733
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.

1268
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:44,944
But none succeeded.

1269
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:48,531
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.

1270
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:51,492
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...

1271
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,536
And he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.

1272
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,496
Fate wills it So.

1273
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,914
Mmm-hmm.

1274
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,833
And what if you're wrong?

1275
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,921
If I'm wrong, then...

1276
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,758
What more could I lose?

1277
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:12,513
(Sniffs)

1278
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:21,939
I could lose a lot.

1279
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,150
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.

1280
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:28,946
Okay.

1281
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:31,949
(Video game beeping)

1282
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:34,118
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...

1283
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:35,995
You're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.

1284
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,164
-What's this?
-What's it look like?

1285
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:40,917
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on contraxia.

1286
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,335
He gave you his eye?

1287
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:43,628
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1288
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:46,756
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

1289
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,926
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1290
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,010
Hmm.

1291
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,056
Huh?

1292
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,766
(Squelches)

1293
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:57,892
Oh.

1294
01:13:58,226 --> 01:14:00,895
I would've washed that.
(Clears throat)

1295
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,481
The only way I could sneak it
off contraxia was up my...

1296
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:04,732
(Alarm beeps)

1297
01:14:04,816 --> 01:14:05,900
Hey, we're here!

1298
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,030
I Don't think
this thing works.

1299
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:12,365
Everything seems dark.

1300
01:14:14,826 --> 01:14:16,536
Rocket: It ain't the eye.

1301
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,259
Something's wrong.

1302
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:33,594
The star's gone out.

1303
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,013
And the rings are frozen.

1304
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,619
Rocket: I hope
these dwarves are better

1305
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,454
at forging
than they are cleaning.

1306
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:02,123
(Video game beeping)

1307
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,295
Maybe they realised
that they live

1308
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,796
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.

1309
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:11,924
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.

1310
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,846
You said thanos
had a gauntlet, right?

1311
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,181
Thor: Yes, why?

1312
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,391
Rocket: It look
anything like that?

1313
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,563
I am groot.

1314
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,231
Go back to the pod.

1315
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:28,733
(Grunts)

1316
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,278
Eitri, wait!

1317
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:34,280
Stop!

1318
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:36,199
Stop.

1319
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:37,909
Thor?

1320
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,622
What happened here?

1321
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,333
You were supposed
to protect us.

1322
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,878
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.

1323
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,255
Asgard is destroyed.

1324
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:57,345
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?

1325
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,433
(Footsteps thudding)

1326
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:04,060
(Video game beeping)

1327
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,813
(Clanging)

1328
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:13,110
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.

1329
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:17,406
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

1330
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,369
I made what he wanted.

1331
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:27,416
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

1332
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:30,920
(Stammers)

1333
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:34,548
Then he killed
everyone anyway.

1334
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,427
All except me.

1335
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,389
"Your life is yours," he said.

1336
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:46,644
"But your hands
are mine alone."

1337
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,605
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.

1338
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,316
Every weapon
you've ever designed,

1339
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,818
every axe, hammer, sword...

1340
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:56,195
It's all inside your head.

1341
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,990
Now, I Know it feels
like all hope is lost.

1342
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,700
Trust me, I Know.

1343
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:05,871
But together, you and I,
we can kill thanos.

1344
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,227
(Grunting)

1345
01:17:36,736 --> 01:17:37,862
(Grunting)

1346
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,664
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1347
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,042
I need you
to meet me on titan.

1348
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,716
Spider-man:
Hey, what's going on?

1349
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:00,092
Dr strange:
I think we're here.

1350
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:02,720
I Don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

1351
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:06,015
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.

1352
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,141
Close those around it.

1353
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:09,852
-You understand?
-Yep, got it.

1354
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,312
This was meant for
one big guy, So we gotta

1355
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,064
-move at the same time.
-Okay, okay. Ready.

1356
01:18:17,485 --> 01:18:18,694
-(Rumbling)
-We might wanna turn.

1357
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:20,112
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1358
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,560
You all right?

1359
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:54,313
Stark: (Grunts)
That was close.

1360
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:56,941
I owe you one.

1361
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:59,527
Let me just say, if aliens

1362
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,362
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...

1363
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:02,655
And I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.

1364
01:19:02,822 --> 01:19:05,157
I do not want another
single pop culture reference

1365
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,826
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?

1366
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,369
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.

1367
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:16,877
Drax: Thanos!

1368
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:18,879
(Yelling)

1369
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:21,757
(Grunting)

1370
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:29,723
(Grunts)

1371
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:33,269
(Peter laughs)

1372
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:37,189
(Spider-man gasps)

1373
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,692
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

1374
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,110
(Grunts)

1375
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,654
-(Spider-man grunts)
-Peter quill: Stay down, clown.

1376
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,784
(Screams)

1377
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,953
Drax: Die, blanket of death!

1378
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:56,792
(Grunts)

1379
01:19:56,876 --> 01:19:59,795
Peter: Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.

1380
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:03,007
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.

1381
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,009
Where is gamora?

1382
01:20:05,176 --> 01:20:07,678
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's gamora?

1383
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,764
I'll do you one better.
Why is gamora?

1384
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,850
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you

1385
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,185
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.

1386
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:17,188
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1387
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,526
-No, he can't take it!
-She's right. You can't.

1388
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,357
Do it, quill! I can take it.

1389
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,737
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.

1390
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:25,946
I'll kill all three of you

1391
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,865
and I'll beat it
out of thanos myself.

1392
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,033
Starting with you.

1393
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,201
Wait, what, thanos?

1394
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:32,369
All right, let me ask you
this one time.

1395
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,538
What master do you serve?

1396
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:35,956
What master do I serve?

1397
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,500
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?

1398
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,460
You're from earth.

1399
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,586
I'm not from earth,
I'm from Missouri.

1400
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,004
Stark: Yeah, that's on earth,
dipshit.

1401
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,214
What are you hassling us for?

1402
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,132
Spider-man: So you're not
with thanos?

1403
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:47,426
With thanos?

1404
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:50,596
No, I'm here to kill thanos.

1405
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,598
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?

1406
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,142
-We're the avengers, man.
-Oh.

1407
01:20:55,226 --> 01:20:57,520
You're the ones
Thor told us about.

1408
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:58,854
You know Thor?

1409
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:00,105
Yeah.

1410
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,650
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.

1411
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,485
Where is he now?

1412
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:22,795
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?

1413
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:23,546
It's a mould.

1414
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:24,547
A king's weapon.

1415
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:27,841
Meant to be
the greatest in asgard.

1416
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:31,345
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.

1417
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:32,972
Did it have a name?

1418
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,391
Storm breaker.

1419
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:36,976
That's a bit much.

1420
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:40,104
So how do we make it?

1421
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:44,149
You'll have to restart
the forge.

1422
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:47,319
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.

1423
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:52,575
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1424
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:58,205
Peter: The hell happened
to this planet?

1425
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:00,165
It's eight degrees
off its axis.

1426
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,459
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.

1427
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:06,589
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

1428
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:10,175
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.

1429
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,594
Or at least
the beginnings of one.

1430
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,095
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,

1431
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,388
pin him down,
get what we need.

1432
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:16,223
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.

1433
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:17,349
We just want the gauntlet.

1434
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,311
-Are you yawning?
-(Yawning)

1435
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:22,563
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1436
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:23,689
Did you hear what I said?

1437
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,775
I stopped listening after
you said, "we need a plan."

1438
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,027
Okay, mr clean
is on his own page.

1439
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,030
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.

1440
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,698
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?

1441
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,450
Kick names, take ass.

1442
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:35,868
Yeah, that's right.

1443
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:41,790
(Sighs)

1444
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:43,917
All right, just get over here,
please.

1445
01:22:44,335 --> 01:22:46,253
Mr lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?

1446
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,589
"Mr lord." Star-lord is fine.

1447
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,593
Stark: We gotta coalesce.

1448
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,386
"Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

1449
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:56,847
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1450
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,182
We don't know what it means.

1451
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:01,185
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.

1452
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:03,812
Except it sucks,
So let me do the plan...

1453
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,898
And that way
it might be really good.

1454
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:08,025
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.

1455
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:10,319
-Stark: What dance-off?
(Stammers) It's nothing.

1456
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:11,528
Like in footloose, the movie?

1457
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:13,072
Exactly like footloose.

1458
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:15,115
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?

1459
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:15,281
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...

1460
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:16,408
Spider-man: It never was.

1461
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:17,618
Stark: Don't encourage this,
all right?

1462
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:18,994
-Okay.
-We're getting no help

1463
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:20,663
-from flash Gordon here.
-Flash Gordon?

1464
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:21,872
By the way,
that's a compliment.

1465
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:23,957
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1466
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:27,878
That's 100% you.

1467
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:29,296
Stark: Your math
is blowing my mind.

1468
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:30,673
Mantis: Excuse me.

1469
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:35,094
But does your friend
often do that?

1470
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,806
Strange, we all right?

1471
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:47,940
(Gasps)

1472
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,024
(Panting)

1473
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:50,150
You're back. You're all right.

1474
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:52,027
-Dr strange: Hi.
-Hey, what was that?

1475
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:56,198
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.

1476
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:58,617
To see all
the possible outcomes

1477
01:23:58,701 --> 01:24:00,536
of the coming conflict.

1478
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:02,621
How many did you see?

1479
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:05,040
14,000,605.

1480
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:08,127
How many did we win?

1481
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,049
One.

1482
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:38,949
Thanos: The stone
had better be up there.

1483
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,870
For your sister's sake.

1484
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:08,520
Welcome, thanos, son of alars.

1485
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,859
Gamora, daughter of thanos.

1486
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:15,194
Thanos: You know us?

1487
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,907
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.

1488
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:22,075
Where is the soul stone?

1489
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:24,453
You should know...

1490
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,248
It extracts a terrible price.

1491
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,168
I am prepared.

1492
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:36,048
We all think that at first.

1493
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:42,888
We are all wrong.

1494
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,819
Thanos: How is it you know
this place So Well?

1495
01:25:56,985 --> 01:26:01,323
A lifetime ago,
i, too, sought the stones.

1496
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:04,493
I even held one in my hand.

1497
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:08,705
But it cast me out,
banished me here.

1498
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:12,918
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.

1499
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:24,555
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1500
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:27,641
As does what you fear.

1501
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:29,852
What's this?

1502
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:31,895
Red skull: The price.

1503
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:36,692
Soul holds a special place
among the infinity stones.

1504
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:41,780
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.

1505
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:44,992
Thanos: Tell me what it needs.

1506
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:48,704
Red skull: To ensure that
whoever possesses it...

1507
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:51,415
Understands its power...

1508
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:56,128
The stone demands a sacrifice.

1509
01:26:56,295 --> 01:26:57,838
Of what?

1510
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:00,215
In order to take the stone,

1511
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:02,718
you must lose
that which you love.

1512
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,598
A soul...

1513
01:27:07,598 --> 01:27:08,849
For a soul.

1514
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:19,359
(Laughing)

1515
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:26,909
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...

1516
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:29,244
A moment...

1517
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,664
When you got
what you deserved.

1518
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,169
And I was always
So disappointed.

1519
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,215
But now...

1520
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:49,264
You kill and torture...

1521
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:53,226
And you call it mercy.

1522
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:59,399
The universe has judged you.

1523
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:05,447
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.

1524
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,492
You failed.

1525
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,745
And do you wanna know why?

1526
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,539
Because you love nothing.

1527
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:16,875
No one.

1528
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:23,674
No.

1529
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,304
Really?

1530
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:31,431
Tears?

1531
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:34,184
They're not for him.

1532
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:49,658
Gamora: No.

1533
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,577
This isn't love.

1534
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:56,123
I ignored my destiny once.

1535
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,752
I cannot do that again.

1536
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:04,631
Even for you.

1537
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:18,729
(Clinks)

1538
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:24,735
(Gasps)

1539
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,199
I'm sorry, little one.

1540
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:36,288
No!

1541
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:43,688
(Gasps)

1542
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:16,721
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1543
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,140
I hope you're right
about this.

1544
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:21,184
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.

1545
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,285
When you said we were
going to open wakanda

1546
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,411
to the rest of the world...

1547
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:41,830
This is not what I imagined.

1548
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,957
And what did you imagine?

1549
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:45,250
The Olympics.

1550
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,169
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1551
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:02,767
Should we bow?

1552
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,186
Yeah, he's a king.

1553
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,521
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1554
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:09,816
-(Clears throat)
-What are you doing?

1555
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,902
Uh, we don't do that here.

1556
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,321
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1557
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:17,490
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.

1558
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:18,658
How we looking?

1559
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:20,702
You will have my kingsguard,

1560
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,747
the border tribe,
the dora milaje, and...

1561
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:27,626
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.

1562
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:31,671
How you been, buck?

1563
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:34,966
Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.

1564
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,063
Banner: Whoa.

1565
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:50,232
The structure is polymorphic.

1566
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,568
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.

1567
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,820
Why didn't you just reprogramme

1568
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:58,031
the synapses
to work collectively?

1569
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:02,369
Because we didn't think of it.

1570
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:04,079
I'm sure you did your best.

1571
01:33:04,246 --> 01:33:05,455
Can you do it?

1572
01:33:06,373 --> 01:33:09,668
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.

1573
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:13,004
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.

1574
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:14,464
It will take time, brother.

1575
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,217
How long?

1576
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,510
As long as you can give me.

1577
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,595
-(Kimoyo beads trilling)
-(Alarm beeping)

1578
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:25,392
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1579
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:44,536
Hey, cap, we got
a situation here.

1580
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:55,880
God, I love this place.

1581
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,674
War machine: (On radio) Yeah,
don't start celebrating yet, guys.

1582
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:59,676
We got more incoming
outside the dome.

1583
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:19,988
Vision: It's too late.

1584
01:34:21,031 --> 01:34:22,282
We need to destroy
the stone now.

1585
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,492
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.

1586
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:25,994
We will hold them off.

1587
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:29,581
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...

1588
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:30,749
You blow it to hell.

1589
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:32,250
I will.

1590
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:35,211
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defences.

1591
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:37,422
And get this man a shield.

1592
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:48,933
Rocket: (On radio)
I Don't think

1593
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:50,143
you get the scientifics here.

1594
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:52,771
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...

1595
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:54,314
You're gonna need something
a lot bigger

1596
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:55,440
to yank 'em loose.

1597
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:57,650
-Leave that to me.
-Leave it to you?

1598
01:34:57,817 --> 01:35:00,945
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...

1599
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:02,655
-(Yelps)
(Grunting)

1600
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,909
(Rocket yelling)

1601
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:10,372
Thor: (On radio)
Fire the engines!

1602
01:35:10,455 --> 01:35:11,790
(Yells)

1603
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:18,338
(Grunts)

1604
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:30,600
(Straining)
More power, rabbit!

1605
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:40,485
(Yells)

1606
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:47,784
(Rumbling)

1607
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,842
Well done, boy.

1608
01:36:05,635 --> 01:36:07,554
That's nidavellir.

1609
01:36:23,945 --> 01:36:25,780
(Powering down)

1610
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:28,616
Damn it.

1611
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:30,577
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

1612
01:36:30,743 --> 01:36:32,162
Eitri: The mechanism
is crippled.

1613
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:33,663
-What?
-With the Iris closed,

1614
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:34,789
I can't heat the metal.

1615
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:36,249
How long will it take
to heat it?

1616
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:39,085
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?

1617
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:42,130
I'm gonna hold it open.

1618
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:43,423
That's suicide.

1619
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:46,009
So is facing thanos
without that axe.

1620
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:48,094
(Grunts)

he brought you?

1722
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:55,701
Let me guess. Your home?

1723
01:47:00,081 --> 01:47:01,373
It was.

1724
01:47:04,126 --> 01:47:05,544
And it was beautiful.

1725
01:47:08,172 --> 01:47:10,633
Titan was like most planets.

1726
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,677
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1727
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:17,098
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1728
01:47:18,099 --> 01:47:19,308
Genocide.

1729
01:47:20,017 --> 01:47:25,439
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.

1730
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,608
They called me a madman.

1731
01:47:28,317 --> 01:47:30,569
And what I predicted
came to pass.

1732

you're a prophet.

1735
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:43,332
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1736
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:53,509
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1737
01:47:53,509 --> 01:47:55,010
I'd finally rest...

1738
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:52,174
And then what?

1739
01:47:55,803 --> 01:47:58,931
And watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1740
01:48:00,099 --> 01:48:03,644
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

equal to yours.

What?

1792
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:35,522
He took her to vormir.

1793
01:51:36,148 --> 01:51:38,108
He came back
with the soul stone.

1794
01:51:38,901 --> 01:51:45,491
But she didn't.

1795
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:46,367
Okay, quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?

1796
01:51:46,367 --> 01:51:49,828
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1797
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,081
Tell me she's lying.

1798
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:57,336
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!

1799
01:51:58,796 --> 01:52:02,216
I had to.

-How much for the gun?
-Not for sale.

1818
01:53:34,183 --> 01:53:36,059
Okay. How much for the arm?

1819
01:53:37,936 --> 01:53:39,938

Noticed you've copied
my beard.

(Grunting)

1825

By the way, this is
a friend of mine, tree.

Why was she up there
all this time?

1837
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:05,607
She's on the field. Take it.

This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.

1854

This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the hulk.

I thought you were formidable,
machine.

You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.

02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:23,266
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1952
02:05:47,749 --> 02:05:48,750
Wanda.

1953
02:05:49,876 --> 02:05:51,169
It's time.

1954
02:05:51,336 --> 02:05:52,337
No.

1955
02:05:52,503 --> 02:05:54,714
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.

1956
02:05:54,881 --> 02:05:56,299
Look at me.

1957
02:05:56,466 --> 02:05:57,634
You have the power
to destroy the stone.

1958
02:05:57,717 --> 02:05:58,718
Don't.

1959
02:05:58,801 --> 02:05:59,928
You must do it. Wanda, please.

1960
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:04,515
We are out of time.

1961
02:06:05,308 --> 02:06:06,434
I can't.

1962
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:08,019
Yes, you can.

1963
02:06:08,686 --> 02:06:09,938
You can.

1964
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:13,733
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.

1965
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:17,612
It's not fair.

1966
02:06:18,821 --> 02:06:20,406
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.

1967
02:06:22,367 --> 02:06:23,826
It's all right.

1968
02:06:25,245 --> 02:06:26,955
You could never hurt me.

1969
02:06:36,005 --> 02:06:37,799
I just feel you.

1970
02:07:46,326 --> 02:07:47,952
(Yelling)

1971
02:08:00,923 --> 02:08:02,050
It's all right.

1972
02:08:11,976 --> 02:08:13,311
It's all right.

1973
02:08:17,648 --> 02:08:18,733
I love you.

1974
02:08:33,539 --> 02:08:35,583
(Panting)

1975
02:08:48,054 --> 02:08:50,181
I understand, my child.

1976
02:08:51,724 --> 02:08:53,351
Better than anyone.

1977
02:08:55,019 --> 02:08:56,938
You could never.

1978
02:09:01,776 --> 02:09:04,779
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1979
02:09:06,572 --> 02:09:09,200
But now is no time to mourn.

1980
02:09:11,452 --> 02:09:15,456
Now is no time at all.

1981
02:09:38,771 --> 02:09:39,772
No!

1982
02:09:44,110 --> 02:09:45,111
(Choking)

1983
02:10:09,969 --> 02:10:11,220
(Screams)

1984
02:10:21,355 --> 02:10:22,356
(Grunts)

1985
02:10:36,037 --> 02:10:37,663
(Panting)

1986
02:10:37,747 --> 02:10:39,207
I told you...

1987
02:10:40,625 --> 02:10:42,418
You'd die for that.

1988
02:10:43,544 --> 02:10:48,591
(Screams)

1989
02:10:48,591 --> 02:10:49,759
(Groans)

1990
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:54,013
(Laboured breathing)

1991
02:10:56,766 --> 02:10:58,518
(Weakly) You should have...

1992
02:11:01,145 --> 02:11:02,605
You should...

1993
02:11:05,107 --> 02:11:08,361
You should have
gone for the head.

1994
02:11:10,279 --> 02:11:11,280
No!

1995
02:11:44,689 --> 02:11:45,898
Daughter?

1996
02:11:53,531 --> 02:11:54,907
Did you do it?

1997
02:11:56,826 --> 02:11:57,827
Yes.

1998
02:12:06,252 --> 02:12:07,837
What did it cost?

1999
02:12:11,549 --> 02:12:13,050
Everything.

2000
02:12:23,311 --> 02:12:24,854
What did you do?

2001
02:12:26,105 --> 02:12:27,607
What'd you do?

2002
02:12:36,699 --> 02:12:38,409
(Panting)

2003
02:12:41,245 --> 02:12:42,622
Where'd he go?

2004
02:12:45,541 --> 02:12:46,542
Thor.

2005
02:12:46,751 --> 02:12:48,294
(Panting)

2006
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,547
Where'd he go?

2007
02:12:51,714 --> 02:12:52,965
Bucky: Steve?

2008
02:13:16,405 --> 02:13:18,407
(All speaking xhosa)

2009
02:13:18,491 --> 02:13:20,117
(All groaning)

2010
02:13:27,792 --> 02:13:30,086
Up, general. Up!

2011
02:13:30,670 --> 02:13:32,088
This is no place to die.

2012
02:13:32,171 --> 02:13:33,714
(Groans)

2013
02:13:44,517 --> 02:13:45,685
(Speaks xhosa)

2014
02:13:47,144 --> 02:13:48,729
(Weakly) I am groot.

2015
02:13:48,813 --> 02:13:50,356
-(Okoye shouts in xhosa)
-Rocket: Oh...

2016
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:53,317
No, no, no!

2017
02:13:54,151 --> 02:13:56,987
Groot! No.

2018
02:14:06,038 --> 02:14:07,248
(Groans)

2019
02:14:10,418 --> 02:14:11,585
Sam!

2020
02:14:13,003 --> 02:14:15,548
(Whimpering)

2021
02:14:15,631 --> 02:14:17,258
Sam, where you at?

2022
02:14:18,384 --> 02:14:19,385
(Thunder rumbling)

2023
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:28,811
Something's happening.

2024
02:14:35,943 --> 02:14:37,945
(Panting)

2025
02:14:40,948 --> 02:14:42,116
Quill?

2026
02:14:49,498 --> 02:14:50,666
Steady, quill.

2027
02:14:50,833 --> 02:14:51,959
Oh, man.

2028
02:14:56,130 --> 02:14:57,131
Dr strange: Tony.

2029
02:15:00,676 --> 02:15:03,137
There was no other way.

2030
02:15:08,809 --> 02:15:09,810
Spider-man: Mr stark?

2031
02:15:14,273 --> 02:15:15,608
I Don't feel So good.

2032
02:15:17,693 --> 02:15:18,694
You're all right.

2033
02:15:18,778 --> 02:15:19,862
I Don't... I Don't know
what's happening.

2034
02:15:19,945 --> 02:15:21,489
I Don't know... (Groans)

2035
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:24,325
I Don't want to go.

2036
02:15:24,408 --> 02:15:26,118
I Don't want to go, sir.
Please.

2037
02:15:26,285 --> 02:15:28,996
Please, I Don't want to go.
I Don't want to go.

2038
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:35,044
(Softly) I'm sorry.

2039
02:15:49,892 --> 02:15:51,352
He did it.

2040
02:16:07,117 --> 02:16:09,119
(Panting)

2041
02:16:16,126 --> 02:16:19,338
What is this?
What the hell is happening?

2042
02:16:36,230 --> 02:16:37,982
Oh, god.

2043
02:17:17,563 --> 02:17:19,064
(Sighs deeply)

2044
02:27:34,262 --> 02:27:35,597
Fury: Still no word
from stark?

2045
02:27:35,764 --> 02:27:37,015
Hill: No, not yet.

2046
02:27:37,182 --> 02:27:38,475
We're watching every satellite

2047
02:27:38,558 --> 02:27:40,435
on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.

2048
02:27:40,519 --> 02:27:42,479
-(Beeping)
_fury: What is it?

2049
02:27:42,646 --> 02:27:44,981
Hill: Multiple bogeys
over wakanda.

2050
02:27:45,148 --> 02:27:47,067
Fury: Same energy signature
as New York?

2051
02:27:47,234 --> 02:27:48,568
Hill: Ten times bigger.

2052
02:27:50,070 --> 02:27:51,196
Fury: Tell klein
we'll meet him at...

2053
02:27:51,279 --> 02:27:52,322
-Hill: Nick! Nick!
(Tyres screech)

2054
02:27:52,405 --> 02:27:53,698
(Crashes)

2055
02:28:05,961 --> 02:28:07,254
Fury: They okay?

2056
02:28:08,255 --> 02:28:10,006
There's no one here.

2057
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:12,092
(Helicopter blades whirring)

2058
02:28:18,265 --> 02:28:19,474
(People screaming)

2059
02:28:19,558 --> 02:28:21,059
Call control.

2060
02:28:21,810 --> 02:28:23,103
Code red.

2061
02:28:23,770 --> 02:28:24,771
Nick.

2062
02:28:26,439 --> 02:28:27,440
Fury: Hill.

2063
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:38,535
(Siren wailing in distance)

2064
02:28:41,037 --> 02:28:42,038
(Pager beeps)

2065
02:28:42,372 --> 02:28:43,540
Oh, no.

2066
02:28:45,166 --> 02:28:46,167
Mother...

2067
02:28:52,757 --> 02:28:54,217
(Beeping)
