1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,087
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,254 --> 00:00:04,505
What happened?

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:07,800
Gregor. His loyalty lies with Kovar.
But Gregor is Pakhan.

4
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:09,047
There is nothing we can do.

5
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,428
We can kill him.

6
00:00:10,595 --> 00:00:12,847
These corrupt cops are taking down
big drug scores.

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,766
You said you're not a criminal
'cause you believe in justice.

8
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,644
Ask yourself, Warner.
Is that still the case?

9
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,689
Now, what are the odds of Oliver Queen

10
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:24,108
and the Green Arrow
being in Russia at the same time?

11
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,069
Very good...
if Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow.

12
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:30,281
Four years ago,
The Hood took down Justin Claybourne.

13
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:33,117
I have been working on a location
for Claybourne's mistress.

14
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:35,286
Prometheus' mother, we find her...

15
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:37,121
We find the name for this son of a bitch.

16
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,251
Thanks for coming along.

17
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:45,171
I know that being my body man
isn't your job anymore.

18
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,632
Sure it is.
Just a different suit, that's all.

19
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,508
Now, we're sure this is the address?

20
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,718
Yeah, Felicity is.

21
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,196
According to her, this is the house

22
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,060
that Justin Claybourne
bought for his mistress.

23
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,224
Think she'll play ball?

24
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:58,142
- That depends.
- On what?

25
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:01,896
Whether or not she knows
her son is Prometheus.

26
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,321
Amanda Westfield?

27
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,572
Yes?

28
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,699
Hi. My name is Oliver Queen...

29
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,826
I know who you are.

30
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,495
Mayor of Star City.

31
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,163
May I come in?

32
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:28,631
Very lovely home.

33
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,969
For the past several months,

34
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:36,180
there has been a serial murderer

35
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:38,641
that has been terrorizing Star City.

36
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:42,812
There is reason to believe
that this individual is your son.

37
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:48,234
I haven't seen my son
since Justin Claybourne's funeral.

38
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,905
But you know he's become something else,

39
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,699
someone else.

40
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:58,244
It's why you live here,
far away from Star City.

41
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:00,913
I moved away because
there was nothing left for me there.

42
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,666
Miss Westfield,
your son is an incredibly capable

43
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,752
and incredibly dangerous individual.

44
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:11,173
He has erased virtually all traces
of his identity from the Internet.

45
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,050
And I am...

46
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,554
Well, I am here simply
to ask you for his name.

47
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,016
And what happens when you find him?

48
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,268
He needs help. He...

49
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,604
I want him to get that help.

50
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,235
What you want...

51
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,740
Is to cage him up like an animal.

52
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:38,409
Like the animal who killed his father.

53
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:41,495
He put an arrow in his chest.

54
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,707
What kind of monster does that?

55
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,667
Whatever my son is doing,

56
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,129
he's doing it because he is hurt
and he is scared.

57
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:54,425
And I will not help you destroy his life.

58
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,427
Innocent people are dying,

59
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,929
and you might be our only chance
to save them.

60
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,473
Get out of my house.

61
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,185
I'm easily reachable
if you change your mind.

62
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,729
I won't.

63
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,087
Hey! Get back to your seat!

64
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,130
Can't a girl stretch her legs a little?

65
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,424
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

66
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:36,634
And you're not going to.

67
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,928
Guards aren't allowed
to fraternize with prisoners.

68
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:42,640
So, take me out of these cuffs

69
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,768
and I won't be a prisoner anymore.

70
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,187
Sounds fun, but I'd lose my job.

71
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,648
How about your life instead?

72
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,665
This is your stop, ladies.

73
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:08,916
Come on, ladies. Go!

74
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:13,879
Next phase?

75
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:17,425
Star City. Time to return home.

76
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,103
How'd it go with Mama Prometheus?

77
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,063
- It didn't.
- She's probably protecting him.

78
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,023
Wow. My mom could
barely handle me being gay.

79
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,192
Says she hasn't seen him
in over four years,

80
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,819
but maybe they emailed.

81
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,028
What is that?

82
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,037
Just a little toy
that Curtis and I whipped up

83
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:43,075
in case the Prometheus apple
didn't fall too far from the tree.

84
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,702
It's a sniffer device.

85
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,412
It basically pulls electronic data

86
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,139
from any hard drives or devices nearby.

87
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,748
- Did it work?
- Oh, yeah.

88
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,084
A little too well.
I got a petabyte worth of data here.

89
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,520
It's gonna take me a while
to work through.

90
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,545
Which is fine

91
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,565
because something happened
while you and John were away.

92
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:57,715
- What?
- Check it out.

93
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,675
Those are some familiar faces.

94
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,137
- What happened?
- Jailbreak led by Liza Warner.

95
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,532
Didn't you put China White
in prison, like, forever ago?

96
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:06,640
Yeah, a couple times.

97
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,350
Why does she look so familiar?

98
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,728
Maybe she arrested you once.
She used to be a cop.

99
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:11,937
Warner was, too.

100
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,540
Lance convinced her
to turn over a new leaf,

101
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,251
which, I'm guessing that these ladies
convinced her to turn back over.

102
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,502
Well, according to the prisoners,

103
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,712
they took the Corrections Department bus

104
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,963
and they're headed towards Star City.

105
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,907
Let's get to work on finding them.
We have to go.

106
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:22,990
Yeah.

107
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,557
Hey, you ready for your big moment?

108
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,161
Oh. It's just a swearing-in ceremony.

109
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,663
You're gonna be a cop again, Dinah.
It's no small thing.

110
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,625
Yeah, I guess it's not.

111
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,522
The city council wanted me
to remind you they have a vote scheduled

112
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,590
right after the SCPD swearing-in ceremony.

113
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,258
Right, right, right.

114
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,985
They're gonna want to get
the show on the road, I totally get it.

115
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,137
Hi...

116
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,431
- I'm gonna need a minute or two, please.
- Mmm-hmm.

117
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,267
- Hi.
- Hi.

118
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,937
- Hey. Come here.
- How are you?

119
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,439
Mmm.

120
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,901
- What was that for?
- That was, "I'm sorry."

121
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,820
For cancelling dinner on me last night?

122
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,090
And the previous two times
that I also cancelled dinner, yes.

123
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,154
Mmm-hmm. Does this mean
I'll get to see you tonight?

124
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,483
Do you wanna have dinner
with the City Comptroller, too?

125
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,263
- Am I ever gonna see you again?
- Of course.

126
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,330
Okay.

127
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,123
Is everything okay?

128
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,710
Yeah, I think so.

129
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,796
Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

130
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,048
No, no, definitely not.

131
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,633
Uh...

132
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:27,555
Whatever is it, just, um, lay it on me.
What's up?

133
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,143
- Are you the Green Arrow?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,646
Really?

135
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,773
No!

136
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,652
No. I'm sorry, I thought that
you were doing a joking thing. I mean...

137
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,280
So I did a joking thing back. Are you not?

138
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,991
I was working on a different story,

139
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,120
and, well, some things came up
that relate to you and...

140
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:55,124
And then you just immediately jumped
to the most insane conclusion possible?

141
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:59,753
So that's a "no" for the record?

142
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,922
No. For the record.

143
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,092
Well, good.

144
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,053
'Cause I think our relationship
is complicated enough already

145
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,346
just with you being mayor.

146
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,514
Yeah, so do I.

147
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,266
Mr. Mayor, everyone's waiting.

148
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,494
- I have to go to this ceremony. Can I...
- Of course.

149
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,853
Can I show you out?

150
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,984
So, I figure that we go after Gregor
at the bathhouse

151
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,671
because he's gonna have the least number
of men guarding him and...

152
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:27,740
I mean, quite frankly, we can be sure
that he's not packing.

153
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:31,243
- Anyway, he has men here, here, and here...
- No. No, no, no, no.

154
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,536
No, what?

155
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,747
Bathhouse is Gregor's turf.

156
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,499
You cannot do it on your own.

157
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,834
- Okay.
- We need army.

158
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,628
Well then, who can we trust, Anatoly?

159
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,921
Because we're basically
talking about a coup.

160
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,300
Lying here
with my ass hanging out like baby.

161
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,804
Don't worry about my men.
They are loyal to me.

162
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:52,431
Soam I.

163
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:56,352
And, look, I'm gonna stay here

164
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,314
until we take out Gregor
and we protect the Bratva.

165
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,651
Ty skazal, stay? You going to leave?

166
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,903
Look, Anatoly, I realized I...

167
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,821
I have to get back to my life.

168
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:13,118
But then I saw what Gregor did to you
because of me, and...

169
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,371
You're a sin-eater, Oliver.

170
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:20,668
In some cultures, there's this guy
who lives on the edge of village.

171
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:25,714
And, when somebody dies,
they put body there

172
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:29,218
and cover with fruits and vegetables,
and he eats that.

173
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:31,595
He eats their sins?

174
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:32,930
Yes.

175
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,391
So they go on to the afterlife, yeah.

176
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,851
He takes their sins

177
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,354
as his own.

178
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,606
You are very much like...

179
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,275
What?

180
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:47,778
In the past ten minutes,

181
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:51,365
I've seen the same orderly pass by
five times with an empty stretcher.

182
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,826
Could be one of Gregor's men.

183
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,161
At any rate, they know that you are back.

184
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,581
Or they're just here
to finish the job on you. Either way...

185
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,752
It is time for me to kak ty skazhesh,
stretch my legs.

186
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,170
- Here, come on.
- Thank you.

187
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,234
I will always have the courage
to hold myself and others accountable

188
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,259
for our actions.

189
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,555
"I will always uphold the Constitution,
my community, and the agency I serve."

190
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:17,224
I will always uphold the Constitution,
my community,

191
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,976
and the agency which I serve.

192
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:21,395
Welcome to the SCPD, Officer Drake.

193
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,948
Is everything okay with Susan?

194
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,950
Yeah. What... Why?

195
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:38,370
Just, you know, your assistant
was clocking a little tension, some...

196
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,914
Thea, is my assistant your mole?

197
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,959
I like to think of him
more as like my informant.

198
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,253
Okay, what's going on?

199
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,271
Susan asked me if I was the Green Arrow.

200
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,176
Wait. What did you say to her?

201
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,886
I handled it.

202
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,822
I've been doing this
for a little while now.

203
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,406
Can I talk to you for a minute, please?

204
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:59,909
Quentin, if I delay this vote any more,
I'm gonna get impeached.

205
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,728
Listen to me,
Liza Warner escaped last night.

206
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,897
And China White, and Carrie Cutter.
We're on it.

207
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:09,026
As a matter of fact, we are on it
sooner than I thought.

208
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,737
- Felicity has their location.
- Great. Where am I going?

209
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,531
I have put all three
of these women away, Quentin.

210
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,176
This is nothing the team can't handle.

211
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,994
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I know that.
But this is personal, Oliver.

212
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,506
Seems like we're a little late.

213
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,842
Looks like China White
had a falling out with the Triad.

214
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,887
This is more than just a "falling out".
This is a massacre.

215
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:42,226
Overwatch, all we've got here are bodies,
and a security camera.

216
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,727
On it.

217
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,486
That's Warner.

218
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,113
This isn't on you, Quentin.

219
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,406
I'm not so sure about that.

220
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,451
But either way, we gotta stop
whatever it is these women are up to

221
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,578
before more bodies drop.

222
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,337
Huh?

223
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,887
So, she said, "Where is the depository?"

224
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,374
I don't think she got her answer.

225
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,140
What "depository" is she talking about?

226
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,268
Well, I mean,
the word could also mean "storage."

227
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,955
So the three of them are looking
for something the Triad is storing?

228
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,139
But that could mean anything.

229
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,457
The Triad's got stashes all over the city.

230
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,875
Whatever these three are looking for,

231
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,794
they just killed an awful lot of people
trying to find it.

232
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:36,071
We want them to stop dropping bodies,
we gotta find it first.

233
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,618
It's all right.

234
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,262
Regretting your choice not to go home?

235
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:01,555
Not yet.

236
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,775
Come on, come on, come on.

237
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:20,991
That coup against Gregor?
That might be short-lived like us.

238
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,500
This just arrived, boss.

239
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,629
- What is it?
- No idea, but it said urgent, so...

240
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,680
Chapman, I want the entire ACU
in the conference room in five minutes.

241
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,018
Hey! Long time no see.

242
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,020
- What're you doing down here?
- Oh...

243
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,856
You know, just some damage control.
You have a minute?

244
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,150
Yeah, for you? Anything. What's up?

245
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,654
- Well, it's, um, Susan Williams.
- Hmm.

246
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,949
She's suspecting
that Oliver's the Green Arrow.

247
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,285
Why? I mean, other than the fact
that he is, but why?

248
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,663
I don't know. I mean, I...

249
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,623
He says that she confronted him about it,

250
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,669
and then, he claims he put it to bed,
but she's not just gonna drop this.

251
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,380
Agreed. What are we gonna do?

252
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,050
Hack into her computer,
and find out what's there and delete it?

253
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,635
Yeah, copy that.

254
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,221
Susan William's computer... I'm in.

255
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,224
- That was fast.
- Yeah, well, her password is "1-2-3-4".

256
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,518
And she has a file here
named "Oliver Queen info"

257
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,436
because she is super original.

258
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,732
- Oh, God. She has...
- Everything.

259
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,586
- She's been connecting the dots.
- This entire time.

260
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,796
We have to delete all of this.

261
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,673
Well, even if we do,
she got this from an outside source.

262
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,817
She's just gonna be able to get it again,
and again...

263
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:44,992
Okay, so what do we do?

264
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,664
Fashion make-over?

265
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,916
Kevlar weave in the jacket.

266
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,394
Figured if I was gonna be back
in the field,

267
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,086
I could have a little more protection.

268
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,588
There he is.

269
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,515
James Wong?

270
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,268
We wanna have a little chat
about your dead Triad friends.

271
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,186
I didn't have anything to do with that.

272
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,354
We know.

273
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,274
But what we wanna know
is what is the chucang?

274
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:18,442
What?

275
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,278
The "depository," the "storage,"
whatever it is.

276
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,698
Tobias Church...

277
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:25,866
Is dead.

278
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,659
Yeah, and he never got to spend

279
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,203
the $100,000,000 he got
from the AmerTek deal.

280
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:31,997
That's the "depository."

281
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,498
His cash stash.

282
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,250
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

283
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,336
Do we believe him?

284
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,012
See? If I'd done that,
I would've sprained my wrist.

285
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,267
So what is this place?

286
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,478
Los Halcones' money laundering facility.

287
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,164
It's likely Warner and her new friends

288
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,899
are after $100,000,000
that Tobias Church left behind.

289
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,083
And you think Church's old running buddies
might know where it is.

290
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,433
Wild Dog and Mr. Terrific
are staking out the Bertinellis.

291
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,948
Dinah and Spartan have eyes on the Bratva.

292
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,286
You know,
you gotta get that new girl a codename.

293
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:17,084
Well, when she's ready,
I was considering "Black Canary."

294
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,920
You all right with that?

295
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,465
Well, so long as she does Laurel proud.

296
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,470
So, you really think
Warner's gonna show up here?

297
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:30,806
Forget I asked.

298
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,689
We don't have time for that, Cutter.

299
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,443
Are you kidding me?
These things are expensive.

300
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,671
We find the money,
you won't have to worry about that.

301
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,447
Yeah, and when's that gonna happen?

302
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,616
Not one of these idiots knew a thing.

303
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,911
No, but they gave me the name
of someone who does.

304
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,497
Don't worry,
everything is going down as planned.

305
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,790
Think again!

306
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,668
You have failed this city.

307
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,378
You're under arrest!

308
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,272
Get on the floor
with your hands behind your head.

309
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,381
On the ground!

310
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,759
I'm good. Besides, I owe
this son of a bitch some payback.

311
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,577
Freeze! Get on the floor!

312
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,496
I listened to you once.
I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.

313
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,850
Since when is doing the right thing
been a mistake, Liza?

314
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,625
Since you turned out to be a liar!

315
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,752
I was all in, Quentin.

316
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,923
You convinced me to turn myself in,
turn my life around.

317
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,051
And then one day, I'm in the TV room
and what do I see?

318
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,303
A news report about you

319
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,139
working for one of the worst terrorists
this city has ever seen!

320
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,933
He threatened my daughter, Liza.

321
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,643
And so you did what you had to.

322
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:00,604
Why shouldn't I do the same for myself?

323
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,330
Because what I did, and what you're doing
are not the same thing!

324
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,693
Sure they are.
We all do whatever it takes to survive.

325
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,404
And if that means breaking a few laws,

326
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:12,949
or betraying the people
who believe in you, so be it.

327
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,945
What are you doing?
You're letting them get away!

328
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,054
They're not our target.

329
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,724
You're under arrest for the murder
of Detective William Malone.

330
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,316
Listen to me, you're making a mistake.

331
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,485
Drop the bow,
or we will light your ass up.

332
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,196
Fine.

333
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,163
Son of a bitch!

334
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,810
What do you mean,
they were after you?

335
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,086
Somehow, they found out about Billy.

336
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:07,879
What?

337
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,006
I'm with her. What're you talking about?

338
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:12,968
Prometheus orchestrated things
so Oliver would kill Billy Malone.

339
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,220
- What?
- DA Chase

340
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,180
decided that we should cover it up, but...

341
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,599
But somehow the ACU knows

342
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,685
and thinks that you
took out one of their own.

343
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,812
We're gonna have to handle this,
but right now,

344
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,522
every second that we're down here

345
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,489
that crew is getting closer
to Church's money.

346
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,608
The more money they have,

347
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,503
the more guns they can buy
and more damage they can do.

348
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,964
Okay, let me talk with Pike,
I'll see if I can get him to stand down.

349
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:36,199
Look, Quentin, I appreciate that,
but I gotta handle it this time.

350
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,367
Why?

351
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,160
Because I'm the mayor.

352
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,042
A lot of firepower in this room.

353
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,378
What's going on?

354
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,047
We just have a couple questions
for you, Captain.

355
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,968
We heard the ACU attempted to apprehend
the Green Arrow last night, is that true?

356
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,344
One hundred percent.

357
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,871
He's a person of interest
in the murder of Detective Malone.

358
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,265
Based on what evidence?

359
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,104
This was delivered to me yesterday.

360
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,399
Open it. You'll see what I saw.

361
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,776
The ME report for Billy Malone's autopsy.

362
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:16,072
Cause of death was an arrow consistent
with the ones the Green Arrow uses.

363
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,241
This wasn't
in the original examiner's report?

364
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,453
That one said the cause of death
was undetermined.

365
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,413
I think we're looking at a cover-up.

366
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,517
There's a lot of whack-jobs running around
with bows and arrows these days.

367
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,981
Doesn't mean it was the Green Arrow.

368
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:31,629
Like I said, the edgework on the wounds
was consistent with his arrows.

369
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:36,134
Captain Pike, I have it on good authority
that the Green Arrow was not responsible.

370
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,553
On whose authority?

371
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,930
Right now, I'm not at liberty to say.

372
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,777
Well then, I'm not at liberty
to drop this.

373
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,353
Look, we're dealing
with a cop killer here.

374
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,982
If that's all, I've got a lot of work.

375
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:54,277
I'll keep you gentlemen posted
on the status of this investigation.

376
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,281
I wouldn't panic just yet.

377
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,533
We don't even know
if that report's legitimate.

378
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,911
I think it's safe to say that it is.

379
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,288
Question is, who sent it to Pike?

380
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,458
Adrian, I'm sorry.
Could we have the room, please?

381
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,841
It was Prometheus.

382
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,511
Isn't that a little paranoid?

383
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,138
I mean, I know that guy has given you
reason to be, but...

384
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,433
The envelope that Pike gave me
was postmarked from Opal City.

385
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,601
Yeah, so?

386
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,978
Prometheus' mother is from Opal City.

387
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,147
I'm not gonna even gonna ask
how you know that.

388
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,482
I went to see her.

389
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,485
This is Prometheus telling me
that he knows about that.

390
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,904
And he is pushing back,
he is keeping me in check

391
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,324
because he knows that I can't make a move
with the ACU breathing down my neck!

392
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,909
Well, you can't just give up.

393
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:48,665
I have to go.

394
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:54,421
Hey. Sorry, I got your text and I...

395
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:59,092
Huh. Okay. Look like you're having
as bad aday as I am.

396
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,302
Really? Did you get fired today, too?

397
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:02,971
What?

398
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,686
My producer called me out on the carpet.

399
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,355
Apparently, they received an anonymous tip

400
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:16,067
that I have been plagiarizing
my stories for the past two years.

401
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:19,863
And my laptop is filled
with incriminating evidence.

402
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,197
Your laptop?

403
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,700
It has all the fingerprints
of a hatchet job.

404
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:27,579
- Okay, Susan...
- And I have to wonder about the timing.

405
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,747
Because...

406
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,459
nothing like this has ever happened to me

407
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,503
before I asked
whether you were the Green Arrow.

408
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,838
Susan.

409
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,592
I swear to you,

410
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:44,304
I didn't have anything to do with this,
I don't know anything about this.

411
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:51,019
And you're going to stand here and tell me
that you're not the Green Arrow?

412
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:54,898
Because that tattoo on your chest
marks you as a Bratva Captain.

413
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,900
- Okay...
- I've got a photo

414
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,569
of you with the Bratva in Russia

415
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,447
at the same time that you were supposed
to be on a deserted island.

416
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,949
I've got another photo, same time,

417
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:08,495
of a man in a hood with a bow and arrow
operating in Russia.

418
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:12,790
But now, of course,
I can't go public with any of it

419
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,919
because I've been thoroughly discredited.

420
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,923
- So, well done.
- If you could just...

421
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,800
Unless the next words out of your mouth

422
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,553
aren't going to be a lie,

423
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,515
I'd really prefer
if you just said nothing at all.

424
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,069
Hey.

425
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,363
Hey, what's going on?

426
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,950
Did you hack Susan Williams' computer?

427
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:48,785
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Back up. You don't...

428
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,622
Did you hack Susan Williams' computer?

429
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,418
- Yes.
- What were you thinking?

430
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,185
I was thinking that you were one
news story away from being outed.

431
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,107
Thea asked me to put a few things
on Susan's computer and...

432
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,592
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Thea asked you?

433
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,888
Yes. I don't know what she's planning
on doing, she said she had it handled.

434
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,766
Why, what did she do?

435
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,817
We'll have to make a run for it.
You ready?

436
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,277
Konechno.

437
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,821
Anatoly Knyazev.

438
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:59,188
- What are you doing?
- I surrender, and he lets you live.

439
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,898
He will kill you.

440
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:05,403
He's going to kill both of us.
We are trapped, Anatoly.

441
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,115
Only one of us is gonna make it
out of this alive.

442
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:15,413
I am avtoritet. There is no way you are
going to suffer for my sins, Oliver.

443
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,207
That's why I'm not giving you a choice.

444
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:23,713
Yeah.

445
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:28,176
Hey, stranger.
Haven't seen you around much today.

446
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,346
Yeah, you know,
just busy taking out the trash.

447
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,389
Yeah? Sanitation?

448
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,434
More like public relations. Uh...

449
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,189
I hear Green Arrow is public enemy
number one again.

450
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:43,608
Yeah, well, now Oliver thinks

451
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:46,653
that he can't make a move on Warner
and her crew. Yeah.

452
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:48,863
And what do you think?

453
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,240
I think that Warner's my mess to clean up.

454
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:55,495
And I'm assuming Oliver
said that's not the case?

455
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,830
What Oliver doesn't know

456
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:02,293
is that the reason her rehabilitation
was short-lived

457
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,214
was because she caught my confessing
to working with Damien Darhk on TV.

458
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,465
Oh, wow.

459
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,675
Yeah.

460
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,178
That is an unbelievable

461
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,263
load of crap, Quentin.

462
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:17,767
- What?
- Liza Warner is a criminal.

463
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,603
You didn't make her into one.

464
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:25,858
You've got to stop taking responsibility
for other people's sins.

465
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,490
You know, I really like
how wise you're getting lately.

466
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,410
That's just because I have

467
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,621
committed my own sin today.

468
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,456
What sin?

469
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,501
Don't worry about it.

470
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:47,130
Why don't you worry about
catching Liza Warner?

471
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:52,510
Not because you are responsible
but because she's a criminal.

472
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,642
Let's get moving, yo.

473
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,314
Hey, hey. What's this now?

474
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,193
- Looks like three hot chicks. Huh?
- Especially this one.

475
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:17,952
- Thanks for that.
- Anything for a friend.

476
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,635
We're looking for
Tobias Church's rainy day account.

477
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:40,975
The AmerTek money?
I tell you where it is, you let me go?

478
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:43,686
No. You're gonna show us where it is.

479
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:46,689
- What about the Green Arrow?
- The ACU is all over his ass.

480
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:49,734
We've got nothing to worry about.
Let's go!

481
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:05,208
You asked to see me?

482
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,668
Did you know that Susan got fired today?

483
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,047
I didn't know she was
gonna get fired, Oliver.

484
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:13,007
You should have come to me with this.

485
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,718
Listen, Ollie,
I just wanted to discredit her...

486
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:18,805
Thea, you should have come
to me with this!

487
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,432
And then what?

488
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,977
We would have the same conversation
we are having right now.

489
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:29,273
I would have told you that she was going
to out you as the Green Arrow...

490
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,193
- She wouldn't do that to me.
- And then you would say that.

491
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,280
Look, Ollie, the only reason
I didn't tell you

492
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:39,909
was because I was trying to keep
your hands clean.

493
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:43,955
- I know you care about her, so I...
- I do care about her.

494
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:48,751
I also care that
you destroyed her reputation.

495
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,754
She's gonna have a tough time
finding a decent job,

496
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:56,676
she's certainly not gonna find a job
in journalism. You just blew up her life!

497
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,264
Honestly, I didn't mean for it
to go this far.

498
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,015
Yes, you did.

499
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:05,893
You knew exactly what you were doing.

500
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:10,106
And that's the part
that I don't understand.

501
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,694
Who does that to a person?

502
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:19,615
You got a minute?

503
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,785
Yeah. We're done here.

504
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,581
What do you need?

505
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,628
Warner and her crew just hit
the Bertinellis. One dead,

506
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,172
two in critical condition,
and they kidnapped number four.

507
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,985
Yeah, that's a change in their MO,
they haven't been abducting people.

508
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,444
Yeah, the guy they took is Enzo Russo.

509
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,148
I'm thinking they took him 'cause
he knows where this depository is.

510
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,140
I'm thinking, you know, maybe,

511
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:47,351
Felicity can hack his cell,
we can track him that way.

512
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,438
No. We have to let
the police handle this one.

513
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,566
- What?
- The ACU will be all over me.

514
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:57,695
- Okay, then send the team.
- I'm not risking anyone getting arrested.

515
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:01,824
- What, you're just giving up now?
- Prometheus hasn't given me a choice.

516
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,534
Um...

517
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,330
Neither did Slade Wilson, or Damien Darhk,

518
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,541
but with those guys, you didn't just pick
up your football and go home.

519
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,335
- This is different.
- How?

520
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,795
Because what's happening now,

521
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,883
it's not something that Prometheus did.

522
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,011
It's something I did.

523
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:26,057
I mean, you're talking about Malone,
right? That was Prometheus.

524
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,351
I fired the arrows.

525
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,773
Listen.

526
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:39,403
Earlier, Thea was talking to me about
not taking on other people's sins.

527
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:45,618
What happened with Malone,
that's on Prometheus, not you.

528
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,372
Well, Quentin, that advice
would mean a little bit more

529
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,999
if it wasn't coming from Thea right now.

530
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,085
Well, I don't know what that means.

531
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:58,297
But I do know that if you're letting
Prometheus, ACU, or anyone else

532
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:02,760
keep you from stopping Warner
and her buddies,

533
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,429
then justice isn't being served.

534
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,603
I will have Felicity look
at Russo's phone.

535
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,065
That's what I wanted to hear.
I'll take another run at Pike.

536
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:18,192
No, I'll do it.

537
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:20,861
You sure?

538
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:25,950
I'm sure that I don't want Malone's death
to have been for nothing.

539
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,915
- Mr. Mayor.
- You have a minute for me?

540
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:36,377
Of course. What can I do for you?

541
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,548
It's about the Green Arrow.

542
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,967
- Sir, we've been over this.
- I know.

543
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:46,595
And I know that I told you
that the Green Arrow was not

544
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,848
responsible for Billy.

545
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:53,644
That's not entirely true.

546
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,481
You've got my attention.

547
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:01,944
Prometheus manipulated
the Green Arrow into

548
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:05,531
killing Detective Malone
by making it appear

549
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:09,243
that Malone was Prometheus.

550
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:14,415
Rightly fearing a city-wide panic,
District Attorney Chase

551
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,586
covered up the circumstances
of Malone's death.

552
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:20,296
And how do you know this?

553
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:23,063
- The Green Arrow told me.
- You're in contact with the vigilante?

554
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:25,801
I'm the mayor.
And, whether we like it or not,

555
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,305
the Green Arrow and his team
are auxiliary law enforcement.

556
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:31,807
Leaving whether I agree with that aside,

557
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,976
why should I believe whatever he says?

558
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:37,438
Because you know as well as I do
what he has done for this city.

559
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,149
What's the simpler answer?

560
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:44,987
That the Green Arrow all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, became a cop-killer?

561
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:48,365
Or that he was manipulated by a psychopath

562
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:52,787
who has had all of us, you included,
running in circles for months?

563
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,955
He still killed Billy.

564
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,542
Yes, he did.

565
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,839
And that's something that he is gonna have
to live with for the rest of his life.

566
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:09,053
All I'm asking is
that you don't let that stop him

567
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,765
from being the hero
this city needs him to be.

568
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,272
Ah...

569
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,694
I don't know, Mr. Mayor.
I'm gonna have to think on this.

570
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,446
Thank you for your time.

571
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,541
Yeah.

572
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:43,170
I got a GPS trace on Enzo Russo.
Well, at least, his cell phone.

573
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,547
Okay, text me the address.

574
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,800
Um, shouldn't we let the team handle
this considering you're the...

575
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:51,345
And there's really no delicate way
to put this. The SCPD's most wanted?

576
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,223
Text me the address.

577
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,439
All right, I traced Russo's cell to Oak
Hill Memorial. John's already en route.

578
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:06,694
Oak Hill Memorial. At least if we get shot
we don't have to go far.

579
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:10,072
That is really not
an encouraging perspective, Rene.

580
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:14,952
Hey, uh, just a quick note. Listen.

581
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,889
Um, now that you're a freshly-minted
officer of the SCPD we can't have you

582
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,916
going out into the field and having your
new co-workers recognize you, So...

583
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,210
This is gonna involve me
wearing a costume, isn't it?

584
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,671
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

585
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:36,348
You know, I'm not sure I'm ready
to fill her shoes quite yet.

586
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,518
Well, it's not shoes. It's a mask.

587
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:48,944
Unit 54 spotted the Green Arrow's Ducati
heading southbound on Riverside.

588
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:52,489
We believe he's en route to engage
Warner, Cutter, and Chien Na Wei.

589
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:55,826
We're tracking him
and we'll be there when he does.

590
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,621
Move out.

591
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,539
Thanks for keying me in on this.

592
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,389
Well, I trust you,
like I'm trusting that

593
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,460
certain people can handle the truth.

594
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,630
- Speaking of, how'd it go with Pike?
- We'll see.

595
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:09,965
Alpha team in position.

596
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,385
This ain't right, man.
Disturbing souls at rest.

597
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:16,680
This is how you get haunted.
I feel a presence.

598
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,724
Beta team in position.

599
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:20,935
On site.

600
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,362
How do you know it's this one?

601
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,740
It's got the least amount of dust.
Help me move it.

602
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,667
We have got the money, honey.

603
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,127
Take what you can carry.
We'll come back for the rest.

604
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:21,287
You did all this for money?
So what, you could go to the Caymans?

605
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:25,040
You think this is about taking a vacation?
We're taking over.

606
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:28,544
- We're taking back this city.
- Yeah, you and what army?

607
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:30,879
This one.

608
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,680
It's amazing the loyalty money can buy.

609
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:41,682
Take them down!

610
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:57,966
I'm gonna enjoy watching them
take you down.

611
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:02,471
Go, go!

612
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:03,889
Move on the targets!

613
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,996
- Thank you, Captain.
- Happy to help.

614
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,290
Didn't hurt that
the Mayor vouched for you.

615
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:32,251
I'm sorry about Billy Malone.

616
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:37,506
Know that it's something I'm gonna have
to deal with for the rest of my life.

617
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,343
That's funny, that's what the Mayor said.

618
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,319
Come to say goodbye?
Clear your conscience maybe?

619
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:02,531
My conscience is clear.

620
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:04,491
Hell, it is.

621
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:08,620
Look in the mirror sometime, Quentin.
You're no better than me.

622
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,707
I'm shot through with flaws, no question.

623
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:15,461
But at least I'm not using
other people's sins to justify my own.

624
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,386
Hey, hey. Are you okay?

625
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,098
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just, she and I,
we got a little history. Hmm.

626
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,854
So, uh, Oliver tells me
that you're the new Black Canary.

627
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,231
Oh. Not yet.

628
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:41,570
I'm not ready
to take your daughter's place, sir.

629
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:44,406
Laurel didn't want someone
to take her place.

630
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:49,203
She wanted someone
to carry on in her place.

631
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,299
Hey. Nice job tonight.
Saw you on the news.

632
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:07,554
We need to talk
about what happened, Speedy.

633
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,850
Look, I'm sorry.

634
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:13,727
Have you...

635
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,188
Have you spoken to Susan?

636
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,023
No, she's not returning my calls.

637
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,276
I'm really sorry, Ollie.

638
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:26,281
- I know I screwed up and...
- But you didn't make a mistake.

639
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,535
You made a choice.

640
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:35,582
- And you reminded me of someone.
- Who?

641
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:37,709
Mom.

642
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,631
She would've done something like this.

643
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,260
Well, she would've done exactly this.

644
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,846
She was a wonderful mother.

645
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:55,477
But I think we both know that she
didn't always make the best choices.

646
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,565
Whatever's gonna happen with Susan is...

647
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:02,276
Is whatever's gonna happen.

648
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,489
Right now...

649
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:13,078
Right now, I'm really worried
about my baby sister.

650
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,761
How very selfless of you.
Did not expect it.

651
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:35,934
But don't worry, my word is good.
Anatoly will not be harmed.

652
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:53,035
Anatoly. Look at you.
Hiding like a rat in the sewer.

653
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:57,414
Did not expect this from Bratva Captain.
But then,

654
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:00,500
you are not going to be Bratva Captain
for much longer.

655
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,340
We have a problem.

656
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,884
Adrian, just once,

657
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:11,386
I'm gonna need you to walk into my office
and not say that.

658
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,364
I'm serious.
I just got a heads up on something,

659
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,325
and I think it's something you need
to get out in front of.

660
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:16,642
Mr. Mayor.

661
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,048
Something's happening.
I think you should turn on the TV.

662
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:25,233
Reports have recently surfaced
there has been a major cover-up

663
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,236
relating to the murder of
ACU Detective William Malone.

664
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,821
According to our sources,

665
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:33,659
the Mayor's Office ordered
the falsification of autopsy reports

666
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,453
to protect the identity
of Detective Malone's Killer.

667
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,081
If any of these allegations prove true,

668
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:42,668
it would constitute a gross overstep
of the Mayor's authority,

669
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:47,005
one that is likely to trigger impeachment
proceedings led by the Mayor's political...

670
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,884
Wow. You undersold this.

671
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:53,929
This isn't a problem.

672
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,476
This might be
the end of my administration.

673
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:31,174
