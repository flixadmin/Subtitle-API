All these years...

595
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:42,255
I was convinced

596
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:42,255
I had the incorrect sequence.

705
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,670
Then they did this study,

706
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,670
and this is a real thing.

707
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,920
They asked people

708
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,920
the same question.

709
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,755
You know, what power

do you want?

711
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,007
But this time, they made it

712
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,007
so the answers were anonymous.

713
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,592
And most people,

714
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,592
since they knew

715
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,219
that it was secret,

716
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,219
said invisibility.

717
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,761

01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,798
Stop! No!

1741
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,091
-I'm not even looking!

1742
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,091
-Stop!

1743
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,302
-I'm not even looking! Oh!

1744
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,302
-Stop!

1745
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:22,262
-Why?

1746
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:22,262
-Oh, and done!

1747
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:23,888
Finished him.

1748
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:29,186
A lair.

1749
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,437
Yes.

1750
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:31,980
And obviously,

1751
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:31,980
we're gonna have to

1752
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,064
-be making this purchase

1753
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,064
anonymously.

1754
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,064
-Mmm.

1755
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,108
Obviously.

1756
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,819
And, um, if you have

1757
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,819
a location on a cliff.

1758
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,696
Like a castle-esque

1759
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,696
type thing.

1760
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,281
-Overlooking some water.

1761
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,281
-[Freddy] Overlooking

1762
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,281
some water,

1763
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,241
seas, below it.

1764
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,241
Rough, you know...

1765
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:44,993
Like a waterfall,

1766
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,786
-so you can drive into...

1767
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,786
-Waterfall, yeah.

1768
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,786
If you... Yeah.

1769
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:49,414
Look, Maximum Voltage,

1770
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:49,414
is it?

1771
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:51,542
You can call me Max.

1772
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,669
Look, Max, why don't you

1773
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:53,669
just start with

1774
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,045
how many bedrooms

1775
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,045
you're looking for?

1776
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,296
-One!

1777
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:56,296
-Seven.

1778
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:57,673
-One?

1779
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:57,673
-Seven?

1780
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,257
What, am I running

1781
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,257
a foster home now?

1782
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:06,848
[students chattering]

1783
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,230
[girl] Have you seen the one

1784
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,230
where he throws

1785
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,230
the football into space?

1786
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,939
[boy] So dope.

1787
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,400
Hey, you guys

1788
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,400
gotta wonder who's

1789
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,400
filming those, right?

1790
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:18,694
I mean, that's bravery

1791
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:18,694
in and of itself.

1792
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,153
I mean, is it, though?

1793
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,406
Yeah. I'd actually argue

1794
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,406
maybe even more brave.

1795
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,740
[Billy] Holding a camera?

1796
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:26,493
[scoffs] Staring in the face

1797
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:26,493
of danger.

1798
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:28,036
Like some weirdo fanboy.

1799
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:30,664
Hey, Freeman.

1800
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:32,624
I wouldn't do that

1801
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:32,624
if I were you.

1802
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,752
What, is your bestie

1803
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,752
gonna hit us with

1804
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,752
a wheelchair this time?

1805
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,337
No, maybe not him,

1806
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,337
but I have another best friend

1807
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:39,047
who might hunt you down

1808
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:39,047
and destroy both of you.

1809
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,758
Okay, Freddy.

1810
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,344
You may have heard of him.

1811
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,344
[stuttering]

1812
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,344
The Human Power Storm.

1813
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,722
Frequency Flinger.

1814
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,722
Sir Zaps-A-Lot.

1815
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,599
Yeah. He's a man

1816
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,599
of many names.

1817
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,849
[Burke] You know

1818
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,849
the Red Cyclone?

1819
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,603
You? [scoffs] My ass you do.

1820
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,521
Oh, we're a lot closer

1821
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,521
than you think.

1822
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,690
Maybe even at this

1823
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,690
very moment.

1824
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:58,316
Prove it.

1825
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:00,860
I will, tomorrow.

1826
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:00,860
Tomorrow he's gonna

1827
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:00,860
come to lunch.

1828
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,820
Right, right, Billy?

1829
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,031
Oh, yeah, and then

1830
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,031
Superman's gonna be

1831
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,031
bringing us dessert, right?

1832
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,742
[school bell ringing]

1833
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,120
Tomorrow at lunch.

1834
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,120
You'll see.

1835
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,457
And when he doesn't show,

1836
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,457
then we'll kick your ass.

1837
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:19,921
So, wait, my identity's

1838
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:19,921
a secret so no one I know

1839
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:19,921
can get hurt.

1840
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,882
Except when it makes you

1841
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,882
look cool,

1842
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,882
then it's all good.

1843
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,509
Billy, it's not like

1844
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,509
they're supervillains.

1845
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:26,511
They're just super douchebags.

1846
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:29,013
So, you're breaking

1847
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:29,013
your own rule?

1848
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,724
Got it.

1849
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:34,603
[scoffs] This thing

1850
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:34,603
is as much as mine

1851
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:34,603
as it is yours.

1852
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:37,230
Starting to think

1853
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:37,230
you think it's all your thing.

1854
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:39,566
Billy, you're still

1855
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:39,566
gonna do it, though, right?

1856
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:41,901
-I mean, what would

1857
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:41,901
a good brother do?

1858
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:41,901
-[door slams]

1859
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:44,988
[Victor] All hands on deck.

1860
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,286
Thank you for this family.

1861
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:51,286
Thank you for this day.

1862
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:54,956
Thank you for this food.

1863
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:54,956
Sorry Billy's hand's

on vacay.

1865
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:01,838
Big news in Philly.

1866
01:03:58,794 --> 01:04:01,838
Got a costumed hero.

1867
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,006
He's doing good.

1868
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,133
[Eugene] Yeah,

1869
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,133
but is he, though?

1870
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:08,052
Ooh! Controversy. Into it.

1871
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,515
Share with us

1872
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,515
your perspective, Eugene.

1873
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,392
Just saying, he's what?

1874
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,392
Charging people's phones?

1875
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:17,479
So what?

1876
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:17,479
I can charge a phone

1877
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:17,479
with a plug.

1878
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:18,605
[Victor] Preach.

1879
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,983
Pedro, any thoughts?

1880
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,027
-Costume's stupid.

-[all laughing]

1882
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,862
-Yeah.

1883
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,862
-[Victor] Okay.

1884
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,489
he's getting married

1885
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,489
or something.

1886
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,489
Big white cape like

1887
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,907
What if he didn't get

1888
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,907
to pick his costume?

1889
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,076
Ever think about that?

1890
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,911
You're a specialist, Freddy.

1891
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,911
What do you think?

1892
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:38,082
Yeah, Freddy,

1893
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:38,082
let's manage to see

1894
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:38,082
the positive.

1895
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,168
Okay, well,

1896
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,168
I think it looks like

1897
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,462
he doesn't have gratitude

1898
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,462
for what he's been given.

1899
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:44,922
[Victor] Very specific.

1900
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:44,922
All right.

1901
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,341
Maybe to the superhero,

1902
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,925
gratitude doesn't mean

1903
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:47,925
having to be clingy.

1904
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,427
Clingy?

1905
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,427
Wow, interesting take.

1906
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:50,804
[Billy] You know,

1907
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:50,804
maybe sometimes

1908
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:53,765
a superhero just wants

1909
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:53,765
a little me time.

1910
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,726
You know, me time

1911
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,726

like this?

2426
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:04,610
he knew I lived

2427
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:04,610
in a group home.

2428
01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:04,610
When he rescued me,

2429
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:06,862
He knew my name.

2430
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:06,862
He called me Mary.

2433
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:18,874
Wait, are you saying Billy's

2434
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:18,874
the Human Power Storm?

2435
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:20,710
Yes! You guys figured it out!

2436
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,252
All on your own.

2437
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,252
I didn't help.

2438
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:24,963
-I didn't break any promises.

2439
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:24,963
-You knew?

2440
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:26,674
I'm a good sister!

2441
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:33,180
[Victor] I mean,

2442
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:33,180
what were you thinking?

2443
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,265
And then you bring

2444
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,265
Freddy into it.

2445
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:44,191
Give him some space, guys.

2446
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:44,191
He's a little upset, okay?

2447
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:55,244
[Mary] Billy?

2448

You're him.

You're the hero.

2450
01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:07,172
Yeah, well,

2451
01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:07,172

01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:14,513
Why do you have my notebook?

2454

Eugene finished your search.

2455
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,311
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

2456
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,689
But I have played

2457
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,689
Watch Dogs and Uplink.

2458
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:26,942
And maybe I did pick up

2459
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:26,942
a few skills,

2460
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:26,942
which maybe did get me

into federal databases

Good for you,

01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:31,238
but I'm gonna go.

2465
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,242
Your parents' names

2466
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,242
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

2467

What?

[Eugene] You were born

01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,793
in Zumbrota, Minnesota.

2470
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,628
They divorced

2471

when you were three.

2472

Your mom moved here

2473
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,421
that year.

2474
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:49,673
Twenty months later,

2475
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:49,673
you got lost.

2476
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,467
You never found them

2477
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,844
in prison in Florida

2478
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,844
for ten years.

And your mom's...

What?

2482
01:22:59,642 --> 01:23:01,351
Is she dead?

2483
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,186
She's two subway stops away.

2484
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,398
What?

2485
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,819
You know, you didn't find her

2486
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,819
because she reverted

2487
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,819

we were running after Billy.

not to be a part of anything.

3279
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:47,621
Thank you for this food.

3280
01:58:47,662 --> 01:58:49,748
Thank you for this day.

3281
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:51,792
Thank you for this family.

3282
01:58:51,833 --> 01:58:54,168
I thought maybe

3283
01:58:51,833 --> 01:58:54,168
this time I'd stay.

3284

[Victor chuckles]

3285
01:58:55,420 --> 01:58:57,672
I mean, after all,

3286
01:58:58,298 --> 01:58:59,340
I'm home.

at our table.

3293
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:37,879
Nope!

3294
01:59:39,965 --> 01:59:41,133
Okay.

3295
01:59:44,552 --> 01:59:45,971
What are you doing?

3296
01:59:46,013 --> 01:59:48,181
Waiting for your imaginary BFF

3297
01:59:46,013 --> 01:59:48,181
to show up?

3298
01:59:48,222 --> 01:59:49,516
[Burke] Yeah.

[grunts]

01:59:58,066 --> 01:59:59,442
What are you guys doing here?

3301
01:59:59,484 --> 02:00:01,028
Well, we're having lunch

3302
01:59:59,484 --> 02:00:01,028
with you.

3303
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,904
But you guys have

3304
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,904
different lunch periods.

3305
02:00:02,946 --> 02:00:06,366
Well, we made

3306
02:00:02,946 --> 02:00:06,366
a very special arrangement.

3307
02:00:06,407 --> 02:00:09,744

Why are you asking me?

Freddy Freeman.

[students gasp]

3312
02:00:13,289 --> 02:00:14,958
This guy

3313
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,545
taught me everything I know

3314
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,545
about being a dope superhero.

3315
02:00:18,586 --> 02:00:20,797
True story. You should get

3316
02:00:18,586 --> 02:00:20,797
some pointers from him.

3317
02:00:20,839 --> 02:00:25,385
What's going on,

3318
02:00:20,839 --> 02:00:25,385
my best bud

3319
02:00:20,839 --> 02:00:25,385

And also new kids that

3321
02:00:25,426 --> 02:00:30,015
I'm meeting for the first time

3322
02:00:25,426 --> 02:00:30,015
but seem very cool?

3323
02:00:30,057 --> 02:00:31,432
Uh... [chuckles]

3324
02:00:31,474 --> 02:00:34,227
I invited another friend.

3325
02:00:31,474 --> 02:00:34,227
I hope that's okay.

Primitive symbols.

You walking, talking monkeys

with your cave drawings.

3344
02:04:19,994 --> 02:04:24,207
You assume there's only

3345
02:04:19,994 --> 02:04:24,207
one way to gain magic.

3346
02:04:24,249 --> 02:04:27,127
No, no, no.

3347
02:04:27,168 --> 02:04:30,422
There are more ways

3348
02:04:27,168 --> 02:04:30,422
than a mind can imagine.

3349
02:04:31,339 --> 02:04:33,133
What in God's name?

3350
02:04:33,174 --> 02:04:37,637
I name the gods, Doctor.

3351
02:04:33,174 --> 02:04:37,637
Not the other way around.

3352
02:04:37,678 --> 02:04:40,974
Oh, what fun

3353

we're going to have together.

You're gonna find someone.

[laughs] Yeah, I'm sure.

3361
02:11:16,410 --> 02:11:18,912
Because there's plenty of fish

3362
02:11:16,410 --> 02:11:18,912
in the sea.

Of course it's not real.

I can't talk to fish.

Even if I could, I mean,

3367
02:11:22,583 --> 02:11:24,960
honestly, what could we do

3368
02:11:22,583 --> 02:11:24,960
with that that's cool?

Well, that's not that cool.
