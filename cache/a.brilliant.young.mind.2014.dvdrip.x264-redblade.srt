1
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,914
I find any communication

2
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,408
of a non-mathematical
nature very difficult.

3
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,713
Because I don't talk much, people think
I don't have anything to say,

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,490
or that I'm stupid.

5
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,599
And that's not true.

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,368
I have lots of things to say.

7
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,210
I'm just afraid to say them.

8
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,886
I know that Tm strange in lots of ways.

9
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,640
I think I see the world
in a different way to other people.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,957
I've always been like that.

11
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,886
Would you like to play with it?

12
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,993
Are you scared it will eat you?

13
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,796
No.

14
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,879
Is it because it's a toy?

15
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,520
No. Because stegosauruses
aren't carnivores.

16
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,720
So, Nathan, what do you like?

17
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,089
I imagine there's things
that you don't like.

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,089
Maybe, say, when meal times change?

19
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,558
Yes. Yes, he is fussy about his food.

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,242
Nathan?

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,487
Nathan?

22
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,687
I... I like patterns.

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,601
And what does it feel like
to see a good pattern?

24
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,607
Nice.

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,645
They're pretty colours.

26
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,120
So, it's positive.
Nathan is certainly on the spectrum.

27
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,961
Traits of autism combined
with synaesthesia,

28
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,037
sensitive to a change in light and pattern.

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,204
These can be gifts, of course, but they
do come with some big challenges,

30
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,631
socially and emotionally, which will
stay with Nathan all of his life.

31
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,003
But there is no question;
That he's a unique young man.

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,407
Give Mum a wave. Bye, Mum.

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,476
Bye.

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,550
Bye.

35
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,759
You know what I was thinking?

36
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,593
You know, sometimes it might seem like

37
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,189
we don't always understand
what it's like to be you.

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,555
It's like you've got these special powers,

39
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,034
like a wizard.

40
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,238
And we're just Muggles
that don't understand how you do it.

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,919
It's like a different language to us.

42
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,128
But even though we don't always
understand each other, Nath,

43
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,764
it doesn't mean that any of us
ever stops loving each other.

44
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,851
Does that make sense?

45
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,607
Nathan, look at me.

46
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,171
But you shouldn't be afraid.

47
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,711
# Sweetheart

48
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,999
# What have you done to us?

49
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,914
# I turned my back and you turned to dust

50
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,721
# What have you done?

51
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,398
# And, Oh, please

52
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,876
# Just come here, don't fight with me

53
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,409
# And I admit

54
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,630
# Think you may have broken It

55
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,717
# Yeah, I admit #

56
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,683
Come here, darling. Come here.

57
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,166
Just hold my hand.

58
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,954
Please, Nathan.
Nathan, just hold my hand. Just this once.

59
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,390
It's okay. We'll do this together.

60
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,280
Come here, darling. Darling, come on.

61
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,600
Nathan. Please, don't. No, Nathan!

62
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,910
Hey.

63
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,124
Gosh.

64
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,566
That looks complicated.

65
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,971
That's not schoolwork then?

66
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,209
Wait, why don't you try
and explain it to me?

67
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,611
I might be able to help you.

68
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,270
Hmm?

69
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,789
You can't.

70
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,995
Why not?

71
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,954
You're not clever enough.

72
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,357
So, Nathan, this is the big school.

73
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,630
When you're older,
you'll go here every single day.

74
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,989
Watch out.

75
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,444
We're just gonna start things early.

76
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,480
It's nothing to be frightened about.

77
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,647
Don't run in the corridor.

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,081
Excuse me.

79
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,069
Excuse me!

80
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,480
There you go.

81
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,841
Oh, that's subtle.

82
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,837
- Ah, really subtle.
- What? We're not... We're not doing anything.

83
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,792
"“We're not... We're not...
We're not doing anything."

84
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,842
Give me that now!

85
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,754
Is this drugs?

86
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,721
Go on, piss off.

87
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,480
We're so lucky.

88
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,034
- Mr Humphreys.
- Yep.

89
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,571
- Can I have a quick word?
- Yeah.

90
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,318
How old are you? Five?

91
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,890
No, Nathan is nine.

92
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,432
His mum got in touch because
of Nathan's rather advanced interest

93
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,962
in numbers and patterns and his primary
schoolwork was no longer testing.

94
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,720
Mmm, I can see why, yeah. Bit of algebra.

95
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,918
Mmm, distance geometry.

96
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,634
Where'd you learn all this, mate?

97
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,390
Mr Humphreys just joined
our maths department.

98
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,251
He was a bit of a maths whizz
when he was young, Nathan.

99
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,000
- Not really, it was a long time ago.
- No, no, no.

100
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,158
He competed in the International
Mathematical Olympiad.

101
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,719
- Olympiad?
- Olympiad, yes. The IMO.

102
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,871
Did you know you could win
medals for maths, Nathan?

103
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,399
Just like sport, only for people who
are really, really strong up here instead.

104
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,282
Mrs Ellis, if Mr Humphreys is willing

105
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,198
I think that we can absolutely begin offering
Nathan some special advanced tuition.

106
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,595
Can't we?

107
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,715
Okay, yeah.

108
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,113
Why don't you walk properly?

109
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,039
That's very direct of you.

110
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,728
I've got multiple sclerosis.

111
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,811
What about you?

112
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,590
Why are you weird?

113
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,715
- I've got special powers.
- Mmm-hmm.

114
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,800
Can you fly?

115
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,085
Can you turn things to ice?

116
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,725
Are you really good at maths?

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,832
Ah, yeah. Ah, fair play.

118
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,754
Well, listen, I should tell you,
I'm not a very good teacher.

119
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,842
I barely encourage myself
to get out of bed,

120
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,678
let alone inspire some kid
with special powers

121
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,239
who wants to spend
all his spare time doing maths.

122
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,521
So as long as we're clear.

123
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,821
What's that for?

124
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:24,075
It's to give it a shake.
It's my hand, isn't it?

125
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,834
- It's what men do when they agree.
- I don't like doing that.

126
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,190
Yeah, well, we all have
to do things we don't like doing,

127
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,160
but we fucking do them, don't we?
So give it here.

128
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,885
What does "fucking" mean?

129
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,915
All in good time, son.

130
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,282
Right then.

131
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,232
We'll start with some
probability, shall we?

132
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,160
Like what's the probability of me
remembering any of this shit.

133
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,476
I can't hear you.

134
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,629
I said, let's do tree diagrams, shall we?

135
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,594
Mr Humphreys?

136
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,234
Yes, Mr Ellis.

137
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,517
What was the Olympiad like?

138
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,525
Mind your own business, nosy.

139
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,167
Boom.

140
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,521
Do you know what this means?

141
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,160
Go on, Sir Nod-A-Lot, tell me,
what does it mean?

142
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,242
A toss.

143
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,922
Toss?

144
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,635
How dare you?

145
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,239
Yeah, the coin toss. Well done.

"And let P denote
the perimeter of the hexagon."

164
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,448
Nathan! Breakfast!

165
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,531
"Prove that RA plus RC plus RE"

166
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,315
"is greater than or equal to P over 2."

167
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,442
Here.

168
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,770
- It doesn't matter if you don't get in.
- Of course it matters.

169
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,960
Got twisted. Okay? Good.

170
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,910
Good luck.

171
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,718
- Get a job.
- You get a job.

172
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,275
- I'm trying. I've handed CVs out.
- You've got a CV?

173
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,926
Yeah, obviously. I don't wanna
sit on me arse all day, you know.

174
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,475
- And even If I do, you're sat next to me.
- No, I'm not.

175
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,240
Yeah, you are.
Joined at the friggin' hip.

176
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,960
Are you listening to our conversation? Eh?

177
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,315
- No.
- What?

178
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,609
- No, I wasn't.
- Are you sure about that?

179
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,469
- Better not be.
- No.

180
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,110
- You're late.
- Sorry, mate.

181
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,766
I had a quick look at it first. Shh.

182
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,834
It's a piece of piss, really.

183
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,811
Well, not really, but...

184
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,408
You know, just do your best.

185
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,560
It's the biggest day of
your life, mate, innit?

186
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,755
Don't feel any pressure.

187
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,999
I'm a bit nervous.

188
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,110
Are you nervous?

189
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,068
- A little bit.
- Well, you shouldn't be.

190
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,241
Because you're brilliant.

191
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,282
Are you ready?

192
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,722
Yeah.

193
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,882
Yeah?

194
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,073
On your marks, get set...

195
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,767
Go on, my son.

196
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,050
I'll just be over there, out the way.

197
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,880
"Question one."

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,402
"Are there infinitely many pairs of
positive integers such..."

199
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,196
"Question one."

200
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,597
"Are there infinitely many pairs
of positive integers"

201
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,280
"such that both m divides
n squared plus one and..."

202
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,522
"Are there infinitely many pairs
of positive integers"

203
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,635
"such that both m divides n squared plus one
and that n divides m squared plus one?"

204
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,993
When will we find out?

205
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,043
Uh, about a week, probably.

206
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,636
It's all right, male. Relax to the max.
Take a chill pill.

207
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,470
Talking of which, this hill's a killer.

208
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,325
Do you mind if we take the weight off?

209
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,807
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hang on.

210
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,646
Go on then, hit me.

211
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,029
- Hit you?
- Ask me the fucking question!

212
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,528
Why did things go wrong for you,
at the Olympiad?

213
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,204
There's lots of reasons, really.

214
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,448
My "thing" was kicking
off around that time.

215
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,201
My ailment.

216
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,520
Cutting me down in the prime of my life.

217
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,432
I just sort of lost it.

218
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,115
I can't Lose it.

219
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,956
Nathan, you haven't gotta
prove anything, all right?

220
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,968
What's important is that you enjoy doing
it, maths, and you do, don't you?

221
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,367
So whether you get on the team or not,

222
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,608
you're gonna do amazing
things in the future.

223
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,602
You haven't.

224
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,635
Well, thanks a lot.

225
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,719
You charming little bastard'.

226
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,841
Hi. Hi.

227
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,051
Um, can I order number 47, please,

228
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,810
with, um,

229
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,231
seven prawn balls
and a small chips, thank you.

230
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,606
It come with six balls, number 47.

231
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,832
Yeah, I know. Usually...

232
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,442
Sorry, are you new?

233
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,688
It's just we come here all the time

234
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,326
and it's usually just fine,
you give us an extra ball.

235
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,750
Number 48 is a large prawn ball meal.

236
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,486
You get nine balls, large
chips and crackers.

237
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,681
Yeah, I know.

238
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,245
No. Sorry.

239
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,282
Sorry.

240
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,361
No, he doesn't like, um, crackers
and he likes to have a small chips.

241
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm sorry, it's just, uh...

242
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,085
My son, he's quite picky

243
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,205
and he needs the meal number
to be a prime number

244
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,324
and there to be a prime number
of prawn balls.

245
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,487
And, um,

246
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,968
if he had nine balls
it wouldn't be a prime number

247
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,878
and number 48 isn't...

248
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,650
Isn't... Isn't a prime...

249
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,922
Is it? Is it? I don't know. Yes, I do.

250
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,609
Um, yes, no, I'm right.

251
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,556
47.

252
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,890
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

253
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,287
There we go. A big fat "well done".

254
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,509
It's all spilt out.

255
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,042
Oh.

256
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,400
No, no, it's fine.
Nathan, Nathan, don't get upset. It's fine.

257
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,442
- No, Mum, it's not fine.
- It's fine.

258
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,240
- You don't do anything right.
- I'm sorry?

259
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,201
Everything you do is wrong.

260
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,766
Oh... Oh, well, Pm sorry, okay?

261
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,041
Thank you so much!

262
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,161
Sorry.

263
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,604
That doctor didn't know his
herbivores from his carnivores, did he?

264
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,355
And do you know why?

265
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,645
Because he's not as smart as you.

266
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,448
Is there someone else you know
that has what you have?

267
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,565
Einstein.

268
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,762
Okay.

269
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,482
But...

270
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,080
I just want you to know

271
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,603
that you're fine the way you are, Nathan.

272
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,751
So do you want one of them
ice cream things for dessert or what?

273
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,927
.Dad! 'What?

274
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,963
Oh, no! Not again. Ah!

275
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,764
- What do I do? Do I lean forward?
- No, back!

276
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,281
Back? Oh, no, this is a disaster.

277
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,912
I know. I know. Give me this.

278
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,235
As promised, I come bearing news.

279
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,641
Are you sure it's okay if I stand out here?
I don't wanna put you out.

280
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,994
- Yeah.
- Invite me in, Nathan.

281
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,805
- Come in.
- Thank you very much.

282
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,680
Put the kettle on, then.

283
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,869
- Put the kettle on what?
- It's okay. I'll do it.

284
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,522
- Hi, Julie.
- Hi, Mr Humphreys.

285
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,438
- How are you?
- Very good, thank you.

286
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,600
- Thanks for coming round.
- I got it.

287
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,870
Oh! Oh, my goodness.
Is that what I think it is?

288
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,241
I hope so, otherwise it would have
been a wasted journey.

289
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,193
Um, you open it.

290
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,240
- You want me to open it? All right then.
- Yeah.

291
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,481
“Dear Mr Ellis, I am writing to let you
know that unfortunately...

292
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,915
"“...you have successfully earned a place
on the United Kingdom maths squad!"

293
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,168
Oh, my goodness! Oh, Nathan, darling.

294
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,634
- Well, that's good news, isn't it?
- Oh, my gosh!

295
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,400
- Well done, mate.
- Oh, well done.

296
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,921
Why is that unfortunate?

297
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,030
No, I was having a joke, mate.

298
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,810
It says the training camp's
in Taiwan this year.

299
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,150
- Have you ever been on a plane before?
- No. He's not.

300
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,237
- Well, that's exciting, isn't it?
- Um...

301
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,962
But...

302
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,965
I should study.

303
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,113
- Are you leaving now, or...
- Nathan.

304
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,990
He doesn't mean that.

305
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,121
Probably, yeah.

306
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,710
- Okay.
- Well...

307
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,913
- I'm gonna go and study.
- Okay.

308
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,561
Well done, mate.

309
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,797
- He is pleased. He's...
- I know he is, yeah.

310
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,032
I'm gonna have something stronger
than a cup of tea, actually, I think.

311
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,759
- I'm gonna have a glass of wine.
- Okay.

312
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,802
Would you like...

313
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,331
I should probably shoot off.

314
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,669
Okay, no, that's fine.

315
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,280
But I mean, if you're gonna have one.

316
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,195
Actually, I was thinking maybe,
you know you'd like to...

317
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,190
To join us next month,

318
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,515
take him to the airport.

319
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,482
I know that would make Nathan happy.

320
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,609
I should probably tell you before they...

321
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,969
I'm taking a bit of a break from work.

322
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,596
Uh, it's a bit of a forced break.

323
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,791
It's a bit like Pm being fired, basically.

324
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,316
I'm sorry.

325
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,591
But I wanted to say to you
even though I'm networking

326
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,331
for the school any more, I'd really
like to carry on teaching Nathan.

327
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:58,872
Really?

328
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:00,626
Yeah. I mean, if that's
all right with you?

329
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,600
- That would be amazing.
- Obviously for no money.

330
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,030
Oh! Jesus Christ!

331
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,282
Oh, my God!

332
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,401
That's a bit of a weird one.

333
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,681
- Thanks for the drink and stuff.
- Not at all.

334
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,240
- Don't worry about it. All right.
- Yeah, no, good.

335
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,312
- Will you be all right? Okay.
- Yeah. Cheers, Julie. Thank you.

336
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,840
- Thank you. Take care.
- All right.

337
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,565
We were just talking, Nathan.

338
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,290
I was looking at Jupiter.

339
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,440
I didn't do it on purpose.

340
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,350
It was just...

341
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,393
It was just nice, you know,
to have someone to talk to.

342
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,365
For once. For me.

343
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,231
Sometimes I feel a bit alone.

344
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,527
Okay.

345
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,728
What else can we write?
Numbers? Say a prime number.

346
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,197
- Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
- 353.

347
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,962
353!

348
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,401
Whoa!

349
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,840
Just in time.

350
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,167
Perfect timing.

351
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,873
Fireworks night again, is it?

352
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,992
He's letting you hold his hand, isn't he?

353
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,201
The sparkler helps.

354
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,882
Come on, Nathan.

355
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,651
It's time to change the fish.

356
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,290
If you come now you can get
an extra scoop of ice cream.

357
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,200
Extra scoop of Ice cream.
And what do I get?

358
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,600
- You don't get anything.
- Go ahead, go ahead.

359
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,552
- You're lucky Pm here, that's all.

360
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,569
- I'm lucky.“
- Yeah, you get me.

361
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,076
- I like a man in a shed.
- Ah...

362
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,446
- Go and get me ice cream.
- But you're not getting...

363
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,005
I told you, you're not getting...

364
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,320
Ice cream, Julie!

365
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,916
Nathan?

366
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,922
Jesus.

367
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:36,962
Nathan!

368
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,602
Oh!

369
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,881
Nathan, It's okay.

370
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,764
Nathan, I'm not angry.

371
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,995
Nathan!

372
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,350
Michael? Michael?

373
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,402
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

374
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,568
I'm quite looking FORWARD to this
in a weird sort of way.

375
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,602
Yeah, I know.

376
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,673
Little trip down memory lane.

377
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,364
- Okay. We all ready?
- Hang on.

378
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,642
This is for you.

379
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,602
Nathan...

380
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,522
What do you say?

381
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,834
- Thank you.
- Well, I used to use them,

382
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,155
so they're probably cursed.

383
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,481
But, you know, it might remind
you of home or something.

384
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,921
- Very lovely of you.
- Right then.

385
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,400
- Shall we get this show on the road?
- Yep. Let's go.

386
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,602
Nathan?

387
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,512
Can you get in the back with me?

388
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,883
Nathan, I think Mr Humphreys will be
more comfortable in the front.

389
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,155
It's okay, darling.

390
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,930
Darling, darling, it's okay.

391
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,795
I'll drive carefully.

392
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,202
No, It's all right.

393
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,430
I'm actually surprisingly bendy.

394
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,001
Christ.

395
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,359
It's Tricky Dicky. Look out.

396
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,766
All right, Richard?

397
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,082
Oh!

398
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,879
Martin Humphreys. '95.

399
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,310
Humphreys! Yeah, hell's teeth. Yes.

400
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,750
Yes. The last I heard, you were, um...

401
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,405
- Teaching, was it?
- Yes.

402
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,276
Yeah. At what university? I can't...

403
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,835
- It's a secondary school.
- Ah, yeah.

404
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,445
Wasted opportunity, this one.

405
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,800
So what are you doing here?
You flying off to Ibiza?

406
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:45,045
Fleeing the world of reason and rationality
for some hallucinogenic escape?

407
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,288
No, I'm dropping this one off, actually.

408
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,362
Ah!

409
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,398
Nathan Ellis, I presume. Yes.

410
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,211
The dragon. Ah!

411
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,789
And where have you been lying dormant, eh?

412
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,230
It's not often we have a mind like yours
spring up off the radar.

413
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,282
He's mine.

414
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,036
I mean, Tm his...
Urn, I've been teaching him.

415
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,164
Ah. The plot thickens.

416
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,408
Well, we'll get you
signed in, shall we, eh?

417
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,409
Just a quick goodbye and then avanti.

418
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,161
Oh, well, Nathan, darling.

419
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,670
Um...

420
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,608
You got your phone on you? Yeah?

421
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,762
Yeah.

422
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,670
Make sure you ring me
as soon as you land, yeah?

423
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,477
- AH right. Bye, then.
- Bye.

424
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,242
Sorry.

425
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,290
Time to meet your peers, Nathan.

426
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,971
Mingle. Mingle.

427
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,830
Um, watch your step,
there's a chess game going on.

428
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,678
Hey. How do you do?

429
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,595
How do I do what?

430
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,437
I mean, what's your name?

431
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,393
- Nathan.
- Tm Isaac.

432
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,840
I'm guessing this is your first maths camp?
You'll be fine.

433
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,645
Best thing is just to dive in.

434
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,953
Come. Sit down.

435
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,040
I mean, can you believe the Chinese team?

436
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,322
They won six golds again last year.

437
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,650
Yes, although upon recent evidential proof
I'd expect this to possibly change,

438
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,889
if I'm allowed to split infinitives,
to possibly change.

439
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,071
Which I believe I technically am now.

440
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,760
Of course, one of the most famous
infinitive splits of all time

441
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,487
came in the introductory lines
of Star Trek, "to boldly go," and...

442
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,206
I think if the writers of a popular
American television series

443
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,210
can get away with it for 40 years,
then, really, any of us can.

444
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,038
Don't worry, he's always like this.

445
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,117
Everyone, this is Nathan.

446
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,164
- Hi, Nathan.
- Hello, Nathan.

447
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,202
Hi, I'm Pav.

448
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,036
Paf?

449
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,719
P-A-V, Pav.

450
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,158
Pav is from India. Pav.

451
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,749
Actually I'm from Chipping Norton.

452
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,123
Yes, but of course I meant your origins,
not your birthplace,

453
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,129
before we open that little Pandora's box.

454
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,833
Oh, dear!

455
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,324
Seat belts on, please.
Seat belts on.

456
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,929
Right, don't sit at the front next
to the driver, that's my seat.

457
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,684
Right, away you go, driver.

458
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:23,010
Now, you are 16 of the cleverest
young brains in this country.

459
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,276
Now, outside you might be
considered nerds or geeks

460
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,835
or whatever the insult du jour might be.

461
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,811
But here, you are among kindred spirits.

462
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,390
Now, assuming you're capable
of basic arithmetic,

463
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,371
you'll know that there are six places
available yet more than six of you.

464
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,169
Which means that this, to a large extent,
is about whittling you down.

465
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,396
Now, we will be training with four other
national teams Tn Taiwan.

466
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,601
And after some
delicate diplomatic negotiation,

467
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,792
I can confirm that the Chinese
will be one of them.

468
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,597
Now we should, of course, be cordial

469
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,361
as it falls to us to host
the competition this year, Tn Cambridge.

470
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,437
But that doesn't mean we can't be ruthless.

471
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,119
Now, I want you up there
with the Chinese, top of the table.

472
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,909
And I will consider it an abhorrent
failure to include a candidate

473
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,718
who does not win a medal.

474
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,159
Be under no illusion.
This is all about winning.

475
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,483
Although that doesn't mean it can't be fun.

476
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,851
55,89, 144,

477
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,033
233, 377,

478
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,282
610.

479
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,691
987, 1,597, 2,584.

480
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,758
I like the Fibonacci sequence, too.

481
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,644
Invaluable for music compositions.

482
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,927
So you're new.

483
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,470
Fresh meat.

484
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,230
How's that going?

485
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,271
Okay, so you're the shy type.

486
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,961
Makes a nice change, to be honest.

487
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,120
Most of these weirdos just wanna show off
about how much maths junk they know.

488
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,562
What?

489
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,362
Nothing.

490
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,769
It's just I'm usually the weird one.

491
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,323
They do all seem good at maths, though.

492
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,281
Yeah.

493
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,926
Here you are neither weird
nor the best mathematician, Tm afraid.

494
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,684
You are painstakingly average.

495
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,726
Post-Olympiad of course,
I'll need to branch out into

496
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,561
modem theoretical physics if I'm going
to describe a unified field theory

497
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,637
for the four fundamental forces of nature.

498
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,401
Are you one of the fundamental
forces of nature, Luke?

499
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,162
No.

500
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,431
But you are terribly gifted, aren't you?

501
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,929
Yes. Gifted but not arrogant, Isaac.

502
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,992
Here we are. Maths camp, Taipei.

503
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,670
Your home for the next two weeks.

504
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,244
Right, everybody out.

505
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,285
Don't forget your umbrellas.

506
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,925
There's a typhoon coming.

507
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,604
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome to Taiwan.

508
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,321
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello. I'm Richard.

509
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,362
My name is Jason.

510
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,130
Nice to meet you, Jaigen.

511
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,651
- Jason. Yeah.
- Jason. Tm sorry.

512
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Jason. It was the accent.

513
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,760
Hello. Nice to meet you.

514
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,002
Right, come on, get your bags. Chop-chop.

515
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,730
Can someone help the man, please?

516
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,329
It's not the days of the Empire.
Thank you.

517
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,922
Oh!

518
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,832
Here comes the typhoon!

519
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,811
Batten down the hatches.

520
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,795
Taiwanese.

521
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,513
Currently below us in the rankings,

522
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,836
but they're our hosts,
so we should be gracious.

523
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,365
Here's the real competition.

524
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,156
The Chinese.

525
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,993
Guys, check out the board.

526
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,168
Is she messing around
with the Goldbach Conjecture?

527
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,675
Maybe it's what they do for fun.

528
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,633
Mmm, I love cracking unprovable theorems
in my free time.

529
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,671
No one has proven that it's unprovable.

530
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,286
Right, come on. They won't bite.

531
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,004
Ah! The enemy!

532
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,351
Surrender or die!

533
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,286
Deng Laoshi.

534
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,754
Dear Richard, welcome.

535
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,473
- Such an honour to have you here.
- Thank you.

536
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,591
- Ni hao.
- Ni hao.

537
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,919
Students, hello.

538
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,471
I hope you are ready for some mathematics.

539
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,731
Now, pay attention, Team UK.

540
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,353
Deng Laoshi and I have decided to pair
you up with a Chinese buddy

541
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,082
and you should make the most
of this opportunity,

542
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,511
or, more to the point, you should
spy on your Chinese counterpart

543
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,358
and bring their trade secrets to Blighty.

544
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,360
Very funny, Richard.

545
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,005
Uh, Luke Shelton.

546
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,442
Zhang Zhi.

547
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,553
Hello. My name is Zhang Zhi.

548
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,042
Luke.

549
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,314
Nathan Ellis.

550
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,962
Zhang Mei.

551
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,611
Nice to meet you. My name is Zhang Mei.

552
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,639
Pavinder Kamdar.

553
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,439
This is Shao Tong.

554
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,890
- Nice to meet you.
- Ni hao.

555
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,917
And you know my uncle.

556
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,682
Nathan. The lucky one
learning from my niece, huh?

557
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,676
We have high expectations for her.

558
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,125
And for you, of course.

559
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,368
High expectations all round, I say.

560
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,602
Zhang Mei.

561
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,482
Oh.

562
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,236
Yes, of course, though it may be
the world's fastest developing nation

563
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,035
some of the cuisine doesn't seem
to have advanced quite so quickly.

564
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,919
- Careful. Careful.
- Oh, look at this.

565
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,590
- Thank you. Uh, zhi Zhia... Xie xie.
- Xie xie.

566
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,833
- You put this in there?
- You put the raw food in this.

567
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,321
- In the peanut sauce?
- Oh...

568
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,249
- No.
- Okay, okay, I'll do that.

569
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,350
You don't use them... Like that.

570
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,072
Hold it like this and
pinch it like a lobster.

571
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,682
Yeah.

572
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,599
So, Nathan, what was your score
on the mock IMO paper?

573
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,513
Zhang Mei got the full seven marks
on questions one to three.

574
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,439
Though her combinatorics
is her weakest area.

575
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,191
I'm really not... Not that good.

576
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,729
No, but you soon will be.

577
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,076
Nathan, are you okay?

578
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,633
Almost everyone on the camp speaks English.

579
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,684
It is expected of us.

580
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,525
You speak it very well.

581
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,171
Thank you.

582
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,789
So do you.

583
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,844
Chinese, I mean.

584
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,564
You don't say a lot in English at all.

585
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,647
This room seems reasonably symmetrical.

586
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,718
Apart from the window.

587
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,202
I don't know about you,

588
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,290
but I don't appreciate
this forced proximity to each other.

589
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,610
I'll take this side.

590
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,486
I'm going to the bathroom.

591
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,594
Oh, you dirty little bastard.

592
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,562
Go on, then.

593
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,842
Oh, my God, that is absolutely disgusting.

594
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,808
Boom! Wanker.

595
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,082
Yeah?

596
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,878
- Yes. Who's this?
- It's...

597
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,644
Nathan? Is that you?

598
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,520
How are you doing? How's
it going out there?

599
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,071
Everything's different
and everyone's cleverer than me.

600
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,089
Look, Nathan, it's your
first night away and...

601
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,159
And first nights away
are always really, really shit.

602
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,405
I mean, it's only a fortnight, innit?

603
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,410
That's 14 days. And what's 14?

604
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,316
- A positive integer.
- Positive integer.

605
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,851
So think positively.

606
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,845
Which is the square root of?

607
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,119
196.

608
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,596
Whose prime factorisation is?

609
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,999
Two squared by seven squared.

610
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,122
See?

611
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,398
# One, two, buckle my shoe

612
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,639
# Three, four.

613
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,317
# Knock on my door.

614
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,608
# Five, six, pick up your sticks

615
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,129
# Seven, eight, lay them straight

616
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,758
# One, two.

617
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,324
# Buckle my shoe

618
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,610
# Three, four... #

619
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,795
Strong squad this year?

620
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,042
Testing my team for weaknesses, Richard?

621
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,950
You should relax more,
not take it so seriously.

622
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,761
It's all right for you, you got
the best in the world to choose from.

623
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,369
But having your niece on the team, Deng?

624
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,965
I mean, really?

625
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,167
You'll see.

626
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,961
Luke, I don't care.

627
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,084
Civilizations have used 10, not l2,
digits to count for millennia.

628
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,568
Yes, for purely primitive reasons, and the
fact that we have lo digits on our hands.

629
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,081
My argument is that if we use base 12

630
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,965
it is an infinitely superior system,
and more logical.

631
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,367
It takes 12 months for the Earth
to orbit the sun,

632
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,790
there are 12 hours a night
and 12 hours a day,

633
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,280
and each of those hours there
are 12 five-minute increments.

634
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,674
And what do you think, Nathan?

635
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,071
You a member of the dozenalist society?

636
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,647
Uh, I don't know.

637
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,202
Sorry.

638
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,435
People disagreeing with my opinion
is one thing, but no opinion?

639
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,869
You might as well not be here.

640
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,990
The vertices of a regular 72-gon.

641
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,280
The vertices of a regular 72-gon

642
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,597
are each coloured red,
green or blue in equal amounts.

643
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,044
Show that we can always choose four red,
four green or four blue vertices

644
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,915
such that each monochromatic set
form a congruent quadrilateral.

645
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,590
Yes, so, of course, the whole question can
be trivialised by Ramsey Theory.

646
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,720
No, sorry, Luke.
There were other hands up before you.

647
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,599
Well, I've already answered it now.

648
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,370
Really? You think so?

649
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,768
Is anyone here convinced by Luke's answer?

650
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,923
"It's interesting you ask
“is anyone convinced?"

651
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,804
rather than "is anyone not convinced?"

652
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,929
- I'm not convinced.
- I'm not convinced.

653
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,526
Nathan, would you join in, please?

654
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,755
This isn't a holiday.

655
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,239
Do you have a proof to share?

656
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,721
That's a disappointment.

657
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,990
Ben?

658
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,198
Muirhead's inequality
and Schur's inequality?

659
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,912
It's interesting stuff, Nathan,
but you do over-complicate everything.

660
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,555
Things can be much simpler
than they initially appear.

661
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,444
Did Mr Humphreys not tell you that?

662
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,880
Mind you, he never did quite live up
to his potential, that one.

663
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,152
It's because his illness was getting worse.

664
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,882
His Illness?

665
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,690
Is he still using that excuse?

666
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,156
Stephen Hawking has done
all right on far worse.

667
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,849
No, Tm afraid it wasn't
Mr Humphreys' body that failed him,

668
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,644
it was his character.

669
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,119
He just couldn't stay with it.

670
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,446
# If you must wait

671
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,638
# Wait for them here in my arms as I shake

672
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,835
# If you must weep...

673
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,870
- Is that strong enough for you?
- That's fine.

674
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,042
- No sugar?
- No sugar, sweet enough for me.

675
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,083
- How are you doing?
- Never better.

676
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,088
# you must mourn, my love

677
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,243
# Mourn with the moon
and the stars up above

678
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,990
# you must mourn

679
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,686
# Don't do it alone #

680
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,491
So, as well as your cycle of amitriptyline,

681
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:25,801
you were prescribed glucocorticosteroids
for your latest relapse.

682
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,798
You can't have got through
all of those already.

683
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,760
I wouldn't have thought.

684
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,319
Someone broke Into my car.

685
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,362
Unfortunate.

686
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,310
- Mention it to the police?
- No, there's no point, is there?

687
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,353
Because they only stole
the pills and some CD's.

688
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,727
Bee Gees' greatest hits.
Which I was gutted about

689
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,309
because I bloody love
those squeaky little bastards.

690
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,410
Soto be clear, these are not
anti-depressants, Mr Humphreys.

691
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,321
I mean, that's good
because I'm not depressed.

692
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,309
You know, maybe you wanna
change your mind

693
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,727
about going to one of those groups
I mentioned?

694
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,241
What, sit in a circle and listen
to how crap everybody else's life is?

695
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,319
- You know, sharing your issues might help.
- Sharing my issues?

696
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,691
Like how I hate wobbling about like a twat,

697
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,725
how I've started to lose control
of my bladder and it won't be Mung

698
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,150
before I lose control of my arse
and start to shit myself.

699
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,169
So, be careful,
'cause I could go at any second.

700
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,203
And then, to top it all off...

701
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,275
My dick doesn't work.

702
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,959
Is that the sort of thing
you think I should be sharing?

703
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,002
Yeah.

704
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,922
Perhaps.

705
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,449
No, but what I really want, Martin,
is for you to

706
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,282
not give up.

707
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,115
I should probably take this
because it's my crack dealer.

708
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,718
- Hello?
- Hello, Martin.

709
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,070
It... It's Julie. Yes.

710
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,680
That's right. Julie Ellis.

711
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,869
- Hi. Hi.
- Hiya.

712
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,284
- Thanks for coming round. It's...
- It's all right.

713
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,050
- Yeah.
- You sure you're ready for this?

714
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,319
Absolutely.

715
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,611
Okay, then.
Let's begin at the beginning, shall we?

716
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,642
Mmm-hmm.

717
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,928
It's all right. It's like anything.
It's scary at first.

718
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,480
But then when you get your head
round it, you'll be all right.

719
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,562
Uh...

720
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,282
Has he, um...

721
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,760
Has he rung you again?

722
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,109
- Nathan? No.
- Yeah.

723
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,089
Now, look, I'm sure he didn't mean
anything by it, calling me.

724
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,850
It's just he doesn't think
sometimes, does he?

725
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,089
Oh, well, no, he does think a lot.
Just mainly about maths.

726
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,634
Which is fine, you know.

727
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,080
He just thinks I'm a bit of an idiot
because I failed at maths at school.

728
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,351
I mean, I got everything else,
it was just, you know...

729
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,561
Mmm.

730
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,565
It's why I wanna do this really,
you know, get into his head more.

731
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,072
- I'm not making sense. Shut up, Julie.
- No, you're making perfect sense.

732
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,491
- Not really.
- No, you are.

733
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,275
I mean, the thing about maths,
as with any subject,

734
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,836
I think if you have an inspirational
teacher, urn, then you'll be away.

735
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,155
Which is where I come in.

736
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,203
Mr Inspirational.

737
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,481
Okay, then.

738
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,568
Let's start with something...

739
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,728
- Yeah. Pythagoras. Yay.
- Okay.

740
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,150
- Uh, can you say that word?
- Hypotenuse.

741
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,271
Bless you.

742
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,641
You all right? You got a
little bit of a cold?

743
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,330
# It's time to step up, mofo,
and see what you can do

744
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,526
# Keep your Pythag theorem to yourself
I raise you B minus C plus F equals 2 #

745
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,121
- Who's next? Who's next?
- Your turn, Luke.

746
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,475
Go, Luke.

747
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,284
Go, Luke. Go, Luke.

748
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,596
Thank you, but I really
don't see the point.

749
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,879
Apart from succumbing
to testosterone-fuelled irrationality.

750
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,359
It's because it's funny, Luke.

751
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,600
- Don't you have a sense of humour?
- Just ignore him.

752
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,637
He's hereto bring the mood down as always,
so don't let him.

753
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,200
- I'm hereto do maths.
- You're just a regular quadrilateral.

754
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,800
- Okay, take it, Ben.
- <i>#</i> UK, make some noise!

755
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,810
# 'Cause I'm
talking pi, bro, I'm talking...

756
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,164
# 1141592653553...

757
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,069
# 9793238462643... #

758
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,469
- Sorry.
- Um...

759
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,886
No, It's all right.

760
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,431
I was just practicing my fingering.

761
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,162
Um...

762
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,554
Go on, laugh.

763
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,675
No? Okay.

764
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,966
Um, do you Play?

765
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,601
- No.
- Come on.

766
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,916
So...

767
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,636
Beautiful sounds are
about frequency ratios.

768
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,794
The simpler the ratio, like this C
and this C, a simple ratio of 1:2.

769
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,269
Beautiful.

770
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,120
Comphex harmonies, like this...

771
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,247
Ugly.

772
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,922
Do you want to try?

773
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,647
Okay.

774
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,079
Is that right?

775
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,850
Yeah, it was, um...

776
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,480
- So you've never played before?
- No.

777
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,965
All music is maths, really.

778
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,840
Come on, I'll teach you the next bit.

779
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,524
- Is this all right?
- Oh, Christ, yeah.

780
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,280
- Do you want me to pour it out?
- Please.

781
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,763
It's nice to relax actually.
It's been a while.

782
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,995
- There you go.
- Thank you.

783
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,590
Well, it's good that you
find maths relaxing.

784
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,284
Must have been very difficult for you,

785
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,603
being just you and Nathan.

786
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,515
You know, without...

787
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,310
- Michael.
- Michael.

788
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,118
- Sorry. Dickhead.
- No.

789
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,129
- Me, not... Not Michael.
- I know.

790
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,957
Well, I mean, but you're...

791
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,247
You're the same. It must be the...

792
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,802
I mean, you're not with anyone.

793
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,472
- No. No.
- Are you? No.

794
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,166
My passion's my work, you see.

795
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,678
Sorry.

796
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,194
- You all right?
- Yeah.

797
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,566
Sometimes I wonder if Nathan
will ever find anyone, you know?

798
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,673
Nathan's nothing like me.

799
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,675
If you're worried that Nathan's
gonna end up like... You shouldn't.

800
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,962
- I wasn't. It would be a good thing.
- You shouldn't.

801
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,403
- I might just pop off to the toilet.
- Okay.

802
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,005
Uh, I got crisps.

803
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,396
<i>Oh...</i>

804
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,758
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

805
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,958
- Sorry, are you a bit stiff?
- No, what?

806
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,605
I mean, your back.

807
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,995
Oh...

808
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,196
- Shit. I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you?
- It's okay. Are you all right?

809
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,970
No. It's okay.

810
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,751
- You all right?
- Sorry. Sorry about that.

811
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,439
- It's okay.
- I, urn...

812
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,405
I just want to say that, um...

813
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,480
- You don't...
- For me... No, I do.

814
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,709
In this sort of situation there's only
so far that I am able to, urn, go.

815
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,638
And I don't want to make you disappointed.

816
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,089
You... You couldn't. I wouldn't... Sorry.

817
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,570
Yeah, I understand.

818
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,921
Do you mind if we get up?
I think I'm sat on a set square.

819
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,478
I think it's funny that your favourite
English food is Chinese.

820
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,251
Do you always like
to have everything the same?

821
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,398
Because I change
my favourite things all the time.

822
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,888
I don't usually like change.

823
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,958
- I like it here, though.
- Do you?

824
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,606
I mean, the Chinese approach to maths.

825
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,830
Yes?

826
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,447
Look.

827
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,032
This is called The Nine
Chapters of Mathematical Art.

828
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,530
This took more than 1,000 years to write.

829
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,205
In China, mathematics is more than numbers.

830
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,070
Um, It is like art.

831
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,961
Here.

832
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,447
There are... There are
eight prawn balls. I...

833
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,479
It needs to be a prime.

834
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:16,349
So... 20 random cards
are placed in a row all face-down.

835
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,753
A move consists of turning
a face-down card face-up

836
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,112
and turning over the card
immediately to the right.

837
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,632
Show that no matter
what the choice of cards to turn

838
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,165
this sequence of moves must terminate.

839
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,272
Nathan, hiding in the back won't help you.

840
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,320
Would you like to come up and show us?

841
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,165
Go on, Nathan.

842
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:29,170
Okay, so we need to... We need to look
at the cards not as cards, but as, uh...

843
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,840
As numbers.

844
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,676
We can call face-down cards...

845
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:39,767
One.

846
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,965
Face-up cards... Zero.

847
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,234
And initially it would be a sequence
of ones as the cards are all face down.

848
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:53,560
But after a while it would look
something like that.

849
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,971
And, as we can see, that
is a binary number.

850
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,756
And a move that consists of turning
a face-down card face up

851
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,952
and the card immediately to the right of it

852
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,636
could be that a one followed by a one,

853
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,326
will turn into a zero followed by a zero.

854
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:21,043
That would be like that.
Or it could be a one followed by a zero

855
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,676
turning into a zero followed by a one.

856
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,829
In either case, we can see that the
number in binary is strictly decreasing.

857
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,556
And that means?

858
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,887
Which means that the sequence
must terminate.

859
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,796
Because?

860
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,230
Because you can't keep taking away
from a positive integer

861
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,762
- without it turning negative.
- No, you can't.

862
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,796
You definitely can't. Good work;.

863
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,598
Everyone. Good work.

864
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,872
Uh, hello. My name's
Martin Humphreys and I'm an alcoholic.

865
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,671
No, not really. Well, a little bit.

866
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,326
Um, I've got MS, that's why I'm here.
I got that group tomorrow.

867
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,158
Uh...

868
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,433
No, seriously, thank you for
everybody who's, uh, shared and stuff.

869
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,926
Because there's definitely things
that I can identify with

870
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,561
and that I definitely recognise;.

871
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,647
Uh...

872
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,600
So, there's this person I like, but I know

873
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,403
how bad I'm gonna get

874
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,241
and it's very difficult to imagine
any sort of a rosy future

875
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,443
or anyone wanting to be
a part of that future with me.

876
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,356
Oh, Pm sorry, I'm sorry. Um...

877
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,274
Because you...

878
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,210
This is ridiculous.

879
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,681
Because in a few years' time I might not...
I might not even be able to hold hands

880
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,571
or have a little cuddle.

881
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,281
And...

882
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,436
That really, really scares me.

883
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,993
We should ask the others to suggest
a variety of trigonometric identities

884
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,875
to simplify the expressions,
which could include, say, coversine

885
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,870
or possibly covercosine or versine
or excosecant and so on.

886
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,991
Luke, we're trying to think of
fun questions for each other,

887
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,435
we're not trying to prove how many
trigonometric identities we know.

888
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,838
Well, then I really don't see the point.
We are competing with each other.

889
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,554
You can pretend you're everyone's
best friend all you like, Isaac,

890
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,721
but I'm here to get on the team.

891
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,160
Sorry, when have I ever tried
to be your best friend, Luke?

892
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,487
Nathan, this is a democracy,
yours is the casting vote.

893
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,275
Yes. Democracy in the true Chinese
sense of the word. Forget it.

894
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,520
- We'll just do your question...
- Are you gonna sulk?

895
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,918
Boo-hoo-hoo, poor Luke.

896
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,327
Sorry.

897
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:06,130
- I've come across people like him before.
- Definitely autistic.

898
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,841
He seems to have picked up all the
bad traits and none of the good.

899
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,288
- What bad traits?
- Obsessive.

900
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,554
- Socially incompetent.
- That sort of thing.

901
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,130
It's about adaptability, Nathan.

902
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,876
Sometimes we have to change our shape
so that we fit Tn.

903
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,116
That was you pushing the cage.

904
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:36,393
- I did not!
- Yes, you did! Polly!

905
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,518
Polly Parrot, wake up!

906
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,761
Polly!

907
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,593
Now that's what I calla dead parrot.

908
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:52,070
I love this. It's stinky tofu.

909
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,005
Stinky?

910
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,149
Oh, that's horrible.

911
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,513
It stinks but it tastes
really, really good.

912
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,755
Oh, look.

913
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:07,794
I used lo play this when I was small,
in my hometown, as a child.

914
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,362
A sweet.

915
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,395
- It's sticky.
- It's stuck in my teeth.

916
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,166
You have a funny face.

917
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,641
You don't like it? I'll eat it.
And you can have this'.

918
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,635
We should, uh... We should probably go.

919
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,236
Aren't you...

920
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,771
Aren't you worried about the exam?

921
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,366
Well, it is good to have a break.
Clear your mind.

922
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:43,550
Don't worry. We will both get into
the Olympiad in Cambridge. The IMO.

923
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,685
And I will meet your family
when I come and stay with you.

924
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,484
My cultural exchange.

925
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:51,876
Ah!

926
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,234
Look at this.

927
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,805
You're a bit like a turtle, aren't you?

928
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,354
In your shell.

929
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,401
Come on.

930
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,389
In China, do boys like me get bullied?

931
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,161
"Bullied"?

932
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,688
You know, like when people treat you
badly because you're clever.

933
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,606
Why would they do that?

934
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,487
I wish England was more like China.

935
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,007
I wish China was more like here.

936
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,010
In China we have to succeed for the family.

937
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,203
Especially for Uncle Deng.

938
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,484
Some people say that I am only here
because of him.

939
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,409
That's not true. No, you're really clever.

940
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,955
Thank you.

941
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,364
And you're very nice.

942
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,170
Prawn ball. Turtle boy.

943
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,800
Alternate team seating.

944
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,091
UK team member, Chinese team member.

945
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,682
Alternative seating.
UK team member, Chinese team member.

946
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,004
IMO conditions apply.

947
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,235
White card if you request some paper.

948
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,359
A blue for water.

949
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,644
Green if you need to go to the toilet.

950
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,002
Yellow to ask a question
but only in the first half-hour.

951
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:32,563
And red if you've left the gas on at home
or something and you need to leave.

952
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:38,230
The six of you who score highest will
represent Team UK, no "ifs", no "buts".

953
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:44,676
You may begin.

954
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:01,964
"Each integer is coloured
either red, yellow or green."

955
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,643
"Show that there always exist A, B, C,"

956
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,996
"such that A, B, C,."

957
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,200
"A plus B, A plus C..."

958
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,995
"A plus B, A plus C, B plus C
and A plus B plus C"

959
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,039
"are all the same colour."

960
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:14,204
Right! No point in
dilly-dallying, I suppose.

961
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,960
I'll pin your scores up on the board
in a second.

962
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,678
The five outstanding students

963
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,407
guaranteed a place at the IMO
in Cambridge this year are...

964
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,030
Isaac.

965
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,035
Lee Jing.

966
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:29,916
Rebecca.

967
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,598
Pav. And Ben.

968
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,967
The last place was very tight
between Nathan and Luke.

969
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,391
Both scores somewhat disappointing, but
one of you will have to go to Cambridge.

970
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,431
So, by the smallest fraction of a point,

971
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,835
the last place on the team goes to...

972
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,082
Nathan.

973
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,329
The six of you will be hosting
the Chinese team at your own homes

974
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,568
and I'll see you all in
Cambridge next week.

975
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,364
Onward, Christian soldiers.

976
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,686
A real Taiwanese last supper!

977
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,639
"As the old proverb say,
“Slowly, slowly, catchy prawn."

978
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,527
Now, you put your bait on the hooks
and you put your hooks in the water.

979
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,122
Don't worry, Nathan.
I only just made the team myself.

980
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,601
We should be celebrating!

981
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,207
Okay.

982
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,125
He's so strange.

983
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,890
At least we don't
have to see him again.

984
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,556
What a dick.

985
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,685
- Ah! Ah!
- What do I do?

986
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,993
Yes!

987
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,645
I'm sorry.

988
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:16,961
- How's it going?
- Good.

989
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,525
- These two are tender?
- Not yet.

990
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,792
Not yet. I have this all under control,
thank you very much. It's fine.

991
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,843
Okay, okay. You're the expert.

992
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,040
I think these ones... Can I get a plate?

993
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,676
Smells good.

994
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,201
Have you seen this?
Now that's what I call a dead prawn.

995
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,031
This prawn is definitely deceased.

996
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,515
When I bought it half-hour ago,
you assured me

997
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,353
that its lack of movement was due to
it being tired and shagged out.

998
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,006
Oh, my God.

999
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,445
"Say, “No, no, it's resting."

1000
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,730
- What?
- Say, "No, no, it's resting."

1001
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,081
No, no, it's resting.

1002
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:03,636
All right, then.
Well, if it's resting, I'll wake it up.

1003
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,889
Hello, Prawny. Prawny, wake up!

1004
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,849
This prawn wouldn't wake up
if I put 4,000 volts through it.

1005
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,327
It's bleedin' demised.
It has ceased to be.

1006
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,437
It's expired and gone to meet its maker.

1007
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,449
This is an ex-prawn!

1008
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,911
Seriously, Luke, what are you?

1009
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,159
Well, what are you, Isaac?

1010
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,250
“I find everything so easy
and I have everything.

1011
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,489
"And I'm gonna go out of my way to make
sure that you're not happy at all.“."

1012
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,761
Remarkable bird,
the Norwegian Blue. Beautiful plumage.

1013
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,605
<i>The plumage don't enter into it.
It's stone-dead.</i>

1014
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,404
No, no, no. It's resting.

1015
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,151
<i>All Right, then.
If it's resting, I'll wake it up.</i>

1016
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,687
Hello, Polly! I got a nice Cuttlefish
for you when you wake up, Polly Parrot!

1017
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,560
- There, it moved.
- No, it didn't.

1018
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,515
Nathan.

1019
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,355
Nathan...

1020
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,440
It's fine.

1021
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,550
I've done it before.

1022
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,310
Just got a bit carried away this time.

1023
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,872
How did your mum and dad explain it to you?

1024
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,927
When they found out.

1025
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,399
I presume you've been diagnosed.

1026
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,567
Mine said it made me unique.

1027
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,486
"“No one wants to be ordinary," they said.

1028
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,357
It's all right being weird

1029
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,114
as long as you're gifted.

1030
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,327
But if you're not gifted, then...

1031
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,514
That just leaves weird.

1032
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:09,846
Doesn't it?

1033
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,880
You are gifted, Luke.

1034
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,718
I don't even enjoy it.

1035
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,281
Maths.

1036
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,959
Isn't that stupid?

1037
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,754
What's the point?

1038
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,953
Right, away you go.

1039
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,244
Your chariot awaits.

1040
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,282
Nathan, can I have a word?

1041
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:20,404
When I speak to people
of a non-mathematical nature,

1042
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,073
they always struggle with the notion
that mathematics can be beautiful.

1043
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,329
But if beauty is truth and truth is beauty,

1044
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,324
well, then surely mathematics
is the most beautiful thing of all.

1045
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,036
<i>Ng?</i>

1046
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,552
There is rare beauty in your work, Nathan.

1047
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,845
But you are unpredictable and inconsistent.
Which worries me.

1048
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,913
You need to focus
if you're gonna win a medal.

1049
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,401
And don't be distracted
by your Chinese guest.

1050
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,674
<i>Oh, cai hang!</i>

1051
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,690
- Uh, the rainbow.
- Yeah, rainbow, cai hang.

1052
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,153
- Cai hang.
- Yeah.

1053
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,839
- Cai hang.
- Cai hang.

1054
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,839
So beautiful.

1055
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,287
- Welcome home. Hi, darling.
- Hey!

1056
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,478
- Hi, darling... Hi!
- Welcome back.

1057
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,240
Hi! Hello, sweetheart.

1058
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:10,756
- Hi.
- Hi.

1059
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,110
- How do you pronounce your name?
- Uh, Zhang Mei.

1060
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,011
- Zhang Mei. Julie. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1061
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,971
We put a little... Wait,
it's coming round now.

1062
01:18:19,997 --> 01:18:21,294
Cambridge, here we come!

1063
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,528
Whoo-whomwhoo-whoo!

1064
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,241
Why did you get my train set out?

1065
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,639
Um... Nathan...

1066
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,281
Sorry.

1067
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,750
- Welcome to England.
- Thank you.

1068
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,485
Nathan.

1069
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,519
Nathan, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry about the train.

1070
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,317
So that's Zhang Mei, is it?

1071
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,919
What's she like?

1072
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,158
She's... She's clever.

1073
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:04,515
And she's nice, too.

1074
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,509
Sounds to me like you quite like her.

1075
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,606
Of course I like her.

1076
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:15,956
Than you normally like; Things;.

1077
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,434
You know, uh, like more than...

1078
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,282
Ice cream. Or...

1079
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,989
Or maths.

1080
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,281
I don't like anything
more than I like maths.

1081
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,607
Nathan, darling, I wish
you'd just called me.

1082
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,755
Let me know that you're okay, you know?

1083
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,390
Why?

1084
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,000
Well, because, darling...

1085
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,605
I like you...

1086
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,324
More than I like ice cream.

1087
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,485
I said she could have my room.

1088
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,844
That's very gentlemanly of you.

1089
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,361
Isn't that the right thing to do?

1090
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,670
Yes.

1091
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,395
So, Tm... I'm blowing this up
for you then, am I?

1092
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:17,651
Yeah. But, uh, can I have it in my room?

1093
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,766
Zhang Mei's in there.

1094
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,355
We might want to study.

1095
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:36,875
So, that man today, he is not your father?

1096
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,595
No, he's my teacher. My father died.

1097
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,153
I'm sorry, Nathan.

1098
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,035
It's not your fault.

1099
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:54,767
I mean, I feel sad for you.

1100
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:00,354
It must be hard to lose someone
that you love so much.

1101
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,273
You think it will work?

1102
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:41,131
100%? I hope so.

1103
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,592
We did it! It actually works.

1104
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,040
Right-oh, observers. It's time to assemble.

1105
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,998
Panama hats, Richard? Really?

1106
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,077
Yes, it was a consensus decision.

1107
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,760
I discussed it with myself
and I decided it would be a good idea.

1108
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,848
Are you sure you're not
too rusty for all this?

1109
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,270
I can manage a bit of shepherding.

1110
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,926
Been Nathan's teacher for seven years,
I wanna see this through.

1111
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,120
He's a very sensitive kid.

1112
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,957
Yeah, yeah, I suppose children
are like animals.

1113
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,521
You get attached to them after a while.

1114
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,118
Oh, my gosh!
Is this where you're staying?

1115
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,201
Oh, wow.

1116
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:14,950
<i>Oh...</i>

1117
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:19,835
Well...

1118
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,955
So, um, you've got your phone on you
and you know you can call me any time.

1119
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,075
So...

1120
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,483
I'll be thinking of you.

1121
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,250
Okay. Well, goodbye.

1122
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,674
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1123
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,394
- Bye.
- Bye.

1124
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,356
Bye, darling.

1125
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:47,647
- What are you doing?
- I was taking your hand.

1126
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:49,875
Come on!

1127
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,007
You let go!

1128
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:56,953
Isaac Newton. G.H. Hardy.

1129
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:00,354
Ramanujan. Bertrand Russell.

1130
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,766
They all began their
mathematical journeys here.

1131
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,712
Trinity alumni have accumulated
thirty two Nobel prizes

1132
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,309
and no less than four Fields Medals.

1133
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,070
Although Russell did go off the rails
somewhat later in his career.

1134
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:17,319
But nevertheless,
this is the most prestigious place

1135
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:21,229
to study mathematics on the planet.
And you are here.

1136
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,389
Because they are the past
and you are the future.

1137
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,606
So don't let me down.

1138
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,361
Ladies and gentlemen,

1139
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,401
I would like to welcome; You!
To the 59th International.

1140
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:38,921
Mathematical Olympiad in Cambridge.

1141
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,798
Please welcome Australia.

1142
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:58,443
A warm welcome for Bangladesh.

1143
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,355
Canada.

1144
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,367
The People's Republic of China.

1145
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,754
A round of applause for United Kingdom.

1146
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,838
- Nathan?
- Yeah?

1147
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,389
I can'! Sleep.

1148
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:56,443
You can, uh, stay here if you want.
Like... Like at home.

1149
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:01,921
What are you reading?

1150
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,552
It's the Ten Years of
Mathematical Challenges,

1151
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,078
'97 to '06 edition.

1152
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,596
Oh.

1153
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,549
I'm sorry.

1154
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,131
Is that right?

1155
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,630
Yes.

1156
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,760
Are you okay?

1157
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:34,689
I am glad I am here with you.

1158
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,121
Me, too.

1159
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:10,597
I can't be here with people
thinking I don't deserve it.

1160
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,630
Why don't you just stay
until the end of the competition?

1161
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,246
No, Nathan!

1162
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,528
Nathan...

1163
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,365
Just because...

1164
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,233
Just because I'm going, it...

1165
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,283
It does not mean that...

1166
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,910
I don't find myself liking you.

1167
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:23,438
Excuse me. Sorry.

1168
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,728
Nathan? Um...

1169
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,351
Did you get into trouble? About Zhang Mei?

1170
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:35,554
I think I might have accidentally

1171
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,445
sort of mentioned something to someone.

1172
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:43,249
I didn't mean to hurt anyone. It's just...

1173
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:48,274
Anyway...

1174
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,406
I'm sorry.

1175
01:30:58,040 --> 01:30:59,121
Oi! Oggy!

1176
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:01,072
- Oi!
- 099v, easy, my!

1177
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:02,486
Oi, Oi, Oi!

1178
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,274
Hello, Nathan.

1179
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:13,758
I know, I know, I know. I know you said
not to bother you, but I just, um...

1180
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:16,200
Well, I just wanted to...
I wanted to cheer on Team Nathan.

1181
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,606
Go, Nathan!

1182
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:22,290
Anyway, urn, I'll be
waiting outside and, uh...

1183
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:23,996
Best of luck, darling.

1184
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,632
There's no such thing as luck.

1185
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,596
No.

1186
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,081
Nathan.

1187
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:15,156
I'm gonna be circling, so I'll try and
slip you some of the answers, all right?

1188
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,841
That's cheating.

1189
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,086
You know I was joking.

1190
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,069
You're gonna be all right.

1191
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,968
Four hours and 30 minutes.
You may begin.

1192
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,992
"4n squared trains
are arranged in a 2n <i>x</i> Zn square"

1193
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:51,319
"and each is painted with
one of four colours."

1194
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:56,008
<i>"Every 2 x 2 square of trains
involves each of the four colours."</i>

1195
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,630
"Every 2 x 2 square of trains..."

1196
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:05,076
<i>"Every 2 x 2 square of trains
involves each of the four colours."</i>

1197
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,032
"Prove that the trains..."

1198
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:13,079
"Prove that the trains on
the comers of the Zn x 2n square"

1199
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:14,725
"are painted with different colours."

1200
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:04,447
It must be hard to lose someone
that you love so much.

1201
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:43,685
What's the matter, mate?

1202
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:55,885
Nathan?

1203
01:34:56,280 --> 01:34:57,441
Nathan!

1204
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,001
Nathan!

1205
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:10,120
Open the door. Martin, open the door!

1206
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:13,127
Open the door, Martin. Martin!

1207
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,001
Martin!

1208
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,195
Nathan?

1209
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:22,961
Nathan!

1210
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,799
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

1211
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,041
He just wanted to go, Julie.
I could see it in his eyes.

1212
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:35,119
And Tm sorry,
I didn't wanna stop him. I'm sorry.

1213
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,709
It's okay.

1214
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:47,875
Nathan?

1215
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:51,566
Nathan?

1216
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:23,207
Zhang Mei said that she liked me.

1217
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,561
Right.

1218
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:27,875
That's a...

1219
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,480
That's a good thing, isn't it?

1220
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:37,520
And do you... Do you think that you might

1221
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:41,567
have those kind of feelings, too?

1222
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,678
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

1223
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:48,200
I've been trying to work it out. But...

1224
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,322
I found a formula. I just
can't understand it.

1225
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:58,398
Well, as far as I know, Nathan,
no one ever has.

1226
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:03,716
I know that when... When I'm around her,

1227
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,036
my brain works differently.

1228
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:13,919
And my body feels strange and I don't
know what it means or why it matters.

1229
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,611
Why it matters?

1230
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:19,804
It matters because...

1231
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:23,156
Well, when...

1232
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,568
When somebody loves you,

1233
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:32,519
it means that they see something in you...

1234
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,968
That they think is worth something.
So it sort of...

1235
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,524
It adds value to you.

1236
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,394
But it can be hard...

1237
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:52,836
You know,
when you love someone and they...

1238
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:56,476
They show no sign that
they love you back, then ifs...

1239
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:59,766
Then it's unequal. Or, um...

1240
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,606
When... When someone you love...

1241
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:11,277
ls subtracted from you...

1242
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:19,004
Then it feels like, you know,
that your value is less than it was.

1243
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,484
Does that make sense?

1244
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,478
Why did he have to go?

1245
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,474
I don't know.

1246
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,031
- It just doesn't make sense.
- I know.

1247
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,250
It never will. It was an accident.

1248
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,873
Things made sense when I was with him.

1249
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:46,925
But why? Why...

1250
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,630
What did he do that I don't?

1251
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,929
How did he make sense of things for you?

1252
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,841
Nathan?

1253
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:08,121
1 don't know,
he made me laugh and...

1254
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:12,112
He stuck chips up his nose.

1255
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,247
What?

1256
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,917
He stuck chips up his nose?

1257
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,168
Oh, okay, well, I'll
stick a chip up my nose.

1258
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,811
Talk to me now?

1259
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,115
Nathan?

1260
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,355
Nathan.

1261
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,047
Nathan, it's all right. It's okay.

1262
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:49,595
It hurts.

1263
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:53,049
I know, darling. Me, too.

1264
01:39:58,280 --> 01:39:59,691
Come here.

1265
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,245
It's all right.

1266
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:06,116
It's all right, it's all right, good boy.
It's okay.

1267
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,313
Hey, hey.

1268
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,313
Where is Zhang Mei now?

1269
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,110
She... She's gone to the station.

1270
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:38,761
Do you wanna fetch her back?

1271
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:42,156
Yeah.

1272
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,437
Okay, we'd better be quick.

1273
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,047
What?

1274
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:56,961
Nothing.

1275
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:24,751
# Miss you terribly already
Miss the space between your eyelids

1276
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,349
# Where I'd stare through awkward sentences

1277
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,471
# And avoid through awkward silence

1278
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:33,924
# Miss your teeth when they chatter
when we smoked out in my garden

1279
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,873
# When we couldn't sleep for all the heat.

1280
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,991
# Soft talk began to harden

1281
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:41,521
# Miss your small hands in the palm of mine

1282
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,597
# The fact they're good at making

1283
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:46,007
# Miss your sitting up incessantly

1284
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:50,205
# And the fact you're always
waking in the night

1285
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:55,553
# The night

1286
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,515
# And I

1287
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:05,917
# I hope for your life

1288
01:42:07,640 --> 01:42:10,075
# You forget about mine

1289
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:15,432
# Forget about mine

1290
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,630
# Miss your teeth dug in my shoulder

1291
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:25,047
# As we rolled in early mornings

1292
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:26,992
# Miss your arm dying beneath me.

1293
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:29,555
# As I lay there, simply yawning

1294
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,670
# Please forget me

1295
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:31,847
# You were right, dear

1296
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:34,327
# I am cold and self-involved

1297
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,750
# And though I'll miss you, recent lover

1298
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,008
# lam weak and therefore fold

1299
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,077
# Get distracted by my music

1300
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,487
# Think of nothing else but art

1301
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,830
# I'll write my loneliness in poems

1302
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:48,486
# If I can just think how to start

1303
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,830
# Dot my I's with eyebrow pencils

1304
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,883
# Close my eyelids, hide my eyes

1305
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,230
# I'll be idle in my ideals

1306
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:58,364
# Think of nothing else but!

1307
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,608
# And I

1308
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:05,117
# And I

1309
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:11,007
# And I

1310
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:15,875
# I hope for your life.

1311
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:19,993
# You can forget about mine

1312
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:25,918
# Just forget about mine

1313
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:31,076
# And mine

1314
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,043
# Mine #
