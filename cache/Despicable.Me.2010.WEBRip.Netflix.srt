-Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
-[all] Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.

170
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,006
Hello, girls!

171
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,925
Anybody come to adopt us
while we were out?

172
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,845
Mmm. Let me think.

173
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,430
No!

174
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,811
Edith! What did you put on my desk?

175
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,813
A mud pie.

176
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:57,485
[sighs] You're never gonna get
adopted, Edith. You know that, don't you?

177
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,862
-Yeah, I know.
-Good.

178
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,532
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?

179
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,701
Mmm, sort of.

180
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:10,039
We sold 43 mini-mints, 30 choco-swirlies,
and 18 coco-nutties.

181
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,126
[sighs] Okay.

182
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,380
Well, you say that
like it's a great sale day.

183
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,633
Look at my face!

184
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,969
Do you still think it's a great sale day?

185
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,889
Eighteen coco-nutties.

186
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,977
I think we can do a little better
than that, don't you?

187
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:33,854
Yeah.

188
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:38,317
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend
in the Box of Shame, would we? No.

189
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,902
-No, Miss Hattie.
-[all] No, Miss Hattie.

190
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,697
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.

-Hi, Penny.

Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...

195
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,047
I just wanted to congratulate you
on stealing the pyramid.

-[sighing]
-That was you, wasn't it?

197
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:06,387
Or was it a villain
who's actually successful? [laughing]

198
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,266
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something

199
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,102
that's very, very big, very important.

200
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,272
When you hear about it,
you're going to be very proud.

202
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,026
Good luck with that.
Okay, I'm out of here.

Yes, please have a seat.

That's one small step for man,

00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,576
one giant leap for mankind.

209
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,412
Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon.

212
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,970
Hey.

213
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:22,606
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.

214
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,696
It's a mathematical term,

215
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,283
a quantity represented by an arrow,
with both direction and magnitude.

216
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,289
Vector! That's me,

217
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:44,628
'cause I'm committing crimes
with both direction and magnitude.

218
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,380
Oh, yeah!

219
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,134
Check out my new weapon.

220
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,469
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!

221
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,306
Fires live piranhas. Ever seen one before?
No, you haven't. I invented it.

222
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,559
Do you want a demonstration?

223
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,729
Oh! Shoot! So difficult, sometimes,

224
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,856
to get the piranha
back inside of my... [exclaims]

225
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,358
[receptionist] Mr. Gru,
Mr. Perkins will see you now.

226
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,527
[Gru] So, all I need

227
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,655
is money from the bank to build a rocket.

228
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:14,700
-And then, the moon is ours.
-Wow!

229
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,453
Well, very nice presentation.

230
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,830
I'd like to see this shrink ray.

231
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,666
Absolutely! Will do.

232
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,043
[softly] Soon as I have it.

233
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,046
You don't have it?

234
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,632
And yet you have the audacity
to ask the bank for money?

235
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,385
Apparently.

236
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,848
Do you have any idea of the capital
that this bank has invested in you, Gru?

237
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:44,063
With far too few of your sinister plots
actually turning a profit.

238
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:48,358
How can I put it?
Let's say this apple is you.

239
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,111
If we don't start
getting our money back...

240
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,615
Get the picture?

241
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,745
Look, Gru, the point is,
there are a lot of new villains out there,

242
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,873
younger than you, hungrier than you,

243
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,000
younger than you.

244
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,377
Like that young fellow out there
named Vector.

245

He just stole a pyramid!

246
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,719
I've got it. I've got it.

247
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,681
Um... So, as far as
getting money for the rocket...

248
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,768
Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk.

00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,372
-Do the effects wear off?
-Uh, so far,

497
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,457
no. No, they don't.

498
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,087
And here, of course,
is the new weapon you ordered.

No, no.

501
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,721
I said "dart gun," not... Okay.

502
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,057
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering

503
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,768
under what circumstances
would we use this?

504
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,312
But, anyway.

505
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,815
What I really wanted to show you was this.

506
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,698
Now those are cookie robots!

[Agnes singing] La, la, la, la
I love unicorns

508
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,831
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!

509
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,500
We got bored. What is this place?

510
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,419
Can I drink this?

511
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,796
Do you want to explode?

00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,506
[exclaims]

00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,633
Gru!

514
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,676
Get back in the kitchen!

515
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,887
-Will you play with us?
-No.

516
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,514
-Why?
-Because I'm busy.

517
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,183
[scoffs] Doing what?

518
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,517
Um...

519
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,186
Okay, okay, you got me.

520
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,022
The dentist thing is more of a hobby.

521
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,025
In real life, I am a spy.

522
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,695
And it is top secret,
and you may not tell anybody,

My unicorn!

00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,165
You have to fix it.

528
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:36,545
Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated.
By definition, it cannot be fixed.

That's freaking me out. What is she doing?

532
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,265
She's gonna hold her breath
until she gets a new one.

533
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,893
It is just a toy. Now stop it!

Okay, okay! I'll fix it!

Tim! Mark! Phil!

537
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,738
This is very important.

538
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,284
You have to get the little girl
a new unicorn toy.

539
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,451
Eh?

Go, and hurry!

What are those?

545
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,049
They are my cousins.

It was your cousin's idea.

What?

564
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,728
Okay, bedtime.

Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.

00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,493
Just so you know,

you're never gonna be my dad.

Hmm. I think I can live with that.

573
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,709
Are these beds made out of bombs?

574
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:25,423
Yes, but they are very old
and highly unlikely to blow up.

575
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,384
But try not to toss and turn.

576
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,593
Cool.

-Will you read us a bedtime story?
-No.

578
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,892
But we can't go to sleep
without a bedtime story.

579

Well, then it's going to be
a long night for you, isn't it?

580
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:45,025
So, good night, sleep tight,
and don't let the bed bugs bite.

00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,988
Because there are literally
thousands of them.

But first, we're going to dance class.

the dance class today.

Actually, we can't

[imitating Gru]
skip the dance class today.

That's fantastic. Wonderful.

No.

No?

We're not going to deliver cookies

[Gru] Really?

00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:31,006
Well, I am not driving you to dance class.

604
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:36,470
So if you want to go,
you are going to have to walk yourselves.

605
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,852
What are you doing?

606
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,688
Walking to dance class.

607
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,731
Ya? Okay, fine.

608
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,694
You just keep walking,
because I'm really not driving you!

609
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,987
[Margo] Okay.

Seriously, I'm going to count to three!

And you had better be in this car!

-Here you go.
-What is it?

Of course, of course.

All right.
Our first customer is a man named Vector.

But he's a V.

You know, we're supposed
to start with the A's.

628
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,466
Then we go to the B's. Then we...

629
00:43:55,549 --> 00:44:00,471
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!

[sighs]

631
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,768
I was just thinking

632
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:09,605
that it might be nice
to deliver Mr. Vector's first.

633
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,315
That is all.

634

Almost over. It's almost over.

of Vector-tude! [chuckling]

Do you have my cookies for me?

Four boxes of mini-mints,
two toffee totes,

638

two caramel clumpies
and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.

639
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:45,099
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else
order that many cookies.

640
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,266
Not likely.

641

Name one person
who ordered more cookies than me.

642
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,187
That'll be $52.

643

Right.

Why are you wearing pajamas?

-Stuff.

00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,482
What sort of stuff?

652
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,985
Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand.

653
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,486
Like sleeping?

654
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,448
They are not pajamas!

All right.

765
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:47,033
Sorry about that. Where were we?

766
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,702
You were sitting on the toilet.

Let's face reality, Gru.

You've been at this for far too long
with far too little success.

We're gonna put our faith,

that the bank is no longer funding us.

we have no money.

So how will we get to the moon?

The answer is clear.

We won't.

-But we're not tired!
-Well, I am tired.

Will you read us a bedtime story?

No.

The physical appearance of the "please"
makes no difference.

It is still no, so go to sleep.

But we can't. We're all hyper!

And without a bedtime story, we'll just
keep getting up and bugging you.

Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.

989
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:44,281
And we are good to go
in T minus 10 seconds.

Nice work, Doctor. All systems go.

Ah-ha!

I've got it!

I've got the moon!

Come on, come on!

He's still not here.

1013
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,059
Why would he come? He gave us up.

1014
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:00,686
But he pinkie promised!

1015

Girls, girls, places!

1016
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:06,400
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.

1017
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:08,861
Can we just wait a few more minutes?

1018
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,117
All right. But just a few more minutes.

1019
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,286
He's not coming, guys.

[Gru] Okay, okay. There's the library.

1025
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:08,420
That's Third Street. The dance studio...

Over?

1031
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,211
Vector, open up!

1032
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:35,465
First give me the moon. Then we'll talk.

-Zip it, Happy Meal.

01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,108
Now, the girls.

1036
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:57,571
Actually, I think I'll hold on to them
a little while longer.

1037
01:16:57,654 --> 01:16:58,697
No!

1038
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,450
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!

1039
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,660
Listen close, you little punk.

1040
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:07,039
When I get in there,
you are in for a world of pain!

[exclaiming sarcastically]

1042
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,167
I'm really scared!

1043
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:15,464
He is gonna kick your butt.

[scoffs]

1045
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,673
[Vector] What? He punched my shark!

1046
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,534
Ha! There he is!

1047
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,708
[Nefario] Hang on, Gru.

1048

Vector has the girls. Go!

1052
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:57,107
What happened to the ship? It's big again!

1053
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,943
-Not as big as the moon is going to be!
-What?

1054
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,112
The larger the mass of an object,

1055
01:19:02,195 --> 01:19:05,115
the quicker the effects
of the shrink ray wear off!

1056

I call it the Nefario Principle.

I just came up with it now, actually.

What are you girls doing back there?

You got it.

[Gru] Okay, girls! Girls!

-You're going to have to jump.
-[Edith] Jump?

1076
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:17,229
Are you insane?

1077
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:18,730
Don't worry, I will catch you.

1078
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,066
You gave us back!

1079

I know, I know.
And it is the worst mistake I ever made.

1080
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:27,823
But you have to jump now.

1081

It'll be okay.

1082
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:36,498
Okay, girls.

And I will never let you go again.

This time, good triumphs,

to its rightful place in the sky.

is baffled, leaving everyone to wonder,

who is this mysterious hero?

And what will he do next?

Okay, girls. Time for bed.

Not to pat myself on the back,
but, yes, it probably will be.
