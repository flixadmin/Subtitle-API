1
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,793
Dad.

2
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,848
Let me see you.

3
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,142
Get out!

4
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,868
Damn it.

5
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,329
They're not here.

6
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,289
Who are you?

7
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,041
How did you get here?

8
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,295
I heard something.

9
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,091
I thought they were here.

10
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,427
Out of my way.

11
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,518
Where did you come from? Is it okay there?

12
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,062
It's fucking okay everywhere.

13
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,899
The school is heaven.

14
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,986
-Later.
-Where are you going?

15
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,780
You'll die if you go out.

16
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,741
Don't go out, asshole! Do as I say.

17
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,962
Aren't you hungry?

18
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,797
What?

19
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:19,889
Aren't you

20
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,392
hungry?

21
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,185
I'm starving.

22
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,316
I'm full right now.

23
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,069
So you get to live.

24
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,280
Count yourself lucky.

25
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,704
What is that smell?

26
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,045
Why do you smell like them?

27
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,922
What? What do you smell?

28
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,049
Let go of me.

29
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,635
You were with Cheong-san, weren't you?

30
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,928
Who's that?

31
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,681
-Where is that asshole?
-What are you talking about?

32
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:03,933
You want to know?

33
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,647
Are you okay?

34
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,357
Are you hurt?

35
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,067
What took you so long?

36
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,652
I kept waiting.

37
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,366
Are you kids okay?

38
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:24,787
Yes.

39
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,206
Good.

40
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:31,961
Cheong-san.

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,215
Mr. Nam.

42
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,602
Can you all run?

43
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,646
-Yes.
-Yes.

44
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,690
Good.

45
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:57,070
If you go through the tennis courts
and the construction site,

46
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,364
you'll reach the mountain.

47
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,076
Go over the mountain and get to Yangdong--

48
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,993
Mr. Nam!

49
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,298
Kids. Run!

50
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,341
Shit.

51
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,805
GYMNASIUM

52
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,056
Hurry!

53
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,228
Run! Hurry!

54
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,689
To the tennis courts!

55
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,524
Hurry up!

56
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,196
Run. Go inside!

57
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,739
Go in.

58
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,415
Get in!

59
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,046
Run!

60
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,841
Hey. Hold on.

61
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,143
We can't go out there. We can't.

62
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,186
What should we do, Dae-su?

63
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,229
Damn it.

64
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,605
What do we do?

65
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,108
We're screwed.

66
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,862
Hey!

67
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,771
Step back.

68
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,731
Let's go.

69
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,069
Hurry.

70
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,572
Hurry.

71
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,369
Cheong-san, take On-jo.

72
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,788
Dad. Where are you going?

73
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,498
Dad!

74
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:14,916
Dad!

75
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,545
Dad!

76
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,592
Dad!

77
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,937
Dad!

78
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,356
Run!

79
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,652
Get out! Go out now!

80
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,029
Go!

81
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,828
Mr. Nam!

82
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,499
Go! Get out!

83
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,841
Dad.

84
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:07,969
Dad.

85
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,722
Look at me, On-jo.

86
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,141
Go.

87
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,603
Run.

88
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,150
-Go!
-Dad.

89
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,569
Go!

90
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,071
Go!

91
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,074
On-jo! Go…

92
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,577
Run.

93
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,248
Dad…

94
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,001
On-jo!

95
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,753
Run!

96
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,591
Dad!

97
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,565
NOTICE FOR CONSTRUCTION WORK

98
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:03,983
Hurry!

99
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,779
No!

100
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,240
What? Why?

101
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,957
Go upstairs. Go!

102
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,001
Hurry! To the second floor!

103
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,961
Hurry!

104
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,724
Where do we go?

105
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,355
There's no way out. It's blocked.

106
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,066
-There's nothing here too.
-This way!

107
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,529
-Is there a way?
-Let's go out this way.

108
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:50,947
The bench.

109
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:56,994
Hurry up.

110
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,250
Damn it.

111
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,803
Careful.

112
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,478
Stay away from the edge.

113
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,479
Okay.

114
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,527
-Come here.
-Quiet.

115
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,113
Don't say a word.

116
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,003
On-jo! Go!

117
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,088
Dad!

118
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,752
It's okay.

119
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,046
Just cry.

120
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,178
It's better to just die.

121
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:27,478
This virus changes a person
into a different being.

122
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,314
The person I loved

123
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,900
becomes a monster.

124
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,529
You can forget someone who dies…

125
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,869
but it's hard to forget someone
who has changed.

126
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,069
That is the last image…

127
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,449
of the people I loved most.

128
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,472
Remember now?

129
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:49,101
I don't know anyone
named Cheong-san, you freak.

130
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,730
Everyone went to the auditorium,
and I got out

131
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,065
by myself.

132
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:55,983
Auditorium?

133
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,236
I don't know who Cheong-san is.

134
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,991
We went with some juniors. That's all.

135
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:10,039
Then they must be
at the auditorium right now.

136
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,674
You're fucking brave.

137
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,723
You'd better run.

138
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,558
Or I'll eat you.

139
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,304
I told you to run. Why don't you listen?

140
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,360
Fuck. Nothing is working out.

141
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,279
We keep hitting dead ends.

142
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,738
Be quiet.

143
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,575
It's your fault Joon-yeong died.

144
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,159
Dae-su. Don't.

145
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,372
If you hadn't bitched at him earlier,
he wouldn't have jumped out there.

146
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,751
Fine. It's my fault he died. Happy?

147
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,088
-Are you happy, asshole?
-You give it a rest too.

148
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,464
Dae-su.

149
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,260
What does it matter who's responsible
for someone living or dying?

150
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,637
What does living or dying even mean?

151
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,014
I have no idea.

152
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,850
If we get out of here, is that living?

153
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,227
Our friends died.

154
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,105
Our moms and dads died.

155
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,150
What's the point in living?

156
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,943
Do you want to die?

157
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,612
Then will you die?

158
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,448
Have you tried being seniors?

159
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,742
Do you even know
how it feels to want to die?

160
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,243
Is it some badge of honor?

161
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,913
You try being one.
You'll see what it's like.

162
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:14,955
You juniors

163
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,877
better survive until next year
and see what it's like being seniors.

164
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:25,424
Survive until next year and tell me
which is tougher, zombies or senior year.

165
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,848
Your father…

166
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,937
He saved all of us.

167
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,483
I'll never forget it as long as I live.

168
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,610
None of us will.

169
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,991
If someone is remembered by many people,
that person…

170
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,121
goes to heaven.

171
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,429
Mi-jin.

172
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,098
Let's go.

173
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,099
Where? Why?

174
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,144
Let's look for a spot
we can jump off from. We're the seniors.

175
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,981
Whatever. It's not like
they show us any respect.

176
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,316
I'll go this way. You go that way.

177
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,779
Damn it. She's so cool.

178
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,158
I'll go.

179
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,284
Stay down.

180
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,327
No.

181
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,457
Why, you…

182
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,417
Move.

183
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,427
Shit.

184
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,350
I hope no one steps up anymore.

185
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,313
Whatever happens…

186
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,651
I hope no one sacrifices themselves.

187
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,783
It's too hard living
because of someone else.

188
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,328
There's nothing we can do for them.

189
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,916
Living life to the full
in honor of the person who died…

190
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,877
It's too selfish.

191
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,131
You can't die even if you want to.

192
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,093
You lack the courage to live,
but you can't die.

193
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:37,848
Let's…

194
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,517
let's talk a little later.

195
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,981
Tomorrow or the day after. Or next week.

196
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,569
After we eat and get ourselves clean.

197
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,281
That's what we agreed to do.

198
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,127
This side.

199
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,422
What?

200
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,591
You probably don't remember.

201
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,635
Don't remember what?

202
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,719
Cheong-san, hold on.

203
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,434
Is this better

204
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,311
or is this better?

205
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,650
Look closely. This? Or this?

206
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,238
The left side is much better.

207
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,699
What are you talking about?

208
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,246
I'll tell you tomorrow.

209
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,881
Cheong-san.

210
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,967
ONE HEART

211
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,610
This moron became a zombie.

212
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,555
Next we'll raise it to 24 kHz.

213
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,819
Turn it off!

214
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,822
Tests we ran in 17 locations across Hyosan

215
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,159
showed that they reacted
most strongly to 24 kHz.

216
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,711
We'll begin the briefing.

217
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,631
We will emit sounds using drones

218
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,050
and draw the infected to target locations

219
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,054
to maximize the impact
with minimal explosions.

220
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:08,225
There are four target locations.
The Hyosan Intersection,

221
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:12,646
the sports complex, Hyosan High,
and Hyosan Future College.

222
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,814
Estimated casualties?

223
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,358
Hyosan has a population of 170,000,

224
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,860
and 110,000 of them are
in quarantine camps.

225
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,988
Thus, we estimate about 60,000 casualties.

226
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:25,659
About 50,000 are infected,
and 10,000 are uninfected or asymptomatic.

227
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,454
We'll send in ground troops after
the bombing to take care of the rest.

228
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:34,293
Sound the evacuation warnings nonstop
until right before the operation begins.

229
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,445
Eat him.

230
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,869
It's okay. Eat him.

231
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,874
I'm hungry.

232
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,799
I'm hungry.

233
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,410
It's okay.

234
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,163
It's not okay.

235
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,082
It is.

236
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,876
If it happens again,

237
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,961
bite me, not yourself.

238
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,677
If you bite me, I'll just become like you.

239
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:30,117
I really think that's the only way out.

240
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,703
No. It drops into the basement
on that side,

241
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,373
and there are exposed steel bars.
So we can't jump down.

242
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,669
That side faces the school,
so there's no point.

243
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,630
The ground is filled with zombies,
so we'll die if we go down.

244
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,008
There's a door on the first floor
that leads to the mountain.

245
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,635
I think we have to go that way.

246
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,847
But it's full of zombies in there.

247
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,564
Can't we reach the roof
if we climb that and the windows?

248
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,860
If someone goes to the roof
and screams, the zombies will follow.

249
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,488
Then it'll empty out
and the rest can escape.

250
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,739
I think that will work.

251
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,740
No.

252
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,286
-If that's the only way--
-I said no.

253
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,872
Please, let's not have
anyone sacrifice themselves.

254
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,790
I'm against it too.

255
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,085
We agreed to survive together.

256
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,254
Me too.

257
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,798
I feel the same.

258
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,968
So do I.

259
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,762
Then let's wait for now.

260
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,763
And then what?

261
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,849
Do you have a plan?

262
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,935
It might rain again,
and then they'll hear us less.

263
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,562
Who knows when it'll rain?

264
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,857
My knees are aching.
I think it'll rain soon.

265
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,400
Look at the sky.

266
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,238
It's way too clear.

267
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,411
Do you hear that?

268
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,248
Hear what?

269
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,627
They're telling us to take cover.

270
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,921
Who is?

271
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,340
Attention, all citizens.

272
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,258
There will be explosions
at the sports complex,

273
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,136
Hyosan High, Future College,
and Hyosan Intersection.

274
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,807
If you hear this, take shelter in nearby
subways and underground parking lots…

275
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,976
There'll be explosions.
We need to take cover.

276
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,728
Explosions? What explosions?

277
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,021
Listen again.

278
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,318
Hyosan Intersection, Future College…

279
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,531
and our school will be blown up.

280
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,868
Is the army going to
fucking launch missiles at us?

281
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,119
When?

282
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,412
They're not saying.

283
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,414
They're just telling people
to evacuate now.

284
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,708
Fuck. Where are we supposed to go?

285
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,961
So when are the explosions happening?

286
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,964
Initiate operation.

287
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,068
Activate the sound waves.

288
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,759
Begin tactical flight.

289
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,930
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

290
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,896
Won't we all die if we stay here?

291
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,649
Do they say where to flee to?

292
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,985
They said hide underground
or in bathrooms.

293
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,821
What if it's a nuclear bomb?

294
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,367
Korea doesn't have nukes. Get a grip.

295
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,493
Whatever!

296
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,079
They're blowing up our school.

297
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,582
Where are we supposed to take cover?
There's nowhere to go.

298
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,461
Cheong-san!

299
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,630
What?

300
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,344
It's Gwi-nam.

301
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,221
That asshole doesn't die.

302
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,597
Who is that?

303
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,558
Maybe we misheard.

304
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,894
It's quiet now.

305
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:19,739
Here you are.

306
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,283
-What the hell?
-Cheong-san!

307
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,335
Hey!

308
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:33,753
Shit!

309
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,381
Cheong-san!

310
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:26,931
No.

311
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,395
Cheong-san!

312
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,737
Help! Hurry!

313
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,822
Shit! Come on.

314
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,792
Cheong-san!

315
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:54,709
Move. Fuck!

316
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,123
They've all arrived
at the target locations.

317
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,291
Execute.

318
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,335
Let me confirm the order.

319
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,420
Fire!

320
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,229
It's okay.

321
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,815
It's not what you think. It's okay.

322
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,360
I said it's okay.

323
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,903
Don't do that.

324
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,780
You'll be fine.

325
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,365
On-jo.

326
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,493
No one…

327
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,205
will die here today.

328
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,293
Don't say anything.

329
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,255
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?

330
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:46,154
LEE CHEONG-SAN

331
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,866
Hold onto it.

332
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,622
I'll hold onto this.

333
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,083
LEE CHEONG-SAN - NAM ON-JO

334
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:54,138
Su-hyeok, go to the first floor.

335
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,183
Cheong-san!

336
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,852
Hey!

337
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,480
Come get me. All of you.

338
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,899
Today,

339
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,276
I am

340
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,447
the happiest guy in this school!

341
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:18,746
Hey!

342
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,040
Hey!

343
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,297
Ha-ri. Let's go.

344
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,466
We have to go.

345
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,676
Let's go, Nam-ra.

346
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:33,761
Let's go.

347
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,350
Can you climb over?

348
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,981
Careful. Step down.

349
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,691
Hurry.

350
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,151
Hey!

351
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,536
Hey!

352
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,622
Hey!

353
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,710
Hey!

354
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,712
-Hurry.
-Hurry up!

355
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:09,964
Hey!

356
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,683
CAUTION - RISK OF ACCIDENT

357
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,490
Come at me.

358
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,575
Come at me, all of you!

359
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,774
WARNING: NO TRESPASSING
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNED BY THE SCHOOL

360
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,613
Keep moving.

361
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,602
You know,

362
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:31,147
I thought it would be really fun
to kill you.

363
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,859
But not anymore.

364
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,778
I'll kill you even if it isn't fun.

365
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,530
Stop acting tough.

366
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,867
Do you really think that makes you cool?

367
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,244
No one thinks that.

368
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,375
You're just scared that people
will find out you killed the principal.

369
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,796
You'll always be a coward and a loser.

370
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,229
I'm not scared of anything.

371
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,733
I'm definitely not scared of you.

372
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,912
I'll gouge out your eye first, fucker.

373
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,527
Yeah, run away.

374
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,159
I'll let you live if you run away.

375
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,265
Sports complex. Bombing complete.

376
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,482
Hyosan Intersection. Bombing complete.

377
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,739
Future College. Bombing complete.

378
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,604
Ha-ri!

379
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,566
Are you okay?

380
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,411
Commander.

381
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,922
The operation is complete, Commander.

382
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,886
Okay.

383
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,265
Send in the troops in the morning
and take care of the rest.

384
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,767
You take charge.

385
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,520
Me, sir?

386
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,064
I'm sure you can handle it.

387
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,818
I need to sleep.

388
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,945
I've been up for too long.

389
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,310
Is this a friendly visit?

390
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:10,569
You came to watch.

391
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:17,660
We just bombed Hyosan.

392
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:21,830
What did you say?

393
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,584
40% of Hyosan's population is dead.

394
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,713
You're a murderer.

395
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,343
How could you be so shameless?

396
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,644
I thought about who would be able

397
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:48,107
to comfort the people of Hyosan right now.

398
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,443
That is why I came to see you.

399
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,573
Please tell the people of Hyosan

400
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,284
that I am sorry.

401
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,054
JIN SEON-MOO

402
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,115
This morning,

403
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,869
I watched the last video made
by Lee Byeong-chan,

404
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,748
the man who created this virus.

405
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,003
He tried to save his wife and son

406
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,339
who were infected with the virus,

407
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,257
but he failed.

408
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,968
And he made a final decision.

409
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,520
Jin-su.

410
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,440
Honey…

411
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:02,116
I respect the decision
Mr. Lee Byeong-chan made.

412
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,786
He was a father and a husband.

413
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:10,040
I'm sure he couldn't kill anyone.

414
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,878
However, I am a soldier.

415
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:17,756
Today, I ordered

416
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,884
the bombing of Hyosan.

417
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:26,807
No one ordered me to do it.

418
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:31,478
It was my sole decision
as the martial law commander.

419
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:36,900
I take full responsibility.

420
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,218
WIFE

421
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,765
Hi, it's me.

422
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:09,975
Did you eat?

423
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:15,105
Come on. Look at the time.
Why haven't you eaten yet?

424
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,691
What about the kids?

425
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,110
Okay.

426
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,947
What's the big deal about missing school?

427
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,116
What matters is staying healthy.

428
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:27,910
Yes.

429
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,996
Look for a tutor.

430
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,748
Yes.

431
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,501
It's fine if they're expensive.

432
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,215
Right. Not too expensive.

433
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,217
Yes.

434
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,180
God, honey.

435
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,517
I miss you.

436
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,436
What?

437
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,689
I'm very sorry.

438
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,991
I love you.

439
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,221
WIFE: I'M SORRY I GOT CRANKY WITH YOU
I LOVE YOU TOO

440
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,891
WHEN CAN YOU COME HOME?

441
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:37,099
NAM ON-JO

442
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,548
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

443
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,759
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.

444
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:45,847
