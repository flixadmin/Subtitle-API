1
00:00:01,384 --> 00:00:03,323
<i>This season on "The Flash"...</i>

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,064
- Who are you?
- My name is Jay Garrick.

3
00:00:06,074 --> 00:00:08,365
<i>Where I came from, I was
a speedster like you.</i>

4
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,664
<i>Before I arrived on your Earth, I
was in a fight with a man named Zoom.</i>

5
00:00:11,674 --> 00:00:15,239
He will do whatever it takes to
ensure he's the only speedster

6
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,245
- in any world.
- Never forget:

7
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:20,119
I am the fastest man alive.

8
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,698
I get these feelings
sometimes, these vibes.

9
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,757
<i>- Cisco, what did you see?</i>
- I saw Jay. He's Zoom.

10
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,258
Who's the man in the iron mask?

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,893
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

12
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,730
What do you say you and I give this a shot?

13
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,064
Yeah, I would like that.

14
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,413
I've always measured my success

15
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:36,446
by counting the number of victims I've had.

16
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:38,036
But now I think I'm going to start counting

17
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,873
the number of Earths I conquer instead.

18
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:41,549
<i>Earth-2 is splitting in half.</i>

19
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:44,152
Tell me I did not just
see the end of the world.

20
00:00:44,154 --> 00:00:46,821
- Dad? No. No!
- This is what's gonna make you

21
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:48,752
just like me.

22
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:50,524
Jay? No!

23
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:56,497
No!

24
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,168
Dad?

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,304
Dad? Hey! Hey! Hey, look
at me. Look at me. Dad.

26
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:07,941
Don't leave. Not again. Not again.
Dad! Come on. Come on. Come on.

27
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,742
It's all right. No.

28
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:10,910
Dad.

29
00:01:30,531 --> 00:01:32,498
No, Dad.

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,899
I told you family was a weakness.

31
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:40,908
You feel the anger, don't you, Flash?

32
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,847
And now...

33
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:45,889
the two of us are the same.

34
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:50,115
No! No!

35
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:51,550
There you go, Flash!

36
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:52,985
Use your anger,

37
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,888
just like I did.

38
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:40,264
I got you, Zolomon!

39
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:44,068
Go on, Barry. Embrace your anger. End me!

40
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:53,577
Let me do it for you.

41
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:59,950
So close, Barry.

42
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:03,853
Another time remnant.

43
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:06,389
You see, Barry, there could be two of you.

44
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:09,292
You just have to be
willing to kill yourself.

45
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:12,728
Yeah.

46
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,630
You're almost ready.

47
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:24,466

48
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,778
And comfort us today

49
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:31,441
with the word of your promise

50
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:34,449
as we return our brother to the earth,

51
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,418
and leave us with the hope

52
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,655
that, one day, we'll meet again.

53
00:03:53,437 --> 00:03:54,720
Um...

54
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,406
my father's...

55
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,355
I can't do this right now.

56
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:10,518
It's okay, Barry.

57
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,588
Henry Allen.

58
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,089
Henry suffered two
great losses in his life.

59
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:22,829
He lost his wife, Nora, and he lost Barry.

60
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,882
He suffered guilt,

61
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:26,809
embarrassment,

62
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:29,330
ridicule, shame, and everything that comes

63
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,875
with being blamed for a
crime he didn't commit.

64
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:37,769
Henry Allen was proof that love can get you

65
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,714
through the darkest of days,

66
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:43,352
and that love will keep him
alive in all of our hearts.

67
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:01,202
I'm gonna find him, Dad.

68
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:07,574
I promise you I'm gonna take
from him what he took from you.

69
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,610
Hey.

70
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:34,031
Hey.

71
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,236
I thought maybe you should eat something.

72
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:39,072
- I'm not hungry. Thank you, though.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,831
Barry, um...

74
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:47,754
I had no idea that you were The Flash.

75
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,650
What you did for me,

76
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:54,321
all the things that you've done
for everyone, this whole city...

77
00:05:54,323 --> 00:05:57,690
And now this with your dad and Zoom.

78
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,394
I'm so sorry.

79
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,096
Thanks, Wally.

80
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:07,645
If there's anything you
need, you just say the word.

81
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:09,584
All right.

82
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:12,838
Guys,

83
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,197
Zoom's still out there.

84
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,205
We need to come up with a plan.

85
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:19,655
The man can crack open
breaches to Earth-2.

86
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:23,492
I mean, if he can do that, what else
can he do that we don't know about?

87
00:06:23,502 --> 00:06:26,118
Right after he killed his time remnant,

88
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,488
- he told me I was "almost ready."
- Almost ready for what?

89
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,290
- I don't know.
- Yep. Classic psychopath.

90
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,933
Why can't they ever just
say what they want to do?

91
00:06:34,943 --> 00:06:37,100
We also have to figure out
why I keep vibing Earth-2

92
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,531
- being ripped to shreds.
- Seriously.

93
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,400
It's like I'm watching
"Transformers" in 4-D,

94
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,536
but, like, ten times more realistic

95
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,620
and with much better acting.

96
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,308
Look, if you can vibe the future,

97
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:52,877
we need to stop Zoom before that happens.

98
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,079
I'm gonna get some air, all right?

99
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,667
I got it.

100
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,919
When I was in the Speed Force,

101
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:23,579
I felt like

102
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:27,133
I'd finally come to grips with her death,

103
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:30,895
with not saving her when I went back.

104
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,184
And then the moment...

105
00:07:35,186 --> 00:07:39,363
where I'm finally at
the place I can move on,

106
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:42,725
my father's taken from me.

107
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:47,819
How am I ever supposed
to find peace with that?

108
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,059
I don't know, Barry, but you're
gonna have to find a way to do that,

109
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:54,170
or it's gonna tear you apart.

110
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,009
I just miss him so much already.

111
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,853
Zoom.

112
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:12,788
Barry, no!

113
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,059
Bad time, Flash?

114
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:21,554
Thought I'd give you some time to mourn.

115
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:23,795
- This ends now.
- Not yet.

116
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:27,034
There's always more to take, Barry.

117
00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:28,869
You're gonna stay away from them.

118
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:30,438
Well, that's completely up to you.

119
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,640
- What?
- When we first met,

120
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:35,169
I told you that Zoom needed to be the best.

121
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,075
You just didn't realize I
was talking about myself.

122
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,226
Is that what this is about?

123
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:43,557
A race, Barry,

124
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,317
between you and me...

125
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:47,457
to see who's the fastest.

126
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:50,001
You win: this is over,
and you get to be the hero.

127
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:51,636
I'm not racing you.

128
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:56,291
Then your father won't be the only
person you love that I'll take from you.

129
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:58,227
Think about it, Flash.

130
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,498
All I want to know is
who's the fastest man alive

131
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,148
on either world.

132
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,495
I'll be waiting.

133
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,352
So Zoom wants to race you?

134
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:18,239
- He's obsessed with being the best.
- Why would we trust him?

135
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:20,002
He just wants to race.

136
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:21,942
You know, it actually makes sense

137
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:24,450
in a completely-off-your-rocker
sort of way.

138
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,392
That can't be everything he wants.

139
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:28,962
It isn't. This Magnetar

140
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:31,698
that's being developed by Mercury Labs...

141
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,860
Turns out, it can act as a pulsar.

142
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,660
- Whoa.
- What is a pulsar?

143
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:41,607
<i>It's a power amplifier with a highly
magnetized, dense rotating core</i>

144
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:44,076
<i>that can be easily weaponized.</i>

145
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:46,860
Nah, that's not dangerous at all.

146
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:49,315
That's what happens to Earth-2.

147
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,683
What happens in my vibes
is because of this machine.

148
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:54,086
That thing is powerful
enough to destroy a planet?

149
00:09:54,088 --> 00:09:56,955
A lot more than just a planet,
if it has the right power source.

150
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:58,256
Like what?

151
00:09:58,258 --> 00:09:59,484
Like me.

152
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:01,795
That's why he wants to race.

153
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:04,896
He wants to siphon the
energy I create when I run.

154
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:06,832
He wants to siphon the
energy off both of you.

155
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,299
When Jay captured me,

156
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:10,235
he said that he used to measure his success

157
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:12,437
by counting the number of victims he had,

158
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,177
but now he was gonna measure it

159
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:17,108
by counting the number of
Earths he conquered instead.

160
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:19,644
He doesn't want to just destroy Earth-2;

161
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:22,113
he wants to take out every
other planet in the multiverse.

162
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:24,841
- How many are there?
- Infinite.

163
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:26,651
Yeah, well, he can do that?

164
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:29,187
If he can create a breach
to Earth-2 all on his own...

165
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:33,003
- He can get to all of 'em.
- One pulse to destroy them all.

166
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:35,325
I guess I don't have a choice.

167
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:38,195
I have to race him.

168
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:41,895
And I have to win.

169
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,056
Bare.

170
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:51,907
Don't race him.

171
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,512
- It's not that easy.
- Yes, it is. You just say no.

172
00:10:55,514 --> 00:10:58,315
We find another way to stop
him, together, like we always do.

173
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,217
And do what, Joe?

174
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:03,367
Just sit around and wait for
him to kill somebody else?

175
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:06,072
Wally? Iris? You?

176
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:08,765
- No. No way.
- He needs you, Bare.

177
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:13,282
He needs your speed again to get what
he wants. We have the advantage here.

178
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:16,660
All I have to do is beat him, Joe.

179
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,268
That saves the multiverse, this whole city,

180
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,806
all of you.

181
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:25,908
I won't let another person I
love die when I can prevent it.

182
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,221
This...

183
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,080
isn't just about racing Zoom, is it?

184
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,684
You want to kill this guy.

185
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:36,952
Of course I want to kill him, Joe.

186
00:11:36,954 --> 00:11:39,069
I want to do a hell of a
lot more than just kill him.

187
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,857
I want him to suffer for
everything that he's done.

188
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:44,359
- And he's going to.
- Come on, Bare.

189
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:46,929
Think about what you're saying.

190
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:50,498
I have to be willing
to do whatever it takes.

191
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,667
I'm sorry, but I'm racing him,
whether you want me to or not.

192
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:55,146
And I can't talk you out of it?

193
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:59,267
- Not this time.
- Then I'm sorry too.

194
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:19,994
Wha...

195
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:26,254
What are you doing?

196
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:34,885
Why did you put me in here?

197
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:36,777
Because you're too angry right now.

198
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,812
You can't race him like that.

199
00:12:38,814 --> 00:12:41,496
Without a plan, you're... You'll lose.

200
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:44,457
Keeping me in here is
gonna get everyone killed.

201
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:48,052
I'm the only one that can
stop him; you know that.

202
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:50,747
You race Zoom on his terms,

203
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,494
- you'll lose.
- This is not your decision to make!

204
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:57,164
- It is this time.
- No.

205
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,120
We all made it together.

206
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:01,724
What?

207
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,538
- All of you?
- Bro, I went back and forth.

208
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,855
I was, like, a good 60/40 at first.

209
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:09,342
Ramon.

210
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:12,011
Yeah, yeah, we all made the decision.

211
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:13,813
Come on.

212
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:15,188
Allen.

213
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:17,316
Allen.

214
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:19,151
This is for your own good.

215
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:22,922
Don't do this. Guys, come on. Iris?

216
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:25,791
Cisco, come on, man. You have to let me...

217
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:29,201
You have to let me stop
him! You have to let me...

218
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,851
Did we make the right call here?

219
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:37,676
Yeah, we did.

220
00:13:45,696 --> 00:13:47,029
You okay, Joe?

221
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:49,464
Yeah, that was just a little
harder than I anticipated.

222
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,466
Yeah, locking up Barry...

223
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,237
That was the easy part. Now, using our plan

224
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:58,647
to take down Zoom without Barry,

225
00:13:58,657 --> 00:14:00,699
that's gonna be the hard part,
but it's gonna be a lot easier

226
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,377
once we know where he is, Ramon.

227
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,412
Chill, man. I'm working on it.

228
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:06,825
- Work harder.
- Got it.

229
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:08,517
He's at the industrial park on Leawood.

230
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,157
- Give me that. Mm.
- Yep.

231
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:12,894
That is some serious nerd love right there.

232
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:14,187
Snow.

233
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,641
Look, everybody here would understand

234
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:20,494
if you don't want to go through with this.

235
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:23,731
Jay may be a monster, but there's
a human inside of him somewherwh

236
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:25,566
I've gotten to that part of him before.

237
00:14:25,568 --> 00:14:26,868
I know I can do it again.

238
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,703
I want to stop him, Harry,

239
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:30,225
for good.

240
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,950
Ramon.

241
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:35,572
So let's go over the plan again.

242
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,269
Okay, Caitlin will distract Jay

243
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:40,272
so that you and Harry
can hit him with the boot.

244
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:41,705
Cisco's gonna open the breach,

245
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:43,408
and we're gonna put him through it.

246
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:46,486
- I'll disarm the Magnetar.
- Destroy the Magnetar...

247
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:48,221
Save the multiverse.

248
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,089
One more thing. We need to agree.

249
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:51,924
We all made this decision together,

250
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:56,195
so if anything goes
wrong, we stick with it.

251
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:57,997
Let's load up.

252
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:12,811
Hey.

253
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:15,214
- Hey.
- What's the matter?

254
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:18,583
You know, I've just been thinking.
You know, what's... what's next?

255
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,070
What's next? We stop Zoom.

256
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:24,523
Right. Right, I guess...

257
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,357
I don't know, I mean... After that.

258
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,055
I don't know. Haven't
really given it much thought.

259
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:31,049
Yeah, no... No, I know you haven't.

260
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:33,834
Guess I've just... I've been
thinking about it a lot lately.

261
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:36,674
You know, I see the way you
are with everyone here...

262
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:38,512
Caitlin and Cisco,

263
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:40,359
Iris and Joe,

264
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,206
Barry,

265
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,108
especially Barry.

266
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,779
You care about these people a lot.

267
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:49,480
You know, but... But my friends?

268
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,208
They're all back home on our Earth.

269
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:56,764
I guess what I'm trying to say is,
you know, when this is all over,

270
00:15:57,898 --> 00:16:00,390
I'm gonna go back home to live my life.

271
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,947
But if you need to stay here so
that you can live yours again,

272
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:05,421
I get that.

273
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,945
I understand. It's
okay, because... No, Dad.

274
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:09,913
Seeing you happy,

275
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:14,504
that is all I've ever wanted for you.

276
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:31,988
<i>Okay. In position.</i>

277
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,856
Copy that. We got you.

278
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:36,793
<i>Okay. Snow, you ready?</i>

279
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,260
As ready as I can be.

280
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,475
Cisco.

281
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:46,268
Cisco, you good?

282
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,794
Define "good."

283
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:50,973
Ramon. You're gonna be great.

284
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:52,408
Snow.

285
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,905
<i>When you're ready.</i>

286
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:55,336
Okay.

287
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:57,726
You got this.

288
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,782
Here we go.

289
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:06,561
<i>Jay?</i>

290
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:08,624
Caitlin.

291
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:12,001
Jay!

292
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,117
How did you find me?

293
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,307
Doctor McGee said the Magnetar
was stolen from her labs.

294
00:17:23,317 --> 00:17:26,974
I knew that it had to be
you, so I tracked you here.

295
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:31,827
I tracked you here, Jay. No one else knows.

296
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,150
I told you, if you left me...

297
00:17:36,152 --> 00:17:39,520
That if I betrayed you, you'd
show me no mercy, I know.

298
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,980
But I just want to explain
why I did that. Please, Jay.

299
00:17:44,827 --> 00:17:45,926
Talk.

300
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:47,294
Good job, girl.

301
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:49,496
<i>Now draw him towards you.</i>

302
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:51,532
I made a mistake.

303
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:55,169
I am so sorry that I abandoned you.

304
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:58,438
But you have to understand,
what you said to me...

305
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,175
That there was a dark side of me...

306
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:04,545
<i>That I was more like
Killer Frost than I knew...</i>

307
00:18:04,547 --> 00:18:06,946
I didn't want to accept that.

308
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:10,583
I tried to lock the darkness inside of me.

309
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:15,288
But you knew that that was
already a part of me now.

310
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,058
And you're the only one who did.

311
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,529
And now, I'm ready to
accept who I really am.

312
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:25,798
Cisco, get ready.

313
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:30,102
I am so sorry that I hurt you.

314
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:34,740
But now I want to be the
one that only you know.

315
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:36,509
Please, Jay.

316
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:38,110
Let me try.

317
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:46,852
One more step.

318
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:50,555
I knew you'd eventually
come around, Caitlin.

319
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:56,829
But it's too late.

320
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:02,242
Now, Ramon!

321
00:19:06,673 --> 00:19:08,039
Damn it.

322
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,308
Tranq him! Tranq him!

323
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,801
- Gun is jammed!
- He's walking in.

324
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:28,259
Dad!

325
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:49,317
- Did you see my dad?
- No, the vibe keeps changing.

326
00:19:49,327 --> 00:19:52,018
It's like my brain is
channel surfing or something.

327
00:19:52,028 --> 00:19:55,797
They must be on the move. That's
why the vibe's in flux. Keep trying.

328
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:58,087
Hey, did you turn off the Magnetar?

329
00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:59,489
No, there's no messing with that thing.

330
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,057
Whatever he did to it...
We try and touch it,

331
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:04,093
we try and move it...
This planet's done for.

332
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:06,262
Iris.

333
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,467
What's wrong?

334
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,272
Zoom took Dad.

335
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:18,040
What? How?

336
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:21,228
We tried to stop Zoom by pushing
him through the breach, but...

337
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:23,312
he took Joe with him.

338
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:25,114
Well, where's Barry? Did he go after him?

339
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:29,352
He's not with us. He's
in a cell in the intake.

340
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,599
Wait, you... you tried to stop Zoom alone?

341
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,923
Long story.

342
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:42,163
Well, we have to get him back.

343
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:45,233
Wally, before Zoom took Dad, we all agreed

344
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:48,136
that if we got him off this Earth,
we would close the breaches for good,

345
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:52,640
and we would never open them again,

346
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:55,238
under any circumstances.

347
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:58,858
Why... why would you do that?

348
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,783
No. No way, that's not gonna happen.

349
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:04,218
He made us all agree to it.

350
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,853
Well, guess what. I didn't agree to that.

351
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:09,192
- Wally...
- Iris, I already lost my mom.

352
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:10,993
If Dad...

353
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:13,280
I...

354
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:31,845
I will say,

355
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:36,049
if anything, Barry sure has an
ample number of fathers to kill.

356
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:38,251
If you're gonna kill me,

357
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:39,613
kill me.

358
00:21:39,623 --> 00:21:41,721
It doesn't matter.

359
00:21:41,723 --> 00:21:43,256
You're not racing anybody.

360
00:21:43,494 --> 00:21:46,826
Come on, Joe. You know Barry
better than that. You raised him.

361
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:49,029
He'll say yes if he thinks he can save you.

362
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:50,463
Not this time.

363
00:21:50,465 --> 00:21:52,198
I made sure of it.

364
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:56,869
Who is that?

365
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:58,571
It would just confuse you.

366
00:21:58,573 --> 00:22:00,039
Try me.

367
00:22:03,344 --> 00:22:05,578
I got my speed the same way Barry did.

368
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,780
<i>When I got struck by the
dark matter and electricity,</i>

369
00:22:07,782 --> 00:22:10,683
<i>I became Zoom, the
fastest man alive.</i>

370
00:22:10,685 --> 00:22:13,586
<i>Wasn't long before I had
this Earth on its knees.</i>

371
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:15,274
<i>But it wasn't enough.</i>

372
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:17,355
I wanted more.

373
00:22:17,357 --> 00:22:19,524
I wanted to be faster.

374
00:22:19,526 --> 00:22:21,727
<i>So I created a speed drug.</i>

375
00:22:21,729 --> 00:22:23,125
Velocity-9.

376
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:25,597
It made me faster than
I ever thought possible,

377
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,432
<i>fast enough to break
the dimensional barrier,</i>

378
00:22:27,434 --> 00:22:30,569
<i>fast enough to run to other
universes, other Earths.</i>

379
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:34,206
And then, one day, on
one of those other Earths,

380
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,740
I discovered him.

381
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:37,442
He's another speedster?

382
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:39,511
Yeah, you could say that.

383
00:22:39,513 --> 00:22:42,714
That was right about the time
I discovered something else too.

384
00:22:42,716 --> 00:22:44,181
<i>All that V-9 I'd been injecting</i>

385
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:46,836
<i>into my system had a
little side effect.</i>

386
00:22:46,846 --> 00:22:49,286
It was killing you.

387
00:22:49,288 --> 00:22:51,222
I searched for a cure.

388
00:22:51,224 --> 00:22:52,957
I tried everything.

389
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,936
I even tried to manipulate the Speed Force,

390
00:22:54,946 --> 00:22:57,061
but let me tell you, the Speed Force,

391
00:22:57,063 --> 00:22:59,247
the Speed Force does not
like its rules being broken.

392
00:22:59,257 --> 00:23:03,280
<i>Now it's been sending its
enforcers after me ever since.</i>

393
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,050
So you brought him here to steal his speed.

394
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,440
I tried, but it wouldn't take.

395
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:11,509
<i>But then the skies parted,</i>

396
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:12,876
<i>and I saw Barry,</i>

397
00:23:12,878 --> 00:23:15,045
<i>and then I stole his speed.</i>

398
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:18,797
I won. I beat the rules of the Speed Force.

399
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:21,290
Why keep him here?

400
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,137
Trophy.

401
00:23:24,556 --> 00:23:27,423
And a little idea I had for fun.

402
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:31,694
You see, I got so tired
of being the villain,

403
00:23:32,034 --> 00:23:34,830
<i>so I decided to be the hero too.</i>

404
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:37,867
I even borrowed his name,

405
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:40,685
Jay Garrick.

406
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:46,447
You know what's gonna be great, Detective?

407
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:47,968
After I beat Barry in the race

408
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:50,390
and prove that I'm the
fastest man alive on any Earth,

409
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,169
he's gonna rot in a cage just
like the one Jay's in now.

410
00:23:54,722 --> 00:23:57,806
And then I'll have a Flash from two worlds

411
00:23:57,808 --> 00:23:59,741
to keep me company.

412
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,254
Look.

413
00:24:13,256 --> 00:24:16,857
Everyone's gonna freak when they
find out I did this, but I don't care.

414
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,987
We need your help, Barry.

415
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,266
Uh, hey, guys,

416
00:24:26,268 --> 00:24:28,001
Barry's not...

417
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:29,265
In his cell anymore.

418
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:30,571
- Wally!
- What? I wasn't just gonna

419
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:33,240
- stand here and let this happen.
- You let him take Joe?

420
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:34,744
What the hell were you thinking?

421
00:24:34,754 --> 00:24:36,611
Allen, there was nothing we could do.

422
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:40,080
- You could've let me race him!
- Allen! You're not racing Zoom!

423
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:42,077
What are you gonna do? Are
you gonna tranq me again?

424
00:24:42,087 --> 00:24:43,550
Don't tempt me.

425
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:45,971
Look, I know you guys made a
pact to keep Zoom on Earth-2,

426
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:48,046
but you did that without me and Wally.

427
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:49,648
All right? You don't get to do that!

428
00:24:49,658 --> 00:24:51,858
Barry, look at yourself
right now; you're not okay.

429
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,727
Cisco, my dad was just
killed in front of me!

430
00:24:53,729 --> 00:24:55,228
Do you have any idea how that feels?

431
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,763
Watching someone you love die?

432
00:24:56,765 --> 00:24:59,232
- Yes, I do.
- Cait...

433
00:24:59,234 --> 00:25:03,055
Look, Barry. I know how cold and angry

434
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:05,085
and distant that can make you.

435
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:08,583
But when this happened to me, you
were the one who kept me in check.

436
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:10,176
You told me to stop and take a breath,

437
00:25:10,178 --> 00:25:12,378
and that's all we're telling you to do now.

438
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,681
- I'm telling you I'm good.
- Really? You're good?

439
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:17,783
Because it seems to me you
want to do more than stop Zoom.

440
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:19,652
It seems to me you want revenge.

441
00:25:19,654 --> 00:25:23,422
If that's why you're doing
this, Allen, you will lose.

442
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:26,822
Look, you guys.

443
00:25:26,832 --> 00:25:29,528
I... you may not think I can do this.

444
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:34,099
You may think I'm too angry.
But we're running out of time!

445
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:35,467
I have to beat him,

446
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:36,869
and I'm going to,

447
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:39,104
whether I have your help or not.

448
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:41,040
So which one is it?

449
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:45,566
- So how does this work?
- It's the same way we took Iris

450
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:48,246
into the Speed Force. Harry
does his best Frankenstein,

451
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:50,948
you hold my hand, and I vibe you there.

452
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,417
All right, let's do it.

453
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:03,719
I'll do it.

454
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:06,263
Say when and where. I'll be there.

455
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:09,400
Cisco's learned how to
bring people into his vibes.

456
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,302
There's one condition.

457
00:26:11,304 --> 00:26:15,239
You bring Joe back. But
if he's harmed in any way,

458
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,487
- it's off.
- I'll bring him,

459
00:26:17,497 --> 00:26:20,143
and I won't release
him until after we race.

460
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,607
Deal?

461
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:24,034
Deal.

462
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,993
I tell you, Jay might be crazy-pants,

463
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:39,128
but he can pick a venue.

464
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:46,735
Brought the whole crew with you, huh?

465
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:48,271
Can't say I blame you.

466
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,772
- Dad.
- Wally!

467
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,740
It's gonna be one hell of a show.

468
00:26:51,742 --> 00:26:53,476
Let him go.

469
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,478
After we race.

470
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,265
Cut the crap. We know you
plan to power up the Magnetar

471
00:26:58,275 --> 00:27:00,616
so you can destroy the multiverse.

472
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,552
Bravo. You figured it out...

473
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:05,153
almost.

474
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:06,922
I don't want to destroy all of it.

475
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:09,357
This Earth is at the
center of the multiverse.

476
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,962
It's the access point to
every other Earth in existence.

477
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,932
One trans-dimensional
shockwave, and... poof.

478
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:18,666
Leaving just our Earth.

479
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:20,835
How generous of you.

480
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:23,538
Need to have some place to hang my cowl.

481
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:27,075
You might want to say your good-byes.

482
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:36,918
Don't worry.

483
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,679
I'm gonna save your dad.

484
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:42,256
No. You're gonna save our dad.

485
00:27:42,258 --> 00:27:44,054
Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs. It's safer.

486
00:27:44,064 --> 00:27:45,827
We're not going anywhere.

487
00:27:45,829 --> 00:27:47,528
We got eyes and ears right here.

488
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:50,397
Either he goes, or we all die together.

489
00:27:53,603 --> 00:27:55,102
We believe in you.

490
00:27:58,073 --> 00:27:59,257
Wait.

491
00:28:00,643 --> 00:28:02,059
Barry,

492
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,211
kick his ass.

493
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:12,218
What are the rules?

494
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,987
One lap around the inside of this loop

495
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:16,256
will produce about 1 gigawatt of energy,

496
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:19,092
and I need 500-plus to power the Magnetar

497
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:20,727
enough to do the job.

498
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:22,462
Once it's full, I win,

499
00:28:22,464 --> 00:28:24,897
because there is no stopping it.

500
00:28:24,899 --> 00:28:26,432
So all I have to do to beat you

501
00:28:26,434 --> 00:28:29,001
is stop you before that happens.

502
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:31,337
Yep. It's that simple.

503
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:35,041
But if, at any point, you decide
you don't want to race anymore,

504
00:28:35,043 --> 00:28:37,343
dear old dad number two is a dead man,

505
00:28:37,345 --> 00:28:40,345
as well as your little fan club.

506
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:42,481
They're not my fan club.

507
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:45,350
They're the reason that I'm running,

508
00:28:45,352 --> 00:28:48,375
why I'm gonna beat you.

509
00:28:49,724 --> 00:28:52,658
Let's see what you're made of, Flash.

510
00:28:56,263 --> 00:28:57,829
Just say when, Zoom.

511
00:28:57,831 --> 00:29:00,899
Run, Barry. Run!

512
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:24,189
He's powering up the Magnetar.

513
00:29:30,863 --> 00:29:33,030
Come on, Barry. Catch up.

514
00:29:44,344 --> 00:29:45,809
Which one's Barry?

515
00:29:45,811 --> 00:29:47,510
Both of them.

516
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:49,512
- He made a...
- Time remnant.

517
00:29:54,954 --> 00:29:56,386
Go, all right? Go!

518
00:29:56,388 --> 00:29:58,355
I'll explain later, Joe.

519
00:30:01,994 --> 00:30:03,793
A remnant?

520
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:07,130
Stole my trick, Flash.

521
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:10,800
But you're too late.

522
00:30:13,204 --> 00:30:16,473
Bye-bye, multiverse.

523
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:17,741
No!

524
00:30:27,318 --> 00:30:29,551
What's the time remnant doing?

525
00:30:29,553 --> 00:30:31,320
He's creating his own pulse.

526
00:30:31,322 --> 00:30:34,157
- Why would he do that?
- Because...

527
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,191
if that's out of phase,

528
00:30:36,193 --> 00:30:37,993
it'll counteract that one.

529
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:40,195
Wait, his body can't handle that.

530
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:42,698
Then what's gonna happen?

531
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,700
He'll die.

532
00:30:57,974 --> 00:31:00,274
NO!

533
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:07,956
Ahh!

534
00:31:12,362 --> 00:31:16,197
Ahh!

535
00:31:19,902 --> 00:31:21,572
You're a hero, Barry.

536
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:24,313
You couldn't kill me before.

537
00:31:24,997 --> 00:31:27,674
You won't kill me now.

538
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,182
I don't have to.

539
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:38,785
Ahh!

540
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:07,166
Okay, so you ran back in time

541
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:09,905
and made a copy of yourself?

542
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:13,055
Well, uh, basically.

543
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:16,250
- Yeah.
- It's called a time remnant.

544
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,062
It's not something that I can do every day,

545
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:22,765
but I needed a way to draw the Time Wraiths

546
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:25,467
out of the Speed Force,
hoping they'd be more upset

547
00:32:25,469 --> 00:32:27,436
at what Zoom had done
than they'd be with me.

548
00:32:27,438 --> 00:32:30,539
Is that what I look like when
they start talking about science?

549
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:31,889
Pretty much.

550
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:34,543
Don't worry, Wally. It'll
get easier to understand.

551
00:32:34,545 --> 00:32:36,578
Well, how does that even work?

552
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,180
Same way Zoom did it.

553
00:32:38,182 --> 00:32:41,916
I ran back in time moments before I left.

554
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,153
It's the only way I can
be in two places at once.

555
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:47,956
Okay, so the time remnant, it's still you?

556
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:49,230
Yeah.

557
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,893
- But he died.
- Uh...

558
00:32:51,895 --> 00:32:55,930
He was willing to sacrifice
himself for all of us.

559
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:58,232
That's how much he loved us.

560
00:32:58,234 --> 00:33:01,069
You know what? We'll just...
We'll forget about it.

561
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:03,201
Barry, I'm glad you're okay.

562
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:06,140
You know what? In battle,
choose your weapon wisely.

563
00:33:06,142 --> 00:33:09,310
All right? Some people choose a gun.
I choose a Phillips-head screwdriver.

564
00:33:09,312 --> 00:33:11,011
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. You're so particular.

565
00:33:11,013 --> 00:33:12,246
Ramon, can you just please...

566
00:33:12,248 --> 00:33:13,414
Have you ever worked with a tool before?

567
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,416
- I'm working with one now.
- Are you ready?

568
00:33:15,418 --> 00:33:16,852
One,

569
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,458
two, and...

570
00:33:21,423 --> 00:33:23,057
Ugh.

571
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:25,059
I don't know what's more annoying,

572
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:26,593
being in that thing

573
00:33:26,595 --> 00:33:28,627
or listening to you two arguing about it.

574
00:33:41,543 --> 00:33:43,147
Um...

575
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,812
you're...

576
00:33:45,814 --> 00:33:47,647
I'm Jay Garrick,

577
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:50,483
the real Jay Garrick.

578
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,856
What?

579
00:33:56,858 --> 00:33:58,743
I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry.

580
00:34:10,037 --> 00:34:11,570
Bare.

581
00:34:11,572 --> 00:34:13,138
He looks just like him.

582
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,673
He looks just like my dad, Joe.

583
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:16,808
I can't believe this. My dad told me.

584
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,279
He told me this. He said his
mom's maiden name was Garrick.

585
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:21,780
I just never thought that that meant...

586
00:34:21,782 --> 00:34:23,415
- Barry, Barry.
- I never thought it meant...

587
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:25,183
Barry, he doesn't know that.

588
00:34:25,185 --> 00:34:26,752
He doesn't know

589
00:34:26,754 --> 00:34:28,920
that he's your dad's doppelganger, okay?

590
00:34:28,922 --> 00:34:32,190
You want me to tell him
that you had to leave?

591
00:34:32,192 --> 00:34:33,892
No. No.

592
00:34:33,894 --> 00:34:36,261
- You sure?
- Yeah.

593
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:38,196
I just need a minute.

594
00:34:38,198 --> 00:34:39,464
I'll be all right.

595
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:46,636
- That's smart.
- Because of...

596
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:48,038
- Yeah, and there it is.
- Genius.

597
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,708
So the reason you didn't have your powers

598
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,177
is because there was
a dampener in the mask.

599
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,721
You see?

600
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:57,681
I don't want to see this thing ever again.

601
00:35:00,352 --> 00:35:03,087
So your powers are back.

602
00:35:03,089 --> 00:35:06,257
I see Jay... Excuse me... Hunter...

603
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:08,025
Stole your color scheme too.

604
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:09,894
He took a lot of things that were mine,

605
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:13,430
except for that. That's,
um... That's all him.

606
00:35:13,432 --> 00:35:15,565
He said it was his father's from the war.

607
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:19,269
Ironically, on my... on our Earth...

608
00:35:19,271 --> 00:35:21,204
This helmet stood for hope.

609
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:23,056
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

610
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:27,744
Well, maybe I can continue that sentiment,

611
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:30,613
take something from him, for a change,

612
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:32,877
make it my own.

613
00:35:37,255 --> 00:35:38,788
It suits you.

614
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,157
Thank you, all of you,

615
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:43,644
for saving me from Zoom,

616
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,139
especially you, Flash.

617
00:35:48,566 --> 00:35:50,933
You're welcome, Flash.

618
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:57,206
Now all I have to do is find my way home.

619
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:01,009
- And where's that?
- I think you would call it Earth-3.

620
00:36:01,313 --> 00:36:03,946
Uh-huh. Well, I can
get you to Earth-2.

621
00:36:03,948 --> 00:36:06,601
My daughter and I can
help you with the rest.

622
00:36:06,611 --> 00:36:08,004
We can?

623
00:36:08,748 --> 00:36:11,119
Yes, we can.

624
00:36:11,121 --> 00:36:13,121
We're going home.

625
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:19,661
Okay.

626
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:25,967
Snow.

627
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:28,189
You're a tremendous scientist, but...

628
00:36:29,138 --> 00:36:32,974
- you're an even better person.
- Don't make me cry, Harry.

629
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:35,452
I've done enough of that already.

630
00:36:37,881 --> 00:36:39,446
Detective Joe West...

631
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:40,814
Harry.

632
00:36:40,816 --> 00:36:43,247
You have great kids. You take care of them.

633
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:46,754
Same to you. You take care
of that beautiful girl.

634
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:48,469
Yes, sir.

635
00:36:50,093 --> 00:36:51,959
Hey.

636
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:57,722
I'm a better man than
I was when I got here,

637
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:02,365
- and that's 'cause of you.
- I'm not the same either.

638
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:07,044
Hey, don't be surprised if I
project myself over to Earth-2

639
00:37:07,054 --> 00:37:10,673
every once in a while, you know, just
to throw your stuff across the office.

640
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:15,581
I'll miss you too, Cisco.

641
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,655
So I guess I can't text
you from another Earth, huh?

642
00:37:24,657 --> 00:37:26,382
I guess not.

643
00:37:26,674 --> 00:37:28,357
That's too bad.

644
00:37:32,592 --> 00:37:34,859
Thank you guys, seriously,

645
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:36,227
for saving our home.

646
00:37:36,229 --> 00:37:38,229
- Mm-hmm.
- Ready?

647
00:37:38,231 --> 00:37:39,964
Yeah.

648
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:41,945
Can't stop thinking about
my dad's doppelganger.

649
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:44,293
Seeing him, knowing that he's out there,

650
00:38:44,295 --> 00:38:46,337
that should've made it easier.

651
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:47,670
It doesn't.

652
00:38:47,889 --> 00:38:50,507
It just made me miss him even more.

653
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:53,647
I can't even imagine how
hard that must have been.

654
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:55,938
We just won.

655
00:38:56,242 --> 00:38:58,810
We just beat Zoom.

656
00:38:58,812 --> 00:39:01,280
Why does it feel like I just lost?

657
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:06,284
Because you've lost a
lot in your life, Barry,

658
00:39:06,788 --> 00:39:09,620
more than most.

659
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,523
But...

660
00:39:14,828 --> 00:39:16,728
Maybe you and me

661
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:19,564
seeing where this thing goes,

662
00:39:20,037 --> 00:39:23,367
maybe that can give you
something for a change.

663
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:29,607
That's all I've ever
wanted to hear you say.

664
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,310
And I wish that I was in a place

665
00:39:32,312 --> 00:39:35,179
where I could try that with you.

666
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:38,982
But I feel so hollowed
out inside right now.

667
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:43,320
I feel more broken than
I've ever felt in my life.

668
00:39:43,322 --> 00:39:46,123
If I'm ever gonna be worth anything to you,

669
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:49,259
I need to fix what's wrong with me.

670
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:53,330
I need to find some... Some peace.

671
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:58,686
Barry, listen to me.

672
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:02,405
You waited for me for years.

673
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:05,808
You let me get to a place
where this was possible.

674
00:40:06,176 --> 00:40:07,878
So I am telling you

675
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:11,981
I am gonna do the same thing for you.

676
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:14,150
Wherever you need to go,

677
00:40:14,152 --> 00:40:16,518
whatever you need to do,

678
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,991
do it.

679
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:22,024
And when you get back, I'll be here.

680
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:24,894
Okay.

681
00:40:24,896 --> 00:40:27,363
I love you, Barry.

682
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,213
I love you too.

683
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:47,249
And I always will.

684
00:41:05,468 --> 00:41:08,034
That's why I'm so sorry.

685
00:41:09,271 --> 00:41:12,038
But I have to do this.

686
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:29,755
- Barry!
- Mom!

687
00:41:35,897 --> 00:41:37,530
Barry!

688
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:38,898
No!

689
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,333
No.

690
00:41:49,944 --> 00:41:51,744
You're not gonna kill her this time.

691
00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:54,146
You're not gonna kill her ever again.

692
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,175
No.

693
00:42:19,548 --> 00:42:21,069
I'm not gonna hurt you.

694
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,272
I'm not gonna hurt you.

695
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:26,845
Okay? I'm not gonna hurt you.

696
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:29,146
You're safe.

697
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:35,452
You're safe now.

698
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:44,306
