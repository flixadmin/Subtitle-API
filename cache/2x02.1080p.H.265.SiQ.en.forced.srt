1
00:00:53,058 --> 00:00:54,142
Get down!

2
00:01:20,586 --> 00:01:21,628
One!

3
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:00,709
Rosa!

4
00:02:02,044 --> 00:02:06,256
Tell me who talked to the police!
Who talked to them?

5
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:11,219
It had to be that whore in the market.
Please, Quica!

6
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:43,288
Thanks for accepting the invitation.

7
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:47,501
Forgive me for the hood.

8
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:49,669
It's for security reasons.

9
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:52,589
- I hope you understand.
- I understand.

10
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:55,634
Can I offer you something?
Coffee, water?

11
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:58,970
No, I'm fine, thank you.

12
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:00,680
Let's begin, then.

13
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:20,075
- Do you regret going to jail a year ago?
- Absolutely not. In fact...

14
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,620
what I regret least is having escaped.

15
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:26,289
The Special Forces came in
and opened fire.

16
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:29,084
I put my life at risk, right?

17
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:31,878
However...

18
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:36,216
I hope this interview
makes it clear to the president...

19
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:41,680
I'm willing to return to any prison
in the District of Antioquia.

20
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:44,933
<i>The most modest
and the most humble.</i>

21
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:48,270
<i>But I have to check the conditions
they're going to put me in</i>

22
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:53,024
<i>because it would be easy, for example,
for someone to rig a car bomb</i>

23
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:54,985
<i>that would explode when I arrived.</i>

24
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:15,839
It turns out that my problem
turned into a political problem.

25
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:18,466
It appears I'm very important

26
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:20,677
to the re-election
of the president of the U.S.

27
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,878
I'm ready to pay for my mistakes
by accepting the most humble cell

28
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:40,298
as long as my rights are respected

29
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:45,220
and they guarantee me that I will not
be transferred anywhere for any reason.

30
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:50,976
Do you acknowledge that
you've committed crimes in the past,

31
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:53,061
or that you ordered someone's death?

32
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:03,822
That answer I could
only give to a priest.

33
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:05,865
In a confessional.

34
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:14,374
Marietta.

35
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:16,459
- What's up?
- What happened?

36
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:21,506
They killed them.
I think there were six or seven girls.

37
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:23,717
Who would do something like this?

38
00:08:33,727 --> 00:08:37,188
Are you, by nature, violent and proud?

39
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:41,401
Those who know me
know I have a great sense of humour.

40
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:45,739
I consider myself a happy man.

41
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:48,033
I've always been happy,
always optimistic.

42
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,951
I've always had faith in life.

43
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:53,079
I always sing in the shower.

44
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:56,458
How do you think the story
of Pablo Escobar will end?

45
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:05,675
Well... one can never assume.
I always hope for the best.

46
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:14,100
I would like to die on my own two feet.

47
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:18,980
In the year 3047.

48
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:06,499
Look behind you.
Watch out for that guy.

49
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:10,169
That's it.

50
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:11,921
Smash the telephone booth.

51
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:14,299
Get the pipe.

52
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:16,342
I already know, Dad.

53
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:18,219
You have to get it.

54
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:21,723
And what's that, a woman?

55
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:23,891
I'm about to fight a woman or what?

56
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:27,145
- Her name's Nora.
- Oh, yeah, what's her name?

57
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,688
Nora.

58
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,774
Boss, excuse me. I have
to interrupt you one second.

59
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,235
How do you...?

60
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:44,620
What about the laboratories?

61
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:48,458
It's been difficult
to find the Moncada laboratories, boss.

62
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,419
And the ones that we find,
we can't get inside.

63
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:54,464
There are police checkpoints
everywhere.

64
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:57,717
This morning we lost four men
trying to get through one.

65
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:00,803
Bastards.

66
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:04,223
And what about Judy Moncada?

67
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:09,479
We can't find her anywhere.
Or Don Berna.

68
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:11,022
Find her.

69
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,191
Yes, sir.

70
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:18,571
And you, boys?

71
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:20,990
Everything is good, boss.

72
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:24,077
- How are you, Limón?
- Very good, sir.

73
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:25,953
- How are you feeling?
- Very good.

74
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,789
- Comfortable?
- Thanks. Very good.

75
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:29,374
Good.

76
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,293
I'm going to teach you something.

77
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:37,298
There is nothing lower than a rat.

78
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:45,098
And if we let the rats run free,
the streets will be filled with them.

79
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:47,183
- Understand me?
- Yes, boss.

80
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,104
Give me one second.
One second.

81
00:14:51,229 --> 00:14:53,064
Boss, excuse me. It's Fernando.

82
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:55,983
Tell me, Fernando.

83
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:58,653
<i>Your interview worked,
Don Pablo.</i>

84
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:01,280
<i>Palace wants to meet with me
right away.</i>

85
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,825
You heard that, brother?

86
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:09,247
- We have to finish our little job.
- But we already finished it, right?

87
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:12,542
No, brother, there's still one left.

88
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,877
But you already killed all the whores.

89
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:17,505
I'm not talking about whores, brother.

90
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:20,883
Why her?

91
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:24,262
- She did everything we told her to.
- Someone talked to the police.

92
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:26,806
Yeah, those fucking whores.

93
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:29,434
She's someone we can trust, man.

94
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:33,646
You can trust her, but I can't.

95
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:35,148
Move it.

96
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:38,985
Quica.

97
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:45,408
I'm not going to tell you again.
Let's go, we've got shit to do.

98
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:47,493
Good day.

99
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:51,164
I have a meeting with the president.

100
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:52,832
I'm Fernando Duque.

101
00:15:57,295 --> 00:16:00,298
Your meeting is not
with the president, Mr Duque.

102
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:01,924
How's that?

103
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,013
- With the vice minister, then?
- No, sir.

104
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:10,725
This says you're meeting
with the attorney general.

105
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:15,229
My apologies, Mr Duque.

106
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:50,139
Mr Duque...

107
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:55,770
I believe that everybody
has the right to a fair trial.

108
00:16:57,063 --> 00:17:02,235
Pablo Escobar has the same rights
as any other Colombian.

109
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:08,366
If he has committed a crime,
he must be judged and indicted,

110
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:11,410
not hunted and killed like an animal.

111
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:14,705
Mr De Greiff,

112
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:20,878
everything you're telling me I find...
fascinating.

113
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,882
However, I don't...

114
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:29,262
I don't buckle under the pressure
of the Americans...

115
00:17:30,638 --> 00:17:33,224
like Gaviria, Mr Duque.

116
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:37,645
Then that means that...

117
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:43,025
you would consider...
making a deal with Pablo.

118
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:47,029
I'm saying that Colombia...

119
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:50,491
has been at war far too long.

120
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:52,910
Of course.

121
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:02,003
The Americans
are bringing in new people.

122
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:06,632
Different faces but, ultimately,
the same motivation.

123
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,554
They are using us
to advance their political agenda.

124
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:13,806
Yes, maybe.

125
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,227
But the reality is we have to accept help
wherever it comes from.

126
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:22,356
The thing about the gringos
is they're limited

127
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:24,525
to Carlos Holguin
and the embassy.

128
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,322
On the other hand, Escobar is gaining
ground, gathering more support.

129
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:31,574
Everyone supports him in Medellin.

130
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:35,244
- Along manhunt plays into his hands.
- Let's talk about Medellin.

131
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:44,545
Colonel Pinzón basically
has Escobar surrounded.

132
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:48,758
Do you think we'll succeed?

133
00:20:34,113 --> 00:20:36,323
Tip line. What do you want to report?

134
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,730
Agent Peña?

135
00:21:33,547 --> 00:21:34,965
Faggots!

136
00:21:50,314 --> 00:21:52,066
Attorney General De Greiff.

137
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:55,736
They told me that you met
with Mr Fernando Duque.

138
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:57,530
That's right.

139
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:00,241
The president was very clear

140
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:04,411
that no one was to communicate
with Escobar's people.

141
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:08,666
Unfortunately for the president,
I don't work for him.

142
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,127
I work for the people of Colombia.

143
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,507
Well, the president and I also work
for the people of Colombia.

144
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:20,427
And should all work together
in a united front against Escobar.

145
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:23,472
- Not in a war...
- Are you afraid of what I might find

146
00:22:23,597 --> 00:22:26,267
if I speak with him, Mr Sandoval?

147
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:29,061
- Excuse me?
- Tell me something.

148
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:33,065
Why did you need to be there
that night at La Catedral?

149
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:38,404
Why was the presence of
the vice minister of justice necessary

150
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:39,905
to transfer a prisoner?

151
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,954
Because we're not talking
about any prisoner.

152
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,290
We're talking about Pablo Escobar.

153
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:52,126
Besides, I was only following
the president's orders.

154
00:22:52,793 --> 00:22:54,336
I don't think that's true.

155
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:59,258
Are you insinuating something?

156
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:03,929
- Are you accusing me of something?
- No, I'm not accusing you of anything.

157
00:23:04,054 --> 00:23:06,181
At least, not yet.

158
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:10,227
But I'm going to open up
an investigation.

159
00:23:10,352 --> 00:23:12,605
About the allegations...

160
00:23:13,606 --> 00:23:18,652
that, possibly,
you helped Pablo Escobar escape.

161
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,698
You know what, Attorney General?

162
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:26,493
Eat shit.

163
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,295
- What the hell are we doing here?
- Running an errand.

164
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,965
- What errand?
- For Don Pablo, brother.

165
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:42,968
Hello.

166
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:45,304
Hello, gentlemen, can I help you?

167
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:49,516
Of course. We're here to pick up
a package, under the name Alvarez.

168
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:51,727
Yes, sir. Right away, with pleasure.

169
00:23:51,852 --> 00:23:53,145
Go ahead.

170
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:58,359
Brother... let's give up on the girl.
She's not coming back.

171
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:01,278
Are you afraid or what, Limón?

172
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:08,994
Close your fucking mouth
and do what I say.

173
00:24:20,297 --> 00:24:21,674
Mr Alvarez!

174
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:24,134
Quica!

175
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:27,763
It's the best in the market.
You really know your shit.

176
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:29,098
Brother!

177
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:31,642
This is fucking great, brother.

178
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,143
Good.

179
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:37,064
Put it in the car.
We've got stuff to do.

180
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:42,653
I'm going to take her eyes out
and make her eat them, that rat bitch.

181
00:24:50,911 --> 00:24:53,789
- What number?
- Room three. I already told you.

182
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:11,807
Bastard.
You told me she'd be here.

183
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:15,185
I don't know, brother.
I think this is where she lives.

184
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,567
She's not there.
Let's come back tomorrow,

185
00:25:21,692 --> 00:25:23,027
or later.

186
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:26,238
Fuck that, brother.

187
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,118
Quica!

188
00:25:40,586 --> 00:25:41,962
Over there, brother.

189
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,688
I got something, brother.

190
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:16,121
That bitch. I'm going to rip out
her tongue and shove it up her ass.

191
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:20,667
I told you she wasn't here, brother.
At this hour, she's at work.

192
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:23,295
- This is bullshit, brother.
- She's not here.

193
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,089
We'll come back later, then.

194
00:26:29,343 --> 00:26:31,428
If the president
doesn't want to negotiate,

195
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:34,056
then we haven't won anything. Right?

196
00:26:34,848 --> 00:26:40,646
Pablo, we have found
a very good option.

197
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:42,189
Definitely.

198
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:48,112
If you let me negotiate with De Greiff,
create some dissension in his ranks...

199
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:49,404
Oh, Fernando.

200
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,740
That's not what I pay you for,
Fernando.

201
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:55,994
You pay me to strategise
and that's exactly what I'm doing.

202
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:59,665
Pablo, you have to understand...

203
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:05,337
The position
that Gaviria is in right now...

204
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:11,093
La Catedral was
a humiliating failure for him.

205
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:16,723
Right now, he's thinking
that capturing you is his only option.

206
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:20,227
And he's not at all thinking

207
00:27:20,352 --> 00:27:26,066
about trying negotiate, but...

208
00:27:29,111 --> 00:27:32,823
De Greiff, he is willing to talk.

209
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:36,910
And he has the autonomy
to make deals.

210
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:45,502
Fine, OK.

211
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:47,754
Let's do it.

212
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:52,843
You're not going to believe it,
but the attorney general

213
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:55,053
supports the legalisation of drugs.

214
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:57,347
- Don't bullshit me.
- It's true.

215
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:01,143
Trust me, Pablo, little by little.

216
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,104
With patience, with time...

217
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:06,440
What we don't have is time, Fernando.

218
00:28:10,152 --> 00:28:12,738
Fernando, excuse us.

219
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:14,656
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

220
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:16,116
- Blackie.
- Yes, sir.

221
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:18,952
Thank you very much, Fernando.

222
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,830
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

223
00:28:21,955 --> 00:28:23,123
Excuse me.

224
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:35,844
What's wrong?

225
00:28:38,347 --> 00:28:40,182
We can't live like this, Pablo.

226
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:43,852
Running from one place to another,
hiding,

227
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:45,938
hoping the government will negotiate.

228
00:28:46,063 --> 00:28:48,190
Gaviria is going to negotiate, Tata.

229
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:53,570
He's too intelligent and too weak not to.

230
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:58,200
How are you so calm?

231
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:04,790
Pablo, if Gaviria doesn't want you in jail
then we both know what he wants.

232
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:12,798
I think it's time for us
to leave Colombia.

233
00:29:14,716 --> 00:29:17,886
I know we said we'd never leave,
but things have changed.

234
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:19,888
No, nothing has changed.

235
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:33,402
My love, we have everything we need.

236
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:36,446
Let's get the children
and go to some other place.

237
00:29:37,364 --> 00:29:39,866
A place where we don't have to hide.

238
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:44,955
We're not going
to spend our lives hiding.

239
00:29:50,752 --> 00:29:52,629
I promise you that.

240
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:35,732
Ortiz, don't let him
out of your sight. Over.

241
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:39,236
They saw La Quica buying a toilet.

242
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:45,117
Guess which one he bought.

243
00:31:45,242 --> 00:31:48,412
The same one that Pablo had
at La Catedral. A Kohler.

244
00:31:54,501 --> 00:31:56,128
We need more.

245
00:31:56,837 --> 00:31:59,464
- But what else, Peña?
- Where did they see him?

246
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:01,800
Going toward the hills
on San Isidro Avenue.

247
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,381
<i>Baby, when are you coming?
You left me all alone.</i>

248
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:43,758
<i>I can't right now. It's too dangerous.</i>

249
00:32:43,884 --> 00:32:46,094
<i>But you said you were coming.</i>

250
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:50,307
<i>Let things calm down a little bit.
I'll show you a good time.</i>

251
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:49,074
Correct me if I'm wrong...

252
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:54,412
In the last raid,
your two men managed to capture

253
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:58,833
the president of the United States,
George Bush.

254
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:03,838
That was based on many different calls
from the tip line.

255
00:34:03,964 --> 00:34:07,717
This is the voice of Velasco.

256
00:34:08,468 --> 00:34:12,639
Ms Messina, apparently
you think my men work for you.

257
00:34:12,764 --> 00:34:16,059
You are mistaken.
I don't work for you.

258
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:19,563
I decide how we are going
to work together. It's different.

259
00:34:21,189 --> 00:34:24,025
I know what happened
to the last man that worked with you.

260
00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:26,069
Colonel Carrillo.

261
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:27,988
He was exiled to Spain.

262
00:34:58,643 --> 00:35:01,938
Colonel, General Silva is on the phone.

263
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,315
Excuse me, Colonel.

264
00:35:12,198 --> 00:35:13,783
General?

265
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:35,138
Move your asses!
The police are coming!

266
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:38,892
Get the guns, the cars and the money
ready, now! They're close!

267
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:40,185
Boss!

268
00:35:42,228 --> 00:35:44,064
Boss, forgive me, it's urgent.

269
00:35:46,149 --> 00:35:47,567
Boss.

270
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:49,486
It's the police.

271
00:35:49,611 --> 00:35:52,572
They're coming up the hill.
We have to leave right now, boss.

272
00:35:55,742 --> 00:35:58,119
Pablo. Pablo!

273
00:36:02,874 --> 00:36:04,292
Bastards.

274
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:06,503
They're coming from
the other side too.

275
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:08,672
- What happened?
- We have to leave.

276
00:36:08,797 --> 00:36:10,173
The police are coming.

277
00:36:10,757 --> 00:36:12,342
- Get the cars ready.
- Yes, boss.

278
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:14,135
- Wait at the back.
- Yes, boss.

279
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,303
Pablo!

280
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:17,889
Go get the kids.
We have to leave right now.

281
00:36:30,193 --> 00:36:33,488
Come this way. Hurry up!

282
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:41,621
Hurry. Over here, through the tunnel.

283
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,506
Surround the house! Let's go!

284
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:31,379
They're gone, sir.

285
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:37,677
Colonel, nobody's in the house,
no signs of life, sir.

286
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:41,306
Fuck.

287
00:37:42,682 --> 00:37:43,850
At ease.

288
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:45,286
Go ahead, come in.

289
00:38:50,124 --> 00:38:51,417
The bedrooms...

290
00:38:53,586 --> 00:38:55,213
they're on the right.

291
00:39:09,102 --> 00:39:10,979
Everything is OK, Tata.

292
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:14,440
No, Pablo.
This time everything is not OK.

293
00:39:14,566 --> 00:39:17,944
Sweetheart, if Pablo says it's OK,
is because it's...

294
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:20,113
Was I talking to you?

295
00:39:22,532 --> 00:39:24,617
I'm talking to my husband.

296
00:39:26,703 --> 00:39:28,872
That was very close, Pablo.

297
00:39:28,997 --> 00:39:30,665
And tomorrow, what?

298
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,293
Do you want the children
to watch those men kill you?

299
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:35,461
No one is going to die, Tata.

300
00:39:37,088 --> 00:39:38,673
I'm dealing with it.

301
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:40,967
How, Pablo?

302
00:39:41,759 --> 00:39:43,136
Tell me how.

303
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:46,347
Negotiating?

304
00:39:47,307 --> 00:39:50,018
Yesterday, they nearly killed you
for negotiating.

305
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:54,272
If you are going to fix it,
fix it for good.

306
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:08,328
Don't worry.

307
00:41:32,286 --> 00:41:33,329
Ready.

308
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:39,752
Boss, we're ready.
What's the order?

309
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:42,130
Do it.

310
00:41:42,714 --> 00:41:44,257
Yes, sir.

311
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:48,970
- What's up?
- Ready.

312
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:50,847
All right.

313
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,226
We're ready, sir.

314
00:42:23,963 --> 00:42:25,256
Come.

315
00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:00,124
Step on it!

316
00:43:53,052 --> 00:43:54,470
Do it, brother.

317
00:43:55,805 --> 00:43:57,723
It's cold, you fucking fag!

318
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:00,268
Finish him! Do it, bastard!

319
00:44:00,393 --> 00:44:01,894
Kill him!
