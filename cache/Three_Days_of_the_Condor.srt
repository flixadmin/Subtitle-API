1
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,639
So tell her what you got.

2
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,139
Male, Caucasian, mid 40s,
appears to have been shot.

3
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,559
- Where?
- In his room.

4
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,600
- Very funny, Harold.
- OK, OK.

5
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,299
The wound is just below the heart.

6
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
- Shot once?
- Seems to have been, yeah.

7
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,639
First you said
appears to have been shot...

8
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,620
Mr. Turner.

9
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,359
Dr. Lappe, I'm sure he's gonna
be here any second now.

10
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,920
Really?

11
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,380
Mr. Turner's late again.

12
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,359
Let's get back to work.

13
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,420
Come on, we can dope it out
in 5 minutes and get back to work.

14
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,270
If Joey were here,
you know what he would say...

15
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:14,159
- ...isn't the only mind in this place.
- Come on.

16
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,019
What kind of a slug?

17
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,299
- You're missing the point, Ray.
- What do you mean?

18
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,834
The machine will come back with a...

19
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:23,305
"Rephrase" or
"Please express in other words".

20
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,000
What do you want to feed in?

21
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,059
- Turner, Joseph. No middle initial.
- You're 17 minutes late.

22
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,239
Make it 12, will you?
I was bucking head winds.

23
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,900
Dr. Lappe, anything in
the early pouch for me?

24
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,339
- Dr. Lappe?
- Yes?

25
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,479
Nothing in response
to your report.

26
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,819
And please have the book I left on your desk
analyzed and on the computer by 4:00.

27
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,520
Yes, sir.

28
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,819
Better get the telemias
moved closer to the light, Dr.,

29
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,960
you're getting a blight
on the leaf.

30
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,920
At ease, Sarge. At ease.

31
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,560
Going to rain today. 10:20.

32
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,239
There's got to be more details.

33
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,859
I only read two chapters.

34
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,859
- No other clues?
- Not so far.

35
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,639
- What time did they find him?
- Just early evening.

36
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,939
They never said
what the caliber of the bullet was.

37
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,719
- Apparently a .38.
- There it is again, "apparently".

38
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,929
Well, it made an entry wound
characteristic of a .38.

39
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,839
But they couldn't
recover the slug itself.

40
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,599
Hey, we're getting somewhere.

41
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,860
You guys figure it out.
I have Far East journals to read.

42
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,779
Was the slug smashed
against the wall?

43
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,919
No. As a matter of fact,
there was no exit wound.

44
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,160
We're not getting anywhere.
Finish the book, Harold.

45
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,159
Hi. What we've got so far is--

46
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,879
Ice.

47
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,739
Instead of lead. Ice!

48
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,239
The murderer pours water
into a .38 caliber mold,

49
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,279
and freezes it, and keeps it solid
until the crime.

50
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,079
Then he shoots the guy
with the ice bullet.

51
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,980
Cops show up in a half an hour,
there's just a few drops of water.

52
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,059
- No bullet, no ballistics.
- That's great.

53
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,000
- Hey.
- Yeah?

54
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,220
What is this?

55
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,427
- Calligraphy's getting beautiful.
- What is it?

56
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:06,599
Ten. That means heaven.

57
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,019
That's it? Nothing else?

58
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,380
Well, it can mean the best.
Tops, sometimes. Why?

59
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,700
I'm not sure.

60
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,759
We're going to Sam
and Mae's tonight, right?

61
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,259
- Mm-hmm.
- Why don't you talk to Sam about it?

62
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,079
- About this?
- Mm-hmm.

63
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,759
I did. He says, "Well, that's interesting,
but that's not my department".

64
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,440
Which means he doesn't think
there's anything, just like Dr. Lappe.

65
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,619
- And you.
- Well, there's not much.

66
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,779
- A mystery that's been translated?
- A mystery that didn't sell...

67
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,519
has been translated into
a very odd assortment of languages.

68
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,299
Turkish, but not French,
Arabic, but not Russian,

69
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,640
or German... Dutch.

70
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,639
Spanish?

71
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,620
Yes.

72
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,319
Hey, where'd you get that thing
about the ice? Dashiell Hammett?

73
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,880
Dick Tracy.
Are you sure about this ideogram?

74
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,300
Look at this face.
Could I be wrong about an ideogram?

75
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,560
It's a great face.

76
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:08,261
But it's never been to China.

77
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,179
- Ray, when can I get some computer time?
- Dick Tracy?

78
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,219
- He was a very underrated detective.
- There's some free time at 2:45.

79
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,139
<i>Morning pickup.</i>

80
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,400
No, no, no, no.
Stay on schedule. I'll get it.

81
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,459
- Four pieces, right?
- Right.

82
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,559
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Five.

83
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,479
- Affirmative. Fiver.
- Where is Mr. Heidegger?

84
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,559
- He called in sick, Dr. Lappe.
- He's probably hung over again.

85
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,019
This is extraordinary.
I was just checking the files,

86
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,679
and I came across this carbon copy of an
inquiry he sent to Persian Gulf command.

87
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,840
He did that for me.

88
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,019
It never went through my office.

89
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,160
I asked him to do some research for me.
I guess he didn't feel it was that important.

90
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,940
I wish you people
would go through channels.

91
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,659
What's on your mind?

92
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,640
OK.

93
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,339
This was in the pouch
from New York Center.

94
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,859
HQ at Langley
said there's nothing

95
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,120
from any other intelligence source
to support your theory.

96
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,999
Is this your idea of
working on that book?

97
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,599
I'll have it on the computer by four.

98
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,799
We have people
to service these machines.

99
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,559
These things are really pretty simple.
They just look complicated.

100
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,116
Mr. Turner,

101
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:17,999
I wonder if you're
entirely happy here.

102
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,419
- Within obvious limits, yes, sir.
- Obvious limits?

103
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,779
It bothers me that
I can't tell people what I do.

104
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,599
Why is it taking you long
to accept that?

105
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,052
Well...

106
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:32,359
I actually trust a few people.
That's a problem.

107
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,519
I believe it's your turn
to bring in lunch.

108
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,400
What time is it?

109
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,339
- 11:22.
- The rain's gonna stop by 11:30.

110
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,840
You can wait eight minutes.

111
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,760
Ah, yes, yes.

112
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,979
Mr. Turner?
Hey! Hey!

113
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,539
Damn it.
It's not a proper exit.

114
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,239
He always goes out that way
when it rains. Saves him a block.

115
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,420
Personnel should enter and exit
the premises by authorized means only.

116
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,759
Jimmy.

117
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,359
- Hey, Shakespeare, how's it going?
- Terrific.

118
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,659
I'm building up a great collection
of rejection slips.

119
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,499
Yeah, I know the feeling.
I always wanted to be Escoffier.

120
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,637
Well, Maybe it's not too late.
You know, Van Gogh was 30

121
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:38,639
- before he started to paint.
- No kidding?

122
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,379
There's no mayonnaise on Dr. Lappe's.

123
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,619
On the other hand, Mozart was 3
when he started playing the piano,

124
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,779
- and he was composing at 6.
- Fast starter. It's probably better.

125
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,399
I don't know.

126
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,499
Van Gogh never sold a painting in
a whole lifetime. Mozart died a pauper.

127
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,039
- Where am I, the NY public library?
- Hey, that's a very bright man.

128
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,599
It's very educational.
That's why I come in here.

129
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,899
You come in here to get sick
just like everybody else.

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,521
Hey, come on.

131
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:06,600
No butter on Ray's sandwich.
He get very panicky about butter.

132
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,300
Give it to Jennings in the back,
he'll sign for it. Just--

133
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,420
Edwinna Rose.

134
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,240
Mrs. Russell,
was the Kirkus report in this--

135
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,980
Wait, wait, wait!

136
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,660
Would you move from the window, please?

137
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,680
- Pardon?
- Would you move from the window, please?

138
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,780
I won't scream.

139
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,360
I know.

140
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,400
A little breakdown
in the security there?

141
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,280
Well, what--
what are you doing?

142
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,080
What--

143
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,540
Come on.

144
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,440
Harold.

145
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,679
For Christ's sake!
What the hell you doin', Mac?

146
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,980
Do your sleeping
at night, will ya?

147
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,179
- This is the Major.
- This is Joe Turner. Listen--

148
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,599
- Identification.
- What?

149
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,955
<i>Identification.</i>

150
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:25,739
My name is Turner,
I work for you. Now listen--

151
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,159
- Identify yourself.
- I-- I don't--

152
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,538
<i>- What is your designation?</i>
- Uh... Condor.

153
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:34,495
Section 9, department 17.
The section's been hit.

154
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:35,962
- What level?
- What level...

155
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,442
- Level of damage.
- Everybody.

156
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:41,939
Dr. Lappe, Janice, Ray, Harold.
Harold was in the, uh--

157
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,179
<i>- Are you on a company line?</i>
- No, I'm in a phone booth.

158
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,699
I'm just a block away.
I'm in the street.

159
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,419
You're in violation of secure
communication procedures, Condor.

160
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,999
Listen, you son of a bitch!
I'm telling you, I came back with lunch,

161
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,079
and it was raining, and the whole house
was murdered, everybody is dead.

162
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,220
<i>Right. Has the incident been discovered
by anyone outside the company?</i>

163
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,939
I don't-- I don't know.
I don't think so.

164
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,093
<i>Are you damaged?</i>

165
00:20:03,394 --> 00:20:05,019
Damaged?

166
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,030
- No.
- Are you armed?

167
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,419
I don't-- I have Mrs., uh, I don't--
I can't remember her code name.

168
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,599
Nightingale.

169
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,999
She was afraid of being raped,
She kept a gun. I've got the gun.

170
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,864
Identify the armament.

171
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:21,719
It's a .45 automatic.
Will you guys bring me in, please?

172
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,879
I'm not a field agent.
I just read books.

173
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,339
- Leave the area.
- All right. Well--

174
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,079
What, do I come in
to headquarters now?

175
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,025
<i>Negative. Find a secure location.</i>

176
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:33,219
- Where?
- Avoid any place you're known.

177
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,379
Do not go home.

178
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,360
Do not go home!

179
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:40,619
Surface again in two hours,
and call the Major.

180
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,739
That'll be 14:30, your time.

181
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,059
Wait a minute.
All right. 2:30, right?

182
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,799
<i>Now, walk away from the phone.
Don't hang it up.</i>

183
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,740
Don't ha--

184
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,300
This is the panic officer.

185
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,560
Section 9-17 may have been hit.

186
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,459
<i>Activate following procedures.</i>

187
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,739
<i>NY 127, DC 469er.</i>

188
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,180
<i>Replay of the report upcoming.
Stand by.</i>

189
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,179
<i>Augie One to New York Center.</i>

190
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,999
This is New York Center,
Go ahead Augie One.

191
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,226
<i>Who am I talking to?</i>

192
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:12,339
Higgins, Deputy Director.
I'm holding the baby, go ahead.

193
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,259
Hit confirmed.
Maximum as reported. Six cold items.

194
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,040
- What was the quality of work?
- Clean, fast, first-rate.

195
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,439
Did you say six?

196
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,059
<i>Excepting Condor,
there should be seven.</i>

197
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,139
Repeat. Six.
Here's a rundown on those items.

198
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,319
Lappe, Chong, Russell,

199
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,339
Jennings, Martin, Mitchell.

200
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,720
All right, Augie One. Find seven.

201
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,160
Thank you.

202
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,680
Condor.

203
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,719
Researcher, tide pool.

204
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,780
Likes to read comic strips.

205
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,100
Who is it?

206
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,380
<i>Jesus.</i>

207
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,679
Hey, you.
You ring my buzzer?

208
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,900
- It was a mistake, buddy.
- Not you guys.

209
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,300
Hey. Hey!

210
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,700
Hey, who are you?

211
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,720
Hey, who the hell are you?

212
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,579
<i>Augie Three here.
We found item seven now.</i>

213
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,979
<i>Ralph Heidegger.
He bought it at home.</i>

214
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:52,179
<i>OK. Button it up, Augie.
I'll send you more janitors.</i>

215
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,599
<i>- Yes, sir.
- I need Langley right away.</i>

216
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,140
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

217
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,851
<i>Garber speaking.</i>

218
00:24:57,952 --> 00:25:01,140
<i>This is Higgins, Deputy Director, NY.
Let me have department 17.</i>

219
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,659
Somebody took out
one of your sections.

220
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,479
- What?
- 9-17.

221
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,259
That's New York.
Somebody got mugged maybe.

222
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,079
They were hit.

223
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,599
- They're bookworms for Christ's sake.
- They got seven out of eight.

224
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,899
We're on the shuttle to
LaGuardia side. 30 minutes.

225
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,645
You say one of my people is still OK?

226
00:25:22,746 --> 00:25:24,239
- Condor. You know him?
- No.

227
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,534
- Is he OK enough to say what happened?
- They didn't touch him.

228
00:25:26,635 --> 00:25:28,399
He was literally out to lunch.

229
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,759
- What does he say happened?
- He's not in yet.

230
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,899
- First call was a little wild, scared.
- Who's bringing him in?

231
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,079
- Higgins.
- Higgins...

232
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:39,179
- Already booked on the shuttle.
- They is Wicks, OIC department 17.

233
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,320
I want a chopper on the pad,
fueled for New York, now.

234
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,871
- Hey, Lois.
- They're waiting for you.

235
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:02,819
- What?
- Your two friends.

236
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,710
They said you'd be home early.

237
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:09,620
They just got here.
Said you gave them the keys.

238
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,540
Mr. Turner?

239
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,638
- This is the Major.
<i>- This is Condor.</i>

240
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:51,161
Stand by, Condor.
I'm routing you to New York Center.

241
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,900
<i>Condor on 1-1, Mr. Higgins.</i>

242
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,246
Hello, Condor.

243
00:26:58,747 --> 00:26:59,706
<i>Who is this?</i>

244
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:02,462
Deputy Director Higgins, New York Center.
I'm controlling now, Condor.

245
00:27:02,563 --> 00:27:03,479
Where are you?

246
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,500
How come I need a code name
and you don't?

247
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,000
Where are you, Turner?

248
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,280
Here.

249
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,239
- You all right?
- Are you insane? Everybody's dead.

250
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,079
Take it easy. Just take it easy,
and we'll bring you home.

251
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,839
Here's how we'll do it.
Do you know the Ansonia Hotel?

252
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:27,219
- Broadway and, uh... 71st.
- Broadway and 73rd.

253
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,979
There's an alley
behind the hotel.

254
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,619
One hour from now
at exactly 15:30,

255
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,800
I want you to enter that alley
from the 73rd Street side.

256
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,700
Will you be there?

257
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,179
The head of your department just came
here from DC. He's gonna bring you home.

258
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,079
- I've never met him.
<i>- Don't worry.</i>

259
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,060
<i>He's studying your photos now.</i>

260
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,540
Turner?

261
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,660
Turner!

262
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,599
I don't know you, either.

263
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,500
We'll meet.

264
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,519
He'll be carrying a Wall Street Journal
in his left hand.

265
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,959
- There were two guys at my house.
- What were you doing there?

266
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,659
- You were told not to go there!
- I was homesick. Who were they?

267
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,900
- They were ours.
- What were they doing in my house?

268
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,039
I'm not going into any alley with you or
anybody, and fuck the Wall Street Journal!

269
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,439
Turner, it's been a long, bad, day.
You've been under--

270
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,980
You're damn right I've been under.

271
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:32,228
All right, Turner.

272
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,300
We'll bring along a familiar face,
somebody you know.

273
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,299
Who's left?

274
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,019
<i>Got a friend in statistics
named Sam Barber.</i>

275
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,339
Sam...

276
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,675
- You guys are something.
<i>- Will he do?</i>

277
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,319
Yes, Sam will do.

278
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,339
All right, Turner.

279
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,819
Stay well for 60 minutes,
and you're home.

280
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,760
- Can I ask a question?
<i>- Sure.</i>

281
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:01,679
What is happening?

282
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,380
I'll talk to you in 60 minutes.

283
00:29:07,275 --> 00:29:08,980
You've got 55.

284
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,399
This is ridiculous.

285
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,559
You're not a field agent.
It's standard procedure.

286
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,858
To pick up a friend?

287
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:17,326
- What about you, Mr. Wicks?
- No, thanks.

288
00:29:17,427 --> 00:29:19,961
- Side arm?
- I don't know. If you got a .45?

289
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:21,219
You bet.

290
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,660
Here, let me help you with that.

291
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,159
How long have you known Condor?

292
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,419
Who, Joey? I knew him
before he was a bird even.

293
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,320
We went to CCNY.
My wife Mae too.

294
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,919
- She ever Condor's girl?
- Here you go, Mr. Wicks.

295
00:29:43,095 --> 00:29:45,959
Hey, can you tell me anything
about what happened today?

296
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,260
- When?
- This morning.

297
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,532
All those murders.

298
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:52,341
What murders?

299
00:30:49,372 --> 00:30:50,572
Sam?

300
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,120
Sam?

301
00:31:00,606 --> 00:31:02,699
Here he is. Joe!

302
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,280
Hey, Sam.

303
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,160
Where-- Where's that other--

304
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,039
What are you doing?
It's him! It's him!

305
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,080
Joe!

306
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,700
Katherine Hale. H-A-L-E.

307
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,979
08, 1156,

308
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,579
172, 208, 875.

309
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,919
Amount, 51.86.

310
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,919
Where's there enough snow
this early?

311
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,479
- Vermont. I hope.
- What's open now, Sugarbush?

312
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,779
No, I don't do downhill.
This is for cross-country.

313
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,200
Don't like the lift lines, huh?

314
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,620
474? Thank you.

315
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,040
Kathy!

316
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,919
Kathy. Where have you been?
Here, let me give you a hand.

317
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,800
- Wait a minute, I don't kno--
- Don't do anything.

318
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,940
Be quiet. Get in the car.
Don't make a sound. Don't be dumb.

319
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,739
Come on. Hurry up.

320
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,620
Get in.

321
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,199
Listen, please don't hurt me.

322
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,623
Where do you live?
Where do you live?

323
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,900
- Brooklyn Heights.
- Alone?

324
00:33:38,254 --> 00:33:40,319
I live with a friend.

325
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,900
You live alone.
Come on, let's go.

326
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,240
Leave the stuff.

327
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,200
Hey, Kathy.

328
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,900
You should have said hello.

329
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,440
- Where is it?
- Here.

330
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,539
"Condor shot us both".

331
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,139
Evidently, that was the only
statement he could make

332
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,339
before they took him
into the operating room.

333
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,819
- And the other man, Barber, he's dead?
- Before he hit the ground, Mr. Atwood.

334
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,799
You should add that it was
a remarkable shot.

335
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,939
A half inch above
his flak jacket.

336
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,599
- I thought this guy was--
- Wait a minute.

337
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,480
Was Condor qualified
with a hand gun?

338
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,259
Two years military service,
Signal Corps.

339
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,374
Telephone lineman, long lines,
switchboard maintenance.

340
00:37:00,475 --> 00:37:01,739
Six months overseas.

341
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,059
Separated 9/61. Worked at Bell Labs
Communication Research.

342
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,279
College on the G.I. bill.

343
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,939
The question was, Mr. Higgins,
is he qualified with a handgun?

344
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,939
No handgun, sir.
M1 rifle and carbine.

345
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,239
Evidently, it was sheer luck.

346
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,320
Or else--

347
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,499
- Yes?
- Or else what, Mr. Higgins?

348
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,899
This Condor isn't the man
his file says he is.

349
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,639
- Then where did he learn evasive moves?
- He reads.

350
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,019
- He reads...
- What the hell does that mean?

351
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,920
It means, sir,
that he reads everything.

352
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,815
- I don't understand.
- Yes. Very good.

353
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:38,059
- Has operations got anything?
- Absolutely nothing, sir.

354
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,079
- Extraordinary.
- It was very well executed.

355
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,539
Which requires planning,
communications, tracks.

356
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,059
I'm not asking for footprints,

357
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,559
but a blade of grass,
a broken twig,

358
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,020
- something disturbed.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,700
- Wicks seems to be all we've got.
- Where do we have him?

360
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,620
We don't.

361
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,619
They rushed him to Guvenor Emergency
before we got word.

362
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,572
Maybe we should leak
the name of the hospital,

363
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:07,539
try to get Condor to make his move.

364
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,579
Of course, Len, don't expect
too many mistakes from this man.

365
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,399
He does seem rather more interesting
than just another of our reader-researchers.

366
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,679
For example, has he gone
into business for himself?

367
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:24,199
Was he turned around?
Does someone operate him?

368
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,380
Is he... Homosexual?
Broke? Vulnerable?

369
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,799
Could he be
a soldier of fortune?

370
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,940
<i>Did he arrange the hit?</i>

371
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,819
<i>Is that why he's still in flight?</i>

372
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,319
<i>Still, he...
may be an innocent.</i>

373
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:45,460
<i>But then, why didn't he
come in gently with Mr. Wicks?</i>

374
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,439
- Tentrex Industries.
- It's a cover. I work for the CIA.

375
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,380
Oh, Jesus.

376
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,979
Your assignment for today
was to go out and kidnap a girl.

377
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,840
Look it up. Look it up.
Tentrex Industries.

378
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,439
Then look up the number
for the CIA in New York.

379
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,059
You mean they're listed,
like my Aunt Gladys?

380
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,880
It's under "US Government
Agencies", go on.

381
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,680
So is this what you do?
This photography?

382
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,300
OK.

383
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,671
It's the same number.

384
00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:27,211
- You could have had the card made--
- Yes, I could've made the card,

385
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:28,740
but I didn't.

386
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,059
You really get into it,
don't you?

387
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,120
Sit down!

388
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,620
I told you I had a friend.

389
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,599
15 and a half, 34.

390
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,319
- I dig 15 1/2, 34s. What size are you?
- What are you, a clown?

391
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,839
- I'm scared!
- So am I!

392
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,180
What are you scared for,
you've got the gun!

393
00:39:47,281 --> 00:39:48,881
Yes!

394
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,940
Yeah, and it's not enough.

395
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,900
Listen.

396
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,260
I work for the CIA.
I am not a spy.

397
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,420
I just read books.

398
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,099
We read everything
that's published in the world.

399
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,031
And we... we feed the plots,
dirty tricks, codes,

400
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:38,199
into a computer,
and the computer...

401
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,079
checks against actual
CIA plans and operations.

402
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,139
I look for leaks,
I look for new ideas.

403
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,899
We read adventures
and novels and...

404
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,160
journals.

405
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,680
I can--

406
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,040
Who'd invent a job like that?

407
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,300
I-- Listen!

408
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,459
- People are trying to kill me!
- Who?

409
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,820
I don't know,
but there's a reason.

410
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,920
There is a reason!

411
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,199
And I just need...

412
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,780
some safe, quiet time
to pull things together.

413
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,860
- Here.
- Here.

414
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,060
That's only fair.

415
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,540
Where's the guy
with the shirts?

416
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,820
He's at a ski place,
in the Green Mountains.

417
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,399
We just want to go
cross-country skiing.

418
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,220
A couple of weeks,
away from everything.

419
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,599
- What time does the news go on, 6?
- 6 o'clock.

420
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,680
40 minutes.

421
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,259
- Come here.
- No, please. Please don't.

422
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,340
Lie down.

423
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:26,540
Lie down. Against the wall.

424
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,100
Put this arm behind you,
and keep it there.

425
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,860
Now you listen to me.
I am tired.

426
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,200
I've got to close
my eyes for a while.

427
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,660
I can't think straight.

428
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,040
If you try and move,
or climb off the bed...

429
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,519
I'll know it.
I'll feel it.

430
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,600
And I promise you
I'll hurt you.

431
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,699
Couldn't you let me
stay in the other room?

432
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,480
No.

433
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,040
I believe what you told me.

434
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,579
No, you don't.

435
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,700
I don't know if I do.

436
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,699
That includes Condor,
of course.

437
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,799
Yes, I owe you Condor.

438
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,200
- Otherwise--
- Otherwise does not exist.

439
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,959
Will Condor take long?

440
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,939
- Do you want an estimate?
- There is a time factor.

441
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,520
Always with you people.

442
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,619
Condor is an amateur.

443
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,880
He's lost, unpredictable...

444
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,980
Perhaps even sentimental.

445
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,440
He could fool a professional.

446
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,719
Not deliberately,
but precisely because he is lost.

447
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,180
Doesn't know what to do.

448
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,279
Unlike Wicks.

449
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,460
Who has always been
entirely predictable.

450
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:00,239
The man Condor killed in the alley.

451
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,560
Some friend of his.

452
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,700
- Close friend?
- I suppose so. Why?

453
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,919
- It interests me.
- What was his name?

454
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,900
I don't know.
He was nobody. He was--

455
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,039
Right.

456
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,320
What about Wicks?

457
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,960
You want the firm
to question him?

458
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,460
They will, you know.

459
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,400
We don't want that.

460
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,979
Cost you nothing.

461
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,960
I was careless with Condor.

462
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,440
Wicks will be done
for nothing.

463
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,520
- What time is it? What time--
- It's news time.

464
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,380
Get up.

465
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,720
Lonely pictures.

466
00:45:42,011 --> 00:45:43,506
So?

467
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,760
You're funny.

468
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,519
You take pictures of...

469
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,740
empty streets and trees
with no leaves on them.

470
00:45:57,036 --> 00:45:58,563
It's winter.

471
00:45:58,898 --> 00:46:00,800
Not quite winter.

472
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,039
They look like...

473
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,680
November.

474
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,500
Not autumn, not winter.
In-between.

475
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,380
I like them.

476
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:21,219
Thanks.

477

<i>Eyewitness News continues

- Sit down.

479
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,139
<i>The shootings
behind the Hotel Ansonia</i>

480

at this hour.</i>

481
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,339
<i>The victims' identities
have not yet been revealed.</i>

482
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,399
- Victims?
<i>- And according to a police spokesman,</i>

483
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,359
<i>drugs were not involved, nor...
- Did he say victims?</i>

484
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,319
<i>does it seem to have been a robbery.</i>

485
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,839
<i>Lieutenant, can you tell us anything
about the possible motive?</i>

486
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,199
<i>- Not at present.
- Have you identified the victims?</i>

487
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,030
<i>They were employees of
a large insurance company.</i>

488
00:46:48,131 --> 00:46:50,899
<i>- What?! - ...routine inspection
for possible violations.</i>

489
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,039
<i>And did the victims know
their assailant or assailants?</i>

490
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:55,539
<i>- Absolutely not.
- Well, there you have it.</i>

491
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,719
<i>One man dead,
one seriously wounded,</i>

492
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,999
<i>in an alley on
the west side of Manhattan.</i>

493
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,479
<i>And the man with the gun,
still at large.</i>

494
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,620
<i>- Stan Roberts, Eyewitness News, New York.</i>
- Sam!

495
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,079
Jesus Christ!

496
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,180
Victims. What is he s--

497
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,960
What happened in that alley?

498
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,840
- I didn't shoot him.
- You said you shot somebody.

499
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,860
But not Sam!

500
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,060
Nobody in that alley
said anything about the CIA.

501
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,640
But--

502
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,220
But they were there.

503
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,459
Wait a minute.
You're telling me--

504
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,740
They had to have been
to change that story.

505
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,459
What did Higgins say?
He said he wouldn't be there.

506
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,640
He said the section chief was
coming in, the section chief w--

507
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,420
Wait a minute. He's--

508
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,519
Section chief would be
coming in from Washington.

509
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,420
He'd have to reach Sam.
Sam would call me.

510
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,880
Hello.

511
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,900
Hello?

512
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,679
- I need your car.
- That's called grand theft.

513
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,100
You don't want trouble
with the police.

514
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,779
This guy in Vermont, what's he
gonna do when you don't show up?

515
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,931
Probably call. Very soon now.

516
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:40,505
Call, or do I have to worry
about him showing up here?

517
00:48:40,606 --> 00:48:41,891
You're not entitled to
personal questions.

518
00:48:41,992 --> 00:48:44,375
That gun gives you the right to rough me up,
it doesn't give you the right to ask me--

519
00:48:44,476 --> 00:48:46,139
Rough you up?
Have I roughted you up?

520
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,939
- Yes! What are you doing in my house?
- Have I-- Have I raped you?

521
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,740
The night is young.

522
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,440
You don't believe
anything I've said, do you?

523
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,619
I believe you're in trouble.

524
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,460
Danger...

525
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,260
But I don't know what kind.

526
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,148
And I'm not sure
how much of it is...

527
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:25,439
made up.

528
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,599
Real! But, uh...

529
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,259
Doesn't make any difference.
Doesn't matter.

530
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,859
- Just... wait a minute. Will you--
- Forget it.

531
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,460
I'm trying to understand
what you're saying to me!

532
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,100
What are you doing?
Let me go!

533
00:49:43,705 --> 00:49:44,932
Wait a minute...

534
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,179
You bully!

535
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,260
Don't tie me up!
Come on, please!

536
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,138
This is...

537
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,721
unfair!

538
00:50:00,077 --> 00:50:01,620
I know.

539
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,520
Hi, Joey.
You're early. Come on in.

540
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,080
Hey, is Janice working late?

541
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,060
So is Sam.

542
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,520
Hey, pour one for me,
too, will you Joey?

543
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:35,180
It's their own fault if we're
zonked when they get here.

544
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,791
Hey, I've got it!

545
00:51:40,092 --> 00:51:41,663
We'll give them an hour,
and if they're not here,

546
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:44,856
then it's you and me babe,
just like old times.

547
00:51:48,765 --> 00:51:50,200
Joey.

548
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,403
What is it?

549
00:51:52,504 --> 00:51:54,706
What is it, Joey? What?

550
00:51:55,207 --> 00:51:56,877
- What's wrong?
- Mae...

551
00:51:57,278 --> 00:51:59,819
How do you know
Sam's working late?

552
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,439
- What do you think he's doing?
- When did he call?

553
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,659
I don't know. 2:00 or 2:30.

554
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,779
What did he say? Exactly.

555
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,259
He didn't exactly.
He had the center call.

556
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,320
- Who at the center?
- I didn't recognize his voice.

557
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,700
It wasn't that lady
that usually--

558
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,480
Hello.

559
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:30,343
- What is it?
- Third damn time tonight.

560
00:52:30,444 --> 00:52:31,339
Third time?

561
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,819
- It's some creepy burglar casing the joint.
- I want you to get out of here.

562
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,059
- I can't, Joey. I'm cooking.
- Just do what I tell you, babe.

563
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,403
- What about dinner?
- Go to Bill and Eileen's.

564
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:42,157
- Stay there until I call.
- Joey, what's going on?

565
00:52:42,258 --> 00:52:43,215
Please.

566
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:46,739
- Joey, you--
- Don't argue. Move! Move!

567
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,359
You should go upstairs and stay there.

568
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,519
Do what I'm telling you.
I'll call you. And stay there.

569
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,999
- Joey-- Joey, you're scaring me.
- I'll call you.

570
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,540
- Do what I'm telling you, please!
- What about Sam?

571
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,020
Yours?

572
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,260
No.

573
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,300
<i>Happy birthday
to Grandpa...</i>

574
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,939
You're always
pushing the buttons.

575
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,240
Would you stop it...

576
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,220
Fifth floor, uh...
Ladies' underwear.

577
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,200
Kids.

578
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,180
Probably the same everywhere.

579
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,900
This is the second floor.

580
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,480
I do it all the time.

581
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,640
- After you.
- No. Go ahead.

582
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,960
All right.

583
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,303
- Anybody here good with a coat hanger?
- What?

584
00:55:57,404 --> 00:55:58,856
I locked my keys in my car,
I need to get in.

585
00:55:58,957 --> 00:56:01,679
I'll give you some money, couple of
bucks, OK? Anybody can get in the car?

586
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:04,021
Come on, you can't tell me you've
never busted into a car before.

587
00:56:04,122 --> 00:56:07,659
- I've busted a car. So how much?
- 5 bucks. 5 bucks.

588
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,739
- 5 bucks? Why not?
- Can you give me a break?

589
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,439
- Do you mind?
- All right. 5 bucks. 5 bucks.

590
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,856
I'll be right back.
Come on, man.

591
00:56:15,957 --> 00:56:17,684
...have some fun.

592
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,700
Merde.

593
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,980
Wait a minute.

594
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,280
Give me the money.

595
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,000
Hey!

596
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,319
I want you to answer the phone.

597
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,660
I'm not going to answer the--

598
00:58:07,886 --> 00:58:09,099
I'm not answering any phone!

599
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,080
Answer it. Answer it.

600
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:15,020
You answer this phone! Tell him
what a brave son of a bitch you are.

601
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,000
I want you to be
casual and nice.

602
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,279
- Hello?
<i>- Where the hell are you?</i>

603
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,699
- Ben?
<i>- Who do you think it is?</i>

604
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,423
Ben...

605
00:58:33,124 --> 00:58:35,279
<i>You were supposed to
be up here by now.</i>

606
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,420
- I know.
<i>- You haven't even left yet.</i>

607
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,640
I was held up.

608
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,333
<i>That's no excuse.</i>

609
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:47,340
<i>Come on, what's going on,
doesn't this trip matter to you?</i>

610
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,380
- It matters.
<i>- Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

611
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,539
- No, it does.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

612
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,846
<i>This has happened over and over again.
The last minute, some...</i>

613
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:57,200
<i>- Some excuse.</i>
- No, this is different.

614
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,080
<i>So, what?</i>

615
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,619
- The car.
<i>- What about it?</i>

616
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,919
- Broke down.
<i>- What, what? What broke down?</i>

617
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:11,559
- The generator went.
<i>- Oh, Christ, the generator.</i>

618
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,460
<i>- That's going to take forever.</i>
- Maybe not.

619
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:18,179
I tried to call you before, but...

620
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,159
<i>The generator... It's--
Look, it's gonna take too long.</i>

621
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,259
<i>Why don't you just--
forget about the car.</i>

622
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,680
<i>Just take the bus up
first thing tomorrow.</i>

623
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,240
I'll try.

624
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,460
<i>Try?</i>

625
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,559
<i>What the hell's going on?
Are you OK? What-- What's...</i>

626
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,760
No, I'm OK. I'm fine.

627
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,280
<i>You don't sound so fine.</i>

628
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,919
I wish you would understand.

629
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,299
<i>I do. I do, I do. It's just--</i>

630
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,620
<i>Goddamn it,
I'm just disappointed, that's all.</i>

631
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,179
<i>I really, uh--</i>

632
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,959
<i>I really wanted to be
with you up here,</i>

633
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,999
<i>tonight, babe, you know?</i>

634
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,040
I know.

635
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,920
- We'll have time.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

636
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,779
<i>Look, get--</i>

637
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,360
<i>get the very first bus out
in the morning, OK?</i>

638
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,320
All right.

639
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:16,280
- Good night, sweetheart.
<i>- Good night.</i>

640
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,760
Listen, I'll be going...

641
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,160
in the morning.

642
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,200
Where?

643
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,820
Was it all right?

644
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,779
All right?

645
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,940
Outside, was it safe?
Wherever you went.

646
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,540
I'm not sure.

647
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,960
Oh, God.

648
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,980
I wish I knew more.

649
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,920
About you...

650
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,565
Yesterday.

651
01:01:50,866 --> 01:01:52,781
Today.

652
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:55,920
I don't remember yesterday.

653
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,620
Today it rained.

654
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,220
Why did you have to
tie me up like that?

655
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,520
You thought I'd call the police.

656
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,220
I wouldn't have.

657
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,380
Why?

658
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,739
Sometimes...

659
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,688
I take a picture that...

660
01:02:28,089 --> 01:02:32,219
isn't like me, but I took it,
so it is like me.

661
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:34,820
It has to be.

662
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,040
I put those pictures away.

663
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,259
I'd like to see those pictures.

664
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,800
We don't know
each other that well.

665
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,379
Do you know anybody that well?

666
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,560
I... don't think I want
to know you very well.

667
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:07,340
I don't think you're
gonna live much longer.

668
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,259
Well, I may...

669
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,340
surprise you.

670
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,500
Anyway, you're not
telling the truth.

671
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,091
- What do you mean?
- You'd rather be with somebody

672
01:03:20,192 --> 01:03:22,159
who's not going to
live much longer.

673
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,332
At least somebody who would be...

674
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:26,241
on his way.

675
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,560
- I'm not--
- You take pictures.

676
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,800
Beautiful pictures.

677
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,519
But of empty streets.

678
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,940
And trees with no leaves.
November.

679
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,500
Why haven't you asked me
to untie your hands?

680
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,820
How much do you want...

681
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,639
I just...

682
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,420
want to stop it.

683
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,320
For a few hours.

684
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,620
For the rest of the night.

685
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,240
And then I'll go.

686
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,140
<i>Joe!</i>

687
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,080
What was his name?

688
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,099
What is it Higgins said?
Was it--

689
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,979
<i>The head of your department just came
here from DC. He's gonna bring you home.</i>

<i>I've never met him.</i>

691
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,640
<i>Anything in the early pouch?</i>

692
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:46,999
<i>Headquarters at Langley

694

696

Wicks.

697
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,820
- You didn't sleep well.
- You didn't?

698
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,120
No, you didn't.

699
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,339
You're up early.

700
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,740
Oh, I have--
I had some thoughts.

701
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,480
I've got a plan.

702
01:09:11,996 --> 01:09:14,680
I don't know if it'll
work or not, but...

703
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:19,279
I'll need your help.

704
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:21,564
Have I ever denied you anything?

705
01:09:21,665 --> 01:09:23,100
Hey.

706
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,920
Well, when things
quiet down...

707
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:33,960
you're really a very
sweet man to be with.

708
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,760
You had bad dreams.

709
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,860
Talked in your sleep.

710
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,640
What did I say?

711
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,980
Who's Janice?

712
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:55,300
Was she a volunteer
or a draftee like me?

713
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,400
She was...

714
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,319
a friend.

715
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,700
She's dead.

716
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,459
Do I have permission
to take a shower?

717
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,119
You don't have to help,
you know.

718
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,832
No, no. I'll help.

719
01:10:15,933 --> 01:10:18,461
You can always depend
on the old spyfucker.

720
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:25,509
OK.

721
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:27,199
- I'm sorry.
- No.

722
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,340
No, I didn't mean--

723
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,179
I didn't mean to say that.

724
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,800
I'm really sorry.

725
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,900
I'd like to help you.

726
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:04,428
- 18, isn't that?
- Yes.

728
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,940
Yeah?

729
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:22,300
Insured package
for Katherine Hale.

730
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:29,140
Could you leave it
out on the stoop?

731
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,759
Somebody's got to sign for it.

732
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,297
Well, she's--
She's not here.

733
01:11:34,398 --> 01:11:36,240
It's OK, you can sign.

734
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,459
- Yeah?
- Her name on top, yours on the bottom.

735
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,410
All right.

736
01:11:48,611 --> 01:11:50,813
- Oh, wonderful.
- Government pens...

737
01:11:51,014 --> 01:11:53,438
Look, I don't have another pen.

738
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,580
I'll get one.

739
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:21,100
Don't, don't--

740
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:22,939
No, no. No.

741
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,560
Now listen.
You're OK. You're OK.

742
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,700
Now listen to me.
You're OK.

743
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,959
Can you get dressed?
You're OK!

744
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,700
Can you get dressed?
Please, hurry.

<i>He's not here just now.
May I ask who's calling, please?</i>

How do you feel, you OK?

764

What did you do
to those people?

765
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,599
What people?
I don't know who they are anymore.

766
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,279
I file a report, and
a guy in Washington reads it.

767
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:35,319
He's supposed to read it.
He's my section chief.

768
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:37,319
And he comes to
New York to shoot me.

769
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,740
- Did you know him?
- No.

770
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,660
Did you know the mailman?

771
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,959
No, but the guy
in Washington did.

772
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,239
- Then you won't know the next one either.
- I'm not gonna wait for the next one.

773
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:52,739
<i>- Has he gone double or dirty?</i>
- I don't know, sir.

- I wouldn't be.

01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,139
Question: Is there
an intelligence network,

undetected by CIA,

777
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,139
linking certain Arabic-speaking countries

<i>We're already visible.
Let's not become conspicuous.</i>

779

If company agents aren't enough,
use freelance.

780
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,240
Use whatever it requires,
but end it.

781
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:24,860
OK.

782

01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,580
Thanks.

785
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,460
Applications here.

786
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:12,560
OK.

787
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:17,660
See Mr. Addison.
Turn right, first door on your left.

788
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:20,400
Mr. Marcus.

789
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,600
- Mr. Addison?
- No.

790
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:51,098
He's in clearance.
You passed it, it's on your left.

791
01:17:52,599 --> 01:17:53,699
Sorry.

792
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,440
Thank you.

793
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,920
Yep. I didn't get the job.

794
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,079
Looks good.

795
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,822
But...

796
01:18:59,165 --> 01:19:00,819
I have this friend,

797
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,699
and he asked me to
give you a message.

798
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,819
Quote: Dear Mr. Higgins,

799
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:09,958
this will introduce
a friend of mine, Sparrow Hawk.

800
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:12,233
Please accompany her to the

801
01:19:12,334 --> 01:19:15,399
Nassau Street exit of this place.

802
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,200
Now.

803
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,759
Personally, I'd do it.

804
01:19:20,860 --> 01:19:23,199
Because he has this huge gun,

805
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,500
and he's looking
at us right now.

806
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:29,520
I'll save this for you.

807
01:19:30,188 --> 01:19:31,625
Shall we?

808
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,260
To your left, please.

809
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,059
OK, sit up. Sit up!

810
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,680
All the way up.
Back up against the panel.

811
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,560
Take it easy, take it easy.
I'm not armed.

812
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:08,199
They could be DF-ing us if you have the
transmitter hidden somewhere on your clothes?

813
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,159
- What's this?
- DF, huh? You do read everything, do--

814
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:14,299
This is no goddamn book. Somebody
or something is rotten in the company.

815
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,703
You never complained
till yesterday.

816
01:20:15,804 --> 01:20:17,839
You didn't start killing
my friends till yesterday.

817
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,539
- Who's she?
- Who hit the Lit Society?

818
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,879
We had a big meeting about that.
Your name came up.

819
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:26,660
Five Continents Imports.
Ring a bell?

820
01:20:29,135 --> 01:20:31,038
- Where'd you get that?
- The mailman.

821
01:20:31,139 --> 01:20:32,499
- Mailman?
- The one you sent. You know,

822
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,167
the one with the uniform, cute little
leather pouch, automatic gun.

823
01:20:35,268 --> 01:20:37,423
- We never use mailmen.
- Would you also happen to be familiar

824
01:20:37,524 --> 01:20:40,670
with a very tall gentleman,
about 6'4", blond hair,

825
01:20:40,771 --> 01:20:42,928
strong like a farmer, not American.

826
01:20:43,029 --> 01:20:46,983
Accent. Country, near Germany.
Maybe Alsace-Lorraine?

827
01:21:11,884 --> 01:21:14,797
- Yes?
<i>- Was the letter delivered?</i>

828
01:21:14,983 --> 01:21:17,266
The return receipt has not arrived.

829
01:21:17,367 --> 01:21:19,814
<i>You should've delivered it yourself.</i>

830
01:21:20,015 --> 01:21:23,266
A more complicated package
had to be handled.

831
01:21:23,667 --> 01:21:26,176
But I might have
underestimated this one.

832
01:21:26,277 --> 01:21:28,967
<i>I was told you never
make that kind of mistake.</i>

833
01:21:30,592 --> 01:21:33,081
<i>- What will you do?</i>
- Wait.

834
01:21:33,182 --> 01:21:35,029
<i>For what?</i>

835
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,929
People who move,

836
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:39,284
leave word of change-of-address.

837
01:21:39,301 --> 01:21:41,276
- I wanna see that report, Turner.
- Oh, no, no Higgins, come on.

838
01:21:41,477 --> 01:21:42,854
- Do you know him?
- Professionally, yes.

839
01:21:42,955 --> 01:21:45,500
- Professionally, he kills people.
- Yes.

840
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:46,908
Yes.

841
01:21:47,009 --> 01:21:48,257
He works for the company?

842
01:21:48,358 --> 01:21:50,328
He did once.
He's a contract agent.

843
01:21:50,429 --> 01:21:53,199
- Contract agent.
- Freelance.

844
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,760
Where did you see him?

845
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,995
Uh-uh.

846
01:21:59,396 --> 01:22:02,077
- It would help if I knew.
- Who would it help?

847
01:22:02,278 --> 01:22:03,659
- Who'd hire him now?
- Anybody.

848
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,959
Terrific answer!

849
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,019
- I wouldn't accept it, either.
- What's his name?

850
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,253
When I knew him, Joubert.

851
01:22:11,454 --> 01:22:13,272
Come on, Higgins. Who'd hire him?
You don't look up Joubert

852
01:22:13,373 --> 01:22:15,572
- in the yellow pages.
- That's right.

853
01:22:16,007 --> 01:22:18,659
It would have to be
somebody in the community.

854
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,679
- Community?
- Intelligence field.

855
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:25,100
Community! Jesus, you guys are
kind to yourselves. Community.

856
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:28,039
I want to see that report, Turner.

857
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:31,059
That report was sent
to headquarters and disappeared.

858
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:34,280
- Who read it?
- You mean besides Wicks?

859
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:37,620
You tell me.

860
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:42,975
I pick up traces of what I think's
an intelligence network

861
01:22:43,076 --> 01:22:45,309
the company doesn't know about.

862
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:46,992
And I report it.

863
01:22:47,027 --> 01:22:49,780
Now, why is that going to
make anybody mad, Higgins?

864
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:53,142
Unless it was the company's network
and you didn't want it blown,

865
01:22:53,243 --> 01:22:55,727
not even to your own guys.

866
01:22:55,962 --> 01:22:58,440
Unless somebody is lying,
Higgins.

867
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,560
Come on.

868
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,680
Why is everybody so shy?

869
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,280
I'm not shy.

870
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:10,540
I don't know.
That's what worries me.

871
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,319
- I don't know.
- Ask Wicks.

872
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:16,620
Wicks died.

873
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:23,480
Someone yanked him off the life
support system at Guvenor Hospital.

874
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,840
Get me in, Higgins.

875
01:23:37,084 --> 01:23:39,519
What good would that do if
you're right, and they are inside?

876
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:42,460
What good would it do
to bring you in?

877
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,040
What am I supposed to do?

878
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,820
I'm sorry.

879
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,640
You're sorry?

880
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:00,940
You're sorry.

881
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,600
Oh, I get it.

882
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,299
I get it.
You expect me to draw fire.

883
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,259
Like one of those
penny arcade bears

884
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,559
that parades back and forth,
waiting for somebody,

885
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:16,879
somebody very good,
just to take another shot.

886
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:20,039
And you're just gonna hang around and
pick him up before he does it, or just after?

887
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,847
I'm gonna try and
find out what's going on,

888
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:23,319
I'm gonna cross-check
all those names.

889
01:24:23,420 --> 01:24:24,859
- Nice talking to you, Higgins.
- Now wait a minute.

890
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,756
- Have a nice day.
- Where are you going, where will I find you?

891
01:24:28,157 --> 01:24:29,559
I'll find you.

892
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,790
Do you trust him?

893
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:41,559
Trust...

894
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,079
Does he trust you?

895
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,122
He's in the suspicion business.
He can't trust anybody.

896
01:24:45,223 --> 01:24:47,640
But they all are. How could
anybody sneak in and fool them?

897
01:24:47,741 --> 01:24:49,471
Maybe nobody did.

898
01:24:49,672 --> 01:24:50,837
Then...

899
01:24:51,038 --> 01:24:53,959
Maybe there's another CIA.

900
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,180
Inside the CIA.

901
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,529
Hey, Sal.

902
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:23,776
The light's gone off.
Come on over here.

903
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,980
The generator went off.

904
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:33,199
- It's a hotel room.
- What hotel?

905
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,359
There's no tag.
It's room 819, city of New York.

906
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:38,659
There's a code number
cut in the edge.

907
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,760
You in the trade?

908
01:25:41,001 --> 01:25:44,060
- I read about it in a story.
- Was the story about locksmiths?

909
01:25:44,161 --> 01:25:47,719
It's the lock manufacturer's code.
He can give you the name of the hotel.

910
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:50,340
Look, I don't want to read
about you in the paper, Sonny.

911
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,940
Will you make the call?

912
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:30,780
Yes?

913
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:34,020
I'm doing a survey.

914
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:38,020
Do you believe the Condor is
really an endangered species?

915
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,480
<i>- Your room number, please.
- 819.</i>

916
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,266
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yes.

917
01:27:07,367 --> 01:27:09,479
- I just had an interesting call.
<i>- Who is this?</i>

918
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,259
In reference to an all
but extinct bird, the Condor.

919
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,259
<i>- Have you had such a call?
- You're a fool to call me here.</i>

920
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:19,279
- You had no such call?
<i>- No.</i>

921
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:21,220
Must have been
the Audubon Society.

922
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,140
I assume they're still
located in New York city.

01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:40,540
Coming up.

943
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:04,090
I'll be damned...
I'll be damned.

944
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,379
- This is the Major.
<i>- Condor.</i>

945
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,239
<i>Find me Higgins.</i>

946
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:01,700
Routing you, Condor.
Stand by.

947
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,519
Hello, Condor.

948
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:11,059
- The Holiday Inn, 57th Street.
<i>- Is that where you are now?</i>

949
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:14,960
Room 819. If you move it, you'll find
the Alsatian gentleman we spoke of.

950
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:17,280
Where are you, Condor?

951
01:31:17,481 --> 01:31:19,081
Where are you?

952
01:31:20,155 --> 01:31:21,668
Quiet down.

953
01:31:22,503 --> 01:31:24,180
Hey, Higgins?

954
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:26,520
Yeah, I'm right here.

955
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,440
Who is Leonard Atwood?

956
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:39,900
Where are you, Higgins?

957
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:47,000
Ain't we pals anymore?

958
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:51,680
- Something?
- Major?

959
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:54,540
- Got him.
- Let me see that.

960
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,840
What's he doing in Brooklyn?

961
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,599
Condor.

962
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,100
- We can get a unit--
- Wait.

963
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:14,519
- What's going on, Major?
- Son of bitch wired together 50 phones.

964
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:15,539
What?

965
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,060
Everybody in Brooklyn's
talking to each other.

966
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,019
I didn't know you smoked.

967
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,960
I... quit three years ago.

968
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:44,240
- You're so pale.
- It's the light in here.

969
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:51,259
What are you gonna do there?

970
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,199
- See a guy.
- More secrets.

971
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:56,620
Like those pictures you hide.

972
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,399
Yes.

973
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,820
Someday, I...
I'd like to show them to you.

974
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,900
If you live through this.

975
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:10,660
You could drive me to Washington.

976
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,480
No, I couldn't.

977
01:33:23,048 --> 01:33:25,780
You have a lot of
very fine qualities.

978
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,859
But--

979
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,961
What fine qualities?

980
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,320
You have good eyes.

981
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,139
Not kind, but...

982
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:49,040
they don't lie, and they
don't look away much.

983
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,760
And they don't miss anything.

984
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,080
I could use eyes like that.

985
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:59,580
But you're overdue in Vermont.

986
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,180
Is he a tough guy?

987
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:11,000
He's pretty tough.

988
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:14,860
What will he do?

989
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,600
Understand, probably.

990
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:20,955
Boy...

991
01:34:21,256 --> 01:34:22,921
That is tough.

992
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:35,640
Kathy, I need time.

993
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,943
Eight hours or so, that's all.
Just till noon.

994
01:34:38,044 --> 01:34:39,900
To do what I have to do.

995
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:43,380
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

996
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:47,480
Are you going
right to Vermont?

997
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,300
Yes.

998
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,640
What I mean is don't...

999
01:34:52,841 --> 01:34:54,801
call anyone.

1000
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,940
Don't stop, please.

1001
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:01,620
Don't tell anyone about...

1002
01:35:10,157 --> 01:35:11,620
Jesus.

1003
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,919
Jesus.

1004
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,679
I-- I didn't--

1005
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:17,820
<i>All aboard!</i>

1006
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:20,180
Hey.

1007
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,320
You take care of yourself.

1008
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,500
I'll do my best.

1009
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,840
Do your best.

1010
01:35:37,551 --> 01:35:41,400
- Why aren't you further along, Mr. Higgins?
- You mean with the company, sir?

1011
01:35:41,501 --> 01:35:44,301
You seem perfect for it.

1012
01:35:46,223 --> 01:35:49,304
Are you perfect for it, Mr. Higgins?

1013
01:35:50,196 --> 01:35:52,276
I have tried to be, sir.

1014
01:35:52,385 --> 01:35:55,223
- You were recruited out of school?
- No sir.

1015
01:35:55,324 --> 01:35:58,094
Company interviewed
a few of us in Korea.

1016
01:35:58,295 --> 01:36:01,517
You served with Colonel Donovan,
in the OSS, didn't you sir?

1017
01:36:01,618 --> 01:36:05,985
I sailed the Adriatic with
a movie star at the helm.

1018
01:36:06,901 --> 01:36:10,611
Does't seem like much of
a war now, but... it was.

1019
01:36:11,809 --> 01:36:14,276
I go even further back than that.

1020
01:36:14,377 --> 01:36:18,777
10 years after the Great War,
as we used to call it,

1021
01:36:19,078 --> 01:36:21,671
before we knew enough
to number them.

1022
01:36:22,442 --> 01:36:24,263
You miss that kind of action, sir?

1023
01:36:24,364 --> 01:36:26,055
No.

1024
01:36:26,756 --> 01:36:29,626
I miss that kind of clarity.

1025
01:36:33,237 --> 01:36:34,780
Yes?

1026
01:36:36,481 --> 01:36:38,066
Thank you.

1027
01:36:39,582 --> 01:36:41,658
He's being held at New York Center.

1028
01:36:48,293 --> 01:36:52,205
Mr. Higgins, you do understand
the company's position?

1029
01:36:54,206 --> 01:36:58,088
It's nothing in the way of your...
doing this, is there?

1030
01:37:38,587 --> 01:37:40,130
What is this?

1031
01:37:40,231 --> 01:37:41,943
What's going on?

1032
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:01,360
Who are you?

1033
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:12,040
Who are you?

1034
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:14,560
What are you doing here?

1035
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:17,820
I'm Condor.

1036
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:22,940
Sit down.

1037
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:26,439
What do you do for a living?

1038
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:28,800
Don't be ridiculous.

1039
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,320
What do you do...

1040
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,400
exactly?

1041
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:38,540
Deputy Director of Operations.

1042
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,352
What section?

1043
01:38:42,453 --> 01:38:44,201
Middle East.

1044
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,080
What are you working on?

1045
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:52,360
What are you doing?

1046
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:57,819
What's the secret worth murdering
everybody at the ALHS house?

1047
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,339
- There's no secret.
- Wicks showed you my report.

1048
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:03,280
What report? Yes.

1049
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,440
It was your network I turned up.

1050
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:15,119
Doing what?

1051
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:17,620
Doing what?

1052
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:21,939
What does operations care
about a bunch of goddamn books?

1053
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,479
A book in Dutch.

1054
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,760
A book out of Venezuela.

1055
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,619
- Mystery stories in Arabic.
- Wait.

1056
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:31,520
What the hell
is so important about--

1057
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,980
Oil fields.

1058
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:44,460
Oil.

1059
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,800
That's it, isn't it?

1060
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,540
This whole damn thing
was about oil.

1061
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:08,880
Wasn't it? Wasn't it?

1062
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:12,580
Yes, it was.

1063
01:40:13,260 --> 01:40:15,200
Don't turn for a moment.

1064
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:18,620
Put your thumb in front
of the hammer.

1065
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:25,680
Release it slowly.

1066
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:31,540
Set down the gun
on the desk.

1067
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,840
And don't move.

1068
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,480
Back up.

1069
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:59,940
You were quite good,
Condor, until this.

1070
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:05,140
This move was predictable.

1071
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,560
Hey!

1072
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,390
What?

1073
01:41:31,591 --> 01:41:33,141
What?

1074
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:36,220
Did you touch anything
except the chair?

1075
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:39,660
You're working for
the company again.

1076
01:41:40,276 --> 01:41:41,624
The desk?

1077
01:41:41,725 --> 01:41:43,260
The lamp?

1078
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:47,020
Jesus. They took you back.

1079
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:50,820
Just for this. For Atwood.

1080
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:55,880
How-- Wha--
He's with the company. Why?

1081
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:58,259
I don't interest myself in why.

1082
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,680
I think more often
in terms of when.

1083
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:02,556
Sometimes where.

1084
01:42:02,657 --> 01:42:04,741
Always how much.

1085
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:08,620
I suspect he was about to
become an embarrassment.

1086
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:12,220
As you are.

1087
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,697
So you're not finished.

1088
01:42:20,898 --> 01:42:21,859
Pardon?

1089
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:25,499
Oh, no. I have no arrangement
with the company concerning you.

1090
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:29,220
They didn't know you'd be here.
I knew you'd be here.

1091
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,040
But didn't you send
the mailman?

1092
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:39,339
That was a business arrangement
with Atwood.

1093
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:41,380
But you see.

1094
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,300
Come on.

1095
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:58,280
Come.

1096
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,320
Tell me about the girl.

1097
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,520
What about the girl?

1098
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:41,540
She was chosen... how?

1099
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:43,699
By age?

1100
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,207
Her car?

1101
01:43:45,308 --> 01:43:46,239
Appearance?

1102
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:48,347
At random.

1103
01:43:48,948 --> 01:43:50,179
Chance.

1104
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,120
Really.

1105
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,840
Can I drop you?

1106
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:04,940
I'd like to go back to New York.

1107
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:09,460
You have not much future there.

1108
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:17,140
It will happen this way.

1109
01:44:18,060 --> 01:44:20,260
You may be walking.

1110
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:24,880
Maybe the first sunny day
of the spring,

1111
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:28,219
and a car will slow beside you,

1112
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:29,739
and the door will open,

1113
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:33,219
and someone you know,
maybe even trust,

1114
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,800
will get out of the car.

1115
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:40,460
And he will smile,
a becoming smile.

1116
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:45,580
But he will leave open
the door of the car.

1117
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:49,520
And offer to give you a lift.

1118
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:57,820
You seem to understand
it all so well.

1119
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,640
What would you suggest?

1120
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:04,959
Personally, I prefer Europe.

1121
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:07,660
- Europe?
- Yes.

1122
01:45:08,140 --> 01:45:10,059
Well, the fact is,

1123
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:13,339
what I do is not
a bad occupation.

1124
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:15,720
Someone is always
willing to pay.

1125
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:22,460
I would find it...

1126
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,459
tiring.

1127
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,120
Oh, no. It's quite restful.
It's almost peaceful.

1128
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:32,299
No need to believe
in either side or any side.

1129
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:34,479
There is no cause.

1130
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:36,500
There's only yourself.

1131
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,860
The belief is in
your own precision.

1132
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:48,480
I was born in the United States,
Joubert.

1133
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:53,020
I miss it when
I'm away too long.

1134
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,440
A pity.

1135
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,480
I don't think so.

1136
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,999
Is it any trouble to drop me
at the Union Station?

1137
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,583
Oh, no.

1138
01:46:06,684 --> 01:46:08,861
It would be my pleasure.

1139
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,480
For that day.

1140
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,240
Higgins!

1141
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:44,500
Higgins!

1142
01:47:00,380 --> 01:47:02,839
Turner! Why'd you call so late?
We were worried about you.

1143
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:04,699
Likewise. The car for me?

1144
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,879
Yeah, it's all right. It's safe.
You have a few hours of debriefing.

1145
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:10,260
- Hey, Higgins?
- Yeah?

1146
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:12,874
Let's say...

1147
01:47:12,975 --> 01:47:17,559
for the purposes of argument,
I had a .45 in one of my pockets.

1148
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:21,880
And I wanted you to take a walk
with me. You'd do it, right?

1149
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:24,999
Which way?

1150
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,171
West.

1151
01:47:27,372 --> 01:47:28,699
And slowly.

1152
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,060
Stay in front of me
about three or four steps.

1153
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:41,500
Where are we going?

1154
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,560
Wave them on ahead.

1155
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:57,080
Do we have plans
to invade the Middle East?

1156
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:59,819
- Are you crazy?
- Am I?

1157
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:01,579
- Look, Turner--
- Do we have plans?

1158
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:04,199
No. Absolutely not.

1159
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,939
We have games. That's all.

1160
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,439
We play games, what if.

1161
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:12,519
How many men?
What would it take?

1162
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:15,359
Is there a cheaper way
to destabilize a regime?

1163
01:48:15,460 --> 01:48:17,349
That's what we're paid to do.

1164
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:19,039
Walk on.

1165
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:21,080
Go on.

1166
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:27,039
So Atwood just took
the games too seriously.

1167
01:48:27,140 --> 01:48:29,721
He was really going to
do it, wasn't he?

1168
01:48:29,922 --> 01:48:31,979
A renegade operation.

1169
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:34,339
Atwood knew 54/12 would
never authorize it,

1170
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:36,339
there was no way, not with
the heat on the company.

1171
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:37,739
What if there hadn't
been any heat?

1172
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:40,640
Supposing I hadn't stumbled
on their plan, say nobody had.

1173
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,259
Different ballgame.

1174
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:47,239
Fact is, there was nothing
wrong with the plan.

1175
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:50,540
The plan was all right.
The plan would've worked.

1176
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:54,239
Boy, what is it
with you people?

1177
01:48:54,340 --> 01:48:57,879
Do you think not getting caught in a lie
is the same thing as telling the truth?

1178
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:00,639
No. It's simple economics.

1179
01:49:00,740 --> 01:49:02,459
Today it's oil, right?

1180
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:07,179
In 10 or 15 years, food, plutonium,
and maybe even sooner.

1181
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,680
Now, what do you think the people
are going to want us to do then?

1182
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:12,739
Ask them.

1183
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:16,279
Not now. Then. Ask them
when they're running out.

1184
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:18,959
Ask them when there's no heat
in their homes, and they're cold.

1185
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:20,879
Ask them when
their engines stop.

1186
01:49:20,980 --> 01:49:24,219
Ask them when people who've never
known hunger start going hungry.

1187
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,669
You want to know something?

1188
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:28,841
They won't want us to ask them.
They'll want us to get it for them.

1189
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:32,220
Boy...

1190
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,800
have you found a home.

1191
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:38,239
Seven people killed, Higgins.

1192
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:40,999
- The company didn't order it.
- Atwood did.

1193
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:43,151
Atwood did.

1194
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:46,156
And who the hell is Atwood?
He's you. He's all you guys.

1195
01:49:46,257 --> 01:49:48,294
Seven people killed!

1196
01:49:48,495 --> 01:49:52,172
- And you play fucking games!
- Right.

1197
01:49:52,273 --> 01:49:54,440
And the other side does, too.

1198
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:57,320
That's why we can't
let you stay outside.

1199
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:01,440
Well, go on home, Higgins.
Go on. They've got it.

1200
01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:03,519
- What?
- You know where we are.

1201
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:07,180
Just look around. They've got it.
That's where they ship from.

1202
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,300
They've got all of it.

1203
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:20,759
What? What did you do?

1204
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:22,619
I told them a story.

1205
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:26,680
You play games,
I told them a story.

1206
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:36,180
Oh, you--

1207
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:39,260
You poor, dumb son of a bitch.

1208
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:42,620
You done more damage
than you know.

1209
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:46,220
I hope so.

1210
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:56,080
You're about to be
a very lonely man.

1211
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,579
It didn't have to end this way.

1212
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:03,760
Of course it did.

1213
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:07,540
Hey, Turner.

1214
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,800
How do you know
they'll print it?

1215
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:15,180
You can take a walk,

1216
01:51:15,660 --> 01:51:18,239
but how far if they
don't print it?

1217
01:51:18,340 --> 01:51:20,240
They'll print it.

1218
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,500
How do you know?
