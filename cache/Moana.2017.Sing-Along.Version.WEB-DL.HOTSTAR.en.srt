Te Fiti.

5
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:06,902
Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.

6
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:10,030
It could create life itself.

7

And Te Fiti shared it with the world.

some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

They believed
if they could possess it...

11

the great power of creation
would be theirs.

the most daring of them all...

14

voyaged across the vast ocean
to take it.

15
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:43,731
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.

16
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,775
He was a warrior.

17
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:49,278
A trickster.

18
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:53,949
A shapeshifter who
could change form...

19
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:57,745
with the power of his magical fish hook.

20
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,081
And his name...

21
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:04,126
was Maui.

Te Fiti began to crumble...

giving birth to a terrible darkness.

26
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:41,080
Maui tried to escape...

Te Kā!

29

A demon of earth and fire.

30
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:02,810
Maui was struck from the sky...

31

never to be seen again.

32
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,652
And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...

33
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,613
were lost to the sea.

34
00:03:15,322 --> 00:03:16,949
Where, even now...

1,000 years later...

Te Kā and the demons of the deep...

37

still hunt for the heart.

38

Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...

39

chasing away our fish...

40

00:47:38,944 --> 00:47:40,612
There! Right there!

502
00:47:40,779 --> 00:47:41,780
You're turning?

503
00:47:41,947 --> 00:47:43,073
What are you doing?

504
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,366
Escaping!

505
00:47:44,658 --> 00:47:45,659
The heart!

506
00:47:45,993 --> 00:47:47,661
Forget it! You'll never get it back!

507
00:47:47,828 --> 00:47:49,830
Besides, you got a better one.

508

Hey!

509
00:47:50,998 --> 00:47:51,999
What am I gonna steer with?

510
00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:54,877
They're just gonna kill ya!

511
00:47:59,173 --> 00:48:00,299
Coconuts.

512
00:48:43,175 --> 00:48:44,385
Got it!

513
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:49,139
Hey!

514
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:06,156
MOANA: Yeah!

515
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:08,242
We did it!

516
00:49:09,743 --> 00:49:11,745
Congratulations
on not being dead, girlie.

517
00:49:12,037 --> 00:49:13,247
You surprise me.

518
00:49:13,705 --> 00:49:15,666
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

519
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:20,212
You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta
go through a whole ocean of bad.

520
00:49:20,504 --> 00:49:21,714
Not to mention Te Kā.

521
00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:24,633
Lava monster?

522
00:49:25,092 --> 00:49:26,760
Ever defeat a lava monster?

523
00:49:27,428 --> 00:49:29,680
No. Have you?

524
00:49:37,187 --> 00:49:40,399
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

525
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:43,777
You can't restore the heart without me...

526
00:49:43,944 --> 00:49:45,696
and me says no.

527
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,115
I'm getting my hook.

528

That's what you're all about, right?

531
00:50:03,714 --> 00:50:06,550
Little girl, I am a hero.

532
00:50:06,717 --> 00:50:08,135
Maybe you were.

533
00:50:08,302 --> 00:50:09,470
But now...

534
00:50:09,636 --> 00:50:12,556
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

535
00:50:12,723 --> 00:50:14,975
The guy who cursed the world.

536
00:50:16,435 --> 00:50:17,770
You're no one's hero.

537

(SCOFFS) No one?

538
00:50:28,781 --> 00:50:29,782
But...

539
00:50:30,407 --> 00:50:31,950
put this back...

540
00:50:32,117 --> 00:50:33,869
save the world...

541
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:35,996
you'd be everyone's hero.

542
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:43,837
Maui! Maui! Maui!

543
00:50:44,505 --> 00:50:46,173
You're so amazing!

544
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:49,510
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Kā.

545
00:50:49,676 --> 00:50:50,761
Then we get your hook.

546
00:50:51,095 --> 00:50:54,640
We get your hook, take out Te Kā,
restore the heart.

547
00:50:54,807 --> 00:50:57,434
Unless you don't wanna be...

548
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:00,687
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

549
00:51:00,854 --> 00:51:02,398
Hero to...

550
00:51:02,815 --> 00:51:03,982

551

Then save the world.

553

Deal?

554
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:13,200
Deal.

555
00:51:17,538 --> 00:51:18,622
Worth a shot.

556
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,458
Okay, we go east.

557
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:23,794
To the lair of Tamatoa.

558
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:29,425
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

559
00:51:41,895 --> 00:51:43,313
Teach me to sail.

560
00:51:45,691 --> 00:51:48,986
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

561
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:50,154
I should...

562
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:53,407
I should be sailing.

563
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:55,576
It's called wayfinding, princess.

564
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:58,162
And it's not just sails and knots...

565
00:51:58,495 --> 00:52:00,914
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

566
00:52:01,248 --> 00:52:03,167
Knowing where you are...

567
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,918
by knowing where you've been.

568
00:52:05,085 --> 00:52:07,421
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

569
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:09,048
I am the daughter of the chief.

570
00:52:09,214 --> 00:52:10,382
- Same difference.
- No.

571

and you have an animal sidekick...

572

why your people decided to send...

back to Te Fiti itself?

669
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,366
Go!

670
00:57:48,303 --> 00:57:51,098
And he sticks the landing.

00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:52,391
Huh?

672
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:55,769
What? Dum-dum, she's not even here.

into the realm of...

Huh?

Well, she's dead.

676
00:58:06,447 --> 00:58:08,282
Okay, let's get my hook.

677
00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:20,544

Maui's fishhook!

00:59:11,637 --> 00:59:13,013
Yeah! (GROANS)

683
00:59:13,097 --> 00:59:14,598
(GASPS) Sorry!

684
00:59:14,723 --> 00:59:16,058
I thought you were a monster...

685
00:59:16,141 --> 00:59:17,184
But I found your hook.

686
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:19,728
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy
really likes his treasure.

Stay.

What? No. I'm the one who found...

00:59:23,524 --> 00:59:24,983
Listen. For a thousand years...

690
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,361
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky...

691
00:59:27,528 --> 00:59:28,529
getting my hook...

692
00:59:28,695 --> 00:59:30,322
and being awesome again.

inside of a monster cave, except...

Except...

00:59:40,165 --> 00:59:41,375
maybe as bait.

00:59:43,335 --> 00:59:44,503
Wow!

699
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:46,714
The shiny, glittery cave.

00:59:48,382 --> 00:59:51,009
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.

Oh, when he shows up,
keep him distracted.

'cause she was absolutely humongous.

'Cause you're amazing!

And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!

But you also almost died.

We're dead soon

Can you at least try?

Giant hawk.

Hey, it's okay, it's okay
We're dead soon

All right, break time's over.

Get up.

Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

Tell me I can beat Te Kā
'cause I'm "Maui?"

Take a hike, Tiny.

They show up. When I earn them.

810
01:07:39,353 --> 01:07:42,189
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

811
01:07:42,356 --> 01:07:45,692
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

812
01:07:45,859 --> 01:07:46,944
What's Nunya?

813
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:48,445
Nunya business.

814
01:07:49,988 --> 01:07:51,407
I'll just keep asking.

815
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,701
What's it for?

816
01:07:55,369 --> 01:07:57,454
You need to stop doing that.

817
01:08:02,042 --> 01:08:03,877
- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is.

818
01:08:04,044 --> 01:08:05,462
I said back off.

819
01:08:05,629 --> 01:08:07,297
Is it why your hook's not working?

820
01:08:23,355 --> 01:08:26,066
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

821
01:08:26,525 --> 01:08:28,485
You wanna throw me off the boat...

822
01:08:28,902 --> 01:08:30,571
throw me off.

823
01:08:30,738 --> 01:08:34,074
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

01:08:34,575 --> 01:08:36,243
I know I don't.

01:08:37,161 --> 01:08:40,372
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

You're right.

827
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:46,837
But my island is dying...

828
01:08:47,671 --> 01:08:50,716
so I am here.

829
01:08:51,341 --> 01:08:53,761
It's just me and you.

830
01:08:53,927 --> 01:08:56,597
And I want to help...

831
01:08:56,764 --> 01:09:01,060
but I can't if you don't let me.

01:09:14,114 --> 01:09:18,118
They took one look and decided...

836
01:09:18,285 --> 01:09:20,704
they did not want me.

837
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,165
They threw me into the sea...

838
01:09:23,624 --> 01:09:26,794
like I was nothing.

839
01:09:28,295 --> 01:09:31,799
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

840
01:09:31,965 --> 01:09:33,592
They gave me the hook.

841
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:35,386
They made me...

842
01:09:36,261 --> 01:09:37,262
Maui.

843
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:41,308
And back to the humans I went.

844
01:09:41,725 --> 01:09:45,646
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

845
01:09:46,647 --> 01:09:48,899
Anything they could ever want.

846
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:51,944
You took the heart for them.

847
01:09:52,653 --> 01:09:55,489
You did everything for them.

848
01:09:56,323 --> 01:09:58,158
So they'd love you.

849
01:09:58,742 --> 01:10:01,954
It was never enough.

850
01:10:10,003 --> 01:10:13,340
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

851
01:10:13,507 --> 01:10:16,677
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

852
01:10:16,844 --> 01:10:20,931
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

853
01:10:22,182 --> 01:10:25,811
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

860
01:13:03,093 --> 01:13:04,094
What?

861
01:13:04,261 --> 01:13:05,804
I figured it out.

862
01:13:07,097 --> 01:13:10,851
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

863
01:13:11,018 --> 01:13:14,772
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

864
01:13:15,481 --> 01:13:18,400
All those new lands, new villages.

865
01:13:18,776 --> 01:13:21,236
It was the water that connected 'em all.

866
01:13:21,612 --> 01:13:23,280
And if I were the ocean...

867
01:13:23,447 --> 01:13:27,534
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

868

That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

870
01:13:35,709 --> 01:13:37,878

for Te Fiti.

You know, it'd be rude to refuse
a gift from a goddess.

You could come with us, you know.

I may have gone

If my name was Sebastian

you'd totally help me.

You would. You know you would.
