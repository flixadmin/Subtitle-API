1
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:10,355
Nice ride.

2
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,993
It does the job.

3
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:15,889
What job, delivering pizzas?

4
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:20,296
Well, it's not the ride,
it's the rider.

5
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:26,106
What the hell was that?

6
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:27,233
What?

7
00:03:27,443 --> 00:03:29,843
Hey! You talking to my girl?

8
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,174
Oh, shit. Here we go. Yeah.

9
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:35,274
She was just admiring my ride.

10
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:36,576
"My ride."

11
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:38,244
My grandma's Buick could smoke ...

12
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,254
that piece of shit, trailer trash.

13
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:43,051
Well, what about your daddy's Viper?

14
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:45,926
This beast's got 500 horsepower ...

15
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,121
and a Borla exhaust system.

16
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:49,061
It does 0 to 60
in like 4.3 seconds ...

17
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:51,099
That's about right.
That's about right. Yeah.

18
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,498
Wow. You can read the brochure.

19
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,792
What a pitch, baby.
What a pitch. I like that.

20
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:21,953
What's he gonna do?

21
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,965
- Let's make it happen.
- Bring it.

22
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:36,907
I got your ...
I got your back.

23
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:41,476
Why don't you nice boys
let your cars do the talking?

24
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:45,478
I only race for pink slips.

25
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:48,285
This car goes for 80 grand.

26
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:51,451
What would I do with a broken-ass
piece of shit like that?

27
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,421
How about me?

28
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:04,532
Winner gets me.

29
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:14,377
Cut it, let's cut it.
Let's go, go, go, go!

30
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:30,995
Blast-off, baby!

31
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:35,761
First one out the other side ...

32
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,963
It's time. Let's go!

33
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,441
Ready, boys? 
Make it interesting, Clay.

34
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,613
Shit!

35
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,293
Yeah!

36
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:50,898
I thought you loved me.

37
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:00,409
Oh, well.

38
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,649
What the hell?

39
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:24,836
Guess I got a new date for prom.

40
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,911
Clay, stop the car! Shut up!

41
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:46,883
Clay, stop the car!

42
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:47,986
Shut up!

43
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:49,291
Stop it!

44
00:08:53,735 --> 00:08:55,930
Clay, please stop! Please stop!

45
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:09,100
Can I get a copy of that?

46
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,409
You think this is a joke, huh?

47
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,679
You see Ken and Barbie over there?

48
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:19,619
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

49
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:22,122
Mommy and Daddy are too hooked up.

50
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:27,156
But I like screw-ups like you.

51
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:28,662
You know why?

52
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,528
'Cause you're 100%
guaranteed conviction.

53
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,630
- Where's my car?
- I crushed it.

54
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:34,828
You did what?

55
00:10:34,903 --> 00:10:36,063
- Sit down! You're done.
- Easy, easy.

56
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:37,537
You're done. 
You understand me? You're done.

57
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:40,439
And all before your eighteenth
birthday. Now sit down.

58
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:43,804
Sean.

59
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:47,411
What the hell were
you thinkin', huh?

60
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,343
Mrs. Boswell? Please.

61
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,685
It's, uh, it's Miss.

62
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:00,690
Officer, is it, um,
illegal to smoke in here?

63
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:10,329
It's a tough state.

64
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:12,565
And it's a pretty clear-cut case.

65
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:16,438
He'll be lucky if they don't
try him as an adult.

66
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:21,315
This is our third town
in two years.

67
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:24,510
Your son's got two priors
for reckless driving,

68
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:26,577
wilful destruction of property.

69
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,623
This makes it strike three.

70
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,318
They're definitely gonna want
to get him off the streets.

71
00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:34,226
Well, there's
just got to be another way.

72
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:45,472
So, where are we moving this time?

73
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:50,136
We are not moving anywhere.

74
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,452
Sean.

75
00:13:47,395 --> 00:13:49,386
I thought you were
gonna be here on the 7th.

76
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:51,091
Today is the 7th.

77
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,025
Well, look,
just hold on one second.

78
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:22,728
Come on in.

79
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:29,134
This is it.

80
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:38,872
You know, Sean, I was,
I was gonna be there.

81
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:42,006
But your mom,
she said the 7th, see,

82
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,711
and we're a day
ahead of you in Japan.

83
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:49,918
Well, you're here now,
and that's good.

84
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:53,620
So, how is your mom?

85
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:57,291
Where do I sleep?

86
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:00,329
Now, Sean, you know
she had no other choice.

87
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:03,132
I mean, it was
either this or juvie hall,

88
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,970
I mean, you just
can't keep moving away ...

89
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,009
every time you get into trouble.

90
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:10,000
Worked for you.

91
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:15,813
Look, neither of us asked for this.

92
00:15:16,418 --> 00:15:19,353
But I promised your mom
I'd take care of you.

93
00:15:19,754 --> 00:15:22,814
So you just go by the
rules her and I agreed to,

94
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:24,825
and I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

95
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,454
Rules?

96
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:29,122
Yeah, rules. Real simple.

97
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,131
You go to school,

98
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,860
you come back here right after.

99
00:15:33,168 --> 00:15:34,795
And I don't want to see or hear

100
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:36,734
about you anywhere near a car.

101
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:41,270
Here, the bedroom is yours.

102
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:49,107
Make yourself comfortable.

103
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:53,213
Lights out in 10.

104
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:54,773
You got to be kiddin'.

105
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,573
Wrong train.

106
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:55,542
I'm new here.

107
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:02,345
Boswell, yes, ma'am.

108
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:05,409
Japanese food is like the Army.

109
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:07,912
Don't ask, don't tell.

110
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:10,482
Name's Twinkie.

111
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:12,576
Hey, I noticed
you ain't have a laptop.

112
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:15,615
Yeah?

113
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:18,354
I'll hook you up. Half price.

114
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:20,892
No, I'm cool.

115
00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:22,452
60% off. Hmm?

116
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,589
Since we're both army
brats and everything.

117
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,191
I ain't got no cash, man.

118
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:29,099
And I ain't an army brat.

119
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,535
All right, all right.

120
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:32,197
Well, what about
a cell phone, huh?

121
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:35,369
Everybody needs a cell phone.

122
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:37,008
No offense,

123
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:38,607
but I'm probably
not gonna be here ...

124
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,511
long enough to remember your name.

125
00:19:41,182 --> 00:19:44,618
Then you gonna need some new
shoes to book town with, man.

126
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:46,153
You like Michael Jordan?

127
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:47,754
I love Michael Jordan.

128
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,547
Check this out.

129
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,383
Brand new Jordans.
Not even out yet.

130
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:56,692
LeBron James couldn't even
get his hands on those.

131
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:00,891
You selling that
Sparco steering wheel?

132
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:03,403
Hell, no.
That's mine right there.

133
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:06,003
Man, I even paid
retail for it.

134
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:07,900
What you drive?

135
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:09,637
- My ride?
- Yeah.

136
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:11,338
My ride's one of a kind.

137
00:20:11,412 --> 00:20:12,572
Show me.

138
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:15,739
Thought you
weren't stickin' around.

139
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:17,778
All right.

140
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,835
Slamming, huh? Look at that car.

141
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:16,607
At least let me drive.

142
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:19,144
Y'all better have some
real cars around here.

143
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:21,272
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh?

144
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:22,907
Well, all right.

145
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:24,918
I don't know if you're
ready for them, though.

146
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:27,011
You look a little nervous.

147
00:21:27,555 --> 00:21:29,079
What up, Tosh?

148
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:05,956
For when you
blow your wad, man.

149
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:04,677
Hear that?

150
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,583
It's still not right
for the way I drive.

151
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:11,858
I don't need a computer to tell
me about my throttle response.

152
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:14,326
Okay. Then we're done here.

153
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:19,796
You wouldn't have
that problem with a V8.

154
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:21,898
Boys.

155
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:25,302
All they care about is
who's got the biggest engine.

156
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,070
I'm a guy. It's in my DNA.

157
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:31,240
So y'all race with these things, 
huh?

158
00:23:31,913 --> 00:23:33,676
Cute little toys.

159
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:38,047
You know, I almost didn't recognize
you without your slippers on.

160
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,019
Don't you mean Uwabaki?

161
00:23:41,222 --> 00:23:42,689
Neela, right?

162
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,358
You're a quick learner.

163
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:49,858
So, where you from, anyway?

164
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:51,057
Here.

165
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:53,193
No, I mean, not where you live.

166
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,894
Where'd you come from?

167
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:57,062
Does it really matter
where I'm from?

168
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:06,540
Who's the tourist?

169
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,482
What's with you
and the schoolgirls, D?

170
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:13,042
You're moving up in the world.

171
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,781
You gotta elevate your company.

172
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:16,517
Wednesday, Wednesday,
meet Thursday.

173
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:18,058
God. Girl.

174
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,059
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?

175
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,723
All right, beautiful. Hold up.

176
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,789
Hey!

177
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:29,468
He was just leaving.

178
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,475
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Japanese.

179
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:42,983
Understand that? Gaijin?

180
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,278
Takashi.

181
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,377
We were just talking.

182
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:48,319
This isn't your scene.

183
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,286
That word you called me,
gaijin or something or other,

184
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:56,022
what does that mean exactly?

185
00:24:56,898 --> 00:24:59,458
Means, turn around,

186
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:01,762
keep walking.

187
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,167
That's exactly what we gonna do.

188
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:04,329
Come on, man, let's roll.

189
00:25:04,405 --> 00:25:05,872
Yo, look, man, he's Yakuza.

190
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,909
Now, see, that's funny,

191
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:12,036
'cause I thought this
was, like, a free country

192
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,815
where a girl could talk
to whoever she wants.

193
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,820
You know who I am, boy?

194
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:25,353
Yeah. You're like the Justin
Timberlake of Japan, right?

195
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:32,358
Leave.

196
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,661
Damn, man.
You know Yakuza? The Mafia?

197
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:39,429
Look, sorry, DK - san.

198
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:41,475
Monkey didn't have
his banana today.

199
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,338
Hey, D, let's go.

200
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:44,776
It's time to race.

201
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,781
Hey, good luck, Timberlake.

202
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,319
You're the one that's lucky,
'cause I'm about to race.

203
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,892
Then let's race.

204
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:13,731
With what, huh? Your skateboard?

205
00:26:15,977 --> 00:26:18,775
Easy to sound cocky
when you got no ride.

206
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:20,778
Take mine.

207
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,250
Let's race.

208
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,885
What? I wanna see
what the kid's got.

209
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,157
Can he drive?

210
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,736
Can he drive?

211
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,867
You know what DK stands for?

212
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:50,242
Donkey Kong?

213
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:52,043
Drift King.

214
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:54,841
Drift?

215
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:57,784
What do you mean, drift?

216
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:11,988
Still need a dictionary?

217
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:14,560
You know that
real famous painting?

218
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:17,035
The one of the woman
who's smiling all the time?

219
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:18,093
The Mona Lisa.

220
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:19,298
Right, right, right.
Mona Lisa.

221
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:20,965
Well, look, man,
this car right here's ...

222
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:22,669
like the Mona Lisa
of the drift world.

223
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:25,573
Han rebuilt this bad boy
from ground up.

224
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:27,113
We talking forged pistons,

225
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:30,446
bigger turbo,
new rods, new crankshaft.

226
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:34,484
Hey, man, Han's labor
ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

227
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:38,788
Well, if I needed a 30-second
lesson on how to drift ...

228
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,350
All right, look, man, there's lots
of ways you can do this, all right?

229
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:42,521
Hand braking is the easiest,

230
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:43,654
so the first thing
I want you to do,

231
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:44,959
I want you to rip that e-brake.

232
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:46,158
All right,
after you rip the e-brake,

233
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,030
then I want you to power over.

234
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:51,031
You know what?

235
00:27:51,105 --> 00:27:52,629
Just don't mess up Mona,
all right?

236
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:54,438
All right.

237
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,555
Ready.

238
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:52,056
Set.

239
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:55,993
Go!

240
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,142
I told you.

241
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:20,212
Damn it!

242
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:08,161
Damn it!

243
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:51,430
Don't leave town.

244
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:09,281
Do you know what time it is?

245
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:11,618
I thought it was around 7:00.

246
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,988
You know,
US is a few hours behind.

247
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:20,833
Looks like the party
was better here, anyway.

248
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:25,797
Have you been racing, Sean?

249
00:33:29,877 --> 00:33:31,606
You're out of here.

250
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:36,377
Go ahead.

251
00:33:37,985 --> 00:33:39,680
You don't get it, do you?

252
00:33:39,753 --> 00:33:41,880
You have nowhere else to go.

253
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,620
If it doesn't work out here,

254
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,715
you're going to jail.
Do you get that?

255
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:50,663
This isn't a game.

256
00:33:51,165 --> 00:33:53,360
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

257
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:55,095
if you're gonna 
live under my roof,

258
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:58,070
you're gonna go by
my rules or get out.

259
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:00,237
Understand?

260
00:34:01,408 --> 00:34:02,966
Understand?

261
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,139
Yes, sir.

262
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:57,024
Get in.

263
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,632
I'll get you your money.

264
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,863
Why you talking
like you have a choice?

265
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:18,109
There's a guy in there
with a paw ...

266
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:19,982
that owes me some money.

267
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:21,213
A paw?

268
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:24,519
Go get me my money.

269
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:28,692
Okay.

270
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:24,848
Han said,

271
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,987
okane.

272
00:36:36,096 --> 00:36:38,587
Han said, okane.

273
00:37:07,527 --> 00:37:08,824
Let's go.

274
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:19,863
You're in the pickup
and delivery business now.

275
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,534
I might call you once a week
or once an hour.

276
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:24,167
I don't care
if you're sick as a dog ...

277
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:25,939
or in bed with Beyoncé.

278
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:27,640
I call, you show.

279
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:30,580
Only if you teach me
how to drift.

280
00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:32,582
This ain't a negotiation.

281
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:34,783
I wasn't negotiating.

282
00:38:23,236 --> 00:38:25,067
What's he doing here?

283
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:27,163
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can ...

284
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,105
sitting in my garage.

285
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:31,041
Hope he's not driving.

286
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:35,341
Gaijin.

287
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,244
When is your next race?

288
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:40,046
I'd really like to be there.

289
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:43,054
Why not be in it?

290
00:38:48,228 --> 00:38:49,695
You heard me.

291
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,928
Ready to lose another car, Han?

292
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:56,530
I'm ready to take that
'86 Corolla off your hands.

293
00:38:58,438 --> 00:38:59,769
All right.

294
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:02,007
Put up the '72 Skyline.

295
00:39:03,143 --> 00:39:04,235
Done.

296
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:08,406
What do you think,
Morimoto, huh?

297
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:13,615
Get him out of here.

298
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:16,548
We have business to discuss.

299
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,431
Your shipment's late.

300
00:39:28,502 --> 00:39:31,630
Since when are you
so worried about the details?

301
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:35,998
When is
the shipment arriving, Han?

302
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:40,105
Just sit pretty
and let me handle it.

303
00:40:02,102 --> 00:40:03,763
Hey, Dad, it's me.

304
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,230
Uh, I had to stay after school ...

305
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:07,170
for some extracurricular activities.

306
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,171
So I'll be home a little later.

307
00:40:12,879 --> 00:40:13,937
Sir.

308
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:19,251
You really need to stop
following me around.

309
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:21,320
What are you doing here?

310
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,522
I thought I'd stop by
and ask your boyfriend ...

311
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,080
for some drifting lessons.

312
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:27,386
Trust me.

313
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:29,258
You don't wanna be
a part of this world.

314
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,659
It's good enough for you.

315
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:33,722
You don't know anything about me.

316
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,098
Well, why don't you think I know?

317
00:40:36,169 --> 00:40:38,569
'Cause I'm a gaijin? An outsider?

318
00:40:40,207 --> 00:40:41,674
Let me guess.

319
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,871
You're an army brat
who moved around a lot.

320
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:47,436
Your mama and daddy
was never home.

321
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:50,483
So you walked around
pissed off all the time.

322
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,883
And now you found your family
with these drift nuts.

323
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:59,388
Zero for one, cowboy.

324
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:13,163
Why can't you go find
a nice Japanese girl

325
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,901
like the rest of
the white guys around here?

326
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:23,145
Is everything okay back there?

327
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:25,509
I can handle DK.

328
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:28,351
I thought he's Yakuza.

329
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:30,751
His uncle's Yakuza.

330
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:35,227
He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.

331
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:39,656
But I need him.

332
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,597
He keeps Uncle Kamata
from poking around too much.

333
00:41:44,104 --> 00:41:45,765
What do you mean?

334
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:48,707
Well, his uncle gets
a piece of the action ...

335
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:50,402
from everyone on his turf.

336
00:41:50,477 --> 00:41:52,138
We're on his turf.

337
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,041
50% of something is better than

338
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:56,776
100% of nothing.

339
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,950
So have you raced DK?

340
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:03,815
Why not? Is he that good?

341
00:42:04,324 --> 00:42:06,417
What's the point of a race?

342
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,928
To see if I'm better
than the other guy.

343
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:12,021
Just proves you're faster,
that's all.

344
00:42:12,098 --> 00:42:13,565
If I were to race,
it would have to be ...

345
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:15,533
for something important.

346
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:17,593
Or why else do it at all?

347
00:42:19,906 --> 00:42:21,874
Why are you letting me race?

348
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:24,172
'Cause you're DK's kryptonite.

349
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,476
And you owe me a car.

350
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,262
Oh, shit.

351
00:42:58,778 --> 00:42:59,972
What the ...

352
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:02,640
Police cars here are
only factory-tuned.

353
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:04,206
You can do better than 180k,

354
00:43:04,284 --> 00:43:06,582
they can't catch you,
so they don't even try.

355
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:10,880
You know what?

356
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:12,822
I'm beginning to like
this country already.

357
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:29,968
Danny!

358
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,673
You're looking good.

359
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:37,009
Disco.

360
00:43:43,923 --> 00:43:45,185
We gotta catch up.

361
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:46,748
Get you a drink on me, huh?

362
00:43:46,826 --> 00:43:48,088
Let's go.

363
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:04,343
Aha. Easy now, ladies.

364
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:08,541
Come on.

365
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:14,684
What's up? How you doing?

366
00:44:14,754 --> 00:44:16,085
Hey, baby.

367
00:44:34,607 --> 00:44:36,302
Keep your hands off the kid, girls.

368
00:44:36,376 --> 00:44:37,866
He's underage.

369
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:41,844
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

370
00:44:42,215 --> 00:44:43,910
Disneyland for grownups, huh?

371
00:44:43,983 --> 00:44:45,416
All these girls, man,
they look like ...

372
00:44:45,485 --> 00:44:46,884
What, models?

373
00:44:46,953 --> 00:44:48,011
Check it out.

374
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:49,851
See,
Tokyo is the fashion capital ...

375
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:51,288
on this side of the planet,
all right?

376
00:44:51,357 --> 00:44:52,790
Now, imagine
you been posing all day.

377
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:54,258
I mean,
that's a lot of hard work.

378
00:44:54,327 --> 00:44:55,919
Not only do you get tired,
but, on top of that,

379
00:44:55,995 --> 00:44:57,485
you wanna have a little fun,
but you can't ...

380
00:44:57,564 --> 00:44:59,555
'cause you don't even know
nobody in town.

381
00:44:59,632 --> 00:45:01,065
And most of
the guys around here are ...

382
00:45:01,134 --> 00:45:02,863
too chicken shit
to even try picking up one.

383
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:04,597
So what do you do?

384
00:45:05,505 --> 00:45:08,702
Man, you talk to the little
dude who makes you laugh.

385
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:09,867
Yeah.

386
00:45:10,777 --> 00:45:12,904
Look, man, I don't just think
outside the box.

387
00:45:12,979 --> 00:45:14,503
I tear it up.

388
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:16,173
That's my thing.

389
00:45:16,316 --> 00:45:17,305
Yo.

390
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,482
Sean!

391
00:46:10,503 --> 00:46:12,232
The red Evo's yours.

392
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,877
What do you mean?

393
00:46:26,686 --> 00:46:28,313
You're representing me now.

394
00:46:28,388 --> 00:46:30,913
What you think, I'm gonna
let you roll in a Hyundai?

395
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:58,445
Oh, man.

396
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,979
Damn it.

397
00:47:10,597 --> 00:47:12,656
My mother,
she's blind in one eye ...

398
00:47:12,732 --> 00:47:14,563
and she can drift
better than that.

399
00:47:17,203 --> 00:47:19,296
Han, where did you find this guy?

400
00:47:20,506 --> 00:47:23,236
Will someone please teach
this guy how to drift?

401
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:48,457
Is that yours?

402
00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:50,731
Sure is.

403
00:47:58,311 --> 00:47:59,573
What happened?

404
00:48:00,847 --> 00:48:04,248
I don't know. I found
it this way at the base.

405
00:48:08,254 --> 00:48:09,721
It's got potential.

406
00:48:14,627 --> 00:48:16,959
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

407
00:48:21,734 --> 00:48:24,567
You know, Sean,
the Japanese have a saying.

408
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:30,175
"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered."

409
00:48:34,213 --> 00:48:36,010
You're gonna be late.

410
00:48:47,627 --> 00:48:48,787
Sean!

411
00:49:10,883 --> 00:49:12,680
Come on, man, you broke it.

412
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:18,982
Hey, whoa, whoa.

413
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:22,187
There must be a misunderstanding.

414
00:49:22,862 --> 00:49:26,025
Out of my way, or you're next.

415
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,157
Take it easy.

416
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:29,030
Look, man, I don't
do refunds, all right?

417
00:49:29,102 --> 00:49:31,400
Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!

418
00:49:31,704 --> 00:49:33,137
Touch me again ...

419
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:37,935
Here.

420
00:49:39,045 --> 00:49:41,070
Try not to break this one.

421
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:56,450
Say, man!

422
00:49:56,529 --> 00:49:58,087
What the hell is
wrong with you, huh?

423
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:00,997
Now everybody's gonna want
exchanges around here.

424
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:02,159
Damn!

425
00:50:14,747 --> 00:50:17,079
Not easy saving the day, is it?

426
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,751
Maybe you could give me
some pointers sometime.

427
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,481
You're doing all right.

428
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:24,783
Thanks.

429
00:50:28,294 --> 00:50:29,352
Hey.

430
00:50:30,563 --> 00:50:31,655
Yeah?

431
00:50:32,698 --> 00:50:34,825
Sorry about the other night.

432
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:37,767
Your life isn't any of my business.

433
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:40,737
It's okay.

434
00:51:03,062 --> 00:51:04,154
Foul!

435
00:51:05,064 --> 00:51:06,861
- Ain't no damn foul.
- That was a foul.

436
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:08,332
- Yo, you in my face.
- That was a foul.

437
00:51:08,401 --> 00:51:10,926
Hey, Han, sort this wanker out.

438
00:51:11,003 --> 00:51:12,231
A wanker?

439
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:14,533
What do I look like, a zebra?

440
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:23,807
So, how did you end up
over here, anyway?

441
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:27,351
Well, you know
those old Westerns ...

442
00:51:28,054 --> 00:51:30,955
where the cowboys
make a run for the border?

443
00:51:33,626 --> 00:51:35,321
This is my Mexico.

444
00:51:39,031 --> 00:51:41,556
Why'd you let me
race with your car?

445
00:51:41,701 --> 00:51:43,931
You knew I was gonna wreck it.

446
00:51:44,537 --> 00:51:45,765
Why not?

447
00:51:47,006 --> 00:51:49,099
'Cause it's a lot of money.

448
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:50,675
I have money.

449
00:51:52,044 --> 00:51:54,877
It's trust and character
I need around me.

450
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:58,608
You know, who you
choose to be around you ...

451
00:51:58,684 --> 00:52:00,709
lets you know who you are.

452
00:52:02,755 --> 00:52:04,416
And one car in exchange
for knowing ...

453
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,219
what a man's made of,

454
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:08,957
that's a price I can live with.

455
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:15,726
Look at all those
people down there.

456
00:52:16,402 --> 00:52:18,734
They follow the rules, for what?

457
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:22,304
They're letting fear lead them.

458
00:52:24,243 --> 00:52:26,336
What happens if they don't?

459
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:29,172
Life's simple.

460
00:52:29,515 --> 00:52:31,779
You make choices
and you don't look back.

461
00:52:46,365 --> 00:52:48,026
So, if you don't drift to win,

462
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,068
what do you drift for?

463
00:52:50,536 --> 00:52:51,764
You really want to know?

464
00:52:51,904 --> 00:52:53,166
Yeah.

465
00:52:54,006 --> 00:52:55,530
Okay. Let's go.

466
00:54:12,952 --> 00:54:15,477
There's no "wax on,
wax off" with drifting.

467
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:17,320
Learn by doin' it.

468
00:54:18,257 --> 00:54:19,781
The first drifters
invented drifting ...

469
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:21,622
out here in the mountains
by feeling it.

470
00:54:22,762 --> 00:54:24,127
So feel it.

471
00:54:36,676 --> 00:54:37,836
Again!

472
00:54:40,246 --> 00:54:41,406
What's in this bag?

473
00:54:41,981 --> 00:54:43,039
You'll see.

474
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:44,982
How much you got?

475
00:54:45,051 --> 00:54:46,484
Keep going, keep going.

476
00:54:52,658 --> 00:54:55,218
I'm so good, man, I could
sell rubbers to a monk.

477
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:01,188
Again.

478
00:55:23,356 --> 00:55:24,516
Again.

479
00:55:33,966 --> 00:55:36,799
Watch it. Watch it.
Not too early, now.

480
00:55:42,108 --> 00:55:44,508
Go, go, go, go!

481
00:55:55,855 --> 00:55:57,755
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

482
00:56:49,408 --> 00:56:52,844
Hey, Twink.
Get this man a bunk.

483
00:58:07,686 --> 00:58:09,381
Pleasure doing business.

484
00:58:13,225 --> 00:58:16,217
Yeah, baby. I told you.
I told you, didn't I?

485
00:58:55,901 --> 00:58:57,801
It's actually not bad.

486
00:58:57,937 --> 00:58:59,837
I didn't even have
to put ketchup on it.

487
00:59:00,906 --> 00:59:03,033
See, I'm not a total gaijin.

488
00:59:04,843 --> 00:59:06,333
I hate that word.

489
00:59:06,779 --> 00:59:08,838
It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

490
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:12,544
I thought you were born here.

491
00:59:12,618 --> 00:59:15,712
Well, "outsider" can mean
many different things.

492
00:59:21,026 --> 00:59:23,051
My mom died when I was 10.

493
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,057
She came out here 
from Australia ...

494
00:59:26,131 --> 00:59:27,792
when she finished high school.

495
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,331
And all I know
about her is that ...

496
00:59:29,401 --> 00:59:32,097
she went to work in a hostess bar.

497
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,367
DK's grandmother took me in.

498
00:59:40,512 --> 00:59:43,413
Well, my parents
split up when I was three.

499
00:59:44,617 --> 00:59:46,380
Me and Mom moved around a lot.

500
00:59:47,186 --> 00:59:48,949
Mostly 'cause of me.

501
00:59:49,955 --> 00:59:52,287
Well, it was all 'cause of me.

502
00:59:54,226 --> 00:59:56,694
Kind of made myself
an outsider, you know,

503
00:59:56,929 --> 00:59:59,227
without even thinking about it.

504
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,493
But I realize now,

505
01:00:02,568 --> 01:00:04,968
outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

506
01:00:06,138 --> 01:00:09,232
All that matters is knowing
what you really want

507
01:00:10,209 --> 01:00:11,938
and going after it.

508
01:00:32,064 --> 01:00:34,862
We used to come up here
when we were kids.

509
01:00:35,334 --> 01:00:38,667
Even before we could drive
we'd cut class, sneak out,

510
01:00:38,737 --> 01:00:41,297
come up here, and watch
the older kids drift.

511
01:00:48,013 --> 01:00:50,038
Things were different back then.

512
01:00:54,086 --> 01:00:56,919
Once I got my license,
I practically lived up here.

513
01:00:57,523 --> 01:01:00,083
Back then, kids just drove
whatever they had.

514
01:01:00,259 --> 01:01:01,521
You know, we just made do.

515
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,922
No one bothered us.

516
01:01:04,363 --> 01:01:05,887
The day I got my license ...

517
01:01:05,964 --> 01:01:08,455
is the day I got
my first speeding ticket.

518
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:10,934
The day after that,
I won my first race.

519
01:01:11,437 --> 01:01:13,997
I beat this rich kid
by three lengths.

520
01:01:15,007 --> 01:01:17,737
I gotta admit, it felt good.

521
01:01:19,545 --> 01:01:20,842
It felt like ...

522
01:01:21,113 --> 01:01:23,343
Like everything else
just disappears.

523
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:26,840
No past and no future.

524
01:01:27,386 --> 01:01:28,910
No problems.

525
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:32,481
Just the moment.

526
01:01:56,014 --> 01:01:57,641
Boy needs to chill.

527
01:02:00,152 --> 01:02:02,347
Hey, Twink,
I'm gonna grab another set.

528
01:02:02,421 --> 01:02:04,685
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Another set?

529
01:02:04,957 --> 01:02:07,551
No. Look, that was
your third set today.

530
01:02:07,626 --> 01:02:09,651
I mean, them tires ain't cheap.

531
01:02:19,505 --> 01:02:21,200
DK, grab a chair.

532
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,069
We're about to
roast some marshmallows.

533
01:02:24,109 --> 01:02:25,838
Yo, come on, man, look ...

534
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,919
Stay away from her,

535
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:43,424
or the only thing you'll
be driving is a wheelchair.

536
01:02:49,468 --> 01:02:51,265
Find yourself a new driver.

537
01:03:04,082 --> 01:03:05,208
I'm all right.

538
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:06,811
What'd you expect?

539
01:03:07,319 --> 01:03:08,684
You didn't just play with fire,

540
01:03:08,754 --> 01:03:10,517
you soaked 
the matches in gasoline.

541
01:03:34,379 --> 01:03:35,710
It's over.

542
01:03:56,468 --> 01:03:58,060
All this over a gaijin?

543
01:03:58,203 --> 01:03:59,795
I am a gaijin.

544
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,437
You've changed, DK.

545
01:04:09,815 --> 01:04:11,612
You say I've changed.

546
01:04:13,952 --> 01:04:16,580
But we're not so different,
you and I.

547
01:04:17,856 --> 01:04:20,689
We're both products
of fuckups, aren't we?

548
01:04:26,698 --> 01:04:29,963
They say your mom
was the best trick ...

549
01:04:30,035 --> 01:04:32,560
in all of Kabukicho
back in the day.

550
01:04:33,105 --> 01:04:34,732
Leave my mother out of this.

551
01:04:34,806 --> 01:04:38,207
If we hadn't taken you in,
you'd be just like her,

552
01:04:39,111 --> 01:04:41,136
doing anything for a buck.

553
01:04:42,281 --> 01:04:44,010
Think anyone would take
a second look at you ...

554
01:04:44,082 --> 01:04:45,549
if it wasn't for your uncle?

555
01:04:59,865 --> 01:05:01,730
We're the same, Neela.

556
01:05:05,637 --> 01:05:08,800
Difference is I know who I am
and where I belong.

557
01:05:14,713 --> 01:05:16,681
Do you know who you are?

558
01:05:19,518 --> 01:05:23,010
Do you know where you belong?

559
01:05:42,274 --> 01:05:43,332
Hey.

560
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:49,608
Come on.

561
01:09:34,573 --> 01:09:35,835
Hey, brother.

562
01:09:36,841 --> 01:09:38,138
I vouched for you!

563
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,178
Put my reputation
on the line for you!

564
01:09:40,278 --> 01:09:41,643
We were partners!

565
01:09:42,047 --> 01:09:44,914
You think you can keep
your side deals from me?

566
01:09:44,983 --> 01:09:47,884
Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

567
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,846
This is what we do.

568
01:09:49,988 --> 01:09:51,148
Takashi!

569
01:09:58,330 --> 01:10:00,457
What about now? Hmm?

570
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,729
Is this what we do?

571
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,897
Man, you need me.

572
01:10:07,138 --> 01:10:08,969
You'd still be
shaking down teahouses ...

573
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,530
for chump change
if it wasn't for me.

574
01:10:20,418 --> 01:10:21,578
Get in!

575
01:10:21,653 --> 01:10:22,984
Go! Go! Go!

576
01:10:27,058 --> 01:10:28,286
Come on.

577
01:13:49,961 --> 01:13:51,326
Sean. Sean!

578
01:16:37,061 --> 01:16:38,050
Takashi.

579
01:16:47,405 --> 01:16:49,566
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

580
01:16:59,984 --> 01:17:01,076
Okay.

581
01:17:02,286 --> 01:17:03,685
I'll go with you.

582
01:17:04,188 --> 01:17:05,348
Neela.

583
01:17:16,401 --> 01:17:18,733
See you when Daddy's not around.

584
01:17:42,226 --> 01:17:43,454
I'm putting you on a plane tonight.

585
01:17:43,528 --> 01:17:44,586
Dad ...

586
01:17:44,662 --> 01:17:46,095
Sean, don't argue with me.

587
01:17:46,164 --> 01:17:48,962
I did this. I can't run away.

588
01:17:50,134 --> 01:17:51,158
I can't.

589
01:17:51,235 --> 01:17:52,862
Sean, I'm your father.

590
01:17:52,937 --> 01:17:54,871
I'm responsible 
for your well-being.

591
01:17:55,473 --> 01:17:57,498
And I'm responsible
for my mess.

592
01:18:00,645 --> 01:18:02,442
I gotta do this.

593
01:18:04,649 --> 01:18:06,617
Can you understand that?

594
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:25,397
At least you're not
redoing my mistakes.

595
01:18:54,132 --> 01:18:55,861
You all right, man?

596
01:18:59,771 --> 01:19:01,363
We're leaving town.

597
01:19:02,073 --> 01:19:03,665
Look, I know some people ...

598
01:19:05,176 --> 01:19:06,973
I can't do it, Twink.

599
01:19:07,912 --> 01:19:11,006
Look, DK wants your head.

600
01:19:11,883 --> 01:19:13,214
All right?

601
01:19:13,651 --> 01:19:15,710
And the trouble you
just made for Kamata?

602
01:19:16,921 --> 01:19:18,980
You're done here, bro.

603
01:19:20,491 --> 01:19:22,118
Maybe I should talk to Kamata.

604
01:19:23,361 --> 01:19:24,988
What?

605
01:19:25,463 --> 01:19:27,124
DK answers to him.

606
01:19:29,901 --> 01:19:32,199
I know I just didn't hear that.

607
01:19:34,205 --> 01:19:37,606
I gotta end this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

608
01:19:37,675 --> 01:19:39,666
What, are you crazy, huh?

609
01:19:39,877 --> 01:19:41,469
Han is dead, all right!

610
01:19:41,546 --> 01:19:44,538
Plus, you can't just walk
into Kamata's place, man!

611
01:19:47,685 --> 01:19:49,209
It's all I got.

612
01:19:55,793 --> 01:19:58,990
Something I think Han
would've wanted you to have.

613
01:20:13,578 --> 01:20:14,977
What's this?

614
01:20:16,247 --> 01:20:17,805
You're gonna need it
if you're gonna make it ...

615
01:20:17,949 --> 01:20:20,110
out of Kamata's place alive.

616
01:20:24,121 --> 01:20:25,782
Don't you need it?

617
01:20:27,491 --> 01:20:30,983
No, it's cool.
Look, I'll figure it out.

618
01:21:40,898 --> 01:21:41,990
Sean.

619
01:21:46,704 --> 01:21:48,365
You need to leave.

620
01:21:48,706 --> 01:21:50,833
You came to the wrong place.

621
01:21:51,008 --> 01:21:53,238
I didn't come here to see you.

622
01:21:53,644 --> 01:21:54,872
Takashi.

623
01:22:23,507 --> 01:22:24,769
You think ...

624
01:22:25,843 --> 01:22:30,371
you can walk in here,
dump some cash and walk out?

625
01:22:32,516 --> 01:22:34,416
I know I'm only returning
what belonged to you ...

626
01:22:34,485 --> 01:22:36,453
in the first place, sir.

627
01:22:38,055 --> 01:22:40,250
But that's not why I really came.

628
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:42,949
I came here to apologize.

629
01:22:45,196 --> 01:22:48,825
I know your nephew and I have
embarrassed ourselves badly.

630
01:23:00,811 --> 01:23:04,577
Sir, I'm here to offer you
a peaceful solution.

631
01:23:07,218 --> 01:23:09,686
How do you plan
to accomplish that?

632
01:23:11,122 --> 01:23:12,282
A race.

633
01:23:17,528 --> 01:23:20,429
DK and I have caused
nothing but problems for you,

634
01:23:20,631 --> 01:23:22,098
for us.

635
01:23:23,401 --> 01:23:25,699
And I'm asking you
to allow us to settle this,

636
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:27,795
once and for all.

637
01:23:29,206 --> 01:23:30,400
We race ...

638
01:23:32,176 --> 01:23:34,269
and the loser leaves town
for good.

639
01:23:34,345 --> 01:23:37,178
I've already beat
this piece of shit once!

640
01:23:37,348 --> 01:23:38,440
Good.

641
01:23:39,417 --> 01:23:41,851
Then it should be easy.

642
01:24:20,091 --> 01:24:22,184
The cops took all the cars.

643
01:24:22,693 --> 01:24:23,751
Hey!

644
01:25:40,571 --> 01:25:42,266
That's why she's spitting.

645
01:26:05,429 --> 01:26:07,124
We almost there, Twink.

646
01:26:07,264 --> 01:26:08,959
Couple more tweaks.

647
01:26:10,501 --> 01:26:12,867
It's not the car
I'm worried about, man.

648
01:26:14,271 --> 01:26:16,239
DK picked this road
for a reason.

649
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,335
This is his mountain.

650
01:26:20,277 --> 01:26:23,371
He's the only one to ever
make it to the bottom.

651
01:30:17,347 --> 01:30:18,507
Yeah!

652
01:30:25,422 --> 01:30:26,514
Yeah!

653
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:27,682
Yes!

654
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:26,940
Come on.

655
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:39,423
Yeah! Come on!

656
01:31:39,496 --> 01:31:40,724
Come on, Sean.

657
01:31:40,864 --> 01:31:42,126
Let's go! Let's go!

658
01:31:42,199 --> 01:31:44,099
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

659
01:32:12,262 --> 01:32:14,526
Damn! Come on, man!
That ain't right.

660
01:34:24,594 --> 01:34:25,583
Yeah, baby!

661
01:34:25,662 --> 01:34:26,822
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

662
01:34:26,897 --> 01:34:28,262
I told you!

663
01:35:32,863 --> 01:35:34,956
Hey, yo, Sean! Yo, Sean!

664
01:35:35,665 --> 01:35:37,360
Hey, check this out, man.

665
01:35:37,667 --> 01:35:40,500
This dude over here
wanna race the new DK.

666
01:35:41,471 --> 01:35:44,304
Heard he's been beating
everybody around Asia, too.

667
01:35:44,374 --> 01:35:46,205
Not tonight, Twinkie.

668
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,306
Said he knew Han.

669
01:35:57,921 --> 01:35:59,684
Said Han was family.

670
01:36:13,703 --> 01:36:15,034
All right.

671
01:36:15,438 --> 01:36:16,530
Let's race.

672
01:36:43,767 --> 01:36:45,098
Nice ride.

673
01:36:45,569 --> 01:36:48,561
I won it from my friend Han,
a few years ago.

674
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,336
I didn't know he was
into American muscle.

675
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:55,901
He was when
he was rolling with me.

676
01:36:58,515 --> 01:37:00,983
You know this ain't
no 10-second race.

677
01:37:01,451 --> 01:37:03,351
I got nothing but time.

678
01:37:06,957 --> 01:37:08,481
You ready, kid?

679
01:37:19,369 --> 01:37:21,030
Come on, Sean! Come on!

680
01:37:23,073 --> 01:37:24,233
Ready!

681
01:37:27,344 --> 01:37:28,402
Set!

682
01:37:32,716 --> 01:37:33,876
Go!
