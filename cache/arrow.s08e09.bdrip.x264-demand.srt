1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,115
Bianca!

2
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,597
Bianca Bertinelli?

3
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,796
Who the hell are you?

4
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,997
Your life's in danger. I'm gonna
need you to come with me now.

5
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,232
My night's just
getting started. Bye.

6
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,919
Get off. Get off!

7
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,598
Help!

8
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,270
Seeking his third straight
term, Mayor Ramirez

9
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,996
has declared Star City the
safest city in the country.

10
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,436
In other news, the vigilante
museum has received

11
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,591
a generous seven-figure donation

12
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,558
from Victor and
Maria Bertinelli.

13
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,869
JJ] Hey. What are you doing?

14
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,838
Babe! You scared me.

15
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,318
I'm just the guy who you
share your bed with most nights.

16
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,834
Hm? Remember me?

17
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,714
How could I forget? Your
snoring always reminds me.

18
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,671
I don't snore.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,038
Look, I know you hate to
be anything less than perfect,

20
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,714
but you do, like old man style.

21
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,314
Ha ha. Right.

22
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,238
1 got up early to finish
writing my speech.

23
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,437
Wait, Is there something
special happening today?

24
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,233
Funny.

25
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,990
A gift for the graduate.

26
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,989
Wait what's happening?

27
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,110
Mia Queen,

28
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,079
I love you more than
anything in the whole world.

29
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,230
Will you marry me?

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,750
Please say yes.

31
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,039
-Yes, of course. Yeah?

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,554
Of course. I love you so much.

33
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,399

Dinah, this is where
you've been living?

47
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,711
Well, it's right above the bar,

48
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,156
and it has got a hell of a view.

49
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,955
Black Canary and the captain
of SCPD now owns a bar.

50
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,395
Also, when'd you learn to sing?

51
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,076
We didn't have much time for
karaoke back in 2020, did we?

52
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,070
So how did you find me? Sara?

53
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,754
She said that she found
you here a couple months ago

54
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,319
and that you didn't want
to come back with her.

55
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,756
The day after Oliver's
funeral in 2020,

56
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,716
1 woke up here.

57
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,553
I had no idea how or why.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,516
When I got here, I found
out that 1 don't even exist.

59
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,478
I'm sorry. How is
that even possible?

60
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,917
1 don't know, but there is no trace
of Dinah Drake or the Black Canary.

61
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,080
And what, you're
just fine with that?

62
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,272
I guess I came to realize that

63
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,477
not having an identity
can either be sad

64
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,711
or it can be oddly freeing.

65
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,991
I can let go of
the people I lost,

66
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,955
mistakes that I made.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,150
I'm not gonna lie, your zen
is kind of creeping me out.

68
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,037
Thank you.

69
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,152
You know, there has been
no real crime in Star City

70
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,435
in 20 years, Laurel.

71
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,592
And zen's not that
hard to come by.

72
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,236
Well, I hate to break it to you,

73
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,273
but Star City isn't
safe anymore.

74
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,518
Bianca Bertinelli's
been abducted.

75
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,836
Helena's daughter.

76
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,954
The socialite. Why-- why
would anybody want to hurt her?

77
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,596
Money, revenge,
something to do with Helena.

78
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,390
Who the hell knows? D, I
need you to help me find her.

79
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,037
You really came all
the way to the future

80
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,350
to rescue a kidnapped socialite?

81
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,999
- What am I looking at?
- Star City 2041.

82
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,350
This is a year from now.

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,553
It's not possible.
The city's safe.

84
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,755
Doesn't stay that way.

85
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,752
Because Bianca
Bertinelli gets kidnapped?

86
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,399
No. Because she dies.

87
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,997
Three days from now, her
body is found in the bay,

88
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,350
her killer never caught.

89
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,430
The city falls apart.

90
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,750
Everything that Oliver
sacrificed his life for.

91
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,877
I thought this part of
my life was done, Laurel.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,389
Then don't do it for
you. Do it for Oliver.

93
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,437
Okay.

94
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,191
For Oliver.

95
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,031
Good.

96
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,077
Now there's one more person
we need who's well-connected.

97
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,436
-And who is that? I'll
inform you on the way.

98
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,358

nicer to wear, right?

What would your dad

106

My father saved Star
City so that we can enjoy it,

107
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,198

graduated college,

I don't know.

129

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,474
Your number was
the last one she texted.

163
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,630
Uh, who the hell are you?

164
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,989
Wait. I-is something
wrong with Bianca?

165
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,275
I don't know. You tell us.

166
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,791
Ah--

167
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,280
You can't just crash my
party and harass my guests.

168
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,350
Do you know who I am?

169
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,675
Alot more than you do.

170
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,840
We were friends of your parents.

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,071
Then how come I've never
seen either of you before?

172
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,516
Long story and less
than zero time to explain.

173
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,273
Your friend Bianca,
she's in trouble.

174
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,078
And we need your
help to find her.

175
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,559
Yeah. I'm calling security.

176
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,955
No, I'm sorry to take
you out of your bubble,

177
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,354
but we really need you.

178
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,914
f know how to protect myself.

179
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,559
-You made sure of that.
- sure did.

180
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,318
The four of you are the
heroes that the city needs.

181
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,839
We are staring
at our father alive!

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,638
Dad. So what's next?

183
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,353
Mar Novu has seen my fate.

184
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,036
Dad-- / don't survive Crisis.

185
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,112
Mia.

186
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,399
«Back off.
-Um, I'm sorry. You fainted.

187
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,194
Are you okay?

188
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,636
Oh, my God.

189
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,195
Sorry. Uh, sorry. I--l guess
I had too much to drink

190
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,919
without eating or something.

191
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,072
Maybe you should
lie down, party animal.

192
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,630
1 think I need some air.

193
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,474
Hey, Mia, listen-- Ooh. No.

194
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,674
What the hell did you do to me?

195
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,598
I would love to
know that myself.

196
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,154
There's this guy, J'onn J'onzz.

197
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,720
He's a Martian or something.

198
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,793
He's why we remember everything
that happened before the Crisis.

199
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,359
Cisco was able to replicate

200
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,716
the Martian's powers using tech.

201
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,271
So a friend of
Supergirl's has a power

202
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,839
a friend of the
Flash can replicate.

203
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,634
Yeah. That's what I said.

204
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,679
I want to say that
you guys are crazy

205
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,433
and that none
of this is possible,

206
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,398
but I know you're right.

207
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,519
I remember everything,

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,798
you two fighting
alongside my dad,

209
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,519
Zoe dying, my--

210
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,635
my fiancé killing her,

211
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,873
I remember my father dying.

212
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,034
Why would you do this to me?

213
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,918
Look, there'll be time
for emotions later.

214
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,760
I woke you up because your
friend Bianca was kidnapped.

215
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,560
But there hasn't been any
crime in Star City in 20 years.

216
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,433
What is that, like
the city's motto now?

217
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,153
You don't know
Bianca, all right?

218
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,994
She's flaky. She's probably on a
beach somewhere having a ball.

219
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,560
I saw her, and she was taken.

220
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,871
How are you even hesitating?

221
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,474
Aren't you supposed
to be the Green Arrow?

222
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,356
Not anymore.

223
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,119
Mia, I understand
that you are torn

224
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,549
between two worlds right now,

225
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,630
but we need your help.

226
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,429
Look, I don't even know if I
can do this anymore, okay?

227
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,920
I haven't trained. I don't--

228
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,310
See? Just like riding a bike.

229
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,313
Is Bianca actually in trouble?

230
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,677
Yes. And if we don't find
her, she's going to die.

231
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,032
Fine. I will help you.

232
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,397
But this is a one-time thing.

233
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,639
Okay, I'm not
interested in joining

234
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,029
your Canary club, all right?

235
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,237
I have a life now, 1 am happy,

236
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,669
and I would like
to keep it that way.

237
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,836
Whatever.

238
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,474
Where was Bianca
when she was taken?

239
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,074
Partying at Club V.

240
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,872
Nothing Bianca loved
more than a good party.

241
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,314
Oh, to be in my 20s again.

242
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,836
Ick. Hard pass. I
was married at 21.

243
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,749
Seriously? Who are you?

244
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,393
Bianca. She was adopted.

245
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,073
Any chance that created tension?

246
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,880
Helena was a great mom
before she disappeared.

247
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,798
She lives with her
great-aunt and uncle now.

248
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,752
Back in the old Star
City, the Bertinellis were

249
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,439
one of the biggest
crime families around.

250
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,079
Well, that sounds
like enough reason

251
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,117
to violate some privacy laws.

252
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,479
It's time for you

253
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,553
to pay that
family a little visit.

254
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,074
I'm sorry Bianca missed your
party. You know how she is.

255
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,469
Free spirit.

256
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,233
Totally. Actually,

257
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,431
I wanted to speak
with you about that.

258
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,116
I think Bianca might be
in some kind of trouble.

259
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,635
What kind of trouble?

260
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,950
Mia's in position, D, you're up.

261
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,639
- You ready? Never not.

262
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,358
I think Bianca might
have been taken.

263
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,796
That's ridiculous.

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,195
You know how safe it is here.

265
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,158
I haven't been able
to contact her in days.

266
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,594
Her social media is quiet, it's-

267
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,955
she's not even
posting those videos

268
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,349
she's always addicted to making.

269
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,396
I wouldn't worry about it.

270
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,876
In a couple days,
we're gonna find out

271
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,553
she's been, uh, what partying

272
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,398
off the coast of Corto
Maltese or something.

273
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,715
Dinah, what's your progress?

274
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,391
Three more rooms to go.

275
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,558
You're about to have company,

276
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,949
one of the help, I'm guessing.

277
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,153
Mia, we need a distraction.

278
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,309
Wouldn't it be better
to be safe than sorry?

279
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,354
I mean, maybe since we're here,

280
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,557
if we call the police--
oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

281
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,755
Logan, get Remy!

282
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,675
Remy?

283
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,440
Remy, we've got an emergency.

284
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,639
Do us a favor. Stop
worrying about Bianca.

285
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,830
She's fine.

286
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,270
Okay, 1 will,

287
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,670
I'm clear.

288
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,871
Please tell me you got
those eyes and ears placed.

289
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,077
All of them.

290
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,075
We can see and hear everything
that goes down in that house.

291
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,878
Good. I'll meet you at the bar.

292
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,838
I want to talk to Bianca's
friends, see what they know.

293
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,229
- You want company?
- Ha.

294
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,755
And have to explain who
you two are again? No, thanks.

295
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,111
You know, I could get
used to all this free alcohol.

296
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,835
So that means you will not
be paying your tab downstairs.

297
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,276
I thought it was a friends
drink for free kind of place.

298
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,200
They say anything
interesting yet?

299
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,637
A couple stock tips,
where to vacation,

300
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,280
nothing that helps.

301
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, man. This is
one hell of a view.

302
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,994
I can see why you hide out here.

303
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,516
Subtle. I am not hiding.

304
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,115
Itold you, the world
doesn't remember who I am.

305
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,993
Don't you remember you?

306
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,356
I really don't expect
you to understand.

307
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,678
Try me.

308
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,270
I mean, isn't this
what friends do?

309
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,000
They sit around and drink,
talk about their problems.

310
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,913
Okay, well, when I
first ended up here,

311
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,913
I spent a lot of time
asking myself why.

312
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,157
It took a while, but I think I
finally understand the answer.

313
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,119
This is the universe's
way of telling me

314
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,953
I'm not supposed to be a hero.

315
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,912
Why? Because you
didn't get a gold star?

316
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,112
Because in this version of the
future, the one where I'm not a hero,

317
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,475
everyone is better off.

318
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,157
Mia's happ-- Mia was happy

319
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,674
until we dragged her into this.

320
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,749
Zoe's alive because
she's not a Canary.

321
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,271
And all of a sudden,
what, you're gun shy?

322
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,636
Zoe didn't die because
she was a Canary.

323
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,360
She died because she
was a hero, because you

324
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,116
inspired her and a bunch
of other women just like her

325
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,158
to fight for something
greater than themselves,

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,070
myself included.

327
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,113
What, are you guys on
a break or something?

328
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,197
It's called surveillance.

329
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,670
How did it go with
Bianca's friends?

330
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,477
Let me guess.

331
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,752
"Oh, Bianca was
just being Bianca.

332
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,672
And, oh, my gosh, what
shoes am I gonna wear?"

333
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,155
They didn't know anything.

334
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,632
And, by the way, three
of them went to Harvard.

335
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,756
That's awesome.

336
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,392
Oh.

337
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,675
Logan Bertinelli just
got chatty. Hang on.

338
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,356
He's worried about
something, "taking precautions,”

339
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,471
specifically moving
"it" out of the city.

340
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,751
What are the
odds "it" is Bianca?

341
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,110
Logan's an ass, but he
wouldn't kidnap his cousin.

342
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,158
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,910
Let's suit up.

344
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,752
You earned it.

345
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,671
I'm not wearing that.

346
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,070
Why? It's yours.
It's my father's.

347
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,671
She doesn't have to wear it
if she doesn't want to, Laurel.

348
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,397
Fine.

349
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,591

But you did. You're welcome.

373
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,990
I could've died.

374
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,198
Okay, that's a little dramatic.
We were there the whole time.

375
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,430
D, some help, please?

376
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,920
It was pretty risky, Laurel.

377
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,196
How about less talking
about your hurt feelings

378
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,590
and more talking about
the fact that your fiancé

379
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,552
just became suspect number one?

380
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,398
There is no way this is JJ.

381
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,194
The guy who attacked us
in the Deathstroke mask?

382
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,033
You do know who
Deathstroke is, right?

383
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,998
It could've been
anyone under that mask.

384
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,753
It does seem like a
pretty big coincidence,

385
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,513
especially given
who ♪ was before.

386
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,000
I mean, he used to lead them.

387
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,559
Yeah, and I used
to be a cage fighter.

388
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,320
That is not who I am anymore,

389
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,993
and that is clearly
not who JJ is.

390
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,270
Are you really that naive?

391
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,158
Are you really that judgmental?

392
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,594
You don't even have
the slightest bit of doubt

393
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,400
that JJ is the one who
is behind that mask?

394
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,636
No.

395
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,150
Prove it.

396
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,833
Mia Queen. These
are my plus-two.

397
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,954
See? A much better idea
than punching our way in.

398
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,519
- Hm.
- A lot less fun, though.

399
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,869
Mia, you sure
you're up for this?

400
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,793
I'm here, aren't 1?
JJ's office is in back.

401
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,110
Dinah, you take cameras.

402
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,953
Mia, go distract your fiancé.

403
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,629
You sure you're okay?

404
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,269
Yeah. It's the strangest thing.

405
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,314
I'have all these
memories of my old life,

406
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,949
but I have my new ones, too.

407
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,031
I just really don't
want it to be him.

408
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,070
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

409
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,436
Oh, yeah. I was
starting to worry.

410
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,238
You left in a hurry earlier.

411
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,993
Yeah, I wasn't feeling well.

412
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,753
"Actually, I just remembered

413
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,354
"you were a dangerous murderer,

414
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,919
probably a kidnapper, too.”

415
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,559
Hey, be nice, Laurel.

416
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,638
-I need a drink. Yeah?

417
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,790
-Yeah.
-Come on.

418
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,280
There's only one
guard at the door.

419
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,317
This should be easy.
Where are we on cameras?

420
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,874
Almost there.

421
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,235
In the meantime,

422
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,080
why don't we go back to
talking about Mia's love life?

423
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,197
Let's not.

424
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,959
You know I dated
your dad, right?

425
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,316
Well, a version of him anyway.

426
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,038
-Gross.
-{JJ] Thank you.

427
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,914
My Oliver also went
down on the Gambit,

428
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,555
also cheated with my sister.

429
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,915
Please stop talking.

430
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,197
People are who they are, Mia,

431
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,556
no matter what timeline,
universe, or earth,

432
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,154
and that's not your fault.

433
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,914
Was that supposed to
be some kind of pep talk?

434
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,077
Cameras are down.

435
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,310
That's my cue.

436
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,675
This area is restricted.

437
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,514
Oh, I'm just gonna step
out and get some air.

438
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,952
Trust me, I am not an art thief.

439
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,440
Well, you're welcome
to step outside.

440
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,838
Okay, let's not cause
a scene here, Laurel.

441
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,794
- ll do it.
- Fine.

442
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,075
No offense, Mia,

443
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,709
but if I couldn't get in there,

444
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,554
do you really think that
you're gonna be able to just--

445
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,755
Oh, you were saying?

446
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,197
I'm in. Now what
do I need to do?

447
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,078
Just put the device
anywhere near the computer.

448
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,913
It'll transfer the data
from your search.

449
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,315
It's working.

450
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,875
Run a search
for the Bertinellis.

451
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,191
Maybe we'll get lucky.

452
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,469
Uh, something's wrong.

453
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,956
Mia, you need to
get out of there now.

454
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,198
Hey, step away
from the computer.

455
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,311
Mia, what are you doing in here?

456
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,356
Where is she?

457
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,271
I'll take it from here.

458
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,670
What is going on with you?

459
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,235
You break into my office,

460
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,629
and you hack my computer?

461
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,194
I know you have Bianca.

462
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,596
That's what this is about?

463
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,994
You think that I kidnapped her?

464
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,230
Do you know how
crazy that sounds?

465
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,913
You're calling me
crazy now. Wow.

466
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,798
Because you are being crazy.

467
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,359
Okay, if you have
nothing to hide,

468
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,880
then show me
what's in these files.

469
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,711
Our honeymoon,

470
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,798
You said that you
always wanted to visit Fiji.

471
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,273
I was hoping I
could surprise you.

472
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,631
Namaste.

473
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,035
Can I call you crazy now?

474
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,552
- Bianca? What the hell?
- Namaste.

475
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,155
I have to get back to the party.

476
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,796
Okay. Let me explain.

477
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,756
Je

478
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,795
Bianca looks pretty happy to
be kidnapped, don't you think?

479
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,839
Turn off your socialite
brain and use your gut.

480
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,957
Don't you think that
video's a little convenient?

481
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,634
I think whoever
posted that is trying

482
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,438
to keep people from
looking for Bianca.

483
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,955
We should analyze it, you know,

484
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,389
see what clues we
can get in finding her.

485
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,756
Okay, I just accused
my fiancé for nothing.

486
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,115
Oh, he'll get over it.

487
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,189
Or you'll move on to someone who
wasn't a homicidal maniac in another life.

488
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,038
Win-win.

489
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,156
Oh, frak you.

490
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,197
Okay, that's enough. I think
we just need to calm down--

491
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,271
No. I am not the
one who cares more

492
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,635
about my relationship problems

493
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,592
than my friend who might die.

494
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,111
Do you not see how
selfish you're being?

495
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,432
Me? You're the one
who's using my friend

496
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,870
to drag me and Dinah
back into this superhero crap

497
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,590
just because you can't handle
the fact that Star City's fine

498
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,957
and doesn't need you to be
the Black Canary anymore.

499
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,396
And here I thought making
you remember your old life

500
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,359
would open your eyes to
how pointless and stupid

501
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,749
your new one is.

502
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,840
My "stupid and pointless"
life is the one that

503
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,911
my father sacrificed
himself to give me.

504
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,599
Don't you dare trivialize that.

505
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,632
Okay, I think all
Laurel was trying to say

506
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,711
is that Bianca is out
there, and she's in danger.

507
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,830
Bianca is fine.

508
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,554
You had no right to
make me remember.

509
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,710
All that did is bring back
the suffering and the loss,

510
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,598
because that's
all being a hero is.

511
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,999
I would've met
you at your place.

512
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,875
I needed the drive.

513
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,631
I hope that I didn't screw
up your event too badly.

514
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,677
I wish it was just the
event that you'd screwed up.

515
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,234
JJ, I'm sorry.

516
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,074
You accused me of
kidnapping our friend.

517
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,276
How in the world do you think
I could do something like that?

518
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,918
You were keeping things from me.

519
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,473
I guess I just jumped
to conclusions.

520
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,998
Jumping to conclusions
is-- is I'm cheating on you,

521
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,036
not that I'm a kidnapper.

522
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,554
And for the record, I'm neither.

523
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,750
I know that.

524
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,555
Can we please just
go back to a time

525
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,791
before I accused you
of being a criminal?

526
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,996
1 get it now.

527
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,110
This never had anything
to do with Bianca.

528
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,149
What are you talking about?

529
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,359
You have never really had to
commit to anything in your life.

530
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,434
That's why you brush off
your brother's job offers.

531
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,274
And it's why you hesitated
saying yes to our proposal.

532
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,590
It's why you're pushing
me away right now.

533
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,476
You don't want to marry me.

534
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,630
That is not true.

535
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,313
Then how come
ever since the party--

536
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,075
ever since I proposed
to you, i-it's like

537
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,877
you're seeing someone else
when you're looking at me?

538
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,675
When I look at you, I
see the rest of my life.

539
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,469
I can't marry someone
who doesn't feel the same.

540
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,278
-John, please. No. l--no.

541
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,833
Ithink it's best we
take some space.

542
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,635
We're running out of time.

543
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,269
Please tell me you're close to
finding something on that video.

544
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,990
Our hunch was right.

545
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,754
There's evidence
the image was altered.

546
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,951
I'm running a decryption
program, but it's gonna take a bit.

547
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,040
Since when did you learn
to do all this Felicity stuff?

548
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,076
I was a police captain,
Laurel. I have tricks.

549
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,270
Like knowing when someone's
not telling me everything,

550
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,470
for example.

551
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,837
Like you.

552
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,358
What?

553
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,954
You've been pushing Mia
real hard, which is weird,

554
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,839
because normally, you keep a
fairly healthy snark-filled distance

555
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,593
from caring too
much about anything.

556
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,232
This is personal.

557
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,999
Look, I wasted a lot of time

558
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,958
pretending to be
something I wasn't

559
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,919
because it was easier, and I don't
want Mia making the same mistake.

560
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,951
You--

561
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,191
You know, part of empathy isn't
only understanding other people's pain.

562
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,756
It's also sharing your own. You
know how hard it is to be a hero.

563
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,072
I mean, hell, I'm
struggling with it right now.

564
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,511
Imagine what
she's going through.

565
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,391
The last time Mia put
on that Green Arrow suit

566
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,039
was the day Oliver died.

567
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,234
The program's finished.

568
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,074
Oh, boy.

569
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,715
Whoever did this
wanted people to think

570
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,473
she was safe on vacation.

571
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,839
They didn't know they
were giving us a lead.

572
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,877
Well, thank God for morons.

573
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,553
I gotta figure
out where this is.

574
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,757
But for the record,
I think you're right.

575
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,833
If there is evil
back in Star City,

576
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,276
the Green Arrow
should be here, too.

577
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,479
Oh, God. Are you crying?

578
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,392
What the hell are
you doing here?

579
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,834
I guess it's that feelings
thing or whatever.

580
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,513
Look, I'm sorry.

581
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,756
♪ broke up with
me, if you even care.

582
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,791
1 do care.

583
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,598
You're strong enough
to get through this.

584
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,910
You're strong enough to get
through anything. I've seen you do it.

585
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,354
Is that why you woke me up?

586
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,040
Mia, I spent so much of my
life choosing the easy path.

587
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,714
And for me, that meant
becoming Black Siren

588
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,878
and destroying things and...

589
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,395
killing people.

590
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,156
It's not a good look.

591
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,278
Not exactly what I'm doing here.

592
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,796
Okay, but can you honestly tell
me that you were happy with your life

593
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,712
before I woke you up? Truly?

594
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,476
I spent my whole life

595
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,029
looking at these
pictures of my dad,

596
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,916
all of the amazing
things he did for the city,

597
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,278
what a hero he was,

598
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,833
wondering how I could
possibly live up to that

599
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,357
you know, in--in
anything I chose to do.

600
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,510
And...

601
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,714
and so I chose to do nothing.

602
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,037
He would probably be
so disappointed in me.

603
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,836
I doubt that.

604
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,157
Your father, he
wanted you to be happy.

605
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,278
And he--he gave you all this,

606
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,391
but I also think he wanted
you to have a choice.

607
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,551
I'am not gonna
sugarcoat it for you.

608
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,038
Being a hero kind of sucks.

609
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,995
And it never gets any easier

610
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,436
because it is the hardest
thing that you can do.

611
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,155
Then why do it?

612
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,118
For me, it gave me a purpose.

613
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,273
And that's why I woke you up,

614
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,032
so that you could have the
chance to realize your own.

615
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,034
Mia, this is your city,

616
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,394
and you're the Green Arrow.

617
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,714
Hey. How'd it go?

618
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,510
Ask her.

619
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,355
I'm glad you decided to join.

620
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,519
Bianca's my friend. Any
luck finding her location?

621
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,513
Not yet. But she's in a
greenhouse of some sort.

622
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,671
Only problem is there
are hundreds in the city.

623
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,910
It's gonna take time.

624
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,989
That's not a greenhouse.

625
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,355
The design's biophilic.

626
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,352
It's meant to power the
building photosynthetically.

627
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,758
What are you, a botanist now?

628
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,030
I took a couple classes

629
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,077
in design theory and
sustainable concepts.

630
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,079
Socialites can have brains, too.

631
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,516
Great. Well, use
your fancy brain

632
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,909
and narrow it down for us?

633
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,994
Uh, there's about 12 buildings
in the city that fit the bill.

634
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,629
But only one of them
is currently unoccupied--

635
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,473
a complex downtown.

636
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,395
Let's go save my friend.

637
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,834
You sure you're ready for this?

638
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,715
One way to find out.

639
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,911
Thermal imaging places
Bianca on the top floor.

640
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,912
There's 2 bodies beside her.
I'm guessing they're guards.

641
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,999
How much more
company can we expect?

642
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,349
It depends on how fast we move.

643
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,510
That's comforting.

644
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,159
Oh, and another
piece of good news.

645
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,357
The whole place is laced
with meta-dampeners.

646
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,076
-S0 no Canary Cries.
-Perfect. Ready?

647
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,678
I so wish I got that
on my live stories.

648
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,114
We have to go now.

649
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,150
Why leave now, huh?

650
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,920
The fun is just getting started.

651
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,750
Trevor.

652
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,479
You know my name. I'm flattered.

653
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,754
Cool masks.

654
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,070
Yeah, very, uh, 2020.

655
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,875
Actually, I have-- I
have one of my own.

656
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,797
So this is what you've been
spending Daddy's money on?

657
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,560
You know, Bianca never
told me that she had

658
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,997
such, uh, colorful friends.

659
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,395
Oh, I get it.

660
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,832
She broke up with you, and
now your feelings are hurt.

661
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,399
- Aw.
- Aw.

662
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,675
Is that why you're doing this?

663
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,353
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

664
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,071
You're a pawn

665
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,592
with a fancy family name.

666
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,909
That's the only reason
you're important.

667
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,434
Yeah, I see why you dumped him.

668
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,915
- Enough talking.
- Great.

669
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,832
So I guess that means
you're waving the white flag.

670
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,633
The three of you
against all of us.

671
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,151
I'll take those odds.

We're too high.

698
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,070
How are you still alive?

699
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,558
Death by tantrum? You're
gonna have to do better than that.

700
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,271
Don't come any closer.

701
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,315
You see, all the, uh,

702
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,313
greenery in this building is
linked to the same system--

703
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,714
all state-of-the-art
and all very, very...

704
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,192
explosive.

705
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,510
If he drops that lighter, this
whole place is gonna go up.

706
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,190
Trevor, don't do this.

707
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,953
You can't stop what's coming.

708
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,440
She won't let you,
And who the hell is she?

709
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,957
We have to jump.

710
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,236
I thought you were trying
to save me, not kill me.

711
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,436
Trust me.

712
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:44,992
Welcome back.

713
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,511
Oh, my God. Who are you bitches?

714
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,679
Any word on how Bianca's doing?

715
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,070
She is back to her old
self, posting live videos.

716
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,117
So I'm not very good
at this, uh, feelings stuff.

717
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,553
I wanted to thank
you, both of you.

718
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,919
And now you can go
back to your glamorous life

719
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,196
of singing to drunk
hipsters in your bar.

720
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,430
Oh, thank you for that.

721
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,832
But, uh, actually, I was
thinking of going part-time.

722
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,632
You know, Trevor's not just a
jealous ex-lover trying to get even.

723
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,199
Somebody pushed him to do this,

724
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,271
and we still haven't
figured out who or why.

725
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,353
Trevor's tattoo looked familiar.

726
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,951
We start there.

727
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,712
We?

728
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,070
Star City needs the Green Arrow.

729
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,153
But what about JJ, and
what about your life?

730
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,390
I'm not giving that up,

731
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,191
but I'm also gonna
protect my father's legacy.

732
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,556
Mia, living a double
life is really hard.

733
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,519
Well, somebody once told me that

734
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,559
being a hero is the
hardest thing you can do.

735
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,030
It's also the right thing.

736
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,871
Well, that person
sounds really smart.

737
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,996
I mean, she has her moments.

738
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,956
But putting on that
suit again wasn't easy.

739
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,314
But it reminded me
that it's not all bad.

740
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,511
There are some really,
really good parts, too.

741
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,430
Well, uh, before we get
back to saving the world,

742
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,671
I say we should have
a celebratory drink.

743
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,752
And after what we did tonight,

744
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,713
I say we deserve the good stuff.

745
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,791
Cheers. To the Green Arrow.

746
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,351
To the Canaries.

747
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,758
To the future,
whatever it holds.

748
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,271
Well, I'm glad you didn't
change the locks on me yet.

749
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,311
Mia--

750
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,711
Look, before you kick me out,
just please let me say I'm sorry.

751
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:56,076
You were right. I--I have been
acting weird since the graduation party.

752
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,552
-So then I did spook you. No.

753
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,155
This has nothing to
do with you proposing.

754
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,875
Look, graduating
got into my head.

755
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,032
I'm trying to figure out what I
want to do with the rest of my life,

756
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,556
what kind of person
I want to be. I...

757
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,550
I want to help you with that.

758
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,437
And that is why I
love you so much.

759
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,833
You're a good person, JJ.

760
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,829
I couldn't imagine spending
my life with anyone else.

761
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,591
You know, it's been a while
since I had a roommate.

762
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,312
I'll get my own
place, I promise.

763
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,229
Your own place? That
sounds pretty permanent.

764
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,396
The city's under threat, and
I'm not gonna leave until it's over.

765
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,038
You know, while you're here,

766
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,316
we could turn this place
into a base of operations

767
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,276
for the Canaries.

768
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,034
Canaries, as in
more than just us?

769
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,074
Tonight made me remember
who I really am, Laurel.

770
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,470
I may have been
erased, but I'm not gone.

771
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,837
I need to figure
out how I got here.

772
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,790
And while I do that, I can help a
whole new generation of women.

773
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,074
So basically, what
you're saying is

774
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,958
that I was right.

775
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,994
Don't gloat.

776
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,917
But please do explain
why you didn't tell me

777
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,799
the whole story about what Bianca's
death would have meant for the city.

778
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,911
Sara said when the city falls...

779
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,957
someone's at the
center of it--Mia.

780
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,679
But Bianca was
dead in the future,

781
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,239
and Mia wasn't the Green Arrow.

782
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,949
We should be in
the clear, right?

783
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,995
I hope so.

784
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,200
I can't believe
it's been 20 years

785
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,749
since he sacrificed
himself to save the city.

786
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,512
Who's that?

787
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,718
Oh, just the Star, the
Globe, the Gazette,

788
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,435
Byline, channel 52.

789
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,238
They all want to know
if 'm the Green Arrow.

790
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,871
Course they do.

791
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,314
Isn'tit a little misogynistic

792
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,754
that they're not
calling you as well?

793
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,274
I mean, come
on, guys. It's 2040.

794
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,237
Oh, my God. You
brought the pet rock.

795
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,116
Excuse me. Are you
referring to the Hozen?

796
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,715
This is the closest thing
we have to a family heirloom,

797
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,759
passed down from Dad to
Aunt Thea to Mom and to me.

798
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,399
Show some respect, please.

799
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,036
May I see it?

800
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,518
-Yes, you may.
-Thank you.

801
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,509
What the hell?

802
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,638
Oh.

803
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,116
William!

804
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,557
Hey, babe. I didn't think
you'd be back so soon.

805
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,277
Who are you? What do you want?

806
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,712
I need you to remember.

807
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,390
I have vision.

808
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,835
We can fix this...

809
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,989
together.

810
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,035
J!

811
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,311
You were wrong about me.

812
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,678
It was never a mask.

813
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,195
Greg, move your head!
