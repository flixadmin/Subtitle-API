1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,685
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,246
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,047
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,730
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,724
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,526
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,291
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,251
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,044
<i>Those little yellow pills you swallowed,</i>

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,402
they do a few interesting things,

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,206
including making you cooperative.

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,448
Thanks to the algae we engineered
from Star City bay,

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,251
the air down here
is now perfectly breathable.

14
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,444
Genesis is almost ready.
We're much too close to play games.

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,443
- Do you remember what I promised you?
- A new beginning.

16
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,449
And you will have it.

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,566
Once we've brought this world to its end.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,891
Andy's working with Darhk
and has been the entire time.

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,047
Andy!

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,651
Your brother's way beyond reach,
Mr. Diggle.

21
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,723
If I'd listened to you
instead of trusting my brother,

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,126
Laurel would be alive right now.

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,129
If Darhk wins, Laurel died for nothing.

24
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,765
He feels unstoppable.

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,724
- Because of his magic.
- It's too strong.

26
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,490
You always find a way,

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,121
<i>and you have to find a way now.</i>

28
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,802
Now is not the time for panic.

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,969
We let him rot in prison.

30
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,131
Clearly, you overestimate
Damien Darhk's capacity for forgiveness,

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,765
which is to say that he has any.

32
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,644
Should Damien prove to be unreasonable,

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,286
I have implemented contingencies.

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,004
My buddies.

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,930
Long time, no see.

36
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,088
I brought my posse. Hope you don't mind.

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,851
What happened to Ian and Judy?

38
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,526
They come down with that nasty, little flu
that's been going around?

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,160
Some were wary of this meeting
given that...

40
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,363
You all abandoned me to my imprisonment?

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,286
I visited.

42
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,289
Someone should teach
this evil organization

43
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,448
a lesson in helping their fellow man.

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,688
I'm sure it's all
just a simple misunderstanding.

45
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,163
After all, why would I rely solely
on the word of Malcolm Merlyn?

46
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,045
- He can be so underhanded.
- Cute.

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,123
And our illustrious council
has worked together

48
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,651
for such a very long time.

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,370
I'm glad that we still have your trust.

50
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,048
Of course. I had a lot of time
to reflect while I was in prison,

51
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,802
mostly about religion and bundt cake.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,287
But after much thought, I realized that...

53
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,204
Oh! Almost forgot.

54
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,848
Did my little incarceration
delay Genesis at all?

55
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,371
Of course not.

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,530
Genesis is much bigger
than just one person.

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,849
Gold star for you.

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,404
Where was I? Oh, that's right.

59
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,369
My jailhouse epiphany.

60
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,688
If I could escape prison
without your help,

61
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,530
what do I need any of you for?

62
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,005
Milo, you really have not been
paying attention, have you?

63
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,607
Anyone else care to do something stupid?

64
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,411
No takers?

65
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,081
Pity.

66
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,242
Ladies and gentlemen
and recently deceased,

67
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,925
it is time to begin
the final phase of Genesis.

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,247
Milo Armitage.

69
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,410
SCPD found him
in an alley outside Ellendale,

70
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,090
and across town,

71
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,207
Phaedra Nixon.

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,562
- Okay. So what am I missing?
- They were both HIVE.

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,961
You probably don't recognize
Phaedra and Milo

74
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,931
now that they're dead, or maybe you were
too busy running for your life, but...

75
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,406
They were with Darhk
when he held us hostage.

76
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,726
And now they're dead.

77
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,605
What, so you think
crazy-pants Lonnie Machin's back in town?

78
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,609
No. His grudge is against Darhk, not HIVE.

79
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,801
You think Darhk is cleaning house?

80
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,042
Well, HIVE didn't lift a finger
to break him out of Iron Heights.

81
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,207
That was all Andy and Merlyn.

82
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,125
Okay, well, if Darhk is settling scores,
then now might be the time to hit him.

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,927
We have seen how powerful he is.
I can't risk losing anyone else.

84
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,087
We can't just sit on our hands, Oliver.

85
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,926
We're not just sitting on our hands,
but before we do anything,

86
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,924
we need to know
that we can counteract his magic.

87
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,969
Well, is that even possible?

88
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,401
I think it might be.

89
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,650
I was finally able to
get in touch with Constantine

90
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,927
and he put me onto someone

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,841
who he thinks may be able to teach me
how to defend against Darhk's magic.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,129
Okay. Well, I'm not just saying this
because I love Harry Potter,

93
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,846
but why are we not all
taking those lessons?

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,607
Well, it is easier said than done,
and apparently, quite dangerous.

95
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,245
So, I have to go to Hub City
for a day or two.

96
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,969
Okay. In that case,
can I take the weekend with Alex?

97
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,686
Kind of wants to go away, clear our heads.

98
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,127
That sounds like a good idea.
I think that...

99
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,964
Actually, I think everyone should
take a little time.

100
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,810
Lay low, but stay available, and
we will deal with Darhk when I get back.

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,206
Okay.

102
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,361
Let him in.

103
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,841
Mind stepping out?

104
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,362
"HEY. you. How you holding up?"

105
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,889
You've, um, looked better.

106
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,724
Considering I've spent two weeks
in a bomb-proof tungsten-encased bunker,

107
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,881
I think I look pretty good.

108
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,727
You hungry?

109
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,527
Mmm. How long have those been there?

110
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,722
That was lunch.
It might have even been today's.

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,405
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

112
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,564
Oliver is leaving tonight
on some Magical Mystery Tour.

113
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,043
He wants me to stay put and do nothing
until he comes back.

114
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,321
Magical Mystery Tour?

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,164
Yeah, it's a long story.

116
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,160
But the point of it is that he thinks
it's too dangerous for any of us

117
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,330
to go after Darhk or Andy
until he gets the right magical know-how.

118
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,563
- I can see you're thrilled about that.
- Mmm.

119
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,080
If you think you have it bad,

120
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,891
try remembering you're not the one
being held prisoner in a metal box.

121
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,889
Look, sweetheart.

122
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,205
We've talked about this.

123
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,210
Andy has been inside of A.R.G.U.S.
He's been inside of our home.

124
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,242
It's too dangerous for you
to be either place right now.

125
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,366
I don't want you in either place, either.

126
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,047
Oh, I got you. I got you.

127
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,571
<i>- Let my agents see what they can find.
- Yeah.</i>

128
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,922
<i>And, as much as you don't wanna hear it,</i>

129
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,284
- Oliver has a point.
- Mmm.

130
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,571
HIVE is too dangerous for you
to go off half-cocked, John.

131
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,763
Well, it's always serious
when you call me "John."

132
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,123
Well, John, why don't you
make yourself useful

133
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,805
by grabbing some diapers while you're out.

134
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,528
We're running low,
and I hate asking my people to get them.

135
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,649
- You got it.
- Mmm-hmm.

136
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,288
- Back in an hour?
- Or less.

137
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,804
Good-bye, Daddy. Honey, say bye.

138
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,603
- You've been living down here?
- Seemed to make the most sense.

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,881
Where's all your stuff?

140
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,482
It's just in storage.
You know me, I don't need much.

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,126
Maybe like a plant?

142
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,166
Like a fern or something.
They thrive in places like this.

143
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,481
How could I forget? Come to see me off?

144
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,846
You were pretty stingy on the details

145
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,010
about this "magic tutor"
Constantine referred you to.

146
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,326
That is, sort of, my MO.

147
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,010
Don't talk to me like I'm other people.

148
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,561
What has you so worried?

149
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,804
Darhk's idol,
the type of magic that he's using,

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,241
I've seen it take good people

151
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,645
and turn them dark, soulless,
and almost inhuman.

152
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,246
And you're afraid
that's gonna happen to you?

153
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,164
There's an argument to be made
that I'm already there.

154
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,044
- That's not funny.
- I am not joking.

155
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,891
There is no length that I will not go to,
to avenge Laurel.

156
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,329
To stop Darhk
from hurting anyone ever again.

157
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,164
And I honestly don't know
where that path will lead.

158
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,885
I'm coming with you.

159
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,007
Felicity.

160
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,531
Just because we're not together

161
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,410
doesn't mean you have to do this alone.

162
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,921
And, I've already chartered
the company jet. Mr. Dennis was furious.

163
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,404
And I've booked us a room, rooms.
With points.

164
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,604
Should I even try
and talk you out of this?

165
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,929
No. You've met my mother.
Same DNA.

166
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,241
Did you see anyone else here?

167
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,483
Which way? Get out of here, now.

168
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,730
What the hell?

169
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,965
Sorry, man.

170
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,771
But I'm not playing anymore! Whoo!

171
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,603
You still got those quick reflexes, John.
Too bad they couldn't save your partner.

172
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,285
Don't you dare say anything about her!

173
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,488
Well, you got a gun. Make me!

174
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,523
Hey, honey, it's a little tough for me
to talk right now.

175
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,326
You'll wanna hear this,
satellite track just picked up Andy.

176
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,330
Let me guess, he's somewhere south of Main
between Grammercy and Addison, right?

177
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,641
How do you know that?

178
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,490
Because I'm trading shots with him
right now.

179
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,160
- Johnny.
- Yell at me later. Just send backup.

180
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,169
He's at the Grammercy Power Plant.

181
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,010
<i>How soon can your men get here?</i>

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,001
Five minutes, ten tops.

183
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,366
That's too long.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,001
<i>Johnny, you need to wait.</i>

185
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,003
You have no tactical advantage in there.

186
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,403
Well, I can't wait. If I do, he gets away.
I can't let that happen. Not again.

187
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,971
Your judgment is compromised.

188
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,363
Maybe it is.
But it doesn't mean I'm wrong. Get here!

189
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,171
Johnny! Johnny!

190
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,087
So, what exactly are we looking for?

191
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,242
High roller room.

192
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,370
When you said that you had found someone
to teach you magic, I was thinking, like,

193
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,210
a mountain top or a hidden temple,

194
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,324
not Hub City's
premiere underground casino.

195
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,209
Well, with Constantine, I have learned
to expect the unexpected.

196
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,767
I'm betting on Fortuna.

197
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,087
Now, he was a little bit vague
with the specifics. He just said,

198
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,921
"Pitch game, first base, mate,
see if you're worthy."

199
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,201
Wow.

200
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,085
Okay, pitch game, blackjack,

201
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,408
uh, dealer using up to two decks.

202
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,371
"First base,"
first seat on the dealer's left.

203
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,562
I think we're in the right place.

204
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,087
I'm not so sure that finding this guy
depends on gambling.

205
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,890
It's not gambling when I play.

206
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,441
Alex?

207
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,610
Hello? Alex?

208
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,766
Alex?

209
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,965
Hey, morning. And here I thought
you were gonna sleep past breakfast.

210
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,487
I almost did. I'm so foggy.

211
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,611
Yeah, you were exhausted. You passed out
five minutes after we left the city.

212
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,801
Oh.

213
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,330
Guess I was really tired.

214
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,689
See, it just proves how badly
you needed this trip. We both did.

215
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,608
Now, you ready for some
famous eggs Benedict?

216
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,049
You poached eggs?

217
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,648
Hey, I'm not just a cutthroat
political operative. I contain multitudes.

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,049
Mmm-hmm.
And you also wear a very mean apron.

219
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,970
Well, you should see
what I have on underneath.

220
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,844
Mmm.

221
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,805
I forgot how good you were at this.

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,684
Ah, like riding a bike.

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,047
Rough beat.

224
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,369
Indeed. I should probably head home soon
before they take my shoes.

225
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,330
Well, you never know
when your luck's gonna change. Trust me.

226
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,202
<i>That's so kind. Muchas gracias.</i>

227
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,846
<i>De</i> nada.

228
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,241
Oh, boom!

229
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,810
Come to mama. I mean. What?

230
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,005
I'm starting to think
that this guy's gonna be a no-show.

231
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,201
Right.

232
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,045
It's because he's not a guy, amor.

233
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,045
Esrin Fortuna.

234
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,725
Tell John Constantine
he still owes me money.

235
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,842
Stay right where you are,
you son of a bitch!

236
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,925
It's funny.

237
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,725
I was gonna tell you the same thing.

238
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,884
Bravo, John.

239
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,130
You played the script out perfectly.

240
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,211
What the hell are you talking about?

241
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,528
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll explain everything.

242
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,241
After you wake up.

243
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,204
Sorry, this place isn't as fancy

244
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,402
as the cage you kept me in
for three months.

245
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,606
Where the hell am I?

246
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,650
You've got bigger worries.
Mr. Darhk is on his way.

247
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,321
To do what?

248
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,085
Well, he's not coming here
to play gin rummy.

249
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,611
I'm supposed to prep you.

250
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,446
Glad to see you're picking up
your psycho boss's old habits.

251
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,610
I'm sorry, but is the man
that locked me up in a cage

252
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,650
and beat me half to death
questioning my savior's orders?

253
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,288
Damien Darhk is no one's savior!
He's a liar and a monster.

254
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,283
The Romans said the same thing
about Jesus.

255
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,444
Just do whatever you gotta do, man! Do it!

256
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,485
Wow.

257
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,804
There's that temper I remember.

258
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,961
You know, it's a good thing

259
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,963
that Sara's not gonna have to grow up
with it like I did.

260
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,122
You keep my daughter's name
out of your mouth!

261
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,321
How could you do this to everyone again
for a second time?

262
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,530
Oh. Oh, I know what you're doing.

263
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,961
You're referring
to my former wife and son.

264
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,051
I left that life a long time ago, John.

265
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,642
You can't even say their names.

266
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,320
Carly. Andy, Jr.

267
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,648
They were your family. They still are!

268
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,649
My family is HIVE.

269
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,409
Okay. So since Oliver
doesn't seem to wanna ask it, um...

270
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,881
Why is an immortal shaman
playing blackjack

271
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,168
in Hub City's premiere underground casino?

272
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,249
Excuse me. Immortal?

273
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,887
- You see any wrinkles on my face?
- And shaman?

274
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,245
A shaman is someone who has influence
in the world of good and evil spirits.

275
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,522
Blackjack is just a hobby. This way.

276
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,251
You're planning on teaching me magic
in the back room of a casino?

277
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,729
You want to learn the dark arts,
Mr. Queen? We cannot do that here.

278
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,567
This is, by far, the coolest high roller
room I've ever seen.

279
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,884
We've left the casino behind, amor.
And that plane of existence.

280
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,123
I've been in a chamber like this before
on an island named Lian Yu.

281
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,888
Yes, Lian Yu is a place of nexus.
Just like your home.

282
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,247
Star City?

283
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,083
There's a nexus chamber there as well.

284
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,089
Wait, you didn't think
it was a coincidence

285
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,930
that Damien Darhk chose that city?

286
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,565
You know Darhk?

287
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,406
I wouldn't be much of a shaman
if I didn't.

288
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,723
A special brand of
nasty <i>loco</i> that one is.

289
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,408
So, if you know Darhk,
why haven't you tried to end him?

290
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,804
That's not the way of things. We immortals
tend to stay out of the affairs of men.

291
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,122
Unless someone owes you money.

292
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,762
Recognize this handsome gent?

293
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,769
Darhk has a similar idol.

294
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,928
- It gives him his power.
- Mmm-mmm.

295
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,281
It only channels it.
Darhk's power comes from...

296
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,731
Death. The more people he kills,
the more powerful he becomes.

297
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,851
Not just a pretty face, this guy.

298
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,242
Yeah, except Oliver's not gonna go
kill a bunch of people

299
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,488
just to be on the same
level playing field as Darhk.

300
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,686
All things have their opposite.

301
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,962
Darhk draws his power from fear and death.

302
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,647
Its opposite is light and hope.

303
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,969
La luz <i>del</i> alma. "Light of the soul."

304
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,128
If you can channel La luz <i>del</i> alma,

305
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,682
you will be able to repel Darhk's magic.

306
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,690
Then that is what I'm here to learn.

307
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,166
I wish it were just that easy.

308
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,008
If the darkness inside you
outweighs the light,

309
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,127
instead of repelling Darhk's magic,
you'll end up fueling it.

310
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,206
You will only make him more powerful.

311
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,691
Are you getting a signal?

312
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,202
Nope. It's one of the benefits
of being on vacation.

313
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,009
Just wanted to call my brother.

314
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,726
You okay?
Seem to be having trouble relaxing.

315
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,570
Yeah, no, I'm...

316
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,526
You're probably gonna think
it's stupid.

317
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,921
Mmm, I can pretty much guarantee
that I won't.

318
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,401
It's this place. it seems too perfect.

319
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,043
Well, it sounds like it's been
way too long since you've left the city.

320
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,605
Yeah, maybe.

321
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,281
Do you hear that?

322
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,243
Yeah, I think people call that "nature."

323
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,411
No. That's...

324
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,930
That's not it.

325
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,405
I don't know,
maybe I'm just tired, but it...

326
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,487
It sounds like
everything is on a loop right now.

327
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,886
Does that sound crazy? That...
That's crazy.

328
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,884
Only a little, yeah.

329
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,086
Like, I think this is just
the last bit of you

330
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,605
trying to fight this vacation.

331
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,561
Yeah.

332
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,087
Hey, let all that go.

333
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,649
- Just be nappy. okay?
- Okay.

334
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,926
I sure am.

335
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,691
- Okay.
- All right.

336
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,246
It's time.

337
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,444
I know this feels personal, John.
But it isn't.

338
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,449
What's happening
is just what has to happen.

339
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,605
Ah!

340
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,365
Do it. Do it for Laurel.

341
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,528
She'd be so disappointed in you.

342
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,562
The only reason why you're still breathing
is because one of us is still human.

343
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,167
I'll hit you with a low dose
of Darhk's magic,

344
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,890
and then we'll take it up from there.

345
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,051
Don't I need an idol or a totem?

346
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,041
The tattoo Constantine gave you
does many things. Are you ready?

347
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,681
Yeah.

348
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,603
Um, I'm sorry. I just thought that these
magic lessons would have, you know, more

349
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,001
lessons.

350
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,006
Magic is a manipulation
of primordial energies.

351
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,362
Primordial as in pre-linguistic.

352
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,249
You'll probably want to
take a few steps back, amor.

353
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,041
Hmm? Mmm.

354
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,250
Two sides of you. Darkness. Light.

355
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,526
Focus on the light.

356
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,044
Good. But that might be,
as they call, "beginner's luck."

357
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,811
So, let's kick it up a notch or two, hmm?

358
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,445
<i>The darkness and light are within you.</i>

359
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,130
<i>In truth, you're only fighting yourself.</i>

360
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,490
<i>The friends you've failed.
The people you've killed.</i>

361
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,322
<i>They have no place in this.</i>

362
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,689
<i>Don't give in. Cast aside your doubt.</i>

363
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,248
<i>Resist your darkness.</i>

364
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,811
- What happened?
- He's not ready.

365
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,441
I'll get it. I'll get it.
Now, let's go again.

366
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,722
I could give you
an infinite number of tries.

367
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,126
It wouldn't change a thing.

368
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,971
What? No, I can do this.

369
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,165
I told you, if the darkness within you
is greater than the light,

370
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,243
you will only make your enemy stronger.

371
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,123
You've seen what's inside of you.

372
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,486
Now, tell me,

373
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,449
what could I possibly "teach" you
that would change what you saw?

374
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,809
Wait, so that's it? It's over?

375
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,851
There's nothing I can do for him.

376
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,163
It's not even getting dark out.

377
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,521
What's that?

378
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,287
It's 8:00 and it's raining outside,
but it's still light out.

379
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,443
Yeah, we're up north and...

380
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,041
Seriously. What's gotten into you?

381
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,724
You never even told me
where we were going.

382
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,647
And, how can you not hear that?

383
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,047
Thea, come on. We've been over this.

384
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,045
Seriously, listen, there's three chirps,

385
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,805
then a bark, then four chirps, and then
it just keeps repeating itself twice.

386
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,004
Okay, I think what's happening here
is you're beyond stressed...

387
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,847
No, okay. Alex, I am not stressed out.
Just listen.

388
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,048
There's gonna be a bark right now.

389
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,651
Since when did you start taking vitamins?

390
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,171
Now you're worried about my vitamins?

391
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,323
Where did you get those?

392
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,689
Ruvé. She said I needed to stay healthy.

393
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,046
Alex.

394
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,281
Where are we?

395
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,921
Is the reason that I don't
remember anything because you...

396
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,885
Did you drug me?

397
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,407
Thea, now you're talking crazy, okay?

398
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,567
No, I can't...

399
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,888
Where are you going? Thea?

400
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,366
What the hell, Johnny?
I told you to stand down!

401
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,961
I know. I know. But I couldn't...

402
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,441
You could've been killed!

403
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,404
I couldn't stand down,
not after what he did.

404
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,085
Then you are going to make
an orphan of your daughter,

405
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,250
because you are not seeing straight.
That's why tonight went south.

406
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,482
- It's okay.
- Lyla, listen, I know, I...

407
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,566
- I know I messed up.
- I know my head isn't on right,

408
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,120
but he's my brother.

409
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,291
And Laurel, she was like a sister.

410
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,131
I know. And it's horrible.

411
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,248
But, right now, Johnny,
you are not acting like the man I married.

412
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,646
You're the man I divorced.

413
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,807
Lyla, l...

414
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,641
I just wanted to help him...
To bring my brother back.

415
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,009
Then bring him to justice.
But do it the right way

416
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,166
I will. I will.

417
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,808
We'll find someone else
to teach you magic.

418
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,651
Someone with more patience
and less smelly incense.

419
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,526
She was right, you know?
It's not about the magic. It's about me.

420
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,646
If she didn't see anything
worthy inside you,

421
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,325
she never would have dealt with us.

422
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,650
She didn't deal with us.
She dealt with you.

423
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,121
She didn't reveal herself
until you offered her your chips.

424
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,689
That has always been the way
with us, Felicity.

425
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,962
You are the one who brings the light.

426
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,809
You know? I told you that I've seen magic
that's turned good people dark.

427
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,401
But all Fortuna did was
show me who I really am.

428
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,405
Don't do this.

429
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,251
Every time you face a setback,
you throw yourself a pity party.

430
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,643
This is not a "pity party."
It's acceptance.

431
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,370
You said it yourself. No matter what I do,

432
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,089
I'm always gonna revert back to the person
I became on the island.

433
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,928
You know, when I said that I was hurt.

434
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,086
I was going through one of the most
painful experiences of my life.

435
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,405
Oliver, you are not perfect.
None of us are.

436
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,924
Good news is,
is that all of us can change.

437
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,443
DARHKI Hmm.

438
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,048
Poor widdle Andy Diggle.

439
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,611
Did your big brother knock your noggin?

440
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,969
Bravo. Your performance was pitch perfect.

441
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,402
Thank you, sir.

442
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,085
I assume the tracker's in place?

443
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,565
We've already locked in on his location.

444
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,926
Well, then I believe it's time
for one last family reunion.

445
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,845
Oh, come on.

446
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,371
You're a bigger baby than Sara.

447
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,321
Ouch.

448
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,609
Is there anything else you can tell me
about their lockup?

449
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,241
Yeah, the place could've really used
some central heating.

450
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,843
Well, it was strange.

451
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,281
Torture just didn't seem
like the right play.

452
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,851
Why not just kill me?

453
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,521
What's that?

454
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,201
Proximity alarm.

455
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,887
Sweetheart, make sure
Sara's strapped in really tight.

456
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,890
- How's Sara?
- She's okay.

457
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,088
It's Director Michaels.
We have a code black.

458
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,968
We have two more bogies.
How the hell did they find us?

459
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,164
It's me. Andy let me go.
He probably tagged me with a tracker.

460
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,163
You can blame yourself
after we get out of this.

461
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,131
You mean, if we get out of this.
Where's your backup?

462
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,131
HIVE has them engaged elsewhere.

463
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,602
A.R.G.U.S. headquarters.
Where's your team?

464
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,122
They're not answering.
So much for "stay available."

465
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,364
We're on our own.

466
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,447
This rig was designed
to withstand just about anything.

467
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,770
Does that include magic?

468
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,291
It's me he's after. I'll draw him out.

469
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,121
No. If you were Darhk's objective,
he already had you.

470
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,567
He wanted you to lead him to me.

471
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,324
- What are you talking about?
- You need to get out of here now.

472
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,845
- Lyla, I'm not leaving you.
- Johnny.

473
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,405
I am not Amanda Waller.

474
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,371
If they use you against me,
I will give them whatever they want.

475
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,800
I need you both safe.

476
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,928
Oh, that was a fun bit of business.

477
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,001
Get him.

478
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,281
Ah!

479
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,287
You are a feisty one, Ms. Michaels.
You had your fun.

480
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,522
It's time for me to have mine.

481
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,125
Oh, it's been a while
since I've hit anybody with this thing.

482
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,327
I didn't think you got my message.

483
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,000
Sorry we're late.
Oliver's on Lyla and Darhk.

484
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,521
- Baby Sara.
- Oh. Hi. Hi, little one.

485
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,966
- Yeah. You got her?
- Yeah, yeah.

486
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,645
_OkaY-_OkaY-

487
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,361
All right.

488
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,961
Okay.

489
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,528
It's a small world, isn't it?

490
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,451
Your brother-in-law
being my loyal servant.

491
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,446
Thanksgiving at your home
is gonna be so interesting this year.

492
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,007
You seem like a likable guy, Oliver.
I bet you've got a lot of friends.

493
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,686
I'm going to enjoy
killing every last one of them.

494
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,924
No. Never again.

495
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,321
I bet you regret not pulling that trigger
the first time around.

496
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,731
What are you gonna do, John?

497
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,206
After Laurel, I left you alone to grieve.
I was being nice.

498
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,802
You have no idea
how much I hate being nice.

499
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,447
It isn't over.

500
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,449
You haven't been paying attention, Andy.

501
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,406
Darhk got out. I got out.
I'll get out again.

502
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,162
That mobile safe-house you've got
looked really homey.

503
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,403
Bet it gets cramped once Sara gets older.

504
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,167
Shut up.

505
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,930
She's gotta go to school eventually.

506
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,203
And Lyla, well, you can't watch her 24/7.

507
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,483
I said, "Shut your mouth," Andy.
Shut your damn mouth!

508
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,448
You're the one who's obviously
not payin' attention. Because this is war.

509
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,406
And women, children,
they're expendable in your war?

510
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,648
Genesis is coming, John.

511
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,611
Lyla and Sara won't be
the only women and children who die.

512
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,807
Tell me, how does it feel knowing that
you had no problem pulling the trigger

513
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,646
to protect a bunch of Afghanis
that you never knew,

514
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,363
<i>but you don't have the guts
to do what's necessary,</i>

515
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,324
to protect your own wife and child?

516
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,405
How's Lyla?

517
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,081
Um...

518
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,047
She's fine.

519
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,281
She's... Uh...

520
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,567
She unconscious, but she's fine.

521
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,448
Felicity's taking her and Sara back.
Darhk is... Darhk's in the wind.

522
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,689
John, what happened?

523
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,451
He was never gonna back off, Oliver.

524
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,685
My family,

525
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,249
they were never gonna be safe.

526
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,410
- Hey.
- Hi.

527
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,048
- Did you get in touch with Thea?
- Not yet.

528
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,247
You Okay?

529
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,001
Earlier, with Darhk, it worked.

530
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,610
He tried to use his magic on me,
and I was able to repel it.

531
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,881
That's incredible.

532
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,885
How'd you do it?

533
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,881
I heard your voice in my head.

534
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,083
You were reminding me
of all the good things

535
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,611
that I have in my life.

536
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,649
I heard Thea, I heard John.

537
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,686
I heard Laurel.

538
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,643
Just telling me to keep fighting,
to never give up.

539
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,688
Just telling me to have hope.

540
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,921
Hey-

541
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,041
- Sara? Where's Sara?
- No, no, no. She's fine. She's fine.

542
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,248
Felicity took her to Donna. She's okay.

543
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,561
But something's wrong.

544
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,841
I, um...

545
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,882
I had to put him down, Lyla.

546
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,126
(And)'-

547
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,641
I had to kill my baby brother.

548
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,080
He wasn't a brother to you, Johnny.

549
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,444
Not in the ways that really matter.

550
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,570
What happened?

551
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,889
He reached for my gun.

552
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,324
I didn't have a choice.

553
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,965
- Oh, no. No, no, no.
- What? What?

554
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,684
It's gone. Darhk took it.

555
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,201
Took what?

556
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,526
Rubicon.

557
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,763
I thought Rubicon was being stored
at A.R.G.U.S.

558
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,129
It was,
until Shadowspire tried to steal it.

559
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,850
After Waller's death, I had it moved
for security reasons.

560
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,041
To where?

561
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,001
It was under your skin?

562
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,329
A subdermal implant. Darhk ripped it out.

563
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,364
Lyla, you need to tell us what Rubicon is.

564
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,128
A ballistic launch override protocol,

565
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,402
designed to prevent any country,
even our own,

566
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,090
from firing a nuclear missile.

567
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,329
Something tells me
Darhk's plans aren't so benign.

568
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,404
<i>With some work
and the right expertise,</i>

569
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,244
<i>Rubicon could be corrupted.</i>

570
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,367
Instead of controlling nukes
to prevent them from being launched...

571
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,527
Oh, my God.

572
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,529
Darhk would control
the world's nuclear stockpile.

573
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,167
To what end? I don't mean to apply logic
to a bad guy's plot here,

574
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,887
but Darhk destroys the world, then what?
He'd be ruler of nothing.

575
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,642
Unless he wants to rebuild.
Andy told me that "Genesis" was coming.

576
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,968
I don't think so. Phil Collins said
they'd never tour again.

577
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,925
The Old Testament. The book of Genesis.

578
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,847
God wanted to give the world a do-over
so he destroyed it.

579
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,485
He destroyed it with a flood.

580
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,930
Rubicon is Darhk's flood.

581
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,681
<i>So, nuclear annihilation
is Darhk's flood,</i>

582
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,642
what's he planning on building as his ark?

583
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,881
English - SDH
