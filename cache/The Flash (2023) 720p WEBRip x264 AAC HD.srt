1
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:29,652
- Have a brilliant day.
- Yeah, thank you.

2
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:30,983
You too.

3
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,532
Morning. What can I get you?

4
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:35,835
- Where's curly-hair lady?
- Sara?

5
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:37,382
She's out sick. Or at least,

6
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:38,800
- that's what she says.
- Oh.

7
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:40,435
She's
got a new boyfriend.

8
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:41,937
What can I get you?

9
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:44,689
Usually it's my usual and she usually
has it ready because I'm usually late.

10
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:46,541
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

11
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:49,065
Um, it's a PB and
BRHC on a roll.

12
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,163
Okay, so...

13
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:52,585
- "PB" would be peanut butter, I'm assuming?
- Yes.

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,134
"BR," bananas, raisins. "H,"
honey. "C," cheese on a roll.

15
00:00:55,158 --> 00:00:57,421
Aren't you blessed
with a fast metabolism.

16
00:00:57,465 --> 00:00:59,397
Are you running a
marathon or something?

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,637
You know, my sister ran a
marathon once, God rest her soul.

18
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:04,826
She's not dead.
She's just exhausted.

19
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,381
We get it, Sharon. You ran.

20
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:09,129
But everyone has to
work in the morning.

21
00:01:09,172 --> 00:01:10,851
Yeah, I have to go to
work, three minutes ago.

22
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:13,052
And, sorry, I'm in sort of
a rush for the sandwich.

23
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:16,413
You can't rush a
good sandwich, dude.

24
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,746
Alfred,
really can't talk.

25
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:23,143
Good morning, Mr. Allen.

26
00:01:23,186 --> 00:01:24,444
No, I'm late.

27
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:26,194
And I'm starving, and
curly-haired girl isn't here

28
00:01:26,223 --> 00:01:27,437
and her name is Sara,
and she has a boyfriend.

29
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,602
We have a situation
at Gotham General.

30
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:31,281
A robbery gone wrong.

31
00:01:31,306 --> 00:01:33,221
This is the middle
of the morning.

32
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:35,727
Why is our bat-friend
even awake?

33
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:37,347
Call Superman.

34
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:39,159
That was my first thought.

35
00:01:39,202 --> 00:01:41,204
Sadly, he's otherwise engaged.

36
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:42,965
- active volcano in Central America.
- Classic.

37
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:43,946
What about Diana?

38
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,304
My other first thought.

39
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:47,304
Rather annoyingly,
she's not picking up.

40
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:50,407
How many first thoughts, exactly, did
you have before you first thought of me?

41
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:52,041
...never about her.

42
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:53,323
- This is about you.
- Hi, sorry. Is my sandwich...

43
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,565
I learned my lesson

44
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:55,843
on the boat last year.

45
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:57,897
Stuff my sister comes out
with when she's drunk.

46
00:01:57,922 --> 00:02:00,093
Personal comments about
my mom's friends as well,

47
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:01,946
which I think is what
I say about her...

48
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:13,996
Oh, my God!

49
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,935
Flash!

50
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:17,849
- Hi. Thank you.
- I love you.

51
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:19,851
- You seem very nice also.
- Oh, my God!

52
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:21,810
- No way!
- I think I'm gonna die!

53
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:23,464
Patching you into Mr. Wayne.

54
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:24,741
No, please don't.

55
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:25,408
Oh, my God.

56
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:28,827
Sorry if this sounds weird, but are
you actively eating that candy bar?

57
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,993
Maybe you could throw it to me?

58
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:32,908
- In the name of justice.
- Yes, yes.

59
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,910
I need you
here now, Barry.

60
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:36,890
Hi, Bruce. Yes, I'm...

61
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:37,873
coming.

62
00:03:40,323 --> 00:03:41,977
No!

63
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,022
No, no!

64
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,075
Bruce, this is a huge mess.

65
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,250
Why aren't you here?

66
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:16,229
Bruce, why does
it sound like you're fleeing the scene?

67
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:19,841
Falcone's idiot kid decided to
try to play in the big leagues.

68
00:04:19,866 --> 00:04:22,652
He put a crew together and broke
into the lab at Gotham General.

69
00:04:22,677 --> 00:04:24,897
Stole a highly deadly virus.

70
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:28,099
I intercepted them, but
they blasted their way out.

71
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:29,936
You can handle the
hospital, Barry.

72
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:32,070
Somebody has to save the rest of
the world, so I was gonna do that.

73
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:33,357
If you don't mind.

74
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:34,831
Sounds about right, Bruce.

75
00:04:55,268 --> 00:04:57,313
"Thanks for saving me
from the sinkhole, Flash."

76
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:59,533
Barry, gas and water
pipes ruptured.

77
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:01,100
In the basement.

78
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:02,101
Right.

79
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:04,502
On it.

80
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,291
Can you open it?

81
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:19,988
- I think it's locked.
- It's jammed.

82
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:21,708
God, it's not working!

83
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,087
Oh, please!

84
00:05:33,116 --> 00:05:35,118
Look, Alfred.
I've come to accept

85
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:38,059
that I'm essentially the
janitor of the Justice League.

86
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:39,433
Which sucks.

87
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:41,531
But I've come to accept it.

88
00:05:41,556 --> 00:05:42,644
But...

89
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:44,541
I can't help but notice...

90
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:47,395
that it always seems
to be a bat-mess...

91
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,743
that I'm cleaning up.

92
00:05:51,672 --> 00:05:53,630
- Right this way. Eyes forward.
- Yes.

93
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:56,024
- Stay together, now.
- Yeah, I know, right?

94
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,294
Look out!

95
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,481
- Wow. Whoa.
- What?

96
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,699
If my calculations are correct,

97
00:07:02,743 --> 00:07:04,962
and history will prove
they usually are,

98
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:09,532
the foundational damage is about to
cause the collapse of the east wing.

99
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:12,796
- East wing's fine.
- All right, I got you.

100
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,624
Which is good because
my speed is lagging.

101
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,036
Running on empty, Alfred.

102
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,280
Do you hear that?

103
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:19,281
That's my stomach.

104
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:26,201
No, no.

105
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,445
It's the collapsing east wing.

106
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,700
Barry, 30th floor.

107
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:48,223
There's a baby...

108
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,226
Shower.

109
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:20,419
Oh!

110
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:22,377
Oh!

111
00:10:34,911 --> 00:10:36,173
Mr. Allen,

112
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:38,654
you've made me very proud.

113
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:40,351
And a lot of mothers very happy.

114
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:41,396
Oh!

115
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:48,534
Yeah.

116
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:51,362
Okay.

117
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:54,714
I understand that these events
can be psychologically scarring.

118
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:57,891
You should seek the services of
a mental health professional.

119
00:10:57,934 --> 00:11:00,937
The Justice League is not
very good at that part yet.

120
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:02,286
Trust me.

121
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,157
God.

122
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:45,155
Shake him off!

123
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,336
If that briefcase
falls into the water,

124
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,034
it could wipe out half
of Gotham by lunchtime.

125
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:42,865
- Damn it.
- Please don't drop me.

126
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:46,173
Oh, God, no. Please,
please don't.

127
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:47,217
No!

128
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,051
Sorry I'm late.

129
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:01,884
Watch your step.

130
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:04,408
- Hi.
- Hey.

131
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,238
Nice suit.

132
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:09,500
Looking good, Flash.

133
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:11,546
Oh, uh... Thank... Uh...

134
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:13,983
And you...

135
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:15,581
are welcome.

136
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:17,841
My ego's far too big to say
"thank you" to someone else.

137
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:18,867
Hmm.

138
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,792
I developed this...

139
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,503
all-powerful persona to compensate
for my childhood trauma...

140
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:27,138
I, too, have childhood trauma.

141
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:28,933
Batman seems crazy.

142
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,533
-The Lasso of Truth...
-Billion dollar. She's the mother...

143
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:33,496
never gets old.

144
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:35,851
I'd do a lot better just giving all my money away. Yes,
if I really wanted to end crime, I should end poverty.

145
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,730
I know sex exists.

146
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:39,887
I've just never experienced it.

147
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:42,138
Damn it.

148
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:43,375
Well...

149
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,924
I have to run.

150
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,385
Yeah.

151
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,839
Always a pleasure.

152
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:52,664
The sex thing was a metaphor...

153
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:54,527
for gothic literature.

154
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:56,436
There was just no way
to recover from that.

155
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,199
Just let it go.

156
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,657
Well, I'd really love to stay
and clean up more mess...

157
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:03,902
but this little superhero
needs his breakfast.

158
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,755
Goodbye, Flash.

159
00:14:05,818 --> 00:14:07,254
Yeah. Bye, Batman.

160
00:14:08,326 --> 00:14:10,035
Well done, Mr. Wayne.

161
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,894
Will you be home
for breakfast, sir?

162
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:17,067
Yes, I think so.

163
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:20,406
The road to destruction.

164
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:22,564
This was never about her.

165
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:24,108
This is about you.

166
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,941
You have to stop
living in the past.

167
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:29,160
Now, was that fast
enough for you?

168
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,551
Morning, professor...

169
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:42,412
Ah, look who's here.

170
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:43,703
Shut up, Albert.

171
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:46,172
Every day. I don't know
how you do it, Barry.

172
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:47,860
What'd you, like,
crawl here, bro?

173
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:49,589
- Is he mad?
- Well, you're getting fired.

174
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:51,461
- You're getting murdered.
- Oh, no, no, no.

175
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:52,835
Let me guess.

176
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:54,670
Your alarm clock didn't go off.

177
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:57,611
- No...
- Oh, your dog ate your alarm clock.

178
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,647
Your alarm clock ate your keys.

179
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:02,631
Your keys' grandmother died,
and they need a personal day.

180
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:04,982
- It was none of those things.
- What was it this time, Barry?

181
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:06,835
It was, um, something else

182
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,601
that was far less outlandish.

183
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:10,864
And I know I missed
the meeting...

184
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:12,823
but I'd still really like to present
these case files for potential review.

185
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:14,284
I think we rushed these cases.

186
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:16,224
- We need to reopen them.
- Oh! Rushed?

187
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,326
We got a backlog six months deep,
and you want us to move slower?

188
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:21,425
You need to focus your motion.

189
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,931
Do the work, close
the case, move on.

190
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:28,114
You have a lot of
potential, Barry.

191
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,968
You shouldn't still be getting
me coffee after all these years.

192
00:15:30,993 --> 00:15:33,691
You're right.
That's... That's true.

193
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:34,769
Go get me a coffee.

194
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:40,564
- Two sugars? Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

195
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:55,800
You're gonna love this.

196
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:57,644
I'm very satisfied with the
ruling in the Johnson case.

197
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:00,246
The evidence our lab analyzed...

198
00:16:00,271 --> 00:16:03,714
was more than sufficient
to be conclusive.

199
00:16:03,739 --> 00:16:06,437
- I'm still working that evidence.
- Because of the diligence

200
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:08,551
and hard work and focus...

201
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:11,100
Barry was still working
on that evidence.

202
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,706
Think if it were up to you

203
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:14,965
that we'd still be scraping
Ted Bundy's molars.

204
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,360
You know what? I'm so happy
you find this all so hilarious,

205
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:22,105
but we are dealing with real
people's lives, people's families.

206
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,306
And I don't think you can
grasp the gravity of that.

207
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:26,029
So, why don't you
leave me alone?

208
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:28,293
- Barry Allen?
- Iris West.

209
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:30,050
You...

210
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:32,356
know my full name also.

211
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:34,152
Yes, from school.

212
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:36,329
Aw, Barry, you didn't tell us
you had a friend from school.

213
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,202
- We actually didn't know that Barry had a friend.
- Wow.

214
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:40,025
Yeah, what
does that make it now?

215
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:41,093
- One?
- One.

216
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:43,533
You guys are so...

217
00:16:43,558 --> 00:16:45,560
Um, bye, you guys.

218
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:47,109
Okay. Oh, my God.
That was just...

219
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:48,706
Um...

220
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:50,994
They're not really my friends.
They're my work friends.

221
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,288
Do you work here?

222
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,815
Yes, I do.

223
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,667
God, it's been a long time, huh?

224
00:16:55,692 --> 00:16:57,476
Hmm.

225
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:59,895
I feel like we saw each other...

226
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:01,907
like a few years ago, right?

227
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,430
No, because...

228
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:05,824
we haven't seen
each other since...

229
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:06,868
college.

230
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:08,174
Ah.

231
00:17:08,217 --> 00:17:11,612
Maybe I was just
thinking about you.

232
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,832
Well, I'm really
glad I ran into you.

233
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,398
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

234
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,618
Your father's appeal
is tomorrow, right?

235
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,273
Yeah. How...

236
00:17:20,316 --> 00:17:21,927
Sorry, how do you
know about that?

237
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,929
I'm covering it for the paper.

238
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:24,886
Oh.

239
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,540
How is he holding up?

240
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:28,753
Um...

241
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:30,477
Are you asking for the paper?

242
00:17:30,502 --> 00:17:32,869
- No, I'm asking as a friend.
- Oh.

243
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:35,723
Although I'm sure the public
would want to know as well.

244
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,582
Well...

245
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:42,487
my only official comment
is that my dad is innocent.

246
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:43,470
Right.

247
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:45,300
I mean, no one...

248
00:17:45,363 --> 00:17:47,974
would want to believe that their
father killed their mother.

249
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:51,154
What do you mean, "believe"?
My dad shouldn't be in jail.

250
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,660
My mom should be alive. It's
not about what I believe.

251
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:56,850
- It's about what the truth is.
- Right. No, yes, that's...

252
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,354
Oh, my God. That's
what I meant.

253
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,300
Right.

254
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,910
Sorry, I have no official
comment at this time.

255
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,246
You
have a collect call

256
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:30,011
from the Iron
Heights Penitentiary.

257
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:33,300
- Do you wish to accept?
- Yes.

258
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:35,167
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Barry.

259
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:37,151
- How ya doing?
- I'm fine.

260
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:39,308
- You getting out much?
- Yeah.

261
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,722
Well, no. Uh, no.

262
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:45,072
But I, um, I ran into
an old college friend...

263
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:46,881
Iris West, today.

264
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:48,951
Didn't you have a
monster crush on her?

265
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:50,542
Well, she have a boyfriend?

266
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:54,223
- Why don't you ask her out?
- Dad, I, um...

267
00:18:54,248 --> 00:18:58,252
I had a friend run the old security
camera footage from the store...

268
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:00,845
through this new
program he's developed.

269
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,264
And it's crystal clear now.

270
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:04,420
It's just...

271
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:07,855
you never look up, Dad.

272
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,886
You can't see your face.

273
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:14,610
So, without new evidence
to support your alibi...

274
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:16,964
we're just gonna need to start
thinking about the next appeal.

275
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,105
No, uh-uh. You need to stop
worrying about your old man.

276
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,583
Do that, you might actually
have time for a girlfriend.

277
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,800
But Dad, I don't want...

278
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,218
We've done this before.

279
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:29,722
This was a last-ditch effort...

280
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:32,489
and we'll go through
the motions tomorrow.

281
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:34,675
I'm okay, really.

282
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,300
You know, sometimes I even think it's
probably easier for me to be in here

283
00:19:38,498 --> 00:19:39,586
than out there...

284
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:42,261
without her.

285
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,839
'Cause this way, I can
imagine she's alive...

286
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:47,626
out there living her life.

287
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:51,846
Barry?

288
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:54,122
Barry?

289
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,758
You there?

290
00:19:56,783 --> 00:19:58,393
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

291
00:19:58,418 --> 00:20:01,943
Hey, remember that sauce
she'd make on Sundays?

292
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:05,841
The whole house would
smell like basil, tomatoes.

293
00:20:05,866 --> 00:20:08,503
And she'd put on my
sweats and start singing.

294
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:12,518
Yeah, what was that song?

295
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,297
I loved that song.

296
00:20:14,322 --> 00:20:15,792
Remember that part.

297
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,570
It's not fair.

298
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:24,205
What's not fair, Monkey?

299
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:26,634
This question is stupid.

300
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,793
How many calculations can you
think of with an answer of 24?

301
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:31,405
There are a bajillion answers.

302
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,019
How am I supposed
to fit them all?

303
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:36,531
You are right. There are a
bajillion answers to this question.

304
00:20:36,556 --> 00:20:38,993
Not every problem
has a solution.

305
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,690
Sometimes you just
have to let go.

306
00:20:42,036 --> 00:20:45,167
Give your brain a rest and help
me make the pasta. Come on.

307
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:48,871
No.

308
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:49,897
Henry?

309
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:53,032
I need you to do me a favor.

310
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:55,156
- I don't do favors.
- Okay.

311
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:57,009
Barry needs you
to do him a favor.

312
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:59,308
Oh, Barry! Yeah, anything.

313
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,585
I need another can of tomatoes.

314
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:03,907
You have a can of tomatoes.

315
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:05,316
I need another one.

316
00:21:05,354 --> 00:21:07,158
I thought you guys went
to the store this morning.

317
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,242
But I forgot the tomatoes.

318
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:12,175
This looks way more fun.

319
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,202
Let's just let Barry
go to the store.

320
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:15,738
You drive, right, Squirm?

321
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:17,112
- What? No.
- Getting so big.

322
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:19,226
You can do anything.
Look at ya.

323
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:20,881
You're getting gray, actually.

324
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:23,256
- Green can, not the blue one, okay?
- Got it.

325
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,144
Blue can, not the
green one, right?

326
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:27,345
- No! Green can, not the blue one.
- What?

327
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,350
Oh, God.

328
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:34,550
She's gonna start singing. Run!

329
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:36,775
Run, Barry!

330
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,165
I love you, Monkey.

331
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:58,009
I love you more.

332
00:21:58,034 --> 00:21:59,383
I loved you first.

333
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,787
Nora?

334
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:21,594
Barry!

335
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:30,858
Barry! Barry!

336
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:32,819
Call 911 now!

337
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,032
Barry?

338
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,146
Barry?

339
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:49,129
Don't worry about tomorrow.

340
00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:50,720
We always knew it
was a long shot...

341
00:22:51,952 --> 00:22:53,613
Dad?

342
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:57,958
Your call with Iron
Heights Penitentiary has been terminated.

343
00:24:44,164 --> 00:24:45,991
Barry Allen?

344
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:51,110
...evidence our lab...

345
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:52,746
You need to focus your motion.

346
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:53,859
Do the work...

347
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:58,347
She promised...

348
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,259
Now, was that
fast enough for you?

349
00:25:44,473 --> 00:25:46,954
So, you're saying
you went back in time?

350
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:48,402
- Mm-hmm.
- Like in Pozharnov?

351
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:50,949
Yeah, like in
Pozharnov, except, but Pozharnov was a second.

352
00:25:50,974 --> 00:25:52,454
This time I went
back a whole day.

353
00:25:52,544 --> 00:25:53,839
So, let's imagine...

354
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:56,784
that it is, in fact,
possible for you to run...

355
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:58,333
faster than the
speed of light...

356
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:00,578
and in so doing,
travel back in time.

357
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,064
It still would be...

358
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:05,353
wildly irresponsible.

359
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:06,667
I knew you were gonna say this.

360
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:09,214
Yes, because, Barry, if you
were to go into the past,

361
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:12,067
any interaction you have with
your parents or yourself,

362
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:13,691
you step on the
wrong blade of grass,

363
00:26:13,716 --> 00:26:16,507
you have no idea what the
consequences to that could be.

364
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:18,534
No, I know. The
butterfly effect, right?

365
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,605
- Yes.
- I get it. But Bruce...

366
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,153
I could fix things.

367
00:26:22,178 --> 00:26:25,285
You could also
destroy everything.

368
00:26:25,528 --> 00:26:27,660
I could save her.

369
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:30,371
I could save both of them. I...

370
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:33,463
I could save your parents.

371
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:37,459
Barry, these scars we have...

372
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:39,703
make us who we are.

373
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:43,427
We're not meant to
go back and fix them.

374
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:46,499
And there's nothing broken with
you that needs to be fixed.

375
00:26:48,786 --> 00:26:51,266
Take it from an old guy
who's made a lot of mistakes.

376
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:53,411
Don't live your past.

377
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:56,339
Live your life.

378
00:26:56,442 --> 00:26:58,964
Don't let your
tragedy define you.

379
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:00,956
What if it's supposed
to define me?

380
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:04,355
Your tragedy made you a hero.

381
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:06,958
And also made me alone.

382
00:27:09,622 --> 00:27:11,711
We could hang out.

383
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:13,215
I mean, do you wanna get a bite?

384
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,155
Like, I'm still hungry.

385
00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:18,044
Not this time.

386
00:27:19,698 --> 00:27:21,047
Maybe some other time.

387
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:24,572
Yeah.

388
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,628
Nice ride.

389
00:27:37,585 --> 00:27:39,277
You have fancy friends.

390
00:27:39,302 --> 00:27:41,197
Yeah, it was an Uber.

391
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,066
Exec.

392
00:27:43,786 --> 00:27:45,550
Look, Iris, I really can't
talk about the case at all.

393
00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:48,052
I'm not here as a reporter.

394
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:51,057
Can we talk?

395
00:27:56,386 --> 00:27:57,997
Come on in.

396
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:06,448
I'm not gonna lie. It's a lot
tidier in here than I expected.

397
00:28:06,473 --> 00:28:08,605
- Yeah? Yeah, well, um...
- Yeah.

398
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,566
I'm a pretty tidy person.

399
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:17,590
- Can I offer you a drink?
- Sure.

400
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:18,713
I'll take a beer.

401
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:21,613
Hmm.

402
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,362
Beers, beers, beers.

403
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,068
I keep 'em in my fridge.

404
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:37,964
Thanks.

405
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:39,604
Sure.

406
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:43,494
Look, I feel really bad

407
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,781
about earlier.

408
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,378
I should've been more sensitive.

409
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:56,451
And, um, I probably could've
been less sensitive.

410
00:28:56,754 --> 00:28:59,285
I mean, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

411
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:02,322
It's like you lost both
parents in one day.

412
00:29:02,947 --> 00:29:04,219
I did.

413
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:05,949
I lost my mom to a tragedy,

414
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:09,020
and I lost my dad to the
failures of the justice system.

415
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:12,190
Is that why you got
into criminal forensics?

416
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:13,730
To try and fix the system?

417
00:29:16,752 --> 00:29:18,292
Yeah.

418
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:19,839
Yeah, to fix it.

419
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:23,346
There's gotta be a
way to fix it, right?

420
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:26,069
I mean, that's kinda why I
got into journalism, too.

421
00:29:26,094 --> 00:29:28,277
I could make it right if I
could just go back somehow

422
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:31,461
and warn them without them
knowing that I'd warned them.

423
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:33,749
I... thinking like that's
gonna...

424
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:35,471
drive you crazy.

425
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,247
"If I could just
go back in time...

426
00:29:37,272 --> 00:29:38,488
and stop the guy
who did it." It's...

427
00:29:38,513 --> 00:29:40,929
No, I can't do that, 'cause
that's way too much interaction.

428
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,195
My dad wasn't even at home.

429
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,657
My mom sent him to go
get a can of tomatoes.

430
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:50,015
I think whoever broke into the
house thought it was empty.

431
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:52,218
And then my mom was in there
with the knife in her hand

432
00:29:52,243 --> 00:29:54,733
and things went bad,
just this absurd

433
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:56,042
chain of events.

434
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:59,441
And it's like, this footage should've
finally supported my dad's alibi.

435
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,800
But instead...

436
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:03,839
three lives ruined
for a can of tomatoes.

437
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:11,407
Oh, my God.

438
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:12,883
What?

439
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,996
Well, that could be it.

440
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:17,738
If my mom doesn't forget the
tomatoes in the first place,

441
00:30:17,763 --> 00:30:20,026
then he never leaves
and she never dies.

442
00:30:20,164 --> 00:30:22,862
No one would even
have to see me.

443
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,473
Bruce said no interaction.
This is no interaction.

444
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:25,894
This is just quick
in, quick out,

445
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,561
back to the present, like
I was never even there.

446
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:29,370
That's how I fix it.
Oh, my God, Iris.

447
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:30,933
- Hmm?
- Thank you, so much.

448
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,307
- This has been great.
- Oh.

449
00:30:32,358 --> 00:30:34,186
Um... I'm sorry.

450
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,855
I... I have to leave.

451
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,095
Okay. Right.

452
00:30:38,145 --> 00:30:40,496
Uh...

453
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:43,175
I had a really great time, by
the way. We should do this again.

454
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,920
Kal-El,
son of Krypton.

455
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:02,703
This is a bad idea.

456
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:10,493
So, you're fast.

457
00:31:14,236 --> 00:31:16,630
Your dad's a murderer.
Your dad's a murderer.

458
00:31:19,154 --> 00:31:22,680
Call 911 now!

459
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:24,710
Now!

460
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,368
Now!

461
00:31:27,393 --> 00:31:28,655
Now!

462
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:21,869
Hi, Mom.

463
00:32:34,882 --> 00:32:36,318
Don't forget the tomatoes.

464
00:32:38,886 --> 00:32:39,887
See you soon.

465
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:48,597
Please work.

466
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:02,388
Happy Birthday, Barry.

467
00:33:08,592 --> 00:33:11,116
- Go, Barry, hurry up.
- Go!

468
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:14,448
Congratulations
to the class of 2013!

469
00:33:18,962 --> 00:33:20,833
I love you so much.

470
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:25,821
Monkey!

471
00:34:26,928 --> 00:34:28,886
What are you wearing?

472
00:34:28,953 --> 00:34:31,912
Is that
Barry? And he's early?

473
00:34:31,956 --> 00:34:33,699
What universe is this?

474
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:35,639
You've cut your hair.

475
00:34:35,664 --> 00:34:38,319
Now you can see your eyes.

476
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:40,081
- You look terrible.
- Henry!

477
00:34:40,106 --> 00:34:41,767
- You look old.
- You look beautiful, baby.

478
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,576
What are they doing
to you over there?

479
00:34:43,601 --> 00:34:45,908
Leave him alone. He's perfect.

480
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:48,653
Come here.

481
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:52,427
I love you so much.

482
00:34:52,452 --> 00:34:54,454
I love you, too.

483
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,606
I love you more.

484
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:57,644
I loved you first.

485
00:34:57,903 --> 00:34:59,556
Go take a shower and change.

486
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:02,160
You smell like a
boot. Go, go, go.

487
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:06,472
"Old," seriously?

488
00:35:06,497 --> 00:35:08,151
Well, no, I mean like mature.

489
00:35:08,176 --> 00:35:10,134
He's at that age, he
wants to look old.

490
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:12,527
He, you know, gets
into bars that way.

491
00:35:12,552 --> 00:35:14,285
How can I help?

492
00:35:19,568 --> 00:35:22,571
Mm. Hey, Mom,
how was your day?

493
00:35:22,615 --> 00:35:24,617
How was your month,
or your last 18 years?

494
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,053
Or that's a weird question...

495
00:35:26,097 --> 00:35:27,620
'cause I was here.

496
00:35:27,645 --> 00:35:30,362
But obviously, we share
those memories together.

497
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:32,209
Or I don't know, maybe we
could make some new memories.

498
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:34,073
Like we could go to the
aquarium, or the circus,

499
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:35,976
or to the park and you
could push me on a swing.

500
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,935
That's also weird
because I'm an adult now,

501
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:40,111
so I'd probably motivate
my own motion on a swing.

502
00:35:40,154 --> 00:35:42,097
So, how was it this
week? How's school?

503
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:46,856
At school was... is good.

504
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,467
- Mm.
- School's been great.

505
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,252
I've just been working
really hard there on my...

506
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:52,480
studies.

507
00:35:52,505 --> 00:35:54,134
Did you ask out
that girl from econ?

508
00:35:54,342 --> 00:35:56,823
I know freshman year is about

509
00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:59,404
going out, meeting people, okay?

510
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:00,517
Exploring things.

511
00:36:01,101 --> 00:36:02,754
Experimenting.

512
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:06,854
But you have
to be very careful.

513
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:08,008
Oh, shit.

514
00:36:09,662 --> 00:36:11,207
I... have to shit.

515
00:36:12,882 --> 00:36:13,927
Outside.

516
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:21,844
Help!

517
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:23,436
Shh! Why are you here?

518
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,385
What year is it?

519
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:27,680
- No, no, no.
- Help!

520
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:35,035
That's my face.

521
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:37,027
You stole my face.

522
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:38,996
Think I'm having a
mushroom flashback?

523
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:40,910
- Is that a thing?
- How old are you?

524
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:43,348
Eighteen.

525
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:53,834
Whoa.

526
00:36:54,576 --> 00:36:56,274
This is mad trippy.

527
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:57,840
So, we're, like, in the future.

528
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:00,365
No, wait. This is
not trippy, dude.

529
00:37:00,408 --> 00:37:04,543
This is catastrophic. And no, we're not in the
future. I was supposed to be back in the present,

530
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:05,707
but I'm still in the past.

531
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:07,746
And there's not supposed
to be two of me.

532
00:37:07,802 --> 00:37:09,997
You and I are not supposed to be
occupying the same reality at all,

533
00:37:10,022 --> 00:37:11,715
let alone interacting.

534
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,136
I just can't believe I'm a
superhero who time travels...

535
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:17,183
No, no, no. You
are not anything.

536
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:20,038
Which is good. You don't want
to be a superhero. It's scary.

537
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:23,502
And I get bug splatter
in my teeth all the time.

538
00:37:23,953 --> 00:37:25,303
Awesome.

539
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:27,087
Hey, do the thing again.

540
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:28,324
No, we don't have time.

541
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:32,353
- Mom!
- Shh!

542
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:34,117
What are you doing?
You're gonna tattle now?

543
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:36,738
- Do the thing.
- Fine.

544
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,712
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Happy?

545
00:37:43,756 --> 00:37:44,757
Now undo it.

546
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:02,288
I can't, I can't.

547
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:04,337
Ow.

548
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:06,886
Barry, are
you okay up there?

549
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:08,514
We're fine! I'm fine!

550
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:10,150
Okay, Monkey.

551
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:12,830
So, do you have like a
plane that goes underwater?

552
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:15,467
Or like a boat that can fly?

553
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:16,667
How old are you, like 40?

554
00:38:16,692 --> 00:38:18,737
Okay, you don't stop talking.

555
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:21,852
It's not charming. It's
abrasive and exhausting.

556
00:38:21,877 --> 00:38:24,793
And, oh, my God. I am starting
to realize what people mean.

557
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:26,199
Just...

558
00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:27,668
do me a favor

559
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:31,301
and promise me that meeting me
isn't gonna screw up space-time.

560
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,892
Broski...

561
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:34,730
I got you.

562
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:36,105
Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

563
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:37,299
What do you mean?

564
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:39,638
What do I do?

565
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,340
I could drug you.

566
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:43,671
Yeah, I could drug you,

567
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,109
and then you'd pass
out, you'd wake up

568
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:46,621
and you'd forget that
anything ever happened.

569
00:38:46,646 --> 00:38:48,268
And it wouldn't be wrong,
right? Because you're me.

570
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:49,988
No! I mean, we shouldn't.

571
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:52,365
- Please don't... drug me.
- No.

572
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,194
No. Because here's the thing,
and I thought about it before.

573
00:38:54,218 --> 00:38:55,741
I don't want to be drugged.

574
00:38:55,784 --> 00:38:58,831
But I'm sure we can
think of another way.

575
00:38:58,874 --> 00:39:00,311
Let's put on our
Barry thinking caps

576
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:02,313
and think of a
different solution

577
00:39:02,356 --> 00:39:03,792
for memory loss.

578
00:39:03,836 --> 00:39:05,751
Also, I'm a green belt...

579
00:39:05,794 --> 00:39:07,231
in the capoeira,

580
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:09,320
and I have extensively
studied wrestler,

581
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:12,061
and I could just go
frickin' lunatic on you.

582
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:13,300
Besides, I have
a date tonight...

583
00:39:16,283 --> 00:39:18,329
Okay.

584
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:20,437
How hard do you have to hit
someone to make them forget stuff?

585
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:23,160
If I hit you in the past,
will it hurt me in the future?

586
00:39:23,203 --> 00:39:24,987
Wait. You say you
have a date tonight?

587
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:26,685
Yeah. Wait, what
were you doing?

588
00:39:26,728 --> 00:39:28,643
Uh, nothing. Who's
your date with?

589
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:31,690
This super babe
in my econ class.

590
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:33,928
- Iris West?
- Oh, my God!

591
00:39:33,953 --> 00:39:35,259
Do we marry her?

592
00:39:35,284 --> 00:39:36,981
You're going on a
date with her tonight?

593
00:39:37,006 --> 00:39:38,604
That's why I need
Mom to do my laundry.

594
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:40,501
You don't even do
your own laundry?

595
00:39:40,568 --> 00:39:41,439
Do you?

596
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,676
Okay.

597
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,791
- I'm actually gonna go.
- What do you mean?

598
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:47,619
Enjoy your life. Do you.

599
00:39:47,662 --> 00:39:49,795
Change literally nothing.

600
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:52,165
- Um, I'll see you again never.
- I have a few more questions, though.

601
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,103
We have so much to
learn from each other.

602
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:56,497
Oh, great.

603
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:57,977
Well, you're leaving me.

604
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,935
And now the storm's
gonna ruin my date.

605
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:02,111
What day is it today?

606
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:05,854
Uh... Uh...

607
00:40:06,681 --> 00:40:07,900
Sunday?

608
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:08,901
No, the date.

609
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,637
It's September 29th.

610
00:40:13,471 --> 00:40:14,428
Shit.

611
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,171
This storm, this is the day.

612
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,608
- What day?
- The day I got my powers.

613
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,828
The day you get your powers.

614
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:25,570
- Powers?
- Listen...

615
00:40:25,613 --> 00:40:27,373
I can't tell you why I
traveled back in time,

616
00:40:27,398 --> 00:40:30,009
and I can't tell
you what I changed.

617
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,620
But, essentially, in
my version of reality,

618
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,753
I ended up interning at
the Central City Crime Lab

619
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:37,451
in my freshman year, and
that's where it happened.

620
00:40:37,495 --> 00:40:38,980
Well, happens.

621
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:42,021
Tonight, September 29, the
accident that gives me my powers.

622
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,675
And if you're not there...

623
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:45,677
in 30 minutes...

624
00:40:47,331 --> 00:40:48,810
then you won't get the powers.

625
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:51,639
Which means I don't
get the powers, maybe?

626
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:54,686
And then, that would
mean that I lose my way

627
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:56,688
of getting back in time
in the first place,

628
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:58,777
and then I literally have
no idea what happens.

629
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,779
Powers?

630
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:06,306
Wait, but what about
our date tonight?

631
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,178
She might be our future wife.

632
00:41:09,222 --> 00:41:12,051
There might not be a future...

633
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,879
if you don't come with me...

634
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,010
right now.

635
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:23,320
Eight minutes.

636
00:41:23,345 --> 00:41:25,280
How are we gonna to get
inside? What are you doing?

637
00:41:25,305 --> 00:41:26,631
Would you stop whining?

638
00:41:26,674 --> 00:41:29,155
This is gonna feel kinda weird.

639
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:54,311
We walk through the door.

640
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:57,550
Yes, it's okay.
It's called phasing.

641
00:41:57,575 --> 00:41:58,663
Come on.

642
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:02,797
I love phasing.

643
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:06,671
Uh-huh.

644
00:42:08,063 --> 00:42:10,065
Everybody moves.

645
00:42:33,828 --> 00:42:35,917
Well... this is it.

646
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:38,006
This is where I was sitting.

647
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,313
And actually, let me
take this for you.

648
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:41,662
Thank you.

649
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:44,121
Okay, I had just
opened those windows...

650
00:42:45,753 --> 00:42:47,668
to clear out the fumes.

651
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:49,931
Right around now.

652
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:51,890
And I was sitting in that chair,

653
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:53,733
and I was right under
this shelf of chemicals.

654
00:42:53,761 --> 00:42:55,763
And that's when
the lightning hits.

655
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,069
Wait.

656
00:42:57,112 --> 00:42:58,612
- I get hit by lightning?
- No, no, no.

657
00:42:58,636 --> 00:43:00,159
You don't get hit by lightning.

658
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,528
Okay, 'cause for a second
I thought you said...

659
00:43:01,552 --> 00:43:02,912
The lightning hits
the chemicals...

660
00:43:02,944 --> 00:43:04,555
which then you get bathed in,

661
00:43:04,598 --> 00:43:06,513
- and that's what electrocutes you.
- Okay,

662
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:08,361
- but I don't want to be electrocuted, though.
- Sit down.

663
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,517
- No, you sit down.
- I already have the powers!

664
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,667
You already have the powers!

665
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:12,621
Exactly!

666
00:43:12,646 --> 00:43:14,941
I am not getting
struck by lightning!

667
00:43:54,648 --> 00:43:55,519
It worked.

668
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,659
It looks like you lost a tooth.

669
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:11,056
Oh.

670
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,885
- No?
- You lost a tooth.

671
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:27,420
All right. We gotta go.

672
00:44:31,163 --> 00:44:32,773
What have we got?

673
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:34,514
The alarms
in the sterile lab.

674
00:44:34,558 --> 00:44:35,910
Go check it.

675
00:44:40,259 --> 00:44:41,832
Securing the entrance.

676
00:44:45,362 --> 00:44:46,668
We've gotta phase.

677
00:44:46,693 --> 00:44:48,129
Phase, phasing.

678
00:45:10,985 --> 00:45:12,857
Oh...

679
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:34,879
Shit!

680
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:40,711
I'm slow.

681
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:44,018
Oh. Oh.

682
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,590
Why is your
place so much nicer

683
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:52,655
- than I expected it to be?
- You like it?

684
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:54,681
Mom had to help decorate.

685
00:45:54,725 --> 00:45:55,900
You know Mom.

686
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:58,424
Right, yeah. Classic Mom.

687
00:45:58,467 --> 00:45:59,496
Classic Mom.

688
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:03,342
Hmm.

689
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:08,565
- What a day.
- Barry,

690
00:46:08,608 --> 00:46:09,957
the accident gave you powers,

691
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,611
but took mine away.

692
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:13,744
So, I don't know how I get back.

693
00:46:13,787 --> 00:46:15,180
Without access to
the Speed Force,

694
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:17,835
I don't know how I ever leave.

695
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:20,011
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

696
00:46:20,054 --> 00:46:22,143
- I might be stuck.
- Wait.

697
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:24,832
I have powers now?

698
00:46:25,669 --> 00:46:26,931
Yeah, but...

699
00:46:26,974 --> 00:46:28,527
you... No, no, no.

700
00:46:41,249 --> 00:46:44,078
Holy speedballs.

701
00:46:44,122 --> 00:46:46,341
Okay, I know this is
incredibly exciting,

702
00:46:46,385 --> 00:46:47,647
because I went through it.

703
00:46:47,691 --> 00:46:48,953
Speedy Gonzales!

704
00:46:48,996 --> 00:46:51,129
Yes, I've done it
many times myself.

705
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:53,087
You can't just start...

706
00:46:54,132 --> 00:46:55,655
Shit.

707
00:47:31,865 --> 00:47:33,084
Oh, my...

708
00:47:44,748 --> 00:47:45,705
Ahh!

709
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:09,163
Okay, I'm leaving!

710
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:21,001
Put your hands up.

711
00:48:36,887 --> 00:48:38,192
What did you do?

712
00:48:38,236 --> 00:48:40,107
Nothing. Why?

713
00:48:46,244 --> 00:48:47,269
Barry...

714
00:48:47,294 --> 00:48:49,626
I could've told you about
the clothes. It's friction.

715
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:51,803
You run too fast, and regular
fabrics are gonna burn up.

716
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:54,916
It's the same reason why you can't
move people very far at hyperspeed.

717
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:56,751
That broccoli looks rotten.

718
00:48:56,776 --> 00:48:58,256
Look, some things you can move.

719
00:48:58,299 --> 00:48:59,910
Like, you can move,

720
00:48:59,953 --> 00:49:02,452
for instance, a microwave.

721
00:49:02,477 --> 00:49:04,741
But you can't move
something like, say...

722
00:49:04,784 --> 00:49:06,037
- a baby.
- Barry,

723
00:49:06,062 --> 00:49:07,849
it's like I've never
eaten anything before.

724
00:49:07,874 --> 00:49:11,573
Everything has this vivid
flavor. Try a little.

725
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:13,445
Just take a little bite.

726
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:14,524
That's bad, isn't it?

727
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:16,462
Yeah, this is not
good. No, I was kidding.

728
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:18,425
I'm amazing. We're amazing.

729
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,712
I'm so hungry.

730
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,194
Hey, wait.

731
00:49:23,237 --> 00:49:25,283
I wanna try that phasing
thing. How do I do that?

732
00:49:25,326 --> 00:49:27,372
You don't. Not yet.

733
00:49:27,415 --> 00:49:29,181
Okay? It's very complicated.

734
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:31,772
Takes a long time to train your
body to be able to speed up

735
00:49:31,797 --> 00:49:33,775
whilst your molecules slow
down enough to pass through

736
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,758
the molecular structure
of solid objects...

737
00:49:38,949 --> 00:49:40,211
Get out of here!

738
00:49:46,957 --> 00:49:49,394
You've gotta start letting
me finish my sentences.

739
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:52,397
Are we always this sleepy?

740
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,834
And hungry and naked?

741
00:49:54,878 --> 00:49:56,673
Well, the first two, yes.

742
00:49:56,698 --> 00:49:59,230
The third one, no. I've
figured that part out.

743
00:49:59,273 --> 00:50:00,927
And honestly, if
we're gonna do this

744
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:02,929
there's a lot I'm gonna
have to explain to you.

745
00:50:02,973 --> 00:50:05,410
So, a good place
to start, I guess,

746
00:50:05,453 --> 00:50:08,195
is that, yeah, the original suit

747
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,399
was actually made out of this polysynth...

748
00:50:11,329 --> 00:50:12,721
Or we'll

749
00:50:12,765 --> 00:50:14,636
pick this up tomorrow.

750
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,310
So, the
suit is inside the ring?

751
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:18,379
- Yeah.
- What?

752
00:50:19,511 --> 00:50:20,673
And I can have this?

753
00:50:20,698 --> 00:50:22,862
No, you can't have
it. You can borrow it

754
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:24,690
so you don't kill yourself
using your powers.

755
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:28,048
You're gonna push this button

756
00:50:28,073 --> 00:50:29,802
and the silk molecules are gonna
uncoil, absorbing atmospheric gases

757
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,566
and expanding the
suit to full size.

758
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:32,785
Ready?

759
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:52,345
It was so tiny...

760
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,435
You're supposed to put it
on before it hits the floor.

761
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:56,504
What, like change...

762
00:50:56,548 --> 00:50:58,158
right here in front of you?

763
00:50:58,202 --> 00:51:00,006
There's no one even here
anyway, Barry. Come on...

764
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:03,251
- Whoo, man.
- Tight.

765
00:51:04,121 --> 00:51:05,470
It hurts.

766
00:51:05,513 --> 00:51:06,993
You know where it hurts?

767
00:51:07,037 --> 00:51:09,343
- In my dick.
- Okay. I know, I know,

768
00:51:09,387 --> 00:51:11,041
but I don't need to know.

769
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:13,173
- Sorry, can we move on?
- Mm-hmm.

770
00:51:13,217 --> 00:51:14,871
Here's what I'm thinking.

771
00:51:14,914 --> 00:51:16,873
If I can train you
to move like I do,

772
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:18,285
then we can re-create
the Chronobowl.

773
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:19,310
Chronobowl?

774
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:20,311
In the Speed Force.

775
00:51:20,354 --> 00:51:21,688
Speed Force?

776
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:25,770
-And then maybe we can find some way to get me back to the future.
-Back to the Future. Yes!

777
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:27,231
Eric Stoltz

778
00:51:27,274 --> 00:51:29,642
is chur boy in that movie.

779
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:31,732
What an embodied performance.

780
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:33,585
You mean Michael J. Fox?

781
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:34,938
Back to the Future?

782
00:51:34,963 --> 00:51:38,003
- Yeah, in the movie Back to the Future?
- Oh, my God!

783
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,431
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

784
00:51:49,644 --> 00:51:50,964
You need to take
the suit off now.

785
00:51:50,994 --> 00:51:52,514
Thank God.

786
00:51:58,044 --> 00:51:59,979
...reported
seeing a mysterious object

787
00:52:00,003 --> 00:52:02,570
hovering above the
Australian seaboard.

788
00:52:02,614 --> 00:52:04,790
- We've obtained footage from the sighting...
- Zod.

789
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,942
- and as you can see, the object...
- "Zod"?

790
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:10,056
- appears to be a flying ship of some sort.
- What's a zod?

791
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,363
According to US
government officials,

792
00:52:12,406 --> 00:52:13,485
satellite data

793
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:16,013
has confirmed the
presence of a spacecraft.

794
00:52:16,038 --> 00:52:17,910
We'll be sure...

795
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:23,069
My name is General Zod.

796
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,551
I come from a world

797
00:52:26,594 --> 00:52:28,422
far from yours.

798
00:52:28,466 --> 00:52:30,990
For some time, your world

799
00:52:31,034 --> 00:52:34,733
- has sheltered one of my citizens.
- No, no, no.

800
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,182
- This can't be happening.
- I request that you return this individual...

801
00:52:37,207 --> 00:52:38,991
- Not now.
- To my custody.

802
00:52:39,016 --> 00:52:41,235
What's happening?

803
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,739
For reasons unknown...

804
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:44,438
Zod's looking for Superman.

805
00:52:44,482 --> 00:52:45,918
What's a superman?

806
00:52:47,941 --> 00:52:50,029
Superman is an
alien who lives on Earth.

807
00:52:50,053 --> 00:52:52,055
I'm assuming still incognito.

808
00:52:52,098 --> 00:52:55,145
But, yeah, he's an alien,
and he's very powerful,

809
00:52:55,188 --> 00:52:56,929
and he's just the best.

810
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:00,193
And then Zod is an alien
from the same planet,

811
00:53:00,237 --> 00:53:01,635
also very powerful,

812
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,153
but he's just the worst.

813
00:53:03,196 --> 00:53:06,025
And Zod came here to find Clark.

814
00:53:06,069 --> 00:53:08,985
- Wait, who's Clark?
- Clark is Superman.

815
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:11,074
- Oh. Okay.
- But then

816
00:53:11,117 --> 00:53:14,512
Zod also tried to terraform the
planet with this World Engine thing,

817
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:16,122
and Superman stopped
him eventually,

818
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:19,169
but not before Zod killed
thousands of people.

819
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:20,408
- Yeesh.
- And at the time,

820
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:23,276
there was nothing
I could do, I've...

821
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,352
Wait, you...

822
00:53:28,395 --> 00:53:29,752
You were there?

823
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:33,183
Yeah, I had just
gotten my powers.

824
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,188
And I was still putting some
finishing touches on my suit.

825
00:53:41,887 --> 00:53:43,721
This thing, Zod's World Engine,

826
00:53:43,746 --> 00:53:46,544
it started destroying
Metropolis, so I just went there

827
00:53:46,587 --> 00:53:49,199
and I started trying
to save people.

828
00:53:50,156 --> 00:53:51,027
Daddy?

829
00:53:52,506 --> 00:53:53,551
Listen to me!

830
00:53:53,594 --> 00:53:55,205
Run away!

831
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:56,119
Run away!

832
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,692
There was
this kid, and I...

833
00:54:04,736 --> 00:54:06,557
I got him, but then...

834
00:54:06,582 --> 00:54:08,305
I couldn't get his dad.

835
00:54:09,132 --> 00:54:11,047
Daddy!

836
00:54:28,151 --> 00:54:29,239
It was all I could do,

837
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:30,501
save that one kid.

838
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,374
Only Superman could stop Zod.

839
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:38,422
But not in time to
save those people.

840
00:54:38,465 --> 00:54:40,119
And now it's about
to happen again.

841
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:42,121
But...

842
00:54:42,165 --> 00:54:44,384
if I can find the
entire Justice League,

843
00:54:44,428 --> 00:54:46,517
Superman and the
rest of the band...

844
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,877
Right.

845
00:54:47,902 --> 00:54:49,757
Then maybe I can
prevent the whole thing

846
00:54:49,781 --> 00:54:51,522
from ever even happening at all.

847
00:54:54,742 --> 00:54:57,136
- Um, give me your laptop.
- Okay.

848
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,442
What is that smell?

849
00:54:58,485 --> 00:55:00,244
Ugh. Could be anything.

850
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,213
Honestly.

851
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:04,502
Who's that?

852
00:55:04,527 --> 00:55:06,965
Oh. That's Gary. That's
the smell. It's...

853
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,072
Don't worry. He's breezy.

854
00:55:10,885 --> 00:55:12,143
We can do this.

855
00:55:12,168 --> 00:55:14,924
Uh, let's see, Victor Stone,
Gotham City University.

856
00:55:17,746 --> 00:55:19,661
Oh, this is my roommate, Patty.

857
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:20,622
Patty...

858
00:55:20,647 --> 00:55:21,953
is your roommate?

859
00:55:21,978 --> 00:55:24,590
And that's her
boyfriend, Albert.

860
00:55:24,685 --> 00:55:26,078
What's up?

861
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:27,906
Good morning.

862
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,879
Oh, sorry. And, uh, guys...

863
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:34,027
This is my cousin.

864
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:35,696
Barry.

865
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:38,873
Whoa.

866
00:55:41,697 --> 00:55:42,524
I'm starving.

867
00:55:46,403 --> 00:55:47,730
Okay.

868
00:55:47,755 --> 00:55:49,381
Victor Stone, Gotham
City University.

869
00:55:49,406 --> 00:55:51,234
Yes. Here he is.

870
00:55:51,259 --> 00:55:53,348
Victor Stone, star
quarterback for the Knight...

871
00:55:53,373 --> 00:55:54,722
Shit, okay.

872
00:55:54,802 --> 00:55:56,195
He's not Cyborg yet.

873
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:58,719
Wonder Woman.

874
00:55:58,763 --> 00:56:00,068
Wonder Woman!

875
00:56:00,112 --> 00:56:02,636
Las Vegas residency.

876
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,204
Illusions, juggling, and zebras.

877
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:07,641
No. That is not Diana.

878
00:56:07,685 --> 00:56:09,556
- Aquaman.
- Aquaman?

879
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,210
Is that like a super mermaid?

880
00:56:11,254 --> 00:56:12,559
No, Albert,

881
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,170
he's not a super mermaid.

882
00:56:14,213 --> 00:56:16,433
Okay? He's half
Atlantean, half human

883
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:19,349
with superhuman strength who can
control marine life with his mind.

884
00:56:19,392 --> 00:56:20,587
So, like a super
mermaid?

885
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:21,761
No, Albert!

886
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:23,701
That is
what you described.

887
00:56:23,744 --> 00:56:25,572
We'll just
try Arthur Curry...

888
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:26,921
Maine...

889
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:29,750
lighthouse.

890
00:56:31,274 --> 00:56:33,450
Here we are. Thomas
Curry. That's his dad.

891
00:56:33,493 --> 00:56:34,386
Uh, phone.

892
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,410
Hello.

893
00:56:37,454 --> 00:56:39,456
- Hello, Thomas Curry?
- Yes.

894
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:41,066
Could I speak to Arthur?

895
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:42,459
Is Arthur around?

896
00:56:42,502 --> 00:56:44,504
You wanna speak to my dog?

897
00:56:44,548 --> 00:56:47,768
What? No, no. Um, sorry. Uh...

898
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:49,857
- Is this Thomas Curry?
- Yes.

899
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:52,643
- And you work at a lighthouse?
- Yes.

900
00:56:52,686 --> 00:56:54,862
Okay, and your wife is
the queen of Atlantis?

901
00:56:54,906 --> 00:56:57,187
- Will you accept this rose?
- Yes.

902
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,737
Uh, no.

903
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,521
Uh, right, but maybe, maybe...

904
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:04,089
um, a fishlike woman

905
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,379
washed into your life

906
00:57:06,483 --> 00:57:08,572
- at some point or another?
- Very funny, asshole.

907
00:57:11,575 --> 00:57:13,794
Arthur Curry was never born.

908
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:15,622
- What?
- This is a disaster.

909
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,320
I-I-I completely
destroyed history.

910
00:57:17,363 --> 00:57:18,886
Like Eric Stoltz.

911
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,473
Okay, why do you keep
saying, "Eric Stoltz"?

912
00:57:20,497 --> 00:57:21,933
Eric Stoltz is Marty McFly.

913
00:57:21,976 --> 00:57:23,326
- What?
- Time travel?

914
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:25,676
Oh. We talking "BTTF"?

915
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:26,851
Come on, who is this guy?

916
00:57:26,894 --> 00:57:28,331
Okay, yeah, no, I know.

917
00:57:28,374 --> 00:57:30,158
I've seen all of them

918
00:57:30,202 --> 00:57:32,726
and Eric Stoltz is
not Marty McFly.

919
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:33,597
Really?

920
00:57:35,512 --> 00:57:37,296
Then explain Marty McThigh here.

921
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,819
I can't explain
that to you, Gary.

922
00:57:38,863 --> 00:57:40,604
That's not your thigh.

923
00:57:40,647 --> 00:57:43,160
It's the wrong actor,
and it's upside down.

924
00:57:44,477 --> 00:57:46,044
Is it?

925
00:57:48,525 --> 00:57:50,048
The point is that

926
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,702
in Back to the Future

927
00:57:51,745 --> 00:57:55,183
Marty McFly is very famously
played by Michael J. Fox.

928
00:57:55,227 --> 00:57:56,489
The guy from Footloose?

929
00:57:56,533 --> 00:57:58,230
No, that's Kevin Bacon!

930
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,058
- Bacon.
- Kevin Bacon's Maverick

931
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,731
with the volleyball, the
gay guys, and the planes?

932
00:58:01,755 --> 00:58:03,670
-Top Gun.

933
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:05,672
- Top Gun, right?
- No, no, no.

934
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:07,761
I completely broke the universe.

935
00:58:10,155 --> 00:58:11,983
Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz.

936
00:58:12,026 --> 00:58:14,072
- Yes.
- Thank you.

937
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:17,554
I created a world
with no metahumans.

938
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:19,904
And now there's no one to
defend us from Zod. Albert!

939
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:23,995
There's no Cyborg.

940
00:58:24,038 --> 00:58:25,910
There's no Aquaman.
There's no Wonder Woman.

941
00:58:25,953 --> 00:58:27,781
There's no Superman.

942
00:58:27,825 --> 00:58:29,043
There's no Batman.

943
00:58:29,087 --> 00:58:30,175
I'm Batman.

944
00:58:32,395 --> 00:58:35,267
What, you... What
did you just say?

945
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,356
I'm Batman.

946
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,012
Batman exists?

947
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:42,250
- Hundo p.
- Yeah, dude.

948
00:58:42,274 --> 00:58:44,015
Nobody knows who he really is,

949
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:46,583
- but he exists.
- Right.

950
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:48,280
Well, uh, we...

951
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:49,977
my cousin Barry and I,

952
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:52,676
have to go to that
cousin's dinner.

953
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:54,417
Now.

954
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,375
But it was a pleasure to meet

955
00:58:56,419 --> 00:58:58,246
you all.

956
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,727
- And Gary.
- Barry.

957
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,076
- Barry.
- Gary.

958
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,121
Barry!

959
00:59:22,923 --> 00:59:25,143
What, are you frickin'
kidding me with this place?

960
00:59:29,147 --> 00:59:30,975
What is this, hell?

961
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:41,333
It's open.

962
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:56,269
- Look at all this cool shit!
- Okay, Barry, don't touch anything in here.

963
01:00:01,266 --> 01:00:02,267
Hello?

964
01:00:03,442 --> 01:00:04,965
Bruce?

965
01:00:06,358 --> 01:00:07,957
Bruce, are you there?

966
01:00:09,622 --> 01:00:11,145
Oh, boy.

967
01:00:13,915 --> 01:00:16,352
Hey, I didn't
know you painted.

968
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:17,543
They're good.

969
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,894
Bruce Wayne?

970
01:00:33,907 --> 01:00:34,821
Bruce?

971
01:00:44,483 --> 01:00:46,026
Hey, check
this out. There's, like,

972
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,878
bells connected to every
room in this house.

973
01:00:47,921 --> 01:00:49,575
Hey, maybe we can
find this Bruce guy...

974
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:51,882
if we just ring all
these bells, right?

975
01:00:51,907 --> 01:00:54,783
You don't understand how servant
bells work? Those are all the bells.

976
01:00:54,808 --> 01:00:57,245
- You ring them from all the other places.
- What?

977
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:59,359
You don't have, like, Downton
Abbeyin your universe?

978
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:01,065
Downtown Abbey's?

979
01:01:01,108 --> 01:01:03,110
The chain of, like,
family-style restaurants?

980
01:01:03,154 --> 01:01:05,504
They're like, it's like
cheaper Bananabee's.

981
01:01:05,548 --> 01:01:08,202
Oh, you know what I'd
really go for right now?

982
01:01:08,246 --> 01:01:10,683
Abbey's sizzlin'
zucchini squares.

983
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:17,734
Okay.

984
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:42,367
You know what, man?
I've had it with you.

985
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:19,796
Who the hell are you?

986
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:21,449
I'm the guy who lives here.

987
01:02:22,581 --> 01:02:25,062
We're looking for Bruce Wayne.

988
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,165
You hungry?

989
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,348
Following the broadcast
earlier from General Zod.

990
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,741
The individual
they're searching for

991
01:02:32,765 --> 01:02:35,115
- is still at large.
- So...

992
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:37,006
The president has yet to respond
to the broadcast from earlier,

993
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,902
and other foreign
leaders are said to be...

994
01:02:38,945 --> 01:02:40,773
you're the same person as him...

995
01:02:40,817 --> 01:02:43,559
- but from an alternate timeline.
- Yes.

996
01:02:43,602 --> 01:02:44,560
In which...

997
01:02:46,213 --> 01:02:47,606
you and I are friends?

998
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:50,696
Yeah, you're like
probably my best friend.

999
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,785
- Okay.
- Well, but you're a bit...

1000
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:54,787
you're, uh...

1001
01:02:54,831 --> 01:02:57,052
- chronologically different.
- Older.

1002
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:59,487
That's what I can't understand.

1003
01:02:59,531 --> 01:03:02,490
I traveled back in
time from here to here.

1004
01:03:02,534 --> 01:03:05,406
Yet somehow,
everything's all changed

1005
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:06,950
back here.

1006
01:03:06,975 --> 01:03:09,341
- Or like when you were born, so...
- Well...

1007
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:11,365
time isn't linear.

1008
01:03:11,456 --> 01:03:12,675
Right?

1009
01:03:12,718 --> 01:03:13,676
Right.

1010
01:03:16,401 --> 01:03:17,664
At some point

1011
01:03:17,689 --> 01:03:20,953
you probably saw a
movie that told you

1012
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:23,163
that if you went back
and changed the past,

1013
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:26,558
you'd create a kind of a
branched timeline, right?

1014
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:27,733
Like, look.

1015
01:03:31,084 --> 01:03:33,086
New present

1016
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,698
- and new future.
- Yeah.

1017
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:37,569
Well, time doesn't
work like that.

1018
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:38,875
That's not how time works.

1019
01:03:38,918 --> 01:03:40,920
When you go back
and change the past

1020
01:03:40,964 --> 01:03:43,009
you create a fulcrum.

1021
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:45,969
You put yourself on a whole
nother strand of spaghetti.

1022
01:03:47,231 --> 01:03:49,668
New future. New past.

1023
01:03:51,235 --> 01:03:52,628
It's retrocausal.

1024
01:03:52,671 --> 01:03:53,933
It goes both ways.

1025
01:03:53,977 --> 01:03:56,457
Actually, it goes many ways.

1026
01:03:56,501 --> 01:03:58,416
Maybe some other time.

1027
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:01,854
Okay, but in an ontological
paradox model, there's not...

1028
01:04:01,898 --> 01:04:04,683
What you did was you
changed the future

1029
01:04:04,727 --> 01:04:06,052
and you changed the past.

1030
01:04:06,729 --> 01:04:07,730
If a person

1031
01:04:07,773 --> 01:04:09,993
is stupid enough

1032
01:04:10,036 --> 01:04:11,559
to mess with time...

1033
01:04:11,603 --> 01:04:13,866
what you eventually
end up with is this.

1034
01:04:15,999 --> 01:04:17,914
The multiverse.

1035
01:04:17,957 --> 01:04:19,698
Some strands run

1036
01:04:19,742 --> 01:04:21,178
almost parallel.

1037
01:04:21,221 --> 01:04:23,876
There will be inevitable
intersections,

1038
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,835
and others that are just...

1039
01:04:25,878 --> 01:04:27,706
wildly divergent.

1040
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:28,708
What it is...

1041
01:04:30,258 --> 01:04:31,161
is a hot mess.

1042
01:04:32,842 --> 01:04:34,539
It's a crapshoot.

1043
01:04:34,582 --> 01:04:35,975
It's all just a crapshoot.

1044
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:37,317
What does the parmesan mean?

1045
01:04:37,342 --> 01:04:39,214
The metaphor's over.
It's just a garnish.

1046
01:04:39,264 --> 01:04:41,179
And I'll tell ya something.

1047
01:04:41,372 --> 01:04:43,239
A person would have to be

1048
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:44,854
an idiot

1049
01:04:44,897 --> 01:04:46,638
to play craps

1050
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:48,553
with the space-time continuum.

1051
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:50,120
Yeah, an idiot.

1052
01:04:51,774 --> 01:04:52,644
Here.

1053
01:04:54,774 --> 01:04:56,820
Mm.

1054
01:04:56,845 --> 01:04:59,390
Are you joking with the
chewing noises right now?

1055
01:04:59,433 --> 01:05:01,559
So, uh, you're the reason

1056
01:05:02,707 --> 01:05:04,012
this Zod character

1057
01:05:04,037 --> 01:05:06,387
is about to destroy the Earth?

1058
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:07,532
Maybe.

1059
01:05:07,557 --> 01:05:09,418
There's a guy called Superman

1060
01:05:09,443 --> 01:05:10,662
who can stop Zod?

1061
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,186
- Yeah, yeah.
- And flies?

1062
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,724
Shoots lasers out of his eyes?

1063
01:05:14,749 --> 01:05:17,165
Yes, he flies, and he shoots
lasers out of his eyes. Yes.

1064
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:18,452
No one said "Superman"...

1065
01:05:19,976 --> 01:05:22,587
that might be a
little on the nose?

1066
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,763
- You call yourself Batman.
- Yeah.

1067
01:05:24,807 --> 01:05:26,634
I don't call myself
Super Batman.

1068
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:31,030
Wait, he's Batman?

1069
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:33,032
What did you think
we were doing here?

1070
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:35,252
I thought this was
the cousin's dinner.

1071
01:05:35,295 --> 01:05:37,863
He's... Bruce Wayne is Batman?

1072
01:05:37,907 --> 01:05:39,604
Not really. Not
so much anymore.

1073
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,519
You know...

1074
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:42,868
they don't really need me.

1075
01:05:44,802 --> 01:05:47,065
Things have changed.
Gotham's now

1076
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:49,222
one of the safest
cities in the world.

1077
01:05:49,266 --> 01:05:51,355
Well, I... I need
you. We need you.

1078
01:05:51,398 --> 01:05:52,660
In my timeline,

1079
01:05:52,704 --> 01:05:54,880
Batman's our
strategist, our leader.

1080
01:05:54,924 --> 01:05:57,578
The world needs Superman. You're
the best detective in the world.

1081
01:05:57,622 --> 01:05:59,818
You're probably the only person
who can help me find him.

1082
01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:01,321
So, will you help us?

1083
01:06:02,845 --> 01:06:03,715
Pass.

1084
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:10,458
Like pass the salt?

1085
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,376
Bruce?

1086
01:06:14,247 --> 01:06:16,293
He doesn't
want to help us...

1087
01:06:16,336 --> 01:06:17,947
we're gonna use his bat shit.

1088
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:19,035
Bat shit?

1089
01:06:20,471 --> 01:06:22,821
Yeah, his bat stuff,
his bat things.

1090
01:06:22,865 --> 01:06:23,822
Stand on that thing.

1091
01:06:26,869 --> 01:06:29,001
Okay, remember when you
phased through the floor?

1092
01:06:29,045 --> 01:06:30,524
- Yeah.
- So,

1093
01:06:30,568 --> 01:06:32,526
I need you to do that again.

1094
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:34,224
Ow.

1095
01:06:39,882 --> 01:06:41,405
What is this place?

1096
01:07:49,255 --> 01:07:50,909
Dude!

1097
01:07:50,953 --> 01:07:54,565
This place straight beeves!

1098
01:07:54,608 --> 01:07:56,045
"Beeves"?

1099
01:08:07,099 --> 01:08:08,100
Barry!

1100
01:08:09,014 --> 01:08:10,450
I almost died

1101
01:08:10,494 --> 01:08:11,582
in an abyss!

1102
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:15,107
12,805 Clark Kents in the US.

1103
01:08:15,151 --> 01:08:17,302
Is this what I think it is?

1104
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,816
Holy shit!

1105
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:32,081
I used to see this thing on
the news when I was a kid!

1106
01:08:32,124 --> 01:08:33,473
Okay, well...

1107
01:08:33,517 --> 01:08:35,214
refine search.

1108
01:08:35,258 --> 01:08:37,042
Date of birth.

1109
01:08:37,086 --> 01:08:39,479
- Wasn't born. He arrived.
- Oh!

1110
01:08:39,523 --> 01:08:41,699
Oh, Barry, look!

1111
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:42,700
I'm busy.

1112
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:44,325
With what?

1113
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:47,226
Looking for unidentified objects
entering Earth's atmosphere

1114
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:49,707
anywhere near Kansas
in the last 50 years.

1115
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:51,970
He has a back door into NASA.

1116
01:08:52,014 --> 01:08:53,015
'Course he does.

1117
01:08:54,645 --> 01:08:57,323
Yeah, but Barry, check this out.

1118
01:08:57,367 --> 01:08:59,021
This bag laughs.

1119
01:09:00,631 --> 01:09:03,068
Okay, can't you take
anything seriously?

1120
01:09:03,112 --> 01:09:04,417
Stop messing around.

1121
01:09:04,461 --> 01:09:06,071
Dude, come on.

1122
01:09:06,115 --> 01:09:07,986
Have you seen this place?

1123
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:09,683
It's amazing!

1124
01:09:09,727 --> 01:09:11,337
Hello!

1125
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:14,123
Has the gravity of this
not sunk in for you?

1126
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:15,338
Stop messing around, Barry.

1127
01:09:15,363 --> 01:09:16,763
I won't say it again.

1128
01:09:17,474 --> 01:09:19,563
Yeesh. Sorry, Mom.

1129
01:09:19,606 --> 01:09:22,000
Shut up. Shut up.

1130
01:09:22,044 --> 01:09:23,523
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

1131
01:09:24,046 --> 01:09:25,528
No idea!

1132
01:09:25,553 --> 01:09:28,572
You take everything for granted.
You don't even appreciate...

1133
01:09:28,615 --> 01:09:31,183
You just walk around
thinking that you're so funny

1134
01:09:31,227 --> 01:09:32,576
and so cool.

1135
01:09:32,619 --> 01:09:34,012
And it's embarrassing,

1136
01:09:34,056 --> 01:09:37,102
because you're not
any of those things!

1137
01:09:37,146 --> 01:09:39,452
Hey, screw you, man!

1138
01:09:39,496 --> 01:09:41,802
I've done nothing but
everything you've asked.

1139
01:09:41,846 --> 01:09:43,935
You made me get
struck by lightning!

1140
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,546
I phased naked through the floor.
And I terrified Mrs. Johannson.

1141
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:48,244
Now I'm probably
gonna have to move.

1142
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:50,768
You won't even tell
me why you're here.

1143
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:53,553
But will you at least tell me
why you're being so mean to me...

1144
01:09:53,597 --> 01:09:54,772
for no reason?

1145
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:57,630
You used Monkey as a dartboard!

1146
01:09:58,297 --> 01:09:59,429
Wait, what?

1147
01:10:00,299 --> 01:10:01,170
Forget it.

1148
01:10:03,563 --> 01:10:05,325
The monkey? Wait...

1149
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:08,693
So, you're mad at me
for playing with a toy?

1150
01:10:08,718 --> 01:10:10,763
It's not a toy.

1151
01:10:10,788 --> 01:10:12,355
Mom bought us that monkey.

1152
01:10:12,398 --> 01:10:14,357
'Cause she calls us Monkey.

1153
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,186
She gives us monkey
stuff all the time.

1154
01:10:18,143 --> 01:10:19,057
Right.

1155
01:10:20,102 --> 01:10:20,972
Look...

1156
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,061
I'm sorry.

1157
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:27,413
I'm not very good with people.

1158
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:28,719
Even myself.

1159
01:10:28,762 --> 01:10:29,589
Oh.

1160
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,504
Come on, dude.

1161
01:10:31,548 --> 01:10:33,202
You're... You're not that bad.

1162
01:10:33,245 --> 01:10:35,622
You can just be kind
of a dick sometimes.

1163
01:10:37,554 --> 01:10:40,078
But let's face it. I
am pretty obnoxious.

1164
01:10:40,122 --> 01:10:42,037
But I just get excited.

1165
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,648
Come on. This place
is pretty cool, right?

1166
01:10:45,562 --> 01:10:46,389
Yeah.

1167
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,523
All right, well, um...

1168
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:53,613
I'll let you work.

1169
01:11:13,633 --> 01:11:14,753
I know you're there.

1170
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:19,770
You know what I'm stuck on?

1171
01:11:19,813 --> 01:11:22,247
That thing you said,
with the spaghetti.

1172
01:11:22,272 --> 01:11:25,184
You said there were certain intersections
that would always be inevitable.

1173
01:11:27,038 --> 01:11:28,387
You had an Alfred.

1174
01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:30,563
My Bruce has an Alfred.

1175
01:11:30,607 --> 01:11:32,739
Different worlds,
different times...

1176
01:11:32,783 --> 01:11:35,002
yet there it is.

1177
01:11:35,046 --> 01:11:37,179
Certain people,

1178
01:11:37,222 --> 01:11:40,921
certain events, certain
strands of spaghetti,

1179
01:11:40,965 --> 01:11:43,446
drawn to each other
like... like magnets.

1180
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:46,057
I've read all about

1181
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:49,104
temporal paradoxes
and causal loops.

1182
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:52,324
But this is more than that.

1183
01:11:52,368 --> 01:11:54,674
Inevitable intersections

1184
01:11:54,718 --> 01:11:56,391
are something none of the theories
could have anticipated 'cause,

1185
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:59,026
well, how do you explain
that except for...

1186
01:12:00,593 --> 01:12:02,247
fate?

1187
01:12:02,291 --> 01:12:04,249
If you are listening,

1188
01:12:04,293 --> 01:12:06,382
sorry about your parents.

1189
01:12:06,425 --> 01:12:07,861
I'm just trying to save mine.

1190
01:12:09,994 --> 01:12:11,865
There has to be a way.

1191
01:12:11,909 --> 01:12:13,563
There is a way, Barry.

1192
01:12:13,606 --> 01:12:14,868
Just keep trying.

1193
01:12:14,912 --> 01:12:16,087
Keep trying, Barry.

1194
01:13:00,218 --> 01:13:01,611
Found him.

1195
01:13:01,654 --> 01:13:03,552
Barry, wake up.

1196
01:13:03,577 --> 01:13:07,320
Clark's being held by a mercenary
group in a Siberian black site.

1197
01:13:07,486 --> 01:13:08,487
Get up, Barry.

1198
01:13:08,531 --> 01:13:10,446
The goat's on fire.

1199
01:13:10,489 --> 01:13:12,012
We're going to Russia.

1200
01:13:13,318 --> 01:13:14,972
Sweet.

1201
01:13:15,973 --> 01:13:19,237
Mm. Coffee.

1202
01:13:19,281 --> 01:13:20,543
How are we gonna get to Russia?

1203
01:13:58,145 --> 01:14:00,409
I'll help
you get this Superman.

1204
01:14:00,452 --> 01:14:02,933
Then, you're on your own.

1205
01:14:05,283 --> 01:14:06,893
Oh!

1206
01:14:08,286 --> 01:14:09,244
You're...

1207
01:14:10,201 --> 01:14:11,420
You are, you're...

1208
01:14:15,815 --> 01:14:16,816
Yeah.

1209
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:19,732
I'm Batman.

1210
01:15:07,519 --> 01:15:09,478
So, what's the plan?
We're just gonna, what,

1211
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:12,263
grab Superman and dip set
before the block is hot?

1212
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:13,525
I don't know.

1213
01:15:13,569 --> 01:15:14,763
Hey,
you should ask him.

1214
01:15:16,398 --> 01:15:17,723
- You ask him.
- You should ask him.

1215
01:15:17,747 --> 01:15:19,444
Yeah, I'm not gonna ask him.

1216
01:15:19,488 --> 01:15:21,074
Why not? I thought Batman was
supposed to be your friend.

1217
01:15:21,098 --> 01:15:23,274
Not this one. Not this Batman.

1218
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:25,998
- We're here.
- Activating hover mode.

1219
01:15:30,716 --> 01:15:32,588
- Ejector seat on.
- Ejector seat.

1220
01:15:32,631 --> 01:15:35,068
Ejector seat.

1221
01:15:38,637 --> 01:15:40,247
Okay, there are stages.

1222
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:43,381
You're strapped to
your parachutes.

1223
01:15:46,253 --> 01:15:47,298
Hey, where's yours?

1224
01:15:58,135 --> 01:16:00,137
Whoo! This rips dicks!

1225
01:16:19,939 --> 01:16:21,680
All
clear. Let's move.

1226
01:16:37,479 --> 01:16:39,045
Okay!

1227
01:16:47,489 --> 01:16:50,230
Good. Everybody's
fast now but me.

1228
01:16:50,274 --> 01:16:52,798
- Why is it so cold?
- It's the Arctic, Barry.

1229
01:16:55,453 --> 01:16:58,413
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know. Just follow the footprints.

1230
01:17:03,592 --> 01:17:05,550
Superman would be
down there for sure.

1231
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,376
Yeah. Okay.

1232
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,623
What did you do?

1233
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:20,625
I had to move you. But
I just did it a little.

1234
01:18:29,591 --> 01:18:30,809
This might hurt.

1235
01:18:39,165 --> 01:18:40,765
Just let it out.

1236
01:19:17,595 --> 01:19:18,857
Let's go.

1237
01:19:26,604 --> 01:19:28,693
That's where
you keep Superman.

1238
01:19:28,737 --> 01:19:29,781
Like a big scrotum.

1239
01:19:41,837 --> 01:19:45,057
He's gonna hack the Soviet security
cyberscrotum with a flip phone?

1240
01:19:50,323 --> 01:19:51,847
I tried all the combinations.

1241
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:55,894
Yes!

1242
01:20:38,154 --> 01:20:39,155
Shit.

1243
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:41,331
Kal-El?

1244
01:20:44,334 --> 01:20:46,466
It's not him. We've gotta go.

1245
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:48,251
Wait.

1246
01:20:48,294 --> 01:20:50,340
We can't just leave
her here. Look at her.

1247
01:20:51,733 --> 01:20:53,996
I'll grab her. Just go!

1248
01:21:01,351 --> 01:21:02,569
I got you.

1249
01:21:21,371 --> 01:21:22,372
I'll handle this jabroni.

1250
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:30,162
What the...

1251
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:39,694
Barry! Somebody shot me!

1252
01:21:44,611 --> 01:21:46,178
Time to dip set!

1253
01:21:55,405 --> 01:21:56,765
You,
you lead the way!

1254
01:21:56,798 --> 01:21:59,539
- Go!
- Not that way! Not that way!

1255
01:22:10,855 --> 01:22:12,117
Oh, God!

1256
01:22:12,161 --> 01:22:13,815
Cover!

1257
01:22:21,474 --> 01:22:22,649
No!

1258
01:22:30,527 --> 01:22:31,852
It's coming
around. Hurry, hurry.

1259
01:22:40,276 --> 01:22:42,887
No, no, no! This is bullshit!

1260
01:22:52,244 --> 01:22:53,898
No!

1261
01:22:53,942 --> 01:22:55,160
Come on.

1262
01:22:55,726 --> 01:22:56,945
Let's go.

1263
01:22:58,598 --> 01:23:00,078
You didn't tell me
we could get shot!

1264
01:23:00,122 --> 01:23:01,402
Why would you
assume we couldn't?

1265
01:23:13,048 --> 01:23:16,486
Oh, great! To die at
the feet of a Sputnik.

1266
01:23:21,317 --> 01:23:23,449
Oh, man! I need this knee!

1267
01:23:23,493 --> 01:23:25,582
- Stay calm. It'll heal.
- Come on.

1268
01:23:38,551 --> 01:23:39,833
- How much do you weigh?
- 180.

1269
01:23:39,857 --> 01:23:41,467
Each. Plus her, 440.

1270
01:23:48,344 --> 01:23:49,432
Hold on.

1271
01:24:18,896 --> 01:24:20,134
Oh, great.
They're here.

1272
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:21,203
They're over here, too.

1273
01:24:21,246 --> 01:24:22,552
Smirnoff Ice.

1274
01:24:22,595 --> 01:24:24,075
- Yes. Smirnoff Ice.
- Hi.

1275
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:26,208
Stop them!

1276
01:24:26,251 --> 01:24:28,036
-Yep.
-Okay, they're serious. Barry, shut up.

1277
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:29,211
Yeah, okay.

1278
01:24:29,254 --> 01:24:30,429
What's the play?

1279
01:24:30,473 --> 01:24:31,778
Batman, what do
we do? What now?

1280
01:24:36,305 --> 01:24:37,306
Now...

1281
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:39,438
we try not to die.

1282
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:41,936
Oh, you guys
should've seen that in slo-mo.

1283
01:26:18,885 --> 01:26:22,019
Yeah, I'm just realizing that
I didn't really think this through.

1284
01:26:22,063 --> 01:26:23,673
There are good Kryptonians...

1285
01:26:23,716 --> 01:26:26,067
and then there are very,
very bad Kryptonians.

1286
01:26:26,110 --> 01:26:27,633
And I
was very confident

1287
01:26:27,677 --> 01:26:29,157
that we were just
gonna find Superman,

1288
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,159
and if we found Superman,

1289
01:26:31,202 --> 01:26:32,987
then this would all
be super simple.

1290
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:34,945
- Who are you?
- Holy Funyuns.

1291
01:26:36,729 --> 01:26:37,861
Hi.

1292
01:26:37,904 --> 01:26:40,081
- I... I'm Barry.
- We're Barry.

1293
01:26:40,124 --> 01:26:42,779
We were trying to find Kal-El.

1294
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:44,911
But we found you instead.

1295
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:46,435
What do you want with Kal-El?

1296
01:26:46,478 --> 01:26:48,045
We were trying to rescue him.

1297
01:26:48,089 --> 01:26:49,873
Why?

1298
01:26:49,916 --> 01:26:52,702
Because he's my friend.

1299
01:26:52,745 --> 01:26:54,095
Do you... Do you know him?

1300
01:26:54,138 --> 01:26:56,271
She
looks mad. Get ready.

1301
01:26:56,314 --> 01:26:58,684
She might do laser vision, or she
might do, like, a freezy breath...

1302
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:01,232
- or she'll just start throwing crazy...
- My name is Kara.

1303
01:27:02,277 --> 01:27:03,495
Daughter of Zor-El.

1304
01:27:04,409 --> 01:27:06,020
Kal-El was my cousin.

1305
01:27:06,063 --> 01:27:08,370
- Right, and who's Kal-El again?
- It's Superman.

1306
01:27:08,413 --> 01:27:11,068
- No, 'cause you said that was Clark.
- Who's Clark?

1307
01:27:11,112 --> 01:27:14,289
Clark is his human name.

1308
01:27:14,332 --> 01:27:15,464
Clark.

1309
01:27:18,554 --> 01:27:20,425
He was an infant when we left.

1310
01:27:21,818 --> 01:27:23,428
The last son of Krypton... I...

1311
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:26,910
I was sent to protect him.

1312
01:27:26,953 --> 01:27:28,912
It looks like he
never made it to Earth

1313
01:27:28,955 --> 01:27:30,914
in this universe.

1314
01:27:30,957 --> 01:27:33,308
Our pods, they must
have separated.

1315
01:27:33,351 --> 01:27:35,049
Wait, so you thought a baby

1316
01:27:35,092 --> 01:27:37,529
was gonna protect us
from this Zod guy?

1317
01:27:37,573 --> 01:27:39,096
General Zod is here.

1318
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,316
He must have tracked
my pod's signal.

1319
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:43,666
- I have to go.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

1320
01:27:43,709 --> 01:27:47,322
Well, you need to recover your
strength. Actually, Barry...

1321
01:27:47,365 --> 01:27:48,888
take her to the roof

1322
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:50,934
and put her in the sun.

1323
01:27:50,977 --> 01:27:52,240
Yeah.

1324
01:27:52,283 --> 01:27:54,242
- Yeah.
- Whatever, like if, I mean,

1325
01:27:54,285 --> 01:27:55,852
you're solar powered.

1326
01:27:55,895 --> 01:27:57,419
Good for you. I've
been trying to...

1327
01:27:57,462 --> 01:27:58,898
Oh, uh...

1328
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,337
We'll take that with us.

1329
01:28:11,302 --> 01:28:14,088
Um, am I cool to...

1330
01:28:14,131 --> 01:28:15,001
turn around?

1331
01:28:16,133 --> 01:28:17,439
Are you dressed

1332
01:28:17,482 --> 01:28:19,615
in a red cape?

1333
01:28:26,187 --> 01:28:28,319
You're levitating?

1334
01:28:35,805 --> 01:28:37,111
Is it always this loud?

1335
01:28:40,157 --> 01:28:42,028
Is it loud?

1336
01:28:42,072 --> 01:28:45,336
Are you, uh, good?
Do you feel, um...

1337
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:46,598
strong yet, or...

1338
01:28:52,561 --> 01:28:53,997
Yep, that seems, uh,

1339
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,781
seems strong. You know...

1340
01:28:55,825 --> 01:28:58,436
old man Barry, down there,

1341
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,743
says if we don't
stop Captain Zode,

1342
01:29:00,786 --> 01:29:03,137
he'll kill thousands of people.

1343
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,660
Billions of people.

1344
01:29:04,703 --> 01:29:05,791
Billions?

1345
01:29:07,402 --> 01:29:08,751
Of your people.

1346
01:29:08,794 --> 01:29:10,492
- They're good people.
- Good people?

1347
01:29:11,667 --> 01:29:13,321
We came to this planet

1348
01:29:13,364 --> 01:29:15,366
looking for a safe
place to live,

1349
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:17,629
and they put me in a cage.

1350
01:29:17,673 --> 01:29:20,328
Yeah. A lot of
humans are dicks.

1351
01:29:20,371 --> 01:29:22,721
But then

1352
01:29:22,765 --> 01:29:25,115
there's babies and ballerinas.

1353
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:26,943
And entertainment wrestlers.

1354
01:29:26,986 --> 01:29:28,423
A lot of humans
are worth saving.

1355
01:29:29,554 --> 01:29:30,773
Maybe to you.

1356
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,471
But I'm not a human.

1357
01:29:34,951 --> 01:29:36,213
I'm a Kryptonian.

1358
01:29:39,956 --> 01:29:41,697
She's gone.

1359
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:43,438
I have to get my powers back.

1360
01:29:46,267 --> 01:29:47,572
If I can re-create the accident

1361
01:29:47,616 --> 01:29:49,139
that gave me my powers...

1362
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:50,638
maybe I can reconnect
to the Speed Force...

1363
01:29:50,662 --> 01:29:53,448
and maybe we'd stand
a chance against Zod.

1364
01:29:53,491 --> 01:29:55,928
Or kill yourself in the process.

1365
01:29:58,931 --> 01:29:59,758
Tell me something.

1366
01:30:01,673 --> 01:30:03,806
If you get your powers back,

1367
01:30:03,849 --> 01:30:05,155
you can go anywhere.

1368
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,722
You can go to another timeline,

1369
01:30:06,765 --> 01:30:08,202
another universe.

1370
01:30:08,245 --> 01:30:10,378
Why do you wanna stay...

1371
01:30:10,421 --> 01:30:12,728
and fight to save this one?

1372
01:30:12,771 --> 01:30:15,121
Because this is the
world where my mom lives.

1373
01:30:18,342 --> 01:30:21,084
I went back in time to save her.

1374
01:30:21,127 --> 01:30:23,260
I'm not gonna lose her again.

1375
01:30:23,304 --> 01:30:25,175
The kid doesn't know, does he?

1376
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:27,917
How do you tell someone
something like that?

1377
01:30:31,442 --> 01:30:33,444
I lost my parents...

1378
01:30:36,404 --> 01:30:38,057
but that pain...

1379
01:30:41,713 --> 01:30:43,324
made me who I am.

1380
01:30:43,367 --> 01:30:45,848
I'm not sure I know who I
am without it, actually.

1381
01:30:50,156 --> 01:30:52,898
I spent a lifetime...

1382
01:30:52,942 --> 01:30:55,771
trying to right the
wrongs of the past.

1383
01:30:57,163 --> 01:30:58,382
As if

1384
01:30:58,426 --> 01:31:01,298
putting on a cape
and fighting crime

1385
01:31:01,342 --> 01:31:03,169
would bring my parents back.

1386
01:31:09,088 --> 01:31:10,394
You actually did it.

1387
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,354
So...

1388
01:31:13,397 --> 01:31:14,790
I guess the plan is

1389
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:17,183
to douse yourself in
industrial chemicals

1390
01:31:17,227 --> 01:31:19,055
while electrocuting yourself?

1391
01:31:19,098 --> 01:31:19,925
Yep.

1392
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:25,409
Want some help?

1393
01:31:27,324 --> 01:31:29,674
Hell yeah. That
would be incredibly useful.

1394
01:31:29,718 --> 01:31:31,348
I've actually already
borrowed some chemicals

1395
01:31:31,372 --> 01:31:32,590
and your soldering iron,

1396
01:31:32,634 --> 01:31:34,810
and I'm sitting
in your bat-seat.

1397
01:31:34,853 --> 01:31:36,290
Is that like a faux pas?

1398
01:31:48,258 --> 01:31:51,566
Wilco,
Lima, Zebra, be advised...

1399
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:57,528
Air
Command to Bravo 601.

1400
01:31:57,572 --> 01:32:00,009
Primary teams,
please confirm your AORs.

1401
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:21,410
- Green teams ready to move.
- Standing by!

1402
01:32:22,727 --> 01:32:26,601
You bring me nothing? Hmm.

1403
01:32:26,644 --> 01:32:29,081
I gave you a warning.

1404
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:31,780
Your failure to deliver
the Kryptonian traitor

1405
01:32:31,823 --> 01:32:33,999
is being taken as an act of war.

1406
01:32:37,568 --> 01:32:39,024
- Fire, fire, fire!
- We have contact, contact!

1407
01:32:39,048 --> 01:32:39,720
Weapons hot! Weapons
hot! Open fire!

1408
01:32:39,744 --> 01:32:42,138
No.

1409
01:32:42,181 --> 01:32:44,880
Air support
now! I repeat, air support!

1410
01:33:12,298 --> 01:33:14,475
Okay, when I throw the switch,

1411
01:33:14,518 --> 01:33:16,085
the current should
run up the wire

1412
01:33:16,128 --> 01:33:18,653
and draw the lightning
right to the kite.

1413
01:33:18,696 --> 01:33:20,045
Here, put that on.

1414
01:33:20,089 --> 01:33:21,525
It's heat and impact resistant.

1415
01:33:21,569 --> 01:33:23,266
Should protect you a little.

1416
01:33:23,309 --> 01:33:25,309
Right, but the point is
for me to not be protected.

1417
01:33:26,748 --> 01:33:27,575
Okay.

1418
01:33:30,491 --> 01:33:32,231
You're gonna need to
be out of the way.

1419
01:33:32,275 --> 01:33:33,276
I will.

1420
01:33:37,672 --> 01:33:38,673
Let's get electrocuted.

1421
01:33:44,635 --> 01:33:46,158
This is going to work, right?

1422
01:33:46,202 --> 01:33:47,943
Of course it's gonna work.

1423
01:33:47,986 --> 01:33:49,684
Nothing we haven't done before.

1424
01:33:49,727 --> 01:33:51,468
Besides, this time
we have Batman.

1425
01:33:51,512 --> 01:33:53,035
What could go wrong?

1426
01:33:53,078 --> 01:33:55,167
Uh, for the record, I
think this is insane.

1427
01:33:56,821 --> 01:33:57,648
Get back.

1428
01:34:03,741 --> 01:34:04,742
It's fine. It's fine.

1429
01:34:14,709 --> 01:34:16,798
Just you and me
again, Mr. Lightning.

1430
01:34:23,674 --> 01:34:24,545
Do it!

1431
01:34:47,132 --> 01:34:48,394
Wait, what? No!

1432
01:34:48,438 --> 01:34:50,309
No, wait! Stop! Stop!

1433
01:34:57,447 --> 01:34:59,057
Oh, God.

1434
01:34:59,101 --> 01:35:00,319
Oh, God.

1435
01:35:00,363 --> 01:35:01,277
Barry, no.

1436
01:35:04,976 --> 01:35:05,803
Go again.

1437
01:35:07,109 --> 01:35:08,414
But...

1438
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:09,415
Please.

1439
01:35:17,685 --> 01:35:19,121
The circuit is fried.

1440
01:36:17,483 --> 01:36:18,484
I've got you.

1441
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:52,606
Hey. Barry.

1442
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:56,348
You're okay. It's
like last time, right?

1443
01:36:56,392 --> 01:36:57,611
So, you gotta heal now.

1444
01:37:15,672 --> 01:37:16,760
Look, look, look!

1445
01:37:16,804 --> 01:37:18,196
It's working. It's working.

1446
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,198
Yeah, it's working. Yeah.

1447
01:37:20,242 --> 01:37:22,113
Yeah, he's
healing. He's healing.

1448
01:37:22,157 --> 01:37:23,941
Oh, my God. He's okay.

1449
01:37:23,985 --> 01:37:26,248
Dude, you scared
the shit out of me.

1450
01:38:09,987 --> 01:38:11,597
You're awake.

1451
01:38:11,641 --> 01:38:12,729
How you feeling?

1452
01:38:13,512 --> 01:38:14,383
Slow.

1453
01:38:15,297 --> 01:38:17,038
Maybe this will help.

1454
01:38:27,048 --> 01:38:29,050
Ooh... Ooh!

1455
01:38:29,659 --> 01:38:30,660
Yes!

1456
01:38:30,704 --> 01:38:33,184
Dude, come on! Irresistible!

1457
01:38:33,228 --> 01:38:34,882
Man, feels good to be back.

1458
01:38:34,925 --> 01:38:36,318
Yeah!

1459
01:38:36,361 --> 01:38:37,972
And what are we wearing tonight?

1460
01:38:38,015 --> 01:38:39,408
You like it?

1461
01:38:39,451 --> 01:38:41,236
I-I made it myself out
of that old Batsuit.

1462
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:43,455
But you know, I made it
our colors and everything.

1463
01:38:43,499 --> 01:38:45,675
Well, check this out!

1464
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:47,546
It's a bit more loose.

1465
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:51,028
It beeves.

1466
01:38:52,203 --> 01:38:53,727
Dude...

1467
01:38:53,770 --> 01:38:55,119
you really mean that?

1468
01:38:55,163 --> 01:38:56,730
I mean, I don't...

1469
01:38:56,773 --> 01:39:00,168
I don't know what it
means, exactly, to beeve.

1470
01:39:00,211 --> 01:39:02,910
But it seems like it's positive.

1471
01:39:02,953 --> 01:39:03,867
What are you doing?

1472
01:39:06,914 --> 01:39:08,176
You came back.

1473
01:39:08,219 --> 01:39:10,221
I'm glad you're okay.

1474
01:39:10,265 --> 01:39:12,963
I have to ask you something.

1475
01:39:13,007 --> 01:39:15,618
When you found me in that
hole that they put me in...

1476
01:39:16,967 --> 01:39:18,621
and I wasn't Kal-El...

1477
01:39:21,232 --> 01:39:23,060
why did you help me?

1478
01:39:23,104 --> 01:39:24,583
Because you needed help.

1479
01:39:27,369 --> 01:39:30,415
Do you know what this
symbol stands for?

1480
01:39:30,459 --> 01:39:32,591
- Supergirl?
- It means hope, right?

1481
01:39:32,635 --> 01:39:34,768
Hope, yeah. Does it mean hope?

1482
01:39:34,811 --> 01:39:37,422
Krypton was a beautiful place.

1483
01:39:39,555 --> 01:39:41,035
We are a people of hope,

1484
01:39:41,949 --> 01:39:43,472
not war.

1485
01:39:44,995 --> 01:39:46,692
I'm coming to you
live from Metropolis,

1486
01:39:46,736 --> 01:39:48,279
where minutes ago, the
mysterious flying...

1487
01:39:48,303 --> 01:39:50,261
Zod may be from Krypton,

1488
01:39:50,305 --> 01:39:53,090
but he is not my people.

1489
01:39:53,134 --> 01:39:55,527
So, you're saying...

1490
01:39:55,571 --> 01:39:57,225
Yes.

1491
01:39:57,268 --> 01:39:58,792
I will help you fight Zod.

1492
01:40:01,707 --> 01:40:03,579
Yes!

1493
01:40:03,622 --> 01:40:05,450
Interesting group.

1494
01:40:05,494 --> 01:40:08,323
What did you say, uh...

1495
01:40:08,366 --> 01:40:09,628
we were called again?

1496
01:40:09,672 --> 01:40:11,674
We're the Justice League.

1497
01:40:11,717 --> 01:40:12,849
No.

1498
01:40:12,893 --> 01:40:15,809
- No?
- Well, I mean, kinda.

1499
01:40:16,897 --> 01:40:17,854
We are short

1500
01:40:17,898 --> 01:40:19,290
one literal goddess...

1501
01:40:19,334 --> 01:40:20,901
one friendly Terminator

1502
01:40:20,944 --> 01:40:23,686
and super mermaid.

1503
01:40:23,729 --> 01:40:25,819
And we could definitely
use a Batman.

1504
01:40:28,909 --> 01:40:30,171
Are you in?

1505
01:40:35,393 --> 01:40:36,525
You wanna get nuts?

1506
01:40:39,049 --> 01:40:40,485
Let's get nuts.

1507
01:40:53,847 --> 01:40:56,545
In my world, Superman showed up
right away when Zod called him out.

1508
01:40:56,588 --> 01:40:59,026
So, as of now, we're
in uncharted territory.

1509
01:40:59,069 --> 01:41:02,246
What I do know is that Zod somehow
controls the World Engines,

1510
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:03,900
which will be
destroying much more

1511
01:41:03,944 --> 01:41:05,510
than just Metropolis now

1512
01:41:05,554 --> 01:41:07,314
with every passing second
that we don't stop him.

1513
01:41:07,338 --> 01:41:08,426
Barry, what are you doing?

1514
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:09,340
What?

1515
01:41:10,951 --> 01:41:12,300
Our kids are gonna
wanna see this.

1516
01:41:12,343 --> 01:41:13,301
Your kids?

1517
01:41:15,607 --> 01:41:18,567
Well, you know, like everybody's kids.
I mean, the children of the world.

1518
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:19,829
They're gonna wanna see this.

1519
01:41:22,353 --> 01:41:24,051
We're getting close.

1520
01:41:24,094 --> 01:41:26,116
I'm gonna stay airborne and
take out their sky power.

1521
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:27,619
And Barry, just so we're clear

1522
01:41:27,663 --> 01:41:28,901
what that essentially
equates to is you and me

1523
01:41:28,925 --> 01:41:30,840
versus the entire
Kryptonian army.

1524
01:41:30,884 --> 01:41:32,363
Chill.

1525
01:41:32,407 --> 01:41:34,931
We need to buy Kara enough
time to take out Zod.

1526
01:41:34,975 --> 01:41:37,257
Oh, and remember that your suit
doesn't dissipate energy like mine

1527
01:41:37,281 --> 01:41:38,804
so you need to take breaks,

1528
01:41:38,848 --> 01:41:40,565
otherwise you're gonna
build up too much charge.

1529
01:41:40,589 --> 01:41:42,069
Wait, what?

1530
01:41:59,216 --> 01:42:00,739
Dang it!

1531
01:42:02,524 --> 01:42:04,091
Hold on!

1532
01:42:06,006 --> 01:42:07,526
- Okay!
- Hold on.

1533
01:42:09,574 --> 01:42:10,967
The humans we came to protect?

1534
01:42:11,011 --> 01:42:12,577
They don't know
we're on their side.

1535
01:42:48,004 --> 01:42:48,831
Zod.

1536
01:42:58,232 --> 01:42:59,450
Kara Zor-El.

1537
01:42:59,494 --> 01:43:01,017
We've been waiting for you.

1538
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:05,369
Go, go!

1539
01:43:06,588 --> 01:43:07,589
Cover!

1540
01:43:11,593 --> 01:43:13,682
- Drag him out, drag him!
- You go! I'll cover!

1541
01:43:30,916 --> 01:43:33,441
Okay, and the space giant...

1542
01:43:33,484 --> 01:43:35,225
and Mistress Murder...

1543
01:43:35,269 --> 01:43:37,358
- are our responsibility, too?
- Hey, hey, hey.

1544
01:43:37,401 --> 01:43:39,055
Don't think about
them, okay? Calm down.

1545
01:43:39,099 --> 01:43:41,144
We're just gonna start
with those guys over there.

1546
01:43:41,188 --> 01:43:42,817
And yeah, they're Kryptonian, and
we won't be able to kill them,

1547
01:43:42,841 --> 01:43:44,713
but we can slow
them down for her.

1548
01:43:44,756 --> 01:43:47,281
One at a time.

1549
01:43:47,324 --> 01:43:49,979
Okay? I'm gonna disarm them,
and then you'll engage.

1550
01:43:52,112 --> 01:43:53,113
Punch 'em.

1551
01:43:54,679 --> 01:43:56,420
Come on, Barbie.

1552
01:43:56,464 --> 01:43:58,422
Let's go party?

1553
01:44:05,255 --> 01:44:06,691
Okay, ow!

1554
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:10,043
Oh.

1555
01:44:15,048 --> 01:44:16,005
Okay. It's okay.

1556
01:44:16,049 --> 01:44:17,615
You're okay. Come on.

1557
01:44:17,659 --> 01:44:19,052
Jesus, they're fast.

1558
01:44:19,095 --> 01:44:20,836
Yes, but not as fast as us.

1559
01:44:24,579 --> 01:44:26,624
Terraforming has begun.

1560
01:44:26,668 --> 01:44:28,365
This world must die

1561
01:44:28,409 --> 01:44:30,454
so that ours may live again.

1562
01:44:38,245 --> 01:44:40,116
Oh, my God. We gotta
go. We gotta go.

1563
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,596
Dan, Danny, go, go!

1564
01:44:43,032 --> 01:44:45,252
Krypton is gone, Zod.

1565
01:44:45,295 --> 01:44:46,775
Your uncle...

1566
01:44:46,818 --> 01:44:47,819
Jor-El...

1567
01:44:49,256 --> 01:44:50,474
hid the key

1568
01:44:50,518 --> 01:44:53,260
to Krypton's rebirth

1569
01:44:53,303 --> 01:44:55,740
inside a Kryptonian child.

1570
01:44:55,784 --> 01:44:58,134
All the genetic material needed

1571
01:44:58,178 --> 01:44:59,962
to start again

1572
01:45:00,005 --> 01:45:01,877
coded inside the DNA,

1573
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:04,532
then sent to Earth
in an escape pod.

1574
01:45:04,575 --> 01:45:06,447
He's not here. You have failed.

1575
01:45:07,752 --> 01:45:08,753
We found him.

1576
01:45:10,842 --> 01:45:12,670
We intercepted his pod.

1577
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:17,501
But your cousin was
not the one we needed.

1578
01:45:19,329 --> 01:45:21,331
You are the one.

1579
01:45:21,375 --> 01:45:23,072
Kara Zor-El.

1580
01:45:23,116 --> 01:45:25,118
It is your blood...

1581
01:45:25,161 --> 01:45:26,249
we must harvest.

1582
01:45:26,293 --> 01:45:27,598
What did you do to Kal-El?

1583
01:45:27,642 --> 01:45:30,340
Your sacrifice that will allow

1584
01:45:30,384 --> 01:45:32,386
Krypton to live again.

1585
01:45:32,429 --> 01:45:35,258
What did you do?

1586
01:45:37,608 --> 01:45:40,263
The infant did not survive.

1587
01:46:13,818 --> 01:46:15,168
Look, new plan.

1588
01:46:15,211 --> 01:46:16,778
I'm gonna create a
cyclonic diversion.

1589
01:46:16,821 --> 01:46:18,562
And you're gonna
just come in, hard.

1590
01:46:18,606 --> 01:46:19,650
Feet first this time.

1591
01:46:35,449 --> 01:46:37,059
Yes!

1592
01:46:37,102 --> 01:46:38,582
Barry, did you see that?

1593
01:46:38,626 --> 01:46:40,506
Be careful. You're
accumulating too much charge.

1594
01:46:42,107 --> 01:46:43,979
What if I just Emperor this guy?

1595
01:46:45,328 --> 01:46:47,330
No, no, no!

1596
01:47:14,314 --> 01:47:16,968
Barry, that was actually
only half stupid!

1597
01:47:17,012 --> 01:47:19,014
But if you're gonna
do that and not die,

1598
01:47:19,057 --> 01:47:20,929
you need to complete
the circuit somehow.

1599
01:47:20,972 --> 01:47:23,105
Try putting your hands
together, like this.

1600
01:47:25,977 --> 01:47:26,935
Oh, shit.

1601
01:47:28,893 --> 01:47:31,505
- You're ready.
- Let's go!

1602
01:48:48,277 --> 01:48:49,757
I'm going after the big one.

1603
01:49:01,203 --> 01:49:02,073
I've been hit.

1604
01:49:04,859 --> 01:49:06,774
Bruce, do you copy?

1605
01:49:06,817 --> 01:49:08,428
- Where's Kara?
- You go find her.

1606
01:49:13,433 --> 01:49:14,303
Bruce!

1607
01:49:15,652 --> 01:49:17,698
Ejection mode failure.

1608
01:49:17,741 --> 01:49:19,613
Ejection mode failure.

1609
01:49:59,261 --> 01:50:00,871
Rest, Kara Zor-El.

1610
01:50:06,486 --> 01:50:07,748
Going down.

1611
01:50:12,796 --> 01:50:14,450
But I'm not going alone.

1612
01:50:14,494 --> 01:50:16,626
No, no, no, Bruce!

1613
01:50:16,670 --> 01:50:19,586
Bruce, eject!
Bruce, just eject...

1614
01:50:26,897 --> 01:50:27,898
No!

1615
01:50:39,736 --> 01:50:40,563
Kara.

1616
01:50:47,352 --> 01:50:49,137
Isn't supposed...

1617
01:50:51,226 --> 01:50:52,445
Not supposed to happen...

1618
01:50:58,886 --> 01:51:00,453
Kara's dead.

1619
01:51:00,496 --> 01:51:01,889
They're both dead.

1620
01:51:01,932 --> 01:51:03,891
But they don't
have to be, right?

1621
01:51:03,934 --> 01:51:06,371
'Cause we can go back.

1622
01:51:06,415 --> 01:51:08,548
- Like you did.
- You're not fast enough yet.

1623
01:51:08,591 --> 01:51:09,505
You sure?

1624
01:51:11,638 --> 01:51:13,466
Barry!

1625
01:51:14,815 --> 01:51:15,859
Barry, wait!

1626
01:51:29,743 --> 01:51:31,484
Is this back enough?

1627
01:51:31,527 --> 01:51:32,702
Yeah, I guess so.

1628
01:51:39,361 --> 01:51:40,884
Listen, Barry, I...

1629
01:51:42,364 --> 01:51:46,063
What? It's okay.
We can fix this.

1630
01:51:46,107 --> 01:51:47,388
You know what
you're gonna change?

1631
01:51:47,412 --> 01:51:48,805
I know what I'm gonna change.

1632
01:51:53,723 --> 01:51:55,246
I'm going after the big one.

1633
01:51:57,727 --> 01:52:00,121
Bruce, pull off. That
gunship is shield-protected.

1634
01:52:00,164 --> 01:52:01,078
Roger that.

1635
01:52:04,778 --> 01:52:05,866
Bet he's not.

1636
01:52:07,084 --> 01:52:08,869
Who? Space giant?

1637
01:52:08,912 --> 01:52:10,523
Yes, yes, please take him out.

1638
01:52:51,999 --> 01:52:52,913
Yes.

1639
01:54:52,728 --> 01:54:53,729
No.

1640
01:54:54,425 --> 01:54:55,252
Hey.

1641
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:57,907
It'll be okay.

1642
01:54:57,951 --> 01:54:59,169
Not this time, kid.

1643
01:55:01,737 --> 01:55:03,521
Maybe some other time.

1644
01:55:09,571 --> 01:55:11,094
We can't bring you back, can we?

1645
01:55:12,792 --> 01:55:13,967
You already did.

1646
01:55:16,143 --> 01:55:17,579
You already did.

1647
01:55:28,111 --> 01:55:29,231
Come on, Barry.

1648
01:55:30,679 --> 01:55:32,202
Gotta get up. Come on.

1649
01:55:32,246 --> 01:55:33,508
- Barry.
- We go again.

1650
01:55:36,206 --> 01:55:37,904
Barry.

1651
01:55:39,732 --> 01:55:41,429
Let's just go.

1652
01:55:41,472 --> 01:55:43,083
Barry, come on. Let's just go.

1653
01:55:43,126 --> 01:55:44,606
Barry, there's no point.

1654
01:55:47,217 --> 01:55:48,610
Barry!

1655
01:56:08,761 --> 01:56:12,199
Phase!

1656
01:56:14,854 --> 01:56:17,421
Okay, I have to pull it out.

1657
01:56:17,465 --> 01:56:18,877
- I have to pull it out.
- No, I'm okay.

1658
01:56:18,901 --> 01:56:20,226
You have to phase again.
Barry, phase again.

1659
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:21,314
I'm okay. I just
should've stopped sooner.

1660
01:56:21,338 --> 01:56:22,339
Ow!

1661
01:56:38,747 --> 01:56:39,922
Again.

1662
01:56:41,532 --> 01:56:42,359
Barry.

1663
01:56:51,107 --> 01:56:53,414
Okay, can we please
just take a minute?

1664
01:56:53,457 --> 01:56:56,025
Sorry, dude. Yeah,
bro, of course.

1665
01:56:56,069 --> 01:56:57,766
That's the whole thing.

1666
01:56:57,810 --> 01:56:59,768
We can take as much
time as it takes.

1667
01:56:59,812 --> 01:57:01,901
No, that's not
what I mean. Hey!

1668
01:57:23,313 --> 01:57:25,794
Okay, you good? Come on.

1669
01:57:25,838 --> 01:57:27,622
I need you in there. Let's go.

1670
01:57:27,665 --> 01:57:29,406
Barry, please,
just listen to me!

1671
01:57:47,511 --> 01:57:48,904
Where were you?

1672
01:57:48,948 --> 01:57:50,490
What, you just stand
here the whole time?

1673
01:57:50,514 --> 01:57:53,387
Barry, this is an
inevitable intersection.

1674
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:55,215
You have to stop. Barry!

1675
01:58:10,578 --> 01:58:11,840
No, Barry, wait!

1676
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:20,196
Barry, listen.

1677
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:21,640
There's something
I should tell you.

1678
01:58:24,244 --> 01:58:26,724
I went back in time initially

1679
01:58:26,768 --> 01:58:29,249
- because...
- Yeah, because Mom died.

1680
01:58:29,292 --> 01:58:30,990
How do you know?

1681
01:58:31,033 --> 01:58:33,601
It doesn't matter. Does it?

1682
01:58:33,644 --> 01:58:35,255
You know that I have
to undo what I did.

1683
01:58:36,343 --> 01:58:37,213
No.

1684
01:58:37,257 --> 01:58:38,649
It's not a mistake.

1685
01:58:38,693 --> 01:58:39,737
We can save her.

1686
01:58:39,781 --> 01:58:41,000
And we can save them.

1687
01:58:41,043 --> 01:58:42,740
No, we can't.

1688
01:58:42,784 --> 01:58:45,482
This is what Bruce
was talking about.

1689
01:58:45,526 --> 01:58:47,702
Barry, this is inevitable.

1690
01:58:47,745 --> 01:58:50,385
We can try a million times, and
we're not gonna be able to fix this.

1691
01:58:51,053 --> 01:58:52,489
No matter what we do...

1692
01:58:53,142 --> 01:58:55,014
this world dies.

1693
01:58:56,015 --> 01:58:57,973
Today.

1694
01:58:58,017 --> 01:58:58,974
Look around.

1695
01:59:03,152 --> 01:59:05,198
Look at the damage
we're causing.

1696
01:59:11,334 --> 01:59:12,596
Now we have to stop.

1697
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,989
Okay?

1698
01:59:14,033 --> 01:59:15,817
Look, I was just
doing my laundry.

1699
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:18,994
You're the one who came and
told me that I'm a superhero.

1700
01:59:19,038 --> 01:59:20,865
And now you're saying what?

1701
01:59:20,909 --> 01:59:22,780
You
don't want me to be?

1702
01:59:22,824 --> 01:59:25,305
Well, guess what!
It's too late!

1703
01:59:25,348 --> 01:59:28,003
I am...

1704
01:59:28,047 --> 01:59:29,483
the Flash.

1705
01:59:29,526 --> 01:59:31,398
And I can save everyone.

1706
01:59:31,441 --> 01:59:33,182
Nobody dies!

1707
01:59:33,226 --> 01:59:34,227
Barry...

1708
01:59:36,098 --> 01:59:37,926
not every problem
has a solution.

1709
01:59:47,022 --> 01:59:48,893
Not every problem
has a solution.

1710
01:59:53,072 --> 01:59:54,464
Sometimes we just
have to let go.

1711
01:59:54,508 --> 01:59:56,814
Sometimes you
just have to let go.

1712
01:59:56,858 --> 01:59:59,469
Let go of Mom?

1713
01:59:59,513 --> 02:00:02,820
She'll always be alive,
somewhere in time.

1714
02:00:04,039 --> 02:00:04,997
Always.

1715
02:00:05,736 --> 02:00:06,868
Just not for us.

1716
02:00:08,087 --> 02:00:10,176
You're full of shit, dude.

1717
02:00:10,219 --> 02:00:11,612
I'm going back.

1718
02:00:11,655 --> 02:00:13,483
You're going
back to kill Mom?

1719
02:00:13,527 --> 02:00:14,702
No!

1720
02:00:14,745 --> 02:00:16,486
You're staying!

1721
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:18,532
You stay, right here.

1722
02:00:20,055 --> 02:00:21,535
Just give me one more time.

1723
02:00:21,578 --> 02:00:23,319
Barry, stop!

1724
02:00:23,363 --> 02:00:25,843
You, stop!

1725
02:00:57,223 --> 02:00:59,268
Feel like we got off
on the wrong foot.

1726
02:00:59,312 --> 02:01:02,054
Let's start again.
I'm the Flash.

1727
02:01:02,097 --> 02:01:03,098
What's your name?

1728
02:01:03,142 --> 02:01:05,709
I've lived...

1729
02:01:05,753 --> 02:01:07,668
more than you can dream.

1730
02:01:07,711 --> 02:01:10,279
Not an answer.

1731
02:01:10,323 --> 02:01:12,151
Do you, like, rehearse that?

1732
02:01:17,547 --> 02:01:19,071
Whoa.

1733
02:01:19,114 --> 02:01:20,420
Get out of here, Barry!

1734
02:01:35,217 --> 02:01:36,914
That scar, you...

1735
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:38,916
Oh, my God.

1736
02:01:39,917 --> 02:01:42,442
So, you're... You are...

1737
02:01:42,485 --> 02:01:44,096
Yes, I am...

1738
02:01:44,661 --> 02:01:45,662
you.

1739
02:01:48,622 --> 02:01:50,580
We are so close.

1740
02:01:50,624 --> 02:01:52,582
I've got it almost figured out.

1741
02:01:52,626 --> 02:01:55,585
How long have you
been doing this?

1742
02:01:55,629 --> 02:01:58,153
Time is inconsequential.

1743
02:01:58,197 --> 02:01:59,154
Come on, Barry.

1744
02:02:08,772 --> 02:02:11,384
Up in the
sky! It's a bird!

1745
02:02:11,427 --> 02:02:12,820
It's a plane!

1746
02:02:12,863 --> 02:02:14,300
It's Superman!

1747
02:02:56,559 --> 02:02:58,300
Purrfectly foolproof.

1748
02:03:00,259 --> 02:03:01,540
Only the
Joker would think of that.

1749
02:03:39,994 --> 02:03:42,170
Please just look at
what's happening.

1750
02:03:43,519 --> 02:03:44,520
These worlds...

1751
02:03:53,616 --> 02:03:55,749
they're colliding
and collapsing.

1752
02:03:58,142 --> 02:03:59,274
We did this.

1753
02:04:01,276 --> 02:04:03,539
W-We're destroying the
fabric of everything.

1754
02:04:05,933 --> 02:04:07,151
You have to stop.

1755
02:04:07,195 --> 02:04:10,024
It stops once I've fixed it!

1756
02:04:11,678 --> 02:04:14,724
It's not entirely
your fault, Barry.

1757
02:04:14,768 --> 02:04:18,380
I pushed you out of the
Chronobowl on that September 29

1758
02:04:18,424 --> 02:04:21,601
so you could start
me on this path. Hmm?

1759
02:04:21,644 --> 02:04:24,299
How do you like our
endless paradox?

1760
02:04:24,343 --> 02:04:26,475
I made you create me...

1761
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,348
and now you're the one...

1762
02:04:30,218 --> 02:04:32,089
in my way.

1763
02:04:32,133 --> 02:04:35,092
No matter how close I get
to winning this fight...

1764
02:04:35,136 --> 02:04:37,138
you go back

1765
02:04:37,181 --> 02:04:38,922
and let Mom die.

1766
02:04:38,966 --> 02:04:41,142
You're the inevitable
intersection.

1767
02:04:42,143 --> 02:04:44,406
And you do have to let go.

1768
02:04:44,450 --> 02:04:46,408
What's he talking about?

1769
02:04:47,540 --> 02:04:48,932
You're my hero.

1770
02:05:02,206 --> 02:05:04,513
What did you do?

1771
02:05:04,557 --> 02:05:07,299
Hey, hey. Don't worry.
It's gonna heal.

1772
02:05:07,342 --> 02:05:08,343
It's gonna heal.

1773
02:05:08,387 --> 02:05:10,040
I just wanted to...

1774
02:05:27,797 --> 02:05:29,321
You tell Mom I love her.

1775
02:06:40,957 --> 02:06:42,394
Don't forget the tomatoes.

1776
02:06:55,450 --> 02:06:57,931
I used to love that
cereal when I was a kid.

1777
02:06:58,497 --> 02:06:59,976
Yeah.

1778
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:01,630
My son goes nuts for it.

1779
02:07:06,113 --> 02:07:08,158
They stop making it.

1780
02:07:08,202 --> 02:07:10,857
Well, I know they were
talking about discontinuing it.

1781
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:13,468
- Do I know you?
- No, I'm not from around here.

1782
02:07:13,512 --> 02:07:15,514
I was just visiting my mom.

1783
02:07:15,557 --> 02:07:16,906
Maybe I know her.

1784
02:07:16,950 --> 02:07:18,168
What's her name?

1785
02:07:19,082 --> 02:07:21,215
She's the best...

1786
02:07:21,258 --> 02:07:23,217
and kindest person in the world.

1787
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:24,740
You okay?

1788
02:07:24,784 --> 02:07:26,742
Yeah, I'm just...

1789
02:07:26,786 --> 02:07:27,826
I'm really gonna miss her.

1790
02:07:49,286 --> 02:07:50,853
I know I'm just...

1791
02:07:50,897 --> 02:07:52,986
a random lady in a store.

1792
02:07:53,029 --> 02:07:54,161
But do you want a hug?

1793
02:07:55,118 --> 02:07:56,119
Mm-hmm. Sure.

1794
02:08:02,256 --> 02:08:04,780
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't say that.

1795
02:08:06,695 --> 02:08:09,829
Your mom must be grateful
you came to visit her.

1796
02:08:09,872 --> 02:08:11,700
She's very lucky to have you.

1797
02:08:19,491 --> 02:08:21,493
I'm very lucky to have her.

1798
02:08:21,536 --> 02:08:25,061
Ah! You have to tell her that.

1799
02:08:25,105 --> 02:08:26,846
Moms like to hear
these kind of things.

1800
02:08:28,021 --> 02:08:29,022
Believe me.

1801
02:09:08,235 --> 02:09:09,497
Love you, Mom.

1802
02:09:17,331 --> 02:09:18,550
I love you more.

1803
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:22,292
I loved you first.

1804
02:09:27,602 --> 02:09:28,690
Bye.

1805
02:09:28,734 --> 02:09:29,822
Bye.

1806
02:10:02,985 --> 02:10:04,204
I'm back.

1807
02:10:14,693 --> 02:10:15,650
Shit!

1808
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:18,044
Court!

1809
02:10:27,096 --> 02:10:29,272
original trial was initially...

1810
02:10:32,493 --> 02:10:33,581
I'm so sorry.

1811
02:10:37,890 --> 02:10:40,457
As I was saying...

1812
02:10:40,501 --> 02:10:42,808
the same security
camera footage,

1813
02:10:42,851 --> 02:10:44,810
Exhibit F in the original trial,

1814
02:10:44,853 --> 02:10:46,681
was initially
considered useless,

1815
02:10:46,725 --> 02:10:48,465
but has now

1816
02:10:48,509 --> 02:10:50,250
been enhanced,

1817
02:10:50,293 --> 02:10:52,513
using the latest tech

1818
02:10:52,556 --> 02:10:53,862
from Wayne Enterprises.

1819
02:10:54,950 --> 02:10:55,821
It confirms

1820
02:10:56,430 --> 02:10:57,823
the alibi

1821
02:10:57,866 --> 02:10:59,999
Mr. Allen has argued,

1822
02:11:00,042 --> 02:11:01,478
and his son, Barry,

1823
02:11:02,654 --> 02:11:05,482
has corroborated, since day one.

1824
02:11:11,401 --> 02:11:12,402
Here.

1825
02:11:15,971 --> 02:11:19,714
Right here, you can clearly
see my client, Mr. Allen,

1826
02:11:19,758 --> 02:11:22,804
reaching for a can of tomatoes

1827
02:11:22,848 --> 02:11:24,632
on the top shelf.

1828
02:11:42,650 --> 02:11:44,672
Mr. Allen, Mr. Allen, can you tell us
a bit more about what happened, please?

1829
02:11:44,696 --> 02:11:46,741
Well, um...

1830
02:11:46,785 --> 02:11:49,483
the tomatoes moved from the
bottom shelf to the top shelf,

1831
02:11:49,526 --> 02:11:51,006
and subsequently,

1832
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:53,182
uncooked the spaghetti.

1833
02:11:54,314 --> 02:11:55,141
Unquote.

1834
02:11:57,709 --> 02:12:00,629
I'm sorry, that makes absolutely no
sense. What are you talking about, sir?

1835
02:12:00,668 --> 02:12:03,453
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- The allegations, the trial...

1836
02:12:03,497 --> 02:12:05,499
We're good here. Thank you.

1837
02:12:05,542 --> 02:12:07,762
statement
in the court.

1838
02:12:07,806 --> 02:12:09,895
- Did I give a good quote?
- Yeah.

1839
02:12:09,938 --> 02:12:11,984
Spaghetti.

1840
02:12:12,027 --> 02:12:14,464
Hey, speaking of food,
I was thinking, um...

1841
02:12:16,466 --> 02:12:17,729
you should ask me to dinner.

1842
02:12:18,817 --> 02:12:20,122
D-Dinner with me?

1843
02:12:20,166 --> 02:12:22,821
Yes, a date, Barry.

1844
02:12:22,864 --> 02:12:25,737
Iris West, do you
wanna dinner-date me?

1845
02:12:25,780 --> 02:12:27,042
- I'd love to.
- Thank you.

1846
02:12:27,869 --> 02:12:29,001
I'd love to also.

1847
02:12:29,871 --> 02:12:30,872
Call me.

1848
02:12:52,502 --> 02:12:54,548
- Bruce!
- Congratulations.

1849
02:12:54,591 --> 02:12:57,420
Thank you. You have no idea how
good it is to hear your voice.

1850
02:12:57,464 --> 02:13:00,946
I... I have so much to tell you the next
time I see you, Bruce. You were right.

1851
02:13:00,989 --> 02:13:02,251
Okay? And I didn't listen.

1852
02:13:02,295 --> 02:13:04,210
And things did get
very, very weird,

1853
02:13:04,253 --> 02:13:06,429
but I put everything
back, I promise.

1854
02:13:06,473 --> 02:13:07,691
I'm pulling up now.

1855
02:13:08,910 --> 02:13:10,607
Oh, great.

1856
02:13:10,651 --> 02:13:12,281
- Get the shot.
- Sir, sir!

1857
02:13:12,305 --> 02:13:14,655
- Back up, please.
- Shot!

1858
02:13:14,698 --> 02:13:16,111
Sir, I'd like to ask
you for a video for the Daily Planet.

1859
02:13:16,135 --> 02:13:17,775
- Wayne! Wayne!
- Step aside.

1860
02:13:19,965 --> 02:13:21,618
Was it backed by
your own allegation?

1861
02:13:24,665 --> 02:13:26,101
Who the fuck is this?

1862
02:13:26,145 --> 02:13:27,905
He's not
answering any questions.

1863
02:13:28,887 --> 02:13:29,888
Hey, Barry.

1864
02:13:31,019 --> 02:13:32,455
No, wh-where's...

1865
02:13:33,282 --> 02:13:35,023
You're, you... No.

1866
02:13:35,067 --> 02:13:36,546
You can't...

1867
02:13:36,590 --> 02:13:38,722
You... You're not Batman.

1868
02:13:41,334 --> 02:13:42,335
What's wrong with you?

1869
02:13:44,293 --> 02:13:45,729
Huh.

1870
02:13:49,908 --> 02:13:50,952
Well...

1871
02:22:35,737 --> 02:22:37,478
I've told you it's
my metabolism, right?

1872
02:22:37,522 --> 02:22:39,393
I can't get drunk.

1873
02:22:39,437 --> 02:22:41,352
I can't get drink either.

1874
02:22:41,395 --> 02:22:43,658
Listen. Listen, I'm, 'cause
I'm trying to... No, no, no.

1875
02:22:43,702 --> 02:22:46,289
'Cause what I'm trying to explain as
simply as I possibly can, I promise...

1876
02:22:46,313 --> 02:22:48,881
They were all Batman.
They were all Bruce Wayne.

1877
02:22:48,924 --> 02:22:50,772
But each of them was a
completely different person.

1878
02:22:50,796 --> 02:22:54,234
- So, on the other line-time...
- Timeline.

1879
02:22:54,277 --> 02:22:55,278
I'm the same guy?

1880
02:22:55,322 --> 02:22:56,889
Yeah. Actually, pretty much.

1881
02:22:56,932 --> 02:22:58,673
You're lovable, furry...

1882
02:22:58,717 --> 02:23:01,067
loyal, motivated by bacon.

1883
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:03,025
All right, listen.

1884
02:23:03,069 --> 02:23:05,767
Thank you for making it more
simpler for me, Mr. Simple More.

1885
02:23:05,811 --> 02:23:07,639
Yeah, I'm doing my
best.- -

1886
02:23:07,682 --> 02:23:09,728
Look, you're missing
the larger premise here.

1887
02:23:09,771 --> 02:23:12,687
In my timeline, when I...

1888
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:16,038
All right, come on.

1889
02:23:16,082 --> 02:23:17,605
Up, up, Broseidon.

1890
02:23:17,649 --> 02:23:19,302
All right, come on.

1891
02:23:19,346 --> 02:23:21,506
I thought you were gonna
sleep on the couch.

1892
02:23:22,131 --> 02:23:23,350
Arthur, I live right here.

1893
02:23:23,394 --> 02:23:24,395
Harry?

1894
02:23:25,613 --> 02:23:27,441
I live right here. It's okay.

1895
02:23:32,098 --> 02:23:33,229
Okay.

1896
02:23:33,273 --> 02:23:34,883
Oh, hey.

1897
02:23:34,927 --> 02:23:36,668
More beer.

1898
02:23:37,495 --> 02:23:40,106
Go fast. Oh, here! Here.

1899
02:23:40,149 --> 02:23:43,718
Here. Pay with this.

1900
02:23:43,762 --> 02:23:45,416
Arthur, this is
Atlantean treasure.

1901
02:23:45,459 --> 02:23:47,766
You... You tell them that.

1902
02:23:50,769 --> 02:23:52,161
-Yep.

1903
02:23:52,205 --> 02:23:53,119
You're a sailor.

1904
02:23:53,989 --> 02:23:55,991
He's fine.
