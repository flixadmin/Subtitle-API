And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

I gave her freedom, but I taught
her never to dishonor her family.

not an Italian.

her nose was broken,

held together by wire.

She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

We'll discuss it when you
come back from California.

When am I going
to California?

I'd like to go to

Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable proteges.

390
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:02,569
For five years,
we had her under training.

391
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:05,615
Singing lessons, acting
lessons, dancing lessons.

392
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:08,096
I spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars on her,

393
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:10,272
I was gonna make
her a big star.

394
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:13,188
And let me be
even more frank.

395
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:15,538
Just to show you that
I'm not a hardhearted man.

396
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,236
That it's not all
dollars and cents.

397
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,936
She was beautiful.
She was young, she was innocent!

398
00:31:21,979 --> 00:31:24,242
She's the greatest

And then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

401
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,646
And she runs off.

402
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,911
She threw it all away just
to make me look ridiculous!

403
00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:46,134
And a man in my position can't
afford to be made to look ridiculous!

404
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:48,571
Now you get
the hell out of here!

Now...

417
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,413
Sollozzo is known
as The Turk.

418
00:34:15,457 --> 00:34:17,502
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife,

419

but only in matters of business with
some sort of reasonable complaint.

420
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:26,076
Uh, his business is narcotics.

421
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,775
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

422
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:32,692
In Sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin.

Now, he needs cash,
he needs protection from the police.

TOM: Well I say, Yes.

435
00:35:04,898 --> 00:35:07,117
There's more money potential in narcotics than anything else we're looking at.

436
00:35:07,161 --> 00:35:10,033
Now, if we don't get into it, somebody else will,

Maybe the five families,
maybe all of them

Now with the money they earn,

439
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:16,431
they can buy more Police

440
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:18,738
Then they come after us.

441
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:21,088
Now we have the unions,
we have the gambling,

things to have,

but narcotics is the thing

30%.

455
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:07,090
In the first year your end should
be three, four million dollars.

456
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:11,573
And then it would go up.

457
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:13,880
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

That's right.

463
00:36:36,772 --> 00:36:40,863
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

I heard that you were a serious man,

to be treated
with respect.

468
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:14,331
But, I must say no to you.

469
00:37:15,593 --> 00:37:18,553
And I'll give you
my reasons.

470
00:37:18,596 --> 00:37:21,382
It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

selfish reasons.

or if he's struck
by a bolt of lightning,

Don't insist.
