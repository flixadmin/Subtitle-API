1
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:59,070
<i>My son.</i>

2
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,606
My firstborn son.

3
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:09,547
My child king, hush.

4
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:14,618
Listen to the gods,
for you they sing.

5
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:20,324
Fight no more, sweet child.

6
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:22,460
Your wars are won.

7
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:26,464
The wolves are buried

8
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:28,866
and the false stag done.

9
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,439
Shut your blue eyes, my love.

10
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,074
Let the crown fall.

11
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:39,777
The Father above
beckons you to his hall.

12
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:44,715
In Seventh Heaven
I'll see you once more.

13
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:53,090
But now I seek vengeance
on Sansa

14
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:55,926
and my brother the Imp

15
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:58,829
who killed his own king.

16
00:02:58,931 --> 00:03:01,599
Born amongst lions,
our curse from within.

17
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:03,968
I will slay him, I swear.

18
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,637
With noose or with knife,

19
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:09,340
though it take me a fortnight,

20
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:12,977
a moon or my life.

21
00:03:37,537 --> 00:03:39,937
<i>What is that
I hear and smell?</i>

22
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:43,340
<i>Someone I'll soon send to hell.</i>

23
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:46,076
<i>It's time to see if truth they told</i>

24
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:49,013
<i>who said Tywin Lannister gold.</i>

25
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:50,848
<i>Get the wig!</i>

26
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,618
<i>You beast, you beast.
You killed my wife.</i>

27
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,888
<i>And now you've taken
your father's life.</i>

28
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,125
<i>No worse child
ever stained this land.</i>

29
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:04,461
<i>I curse the day I named you.</i>

30
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,733
<i>My greatest crime!</i>

31
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,700
Episode 8 - No One.

32
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:43,167
You're good at that.

33
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:45,736
Where did you learn?

34
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:47,471
I'm a jealous woman.

35
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,874
I've always liked bad men

36
00:04:49,976 --> 00:04:52,076
and they've always liked me.

37
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:56,647
They'd come home wherever
home was that night

38
00:04:56,749 --> 00:05:00,951
stinking of some perfume.

39
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:03,888
So we'd fight and I'd
put a hole in them.

40
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,724
And then I'd feel terrible,

41
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:08,792
so I'd patch them up.

42
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:10,294
<i>I got good at patching them up.</i>

43
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:12,029
And good at putting holes in them.

44
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:14,365
And that.

45
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:19,436
What happened to the actress?

46
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:22,640
<i>The one who wanted you dead.</i>

47
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:24,375
Bianca.

48
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:27,011
She'll have a hard time
finding work as an actress

49
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:29,146
after what I did to her face.

50
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:35,586
Mmm.

51
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:37,755
I never did learn to cook.

52
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:40,424
But eat.
Eat. You need it.

53
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:45,396
The company is moving
on to Pentos soon.

54
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,031
You should come with us.

55
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,166
- I can't.
- Why not?

56
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:51,702
Got a feeling you'd be
good at this sort of work.

57
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:53,871
And besides, we need a new actress.

58
00:05:53,973 --> 00:05:57,708
I don't think I could
remember all of the lines.

59
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,210
Come with us.

60
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:02,279
What's left for you here?

61
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,216
You wouldn't be safe.

62
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,119
Not while she's looking for me.

63
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:11,355
<i>Who?</i>

64
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:13,023
She doesn't have a name.

65
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:20,264
Where will you go?

66
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:26,637
Essos is east and Westeros is west.

67
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:28,706
But what's west of Westeros?

68
00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:31,175
I don't know.

69
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:32,843
Nobody does.

70
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:35,045
<i>That's where all the maps stop.</i>

71
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:37,081
The edge of the world, maybe.

72
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:38,482
<i>I'd like to see that.</i>

73
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:51,562
- What's that?
- Milk of the poppy.

74
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:53,230
I don't want any.

75
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:58,535
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.

76
00:06:58,637 --> 00:07:02,473
Trust me, if my soup didn't
kill you, nothing will.

77
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:48,185
Thing about Gatins, right,
is he used to be pretty.

78
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:49,620
I was a famous kisser.

79
00:07:49,722 --> 00:07:52,289
You lads know how to kiss proper?

80
00:07:54,326 --> 00:07:55,459
Course we do.

81
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:58,095
This is for masters, this technique.

82
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:00,030
- You're not ready.
- I'm ready.

83
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:02,533
He says he's ready.

84
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:05,636
All right.
Now, pay attention.

85
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:11,742
You put your left hand on the
back of the lady's head.

86
00:08:11,844 --> 00:08:15,145
Your right hand holds the small
of the lady's back like so.

87
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:17,648
Very romantic.

88
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,751
Take your middle finger, yeah,

89
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:22,953
and you jam it right up her bunghole.

90
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,357
<i>So close!</i>

91
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,094
Ah, it smells like to me.

92
00:08:30,196 --> 00:08:31,795
Look at him.
You get hard, boy?

93
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:34,965
Disgusting old twats.

94
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:41,438
Got off on that,
did you, you old

95
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:04,895
Where's the other one?

96
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:07,531
The one with the yellow cloak.

97
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,933
Those are your last words?

98
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:11,902
Come on, you can do better.

99
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:15,939
You're at dying, you know that?

100
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:34,825
From the fire she was reborn
to remake the world.

101
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:40,164
Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light
to her children.

102
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:44,585
If we are steadfast in our love for the
Queen and her faithful advisors,

103
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:48,673
no man will ever lock us in chains again.

104
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,176
I'd call that a successful gambit.

105
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:54,077
- Would you?
- Look around.

106
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,280
The city has come back to life.

107
00:09:56,382 --> 00:10:00,050
- You made a pact with fanatics.
- I did and it worked.

108
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:03,921
If you shaved your beard with a straight
razor, you'd say the razor worked.

109
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:06,190
That doesn't mean
it won't cut your throat.

110
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:09,526
Spoken like a man who has
never had to shave.

111
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:15,999
I'm going to miss you.

112
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:17,701
I know.

113
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:20,804
I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.

114
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:24,174
If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

115
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:29,680
We need friends in Westeros.

116
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:31,348
And we need ships.

117
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,983
Most of all, we need our queen.

118
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:36,553
She'll come back.
She has to.

119
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:39,356
My heart's been broken
too many times already.

120
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:43,894
I'll walk the rest of the way myself.

121
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:45,596
I can't go off on a secret mission

122
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:48,298
in the company of the most
famous dwarf in the city.

123
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:54,171
Varys.

124
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:57,274
The most famous dwarf in the world.

125
00:11:25,437 --> 00:11:27,871
Your Grace, several members
of the Faith Militant

126
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:30,641
have been permitted
entry to the Red Keep.

127
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:32,976
Have been permitted?

128
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:35,212
That's rather a tortured
way of putting it.

129
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:37,848
They demand to see you, Your Grace.

130
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,983
Who permitted them
inside the Red Keep?

131
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:45,522
The king is aware of their presence?

132
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:47,057
<i>He is, Your Grace.</i>

133
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,860
He's currently in his
chambers at prayer.

134
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:07,577
Your Grace, His Holiness
the High Septon

135
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,380
wishes to speak with you at
the Great Sept of Baelor.

136
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:12,115
His Holiness the High Septon

137
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:15,085
is welcome to see me
here in the Red Keep.

138
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:17,654
Your Grace, this is not a request.

139
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:19,956
It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

140
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,659
You are asking me for
something, I'm refusing.

141
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:27,597
The High Septon commands you.

142
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,800
<i>Are you sure you want to refuse him?</i>

143
00:12:32,137 --> 00:12:35,205
He promised me I could stay in
the Red Keep until my trial.

144
00:12:35,307 --> 00:12:37,240
He made no such promises.

145
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:39,366
If you refuse to come of your
own free will...

146
00:12:39,486 --> 00:12:40,607
Get out.

147
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:52,022
Move aside, ser.

148
00:12:55,294 --> 00:12:58,228
Order your man to step aside
or there will be violence.

149
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:07,504
I choose violence.

150
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:52,249
Please tell His High Holiness
he's always welcome to visit.

151
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:06,096
Looks like a siege, my lady.

152
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:09,566
You have a keen military mind, Pod.

153
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:21,411
My lady.
My lady.

154
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:27,117
Who goes there?!

155
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:28,452
State your business!

156
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:30,587
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

157
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:34,524
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
I've come to speak with him.

158
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:39,429
Tell him I have his sword.

159
00:14:50,609 --> 00:14:52,876
Getting a bit old
to be a squire, aren't we?

160
00:14:58,317 --> 00:14:59,583
Podrick Payne.

161
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:02,285
I thought you'd be dead by now.

162
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:03,787
Not yet.

163
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:07,557
- Are they in there?
- Uh-huh.

164
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,530
You think they're

165
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:15,165
What?

166
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:16,867
No.

167
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:19,836
Why not?
I'd her.

168
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:21,571
You'd her, wouldn't you?

169
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:23,974
- I'm her squire.
- Oh.

170
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:27,277
Well, he'd
her, that's for sure.

171
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,346
And she'd him, don't you think?

172
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:31,281
The way she looks at him.

173
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:33,884
The way all women look at
him is frankly irritating.

174
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:37,087
I preferred working with the
little brother on that account.

175
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:40,924
Come on, you're the one
with the magic

176
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:44,427
You must have shown it to her by now.

177
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:49,165
- She's training me to fight.
- Is she?

178
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:51,701
- Oh.
- An hour in the morning, an hour at night.

179
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:53,603
Every day.

180
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:57,507
Then how come an old like me
can still sneak up and murder you?

181
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:00,143
Well, that's a different
sort of fighting.

182
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:01,845
Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

183
00:16:01,947 --> 00:16:04,514
<i>You want to learn
that sort of fighting?</i>

184
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:07,717
All right.

185
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:10,086
All right, let's start
with your footwork.

186
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:12,389
Show me your stance.

187
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:15,392
Now listen to me, Pod.

188
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:18,161
See how your feet
are about a yard apart?

189
00:16:18,263 --> 00:16:21,064
Lesson number one, assume
everyone wants to hit you.

190
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:25,268
'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone
wants to hit a squire.

191
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,971
Do it again.
Come on, don't sulk.

192
00:16:28,073 --> 00:16:29,673
<i>I never thought
you'd find her.</i>

193
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:31,207
<i>I just assumed Sansa was dead.</i>

194
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,410
Why would you assume that?

195
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:37,447
In my experience, girls like
her don't live very long.

196
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:40,183
I don't think you know
many girls like her.

197
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:43,219
Well, I'm proud of you.

198
00:16:43,322 --> 00:16:45,922
<i>I am. You fulfilled your
oath to Catelyn Stark</i>

199
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:47,791
<i>against all odds.</i>

200
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:50,860
Of course, my sister
wants Sansa dead.

201
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:53,563
The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,

202
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:57,400
so there is that complication.

203
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:00,491
What the hell are you doing here?

204
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:02,272
I've come for the Blackfish.

205
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:04,174
You're welcome to have him.

206
00:17:04,276 --> 00:17:08,044
Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons

207
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:11,314
and assume her rightful
position as Lady of Winterfell.

208
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,484
With what army does she
plan on taking Winterfell?

209
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:15,952
The Tully army.

210
00:17:16,054 --> 00:17:17,787
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

211
00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:19,556
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun

212
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:21,391
currently defended
by the Tully rebels,

213
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:23,193
so you can see the conundrum.

214
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:25,473
The Tullys are rebels because
they're fighting for their home?

215
00:17:25,497 --> 00:17:27,931
Riverrun was granted to
the Freys by royal decree.

216
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:31,534
As a reward for betraying Robb
Stark and slaughtering his family.

217
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:33,036
Exactly.

218
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:38,675
We shouldn't argue about politics.

219
00:17:38,777 --> 00:17:41,511
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

220
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:43,580
I know there is honour in you.

221
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:46,449
- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.

222
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:48,451
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

223
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:50,820
I do no such thing.

224
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:53,490
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

225
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:57,127
Ride south again with your mission
complete and your army intact.

226
00:17:57,229 --> 00:17:58,828
What do you propose?

227
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,599
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

228
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:05,035
Let me try to persuade the
Blackfish to give up the castle.

229
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:07,137
Why would he abandon
his ancestral home?

230
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:10,840
Because you'll allow him to lead
the Tully forces safely north.

231
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,712
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

232
00:18:17,783 --> 00:18:20,617
- No.
- He's even more stubborn than you are.

233
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:22,786
All right.

234
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:25,288
Try to talk some sense
into the old goat.

235
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,691
He won't listen, but his men might.

236
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:30,260
Not everybody wants to die
for someone else's home.

237
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:32,395
I need your word.

238
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:35,632
If I persuade him
to abandon the castle,

239
00:18:35,734 --> 00:18:38,168
you'll grant a safe passage north.

240
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,470
You have my word.

241
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:42,505
You have until nightfall.

242
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:02,092
You gave it to me for a purpose.

243
00:19:02,194 --> 00:19:05,395
I've achieved that purpose.

244
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,866
It's yours.

245
00:19:11,603 --> 00:19:13,603
It will always be yours.

246
00:19:22,914 --> 00:19:24,914
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

247
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:27,150
Yes, Lady Brienne?

248
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:31,187
Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender

249
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,157
and if you attack the castle,

250
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:37,293
honour compels me
to fight for Sansa's kin.

251
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:39,462
Of course it does.

252
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:41,064
To fight you.

253
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,737
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

254
00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:00,016
<i>I've said no
three times already.</i>

255
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:02,352
I have a signed letter
from your niece Sansa Stark.

256
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:04,254
I haven't seen her
since she was a child.

257
00:20:04,356 --> 00:20:06,523
I don't know her signature.
I don't know you.

258
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:10,093
And I will not surrender.
Double the guards tonight.

259
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:13,730
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

260
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,765
I can feel it.

261
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:18,434
As I have said,
my name is...

262
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:20,970
Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
I know your father.

263
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:22,872
- Good man.
- He always spoke highly of you.

264
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:25,675
And if he were here now, I'd tell
him the same I'm telling you.

265
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:28,211
If you think I'm abandoning
my family's seat

266
00:20:28,313 --> 00:20:30,613
on the Kingslayer's word of
honour, you're a bloody fool.

267
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:33,383
Riverrun cannot stand against
the Lannisters and the Freys.

268
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:37,086
We can stand longer than your
one-handed friend thinks we can.

269
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:39,622
- He's not my friend.
- No?

270
00:20:41,393 --> 00:20:44,360
Who gave you permission to cross the
siege line and enter the castle?

271
00:20:44,462 --> 00:20:47,230
Who gave you that sword with
the gold lion on the pommel?

272
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:51,134
Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

273
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:54,470
He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

274
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:56,673
He gave me this sword to protect her.

275
00:20:56,775 --> 00:20:59,442
That is what I have done
and I will continue to do

276
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:01,845
until the day I die.

277
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:17,327
She's exactly like her mother.

278
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:26,669
I don't have enough men to
help her take Winterfell.

279
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:28,838
You have more than she does.

280
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,474
She wants her home back.
I understand that.

281
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:33,443
But this is my home.

282
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:35,511
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

283
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:39,215
he can bloody well take it
the way everyone else does.

284
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,668
Find the maester.

285
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,471
We need to get a raven
north to Sansa.

286
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:04,974
What should I write?

287
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:09,646
Tell her I failed.

288
00:22:40,478 --> 00:22:42,078
There's to be a royal announcement?

289
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,147
There is.

290
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:45,848
Why wasn't I informed?

291
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:50,920
There is to be a royal announcement

292
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:52,989
in the throne room

293
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:55,091
at this very moment.

294
00:22:58,096 --> 00:23:00,129
Where are you going?

295
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:05,101
To stand by my son.

296
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:07,870
Your place is in the gallery

297
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:10,640
with the other ladies of the court.

298
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,983
<i>Your Grace...</i>

299
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:40,336
<i>Lords and ladies,</i>

300
00:23:40,438 --> 00:23:43,072
the Faith and the Crown

301
00:23:43,174 --> 00:23:46,409
are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

302
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:50,146
One collapses, so does the other.

303
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:54,217
The Father judges us all.

304
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,752
If you break his laws...

305
00:23:58,623 --> 00:24:00,890
<i>you will be punished.</i>

306
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,462
After conferring with His
Holiness the High Septon,

307
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:08,898
we have determined that Loras Tyrell

308
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,700
and Cersei Lannister's trial

309
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:12,869
<i>will be held in
the Great Sept of Baelor</i>

310
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:15,471
<i>on the first day of the
Festival of the Mother.</i>

311
00:24:21,846 --> 00:24:24,847
Furthermore, after much prayer

312
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:27,016
<i>and reflection,</i>

313
00:24:27,118 --> 00:24:30,219
the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,

314
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:32,288
trial by combat will be forbidden

315
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,424
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

316
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:38,461
<i>The tradition
is a brutish one,</i>

317
00:24:38,563 --> 00:24:40,530
<i>a scheme devised by corrupt rulers</i>

318
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:43,266
<i>in order to avoid
true judgment from the gods.</i>

319
00:24:43,368 --> 00:24:45,868
<i>Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell</i>

320
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,937
will stand trial before seven septons

321
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:50,840
as it was in the earliest
days of the Faith.

322
00:24:50,942 --> 00:24:53,076
<i>Seven blessings to all.</i>

323
00:24:53,178 --> 00:24:55,044
<i>Seven blessings.</i>

324
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:19,902
Your Grace...

325
00:25:20,004 --> 00:25:23,473
that old rumour you told me about.

326
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,477
My little birds investigated.

327
00:25:29,347 --> 00:25:32,081
And?

328
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:35,284
Was it just a rumour
or something more?

329
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:37,019
More.

330
00:25:39,257 --> 00:25:40,857
Much more.

331
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:49,031
<i>You seem happy.</i>

332
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:50,967
I am happy.

333
00:25:52,203 --> 00:25:54,036
You should both be happy as well.

334
00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:58,508
Not so long ago, this city
was ready to devour itself.

335
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,043
Now it's like a man reborn.

336
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:03,246
I will be happy
when our queen returns.

337
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:07,016
Why don't you drink? Why don't
either of you ever drink?

338
00:26:07,118 --> 00:26:08,451
Unsullied never drink.

339
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:09,819
- Why not?
- Rules.

340
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:12,221
And who made these rules?

341
00:26:12,323 --> 00:26:14,223
Your former masters?

342
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:17,393
<i>Those miserable old
didn't want you to be human.</i>

343
00:26:17,495 --> 00:26:19,562
Have a drink with me.

344
00:26:22,534 --> 00:26:25,801
And you?
What's your excuse?

345
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:28,337
I have tried wine before.

346
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,239
It made me feel funny.

347
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:32,308
That's how you know it's working.

348
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:37,280
Here's to our queen.

349
00:26:37,382 --> 00:26:40,650
Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.

350
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:46,088
To Daenerys Stormborn,
Mother of Dragons,

351
00:26:46,191 --> 00:26:48,891
Breaker of Chains,
long may she reign.

352
00:26:48,993 --> 00:26:51,194
- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.

353
00:26:56,935 --> 00:26:58,467
<i>Do you like it?</i>

354
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,603
Tastes like it has turned.

355
00:27:00,705 --> 00:27:03,940
Yes, yes.
Fermentation.

356
00:27:07,512 --> 00:27:12,114
One day, after our queen has
taken the Seven Kingdoms...

357
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:16,085
I'd like to have my own vineyard.

358
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:20,022
Make my own wine.

359
00:27:20,124 --> 00:27:22,625
The Imp's Delight.

360
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,194
Only my close friends could drink it.

361
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,367
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

362
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:34,036
I do not know any jokes.

363
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:35,271
Grey Worm?

364
00:27:37,842 --> 00:27:39,575
Right.

365
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:44,447
Three lords
walk into a tavern...

366
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:47,049
A Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.

367
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:48,651
<i>They order ale,</i>

368
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:51,254
but when the barkeep
brings them over,

369
00:27:51,356 --> 00:27:53,856
each of them finds a fly in his cup.

370
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:58,294
The Lannister, outraged, shoves the
cup aside and demands another.

371
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:02,565
The Martell plucks the fly
out and swallows it whole.

372
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:07,303
The Stark reaches into his cup,

373
00:28:07,405 --> 00:28:10,206
pulls out the fly and shouts,

374
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:12,875
"Spit it out, you wee

375
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:14,310
Spit it out."

376
00:28:20,118 --> 00:28:22,451
It's funnier in Westeros.

377
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:25,755
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

378
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:26,889
Yes.

379
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:30,626
A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

380
00:28:30,728 --> 00:28:32,862
Not a true story, necessarily.

381
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:35,965
A story that's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.

382
00:28:36,067 --> 00:28:37,867
<i>Not at the moment, perhaps.</i>

383
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:40,369
<i>Missandei, do you like the wine?</i>

384
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:41,904
I do.

385
00:28:42,006 --> 00:28:43,339
Tell a joke.

386
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,214
Two translators
are on a sinking ship.

387
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:55,918
The first says,

388
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,387
"Do you know
how to swim?"

389
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:02,958
The second says, "No, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages."

390
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:08,564
Ah!

391
00:29:12,036 --> 00:29:14,136
That is the worst joke I ever heard.

392
00:29:14,238 --> 00:29:15,905
You don't even know what a joke is.

393
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:18,908
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?

394
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,377
You lied to us.

395
00:29:22,947 --> 00:29:24,313
I make joke.

396
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:36,292
More jokes.

397
00:29:36,394 --> 00:29:38,761
I once walked into a brothel

398
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:40,496
with a honeycomb and a jackass.

399
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:43,265
The madam says...

400
00:29:55,513 --> 00:29:58,180
The Masters have come
for their property.

401
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:17,633
Lord Edmure.

402
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:22,037
<i>I apologize for the way
the Freys treated you.</i>

403
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,407
A man of your birth deserves better.

404
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:28,477
You have my word you'll be properly
fed and clothed from now on.

405
00:30:30,481 --> 00:30:32,448
I have your word?

406
00:30:34,652 --> 00:30:37,052
Oh, good.

407
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:39,188
Good, that's...

408
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,257
That's a fine thing.

409
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:45,995
My uncle will never
surrender the castle, ser.

410
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:48,063
Whatever game you're playing.

411
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,032
The Blackfish is an old man.

412
00:30:50,134 --> 00:30:52,234
A good death is all he can hope for.

413
00:30:52,336 --> 00:30:55,404
But you, you have a
child now, I've heard.

414
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:59,341
A son you sired
on your wedding night.

415
00:30:59,444 --> 00:31:01,243
You're a potent man.

416
00:31:01,345 --> 00:31:03,679
A son I've never met

417
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:06,515
born of a wife that I haven't seen

418
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:07,950
since our first night together.

419
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:09,585
You should be with them both.

420
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:12,955
I can arrange that, you realize?

421
00:31:13,057 --> 00:31:15,090
Comfortable rooms for you
at Casterly Rock.

422
00:31:15,193 --> 00:31:18,394
A tutor for your boy, knights to
train him to fight and to ride.

423
00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:20,930
And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

424
00:31:21,032 --> 00:31:23,466
Do you imagine yourself
a decent person?

425
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:26,101
Is that it?

426
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:29,638
After you've massacred my family.

427
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,842
Kept me in a cell for years.

428
00:31:32,944 --> 00:31:34,910
Stolen our lands.

429
00:31:35,012 --> 00:31:37,580
I'll remind you that
our houses are at war.

430
00:31:37,682 --> 00:31:39,815
I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,

431
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:42,418
but rebelling against the
Crown does have consequences.

432
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,965
Says the man who shoved his
sword through his king's back.

433
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,623
Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation?

434
00:31:47,725 --> 00:31:48,958
It's not.

435
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:54,363
You understand. On some
level you understand

436
00:31:54,465 --> 00:31:56,398
that you're an evil man.

437
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,133
I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

438
00:31:58,236 --> 00:32:00,536
Well, that is convenient for you.

439
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:07,443
You're a fine-looking
fellow, aren't you?

440
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:12,615
Your square jaw,

441
00:32:12,717 --> 00:32:14,483
your golden armour.

442
00:32:16,153 --> 00:32:19,255
Tell me, I want to know.

443
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:20,923
I truly do.

444
00:32:21,025 --> 00:32:22,491
How do you live with yourself?

445
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,364
All of us have to believe

446
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:31,467
that we're decent, don't we?

447
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:34,737
You have to sleep at night.

448
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:37,273
How do you tell yourself

449
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,975
that you're decent

450
00:32:40,077 --> 00:32:42,578
after everything that you've done?

451
00:32:48,386 --> 00:32:50,753
I was your sister's prisoner once.

452
00:32:54,025 --> 00:32:57,493
She hit me on the head with a
rock if I remember correctly.

453
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:02,064
Yeah.

454
00:33:03,768 --> 00:33:05,067
She should have killed you.

455
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:07,036
Perhaps, but she didn't.

456
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:12,174
Catelyn Stark hated me
just like you hate me.

457
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:14,543
<i>But I didn't hate her.</i>

458
00:33:14,645 --> 00:33:16,211
I admired her.

459
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:18,180
Far more than her husband or her son.

460
00:33:18,282 --> 00:33:20,549
Do you think I care whom you
admire and whom you don't?

461
00:33:20,651 --> 00:33:23,291
No, I don't, but I'm telling you
anyway because you're my prisoner.

462
00:33:23,321 --> 00:33:25,554
You don't have a choice.

463
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:27,656
The love she had for her children,

464
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,725
I was a little awed by it.

465
00:33:29,827 --> 00:33:32,194
Reminded me of my sister.

466
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:35,431
Oh.
Oh, I see.

467
00:33:37,268 --> 00:33:39,068
You're a madman.

468
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,036
I'm not here to trade insults.

469
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:43,639
- Your sister was a strong...
- Don't talk about Cat!

470
00:33:43,741 --> 00:33:47,643
I'll talk about whomever I want.

471
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:50,746
She loved her children.

472
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,415
I suppose all mothers do,

473
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:56,251
but Catelyn and Cersei,

474
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:58,420
there's a fierceness
you don't often see.

475
00:33:58,522 --> 00:34:01,323
They'd do anything
to protect their babies.

476
00:34:01,425 --> 00:34:03,225
Start a war.

477
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:07,096
Burn cities to ash.
Free their worst enemies.

478
00:34:07,198 --> 00:34:09,365
The things we do for love.

479
00:34:13,704 --> 00:34:17,473
You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters.

480
00:34:17,575 --> 00:34:20,476
That's exactly why I came here.

481
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,246
I love Cersei.

482
00:34:24,348 --> 00:34:26,382
You can laugh at that if you want.

483
00:34:26,484 --> 00:34:28,550
You can sneer.
Doesn't matter.

484
00:34:28,653 --> 00:34:30,519
She needs me.

485
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:34,456
And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.

486
00:34:37,895 --> 00:34:41,030
I'll send for your baby boy.

487
00:34:41,132 --> 00:34:44,400
And I'll launch him into
Riverrun with a catapult.

488
00:34:44,502 --> 00:34:47,803
Because you don't matter
to me, Lord Edmure.

489
00:34:47,905 --> 00:34:50,472
Your son doesn't matter to me.

490
00:34:50,574 --> 00:34:54,243
The people in the castle
don't matter to me.

491
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,479
Only Cersei.

492
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:01,617
And if I have to
slaughter every Tully

493
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:04,787
who ever lived to get back to her,

494
00:35:04,889 --> 00:35:07,389
that's what I'll do.

495
00:35:34,351 --> 00:35:36,919
<i>Who goes there?</i>

496
00:35:37,021 --> 00:35:38,754
Edmure Tully,

497
00:35:38,856 --> 00:35:40,322
son of Hoster Tully

498
00:35:40,424 --> 00:35:42,791
and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.

499
00:35:45,196 --> 00:35:47,062
I demand entry.

500
00:35:47,164 --> 00:35:49,965
Don't let him in.

501
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:52,434
He's the Lord of Riverrun.

502
00:35:52,536 --> 00:35:53,769
I have to obey his commands.

503
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:55,471
He's been their captive

504
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:58,373
ever since they murdered
his king at the Red Wedding.

505
00:35:58,476 --> 00:36:01,510
Why do you think the people who
murdered his king at the Red Wedding

506
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:04,880
would decide to let him come home?

507
00:36:04,982 --> 00:36:08,150
Because it's a trap, you idiot.

508
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:09,551
Don't let him in.

509
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:11,353
He's my lord, my lord.

510
00:36:11,455 --> 00:36:14,223
I've sworn to serve the Lord of
Riverrun and obey his commands.

511
00:36:14,325 --> 00:36:17,126
You're not obeying Edmure's commands.

512
00:36:17,228 --> 00:36:21,196
You're obeying the
Kingslayer's commands.

513
00:36:21,298 --> 00:36:23,966
<i>I demand entry.</i>

514
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:25,434
My lord has given an order.

515
00:36:25,536 --> 00:36:27,536
With a knife to his throat.

516
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:30,072
That is not a valid order.

517
00:36:34,812 --> 00:36:36,912
Lower the drawbridge and
open the gate for Lord Ed...

518
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:39,281
Aye, ser.

519
00:36:39,383 --> 00:36:42,918
I'll have your head before
I surrender Riverrun.

520
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,688
You are not lord
of this castle, my lord.

521
00:36:58,402 --> 00:37:01,270
- Lower the drawbridge.
<i>- Aye, ser!</i>

522
00:37:45,716 --> 00:37:47,382
<i>If you're wrong,</i>

523
00:37:47,484 --> 00:37:51,153
we've just surrendered
our most valuable prisoner.

524
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,928
Welcome home, my lord.

525
00:38:37,668 --> 00:38:40,903
Command all the forces within the
castle to lay down their arms.

526
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,773
Open the gates.

527
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:47,709
- My lord...
- Your lord has given a command.

528
00:39:21,712 --> 00:39:24,746
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

529
00:39:37,895 --> 00:39:40,662
Find the Blackfish.

530
00:39:40,764 --> 00:39:43,999
Put him in irons and hand
him over to the Freys.

531
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:49,671
Find him.

532
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:16,665
Go on.

533
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:18,000
Come with us.

534
00:40:18,102 --> 00:40:19,634
I've run before from the Red Wedding.

535
00:40:19,737 --> 00:40:22,037
I'm not running again.
This is my family home.

536
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:25,774
Your family is in the North.
Come with us.

537
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:28,910
Don't die for pride when you
can fight for your blood.

538
00:40:30,547 --> 00:40:34,182
You'll serve Sansa far
better than I ever could.

539
00:40:39,323 --> 00:40:40,856
<i>All the way down!</i>

540
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:43,759
- <i>Check that out!</i>
- Go on, now.

541
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:46,862
I haven't had a proper
sword fight in years.

542
00:40:46,964 --> 00:40:49,698
I expect I'll make
a fool of myself.

543
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:26,468
We found the Blackfish, my lord.

544
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:28,136
Good.

545
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:30,539
Bring him to me.

546
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:33,041
He died fighting, my lord.

547
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:05,367
- I was wrong. I admit it.
- That changes nothing.

548
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:07,869
The Unsullied could mount
a defence off the beachhead.

549
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:09,025
If the slavers' forces...

550
00:43:09,145 --> 00:43:11,151
No more talking from you.
Your talking gave us this.

551
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:12,819
And I have acknowledged that.
I'm trying...

552
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:14,763
You're trying to tell me
what the army should do.

553
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:17,279
<i>You do not know
what the army should do.</i>

554
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:19,548
All right, what should the army do?

555
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,416
We'll not go to the beach.

556
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:23,818
If we go to the beach, the
Masters will take the pyramid.

557
00:43:23,921 --> 00:43:26,354
The pyramid is the only place
in the city we can defend.

558
00:43:26,456 --> 00:43:27,889
- We stay here.
- And then?

559
00:43:27,991 --> 00:43:29,791
We wait for them to come to us.

560
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:32,093
Then we fight them.

561
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,965
Clegane.

562
00:44:44,067 --> 00:44:46,167
What the doing here?

563
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,370
Chasing them.
You?

564
00:44:48,472 --> 00:44:50,305
Hanging them.

565
00:44:50,407 --> 00:44:52,107
Any particular reason?

566
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:54,576
They're our men.
Or they were.

567
00:44:54,678 --> 00:44:57,245
They attacked a nearby sept
and murdered the villagers.

568
00:44:57,347 --> 00:44:58,513
<i>Why do you want them?</i>

569
00:44:58,615 --> 00:45:00,115
Same reason.

570
00:45:00,217 --> 00:45:02,250
I was helping build it.

571
00:45:02,352 --> 00:45:04,586
<i>They killed a friend of mine.</i>

572
00:45:04,688 --> 00:45:05,954
You've got friends?

573
00:45:06,056 --> 00:45:08,923
Not anymore.
They're mine.

574
00:45:09,026 --> 00:45:11,626
It's the Brotherhood's good name
they've dragged through the dirt.

575
00:45:11,662 --> 00:45:13,361
Your name.
They're mine.

576
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:14,996
I killed you once before, Dondarrion.

577
00:45:15,098 --> 00:45:17,065
Happy to do it again.

578
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:19,434
Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.

579
00:45:20,837 --> 00:45:23,271
Tougher girls than you
have tried to kill me.

580
00:45:25,542 --> 00:45:26,841
You can have one of them.

581
00:45:31,682 --> 00:45:33,048
Two.

582
00:45:44,795 --> 00:45:46,795
No, no, no.

583
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:49,364
We're not butchers.
We hang them.

584
00:45:49,466 --> 00:45:51,099
Hanging?

585
00:45:51,201 --> 00:45:52,600
All over in an instant.

586
00:45:52,703 --> 00:45:54,135
Where's the punishment in that?

587
00:45:54,237 --> 00:45:56,838
- They die.
- We all bloody die.

588
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,407
Except this one here.

589
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:01,576
I'll only gut one of them.

590
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:04,112
<i>No.</i>

591
00:46:04,214 --> 00:46:05,980
I'll chop off one hand.

592
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:09,150
We gave you two of the three
out of respect for your loss.

593
00:46:09,252 --> 00:46:10,652
That's generous.

594
00:46:14,424 --> 00:46:17,492
Bunch of nancies.

595
00:46:17,594 --> 00:46:20,095
There was a time I would
have killed all seven of you

596
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:21,363
just to gut these three.

597
00:46:21,465 --> 00:46:22,764
You're getting old, Clegane.

598
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:24,332
He's not.

599
00:46:26,436 --> 00:46:28,970
Please don't.
I'll give you anything.

600
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:59,434
Got anything to eat?

601
00:47:11,715 --> 00:47:13,882
Enjoying yourself?

602
00:47:13,984 --> 00:47:16,050
I prefer chicken.

603
00:47:17,487 --> 00:47:20,822
You ought to join us.
We could use you.

604
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:24,592
I tried joining.
Didn't work out for me.

605
00:47:24,694 --> 00:47:27,629
Clegane, we're here for a reason.

606
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:32,567
The Lord of Light is keeping
Beric alive for a reason.

607
00:47:32,669 --> 00:47:35,036
He gave a failed, drunk priest

608
00:47:35,138 --> 00:47:37,872
the power to bring him
back for a reason.

609
00:47:37,974 --> 00:47:40,308
We are part of something
larger than ourselves.

610
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:43,578
Lots of horrible
in this world gets done

611
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,747
for something larger than ourselves.

612
00:47:53,056 --> 00:47:56,057
Cold winds are rising in the North.

613
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:58,460
And you're going to go stop them?

614
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:01,129
We need good men to help us.

615
00:48:01,231 --> 00:48:04,999
Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.

616
00:48:06,636 --> 00:48:08,236
<i>True enough.</i>

617
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:11,406
But the Lord of Light gave
you the power to defeat me.

618
00:48:11,508 --> 00:48:14,008
Why?

619
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:17,011
I beat you because I'm
better than you, Beric.

620
00:48:17,113 --> 00:48:21,349
I was better than you before you
started yammering on about the Lord

621
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:24,419
and I'm better than you now.

622
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:26,321
Aye, you're probably right.

623
00:48:26,423 --> 00:48:29,257
You're a fighter.

624
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,593
You were born a fighter.

625
00:48:31,695 --> 00:48:34,095
You walked away from the fight.

626
00:48:34,197 --> 00:48:35,864
How did that go?

627
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:41,936
Good and bad, young and old,

628
00:48:42,038 --> 00:48:44,806
the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.

629
00:48:46,643 --> 00:48:49,878
<i>You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.</i>

630
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,880
It's not too late for you.

631
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:57,478
Lady Crane?

632
00:50:05,722 --> 00:50:07,589
<i>Lady Crane?</i>

633
00:50:13,863 --> 00:50:17,632
If you'd have done your job, she
would have died painlessly.

634
00:50:19,869 --> 00:50:21,970
Instead...

635
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,507
The Many-Faced God
was promised a name.

636
00:50:27,911 --> 00:50:30,011
He must always receive what is his.

637
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:32,814
You can't change that.

638
00:50:32,916 --> 00:50:35,350
I can't change that.

639
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:37,485
No one can.

640
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:42,590
And now he's been
promised another name.

641
00:50:58,141 --> 00:51:00,341
- Hey!
- Get out!

642
00:51:03,213 --> 00:51:05,146
Yah!

643
00:52:24,661 --> 00:52:26,394
Hey!

644
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:31,032
Yah!

645
00:52:32,102 --> 00:52:33,634
Ah!

646
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:48,082
My basket!

647
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:23,678
It will all be over soon.

648
00:54:25,114 --> 00:54:27,915
On your knees or on your feet?

649
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:40,895
Haven't we been through this already?

650
00:54:43,066 --> 00:54:44,832
That won't help you.

651
00:55:56,539 --> 00:55:58,572
You told her to kill me.

652
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:06,914
Yes.

653
00:56:07,016 --> 00:56:09,483
<i>But here you are.</i>

654
00:56:09,585 --> 00:56:12,286
And there she is.

655
00:56:22,498 --> 00:56:25,366
Finally a girl is no one.

656
00:56:28,771 --> 00:56:32,273
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell

657
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,508
and I'm going home.
