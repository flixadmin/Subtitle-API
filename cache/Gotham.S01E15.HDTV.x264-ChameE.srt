Here's a promise, boys.

that.

(laughs)
There's hope for us yet.

67
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,042
Yeah.

68
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:35,878
So, what is this,
our third date?

69
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,514
I believe that's correct.

70
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:42,018
Three dates, and I still haven't
been to your apartment.

71
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,221
Well, what particular room in my
apartment are you interested in?

72
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:47,657
Oh, I don't know.
How's the kitchen?
Small.

73
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,192
Living room?
Dark.

74
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:51,160
What about the bedroom?
The bedroom I think you'd like.

75
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:53,096
Yeah? Taxi!

76
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:55,732
But not tonight.

77
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,667
No?

78
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:59,535
I have
to get a good night's sleep.

79
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:01,504
I start a new job
in the morning.

80
00:04:01,506 --> 00:04:04,340
A new job? Congratulations.
Since when?

81
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:07,143
I heard this morning.
I didn't want to spoil dinner

82
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,911
with a whole big
discussion about it.

83
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:11,514
Why would it spoil dinner?

84
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:14,183
I'm coming to work
at the GCPD.

85

I'm you're new
medical examiner.

86
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:18,454
You're kidding.

87
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:21,324
Wow. That's great.

88
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:23,960
Is it?

89
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:27,597
Of course. I mean, I was the one
that suggested you work there.

90
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,831
Yes, but now it's real.

91
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,700
So? Good.

92
00:04:30,702 --> 00:04:32,769
We'll see, won't we?

93
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:40,943

My father and I stayed

We woke up early

OSWALD:
<i>And then, the worst of it...</i>

134
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,644
Maroni had me locked me
inside a sedan

135
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:07,213
and tried
to crush me alive.

136
00:08:07,215 --> 00:08:10,282
So, well, you can
imagine my concern.

137
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:13,085
Maroni's not a man
to let things go,

138
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,988
and I fear he will
come after me in retaliation.

139
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,524
Were you planning to
clean up the place?

140
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:20,626
What?

141
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:23,863
Oh, um, I... I can...
if you like.

142
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:25,798
It needs it.

143
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,867
Is that blood?

144
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:30,870
Perhaps.

145
00:08:30,872 --> 00:08:33,005
But Don Falcone...

146
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,440
While you're at it...

147
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:37,643
maybe you could do
something about the design.

148
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:39,445
The design?

149
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:41,981
It reeks of Fish Mooney.

150
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,083
What do you think
about the lamps?

151
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:45,818
(anxious laugh)

152
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,654
Don Falcone, maybe
you didn't hear me.

153
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:51,156
I need your protection.

154
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:53,125
Maroni will surely
try and kill me.

155
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:54,460
Yes.

156
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:56,862
The lamps should go.

157
00:08:56,864 --> 00:09:00,199
Don Falcone, please!

158
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:03,202
Maroni wants my scalp,
and you'd have me redecorate.

159
00:09:05,238 --> 00:09:08,173
This nightclub makes
a lot of money.

160
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:10,543
Without money,
we lose influence.

161
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:12,545
Without influence,
we lose control.

162
00:09:12,547 --> 00:09:15,614
And without control,
Maroni killing you

163
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:17,016
is no longer a hypothetical.

164
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:18,284
It's a foregone conclusion.

165
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:21,453
That's why I want
to reopen it.

166
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,255
Under your care.

167
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:25,157
I can have the club?

168
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,191
(gasps)

169
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:27,226
It's mine?

170
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:28,661
You've earned it.

171
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:31,697
Your days of sneaking around,
spying on Maroni, are over.

172
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,666
You're with me now.

173
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:35,434
Publicly.

174
00:09:35,436 --> 00:09:37,102
Things are gonna
be much different.

175
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:39,905
So spruce up the place,
get it open.

176
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:43,275
As for Maroni, leave him to me.

177
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:46,278
What do you got?

178
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,247
BULLOCK: Your book
where the victim taught English.

179
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:50,115
Tell you one thing--

180
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:52,217
girls didn't look like this
when I was back in high school.

181
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:53,285
Easy...

182
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:55,254
I'm just sayin'.

183
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:57,289
Hi, Jim.

184
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,593
Lee. You remember
Harvey, right?

185
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:02,494
BULLOCK:
Hi, Lee.
Hi.

186
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,396
Lee's our new M.E.

187
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:06,932
You're joking.

188
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:08,667
No.
ESSEN:
Oh, good.

189
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:09,935
You've met.

190
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:12,037
Oh, Detective Gordon and I
already know each other.

191
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:14,173
Oh, right.
From Arkham?

192
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:15,608
Right. Arkham.

193
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,409
Welcome aboard.

194
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:18,911
Thank you.

195
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:20,846
ESSEN: You can fill her in
on your cases later.

196
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:22,147
Dr. Thompkins,
will you follow me?

197
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,416
Lots to get you
up to speed on.

198
00:10:24,418 --> 00:10:26,418
It was good to see you again,
Detective.

199
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,654
It was really good
to see you, Doctor.

200
00:10:33,526 --> 00:10:35,694
You have no luck at all,
do you, brother?

201
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:38,430
What do you mean?
You find a fine
lady like that,

202
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:41,066
and she comes to work
with you in the same building?

203
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,668
It's a damn shame.

204
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,169
Why?

205
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:48,207
Office romance
always ends in tears-- tears!

206
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:49,708
It's not gonna be like that.

207
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,244
Trust me. I know.

208
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:58,283
There.

209
00:10:58,285 --> 00:10:59,885
Holy Mother Mary.

210
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:03,255
You got him?
Staring right back at me.

211
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:05,591
That's him. That's him.
That's the guy from the pool.

212
00:11:05,593 --> 00:11:06,892
His name is Gerald Crane.

213
00:11:06,894 --> 00:11:08,894
He's a biology teacher.

214
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:11,230
School doesn't let out
for hours.

215
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:13,599
Let's go.

216
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:17,503
I'm Kelly.

217
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:18,971
Fish.

218
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:20,305
Fish?

219
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:22,808
That's what I said: Fish.

220
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,376
(man coughing in distance)

221
00:11:24,378 --> 00:11:26,612
So... where are we?

222
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,447
What is this place?

223
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,949
Some people think
it's a prison.

224
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:33,252
Some think it's Hell.

225
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:36,088
I just think
it's cold, mostly.

226
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,423
(gate creaks open)

227
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,761
Breakfast.

228
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:45,864
No. Uh-uh.
(grunts)

229
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:51,003
You got to let
the boss eat first.

230
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:53,572
People call him Mace.

231
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:56,041
He's the one in charge, hmm?

232
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,278
Okay. Okay.

233
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,579
MAN: Get up there!
Get up there!

234
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:02,815
Go on! Move!

235
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:04,850
(birds chirping, water burbling)

236
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:39,518
WOMAN:<i> Gerald called in one day</i>
<i>and said he wasn't coming in.</i>

237
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,720
That's the last I heard of him.
Let me guess,
that was about three weeks ago?

238
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:44,523
Yeah.
That's when neighbors said
he up and moved out.

239
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:46,792
Unis searched the place.
Nothing.
Hmm.

240
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:48,861
So what can you tell us
about Crane?

241
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:50,462
He was a
good teacher.

242
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:52,397
Focused. And a good father.

243
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,101
He was very protective
of his son Jonathan.

244
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:59,104
But he could be quiet, too.
Somber.

245
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:01,507
Think it had to do
with his wife-- she died six

246
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:02,674
or seven years ago.

247
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:04,710
She died? How?
Uh,

248
00:13:04,712 --> 00:13:06,178
car accident.

249
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,181
Did Crane ever talk
about fear or phobias?

250
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:10,482
Why?

251
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:13,252
Is someone targeting phobics?

252
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:15,154
Yeah.

253
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:17,689
Killing them?

254
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:19,958
Does this mean something to you?

255
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,226
These victims,

256
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:22,895
were they missing
their adrenal glands?

257
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:24,329
How'd you know that?

258
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:26,265
Uh...

259
00:13:28,401 --> 00:13:31,203
This was an academic paper

260
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:32,404
that Gerald wrote
a few months ago.

261
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:33,739
He asked me to proof it for him.

262
00:13:33,741 --> 00:13:35,240
See, Gerald had a theory

263
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:38,744
that fear was an
evolutionary flaw in humans.

264
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:41,246
War, rape,
theft, murder--

265
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:43,048
it was all caused by fear.

266
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,917
He was obsessed
with it.
GORDON: So Crane

267
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,719
killed these people and took
their glands to test a theory?

268
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:51,490
No... Gerald wasn't trying to
prove he was right about fear.

269
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:54,026
He was trying
to cure himself of it.

270
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:55,360
NYGMA:
<i>Crane's idea</i>

271
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:57,563
of curing fear was to
inoculate himself against it.

272
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:59,731
Like a disease?
Exactly. But in
order to do so,

273
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:02,501
he needed a condensed source
of the hormones that cause fear.

274
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:04,102
Phobics.

275
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,038
Crane's preying
on them?

276
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,340
Spiking their fear
by scaring them

277
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:10,809
and then killing them in order
to harvest the hormones?

278
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:12,144
BULLOCK:
Damn!

279
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:13,679
How much of this stuff
does he need?

280
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:14,880
What do you mean?

281
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:16,949
How many more people
is he gonna kill?

282
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:18,917
Oh. Of course.
Good question.

283
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,919
Depends on how scared
he is, I guess.

284
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:22,187
What's he scared of?

285
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:23,856
In Scottie's phobia
support group,

286
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,657
he said he was afraid
of failure.

287
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:26,925
(Bullock sniffing)

288
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:29,661
GORDON: Who isn't?
It's gotta be something else.

289
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:32,164
Did you hear?
Hear what?

290
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,665
That we got
a new medical examiner.

291
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,601
Much better
than the old one.

292
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:37,469
And she smells nice.

293
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:38,604
(chuckles)

294
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:40,606
See, Jim?
Competition already.

295
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:42,608
Look at this.

296
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,944
Crane developed protocols
for two inoculations,

297
00:14:45,946 --> 00:14:48,680
himself and somebody else--
Subject B.

298
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:49,781
Ooh!

299
00:14:49,783 --> 00:14:51,717
I wonder who that is.

300
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:53,785
(gulls squawking)

301
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:57,055
(moaning)

302
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:59,124
(heart beating rapidly)

303
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:11,937
(heartbeat slowing)

304
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:20,979
(heartbeat slowing further)

305
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:25,183
JONATHAN:
Dad...

306
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,361
Dad?

307
00:15:36,363 --> 00:15:38,096
You okay?

308
00:15:38,098 --> 00:15:40,165
I'm glorious.

309
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:44,469
It's working, Jonathan.

310
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:48,073
I said it would.

311
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:50,409
And it's almost your turn.

312
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:54,579
You will be free
of fear forever.

313
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:56,448
You'll be cured.

314
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,352
Are you ready, Jonathan?

315
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:02,421
Are you ready, son?

316
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:14,295
Thank you for having me.
My pleasure.

317
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:15,963
We're friends, right?

318
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:19,433
Of course.
Then let me talk
to you as a friend.

319
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:22,169
You want to have lunch,
take a walk,

320
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:24,505
I'm happy to.

321
00:16:24,507 --> 00:16:26,574
But a sandwich and a stroll
ain't gonna keep me

322
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:27,741
from killing Penguin.

323
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:30,044
That little rat is dead.

324
00:16:30,046 --> 00:16:32,112
So be it.

325
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:36,150
MAN: Mr. Cobblepot,
will this do?

326
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:38,219
We will not be serving that.

327
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:44,158
No, no, no.

328
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,727
I said lose the drapes,
not tie them back!

329
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:49,363
We're opening in ten hours!

330
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:52,233
MAN 2:
Sorry.
Hey, boss...

in spirit,

498
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:51,588
he's yours.

499
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,323
Now smile for the camera.

500
00:27:53,325 --> 00:27:55,325
(Turnbull whimpering)

501
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:57,394
It's beautiful.

502
00:27:58,629 --> 00:28:00,630
GORDON: We must be
missing something.

503
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:03,133
BULLOCK: What about
your pal Penguin?

504
00:28:03,135 --> 00:28:05,135
What about him?

505
00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:06,503
He helped us with Flass.

506
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:08,838
Maybe he'll help us with Crane.

507
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,140
No. I'm not going back to him.

508
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:12,442
It's worth a try.
No, it's not.

509
00:28:12,444 --> 00:28:13,910
Then we wait for another
body to drop,

510
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:15,979
because we're not
gonna find him here.

511
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:20,150
Yeah, you're right.

512
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:23,286
We're never gonna
be able to track Crane.

513
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:24,354
We gotta get ahead of him

514
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:25,455
by finding out
what's driving him.

515
00:28:25,457 --> 00:28:27,123
We know what's driving him.

516
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,858
He's obsessed with fear.
Yeah.

517
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,859
But why?

518
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:31,728
What's he afraid of?

519
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,929
What happened to him that

520
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:34,497
made him this way?

521
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:37,067
His wife was killed
in a car crash.

522
00:28:38,602 --> 00:28:40,070
Yeah.

523
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:41,204
Check that out.

524
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,911
BULLOCK:
Got it. Karen Crane.

525
00:28:47,913 --> 00:28:49,679
GORDON: Yeah.

526
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:52,182
Says here she died
in a house fire,
not a car accident.

527
00:28:52,184 --> 00:28:55,085
You think
the coworker was lying?

528
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:57,554
Three other people
said the same thing.

529
00:28:57,556 --> 00:28:59,556
Crane must've lied
about it for some reason.

530
00:28:59,558 --> 00:29:00,890
What happened in the fire?

531
00:29:00,892 --> 00:29:02,225
Article says she was
sleeping upstairs

532
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:03,526
when the fire broke out.

533
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:06,129
Husband Gerald
and son Jonathan, eight,

534
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:08,198
were downstairs.

535
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,701
Crane was in the house
when his wife died?

536
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:13,770
And didn't save her.
No wonder he lied.

537
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:15,505
He's ashamed.

538
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:17,907
His fear is the reason
his wife died.

539
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:19,275
That's why
he's doing this.

540
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:21,244
Address for the old Crane house.
Let's go.

541
00:29:21,246 --> 00:29:23,780
Okay.

542
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:31,988
<i>(heartbeat slowing)</i>

543
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:45,635
Jonathan!

544
00:29:50,674 --> 00:29:52,408
(door slams in distance)

545
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,844
Jonathan!

546
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:57,881
Stop, Johnny, stop!

547
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,015
Stop there!

548
00:29:59,017 --> 00:30:02,485
We've started
the protocol.

549
00:30:02,487 --> 00:30:04,788
It must be completed, it will
be harmful for you otherwise.

550
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,023
I can't... I can't do it again.

551
00:30:07,025 --> 00:30:09,159
Think of it Johnny--
no more fear.

552
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:11,494
I'm not-I'm not even
afraid like you.

553
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:12,862
We're all afraid.

554
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:14,697
Every man and woman
on the planet.

555
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,599
We're all standing
at the edge of the abyss,

556
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:17,734
paralyzed by fear.

557
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:21,104
Now, come on, son.

558
00:30:21,106 --> 00:30:22,539
Trust me.

559
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,207
I just want to help you.

560
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:26,009
And mankind.

561
00:30:26,011 --> 00:30:27,811
Mankind, Johnny.

562
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:30,947
Now you must
be brave, hmm?

563
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:32,282
Come on, son.

564
00:30:32,284 --> 00:30:34,150
Are you with me?

565
00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:35,985
Then let's go back
to the house.

566
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:39,222
It'll all be over before
you know it, I promise.

567
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:43,793
Come on.

568
00:31:03,544 --> 00:31:05,611
(watch ticking)

569
00:31:12,953 --> 00:31:15,021

00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,478
(gasping in pain)

571
00:31:52,726 --> 00:31:54,794
(grunts)

572
00:31:58,632 --> 00:32:00,133
Ah, come on.

573
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:01,701
(grunting):
Come on.

574
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,942
What's up, Doc?

575
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,052
The name's Mace.

576
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:21,554
That's cute, but I like

577
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:24,023
to give my friends
nicknames.

578
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,492
And yours is Doc...

579
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:28,661
'cause you have
such a wise look in your eyes

580
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:30,730
for such a big man.

581
00:32:30,732 --> 00:32:33,199
A real little firecracker, huh?

582
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,667
Mm.

583
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:36,135
A firecracker goes off once

584
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:38,805
and then just lies there.

585
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:42,175
What you're looking at
is the Fourth of July.

586
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:44,510
Come sit by me.

587
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:46,379
Does that mean we have a deal?
Sure, baby.

588
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,182
Well, I have a couple of riders
I would like to talk to you...

589
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:51,184
Hush, now, baby.
(weak laugh)

590
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:54,220
You talk too much and
you'll make me mad.

591
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,255
Huh, let's see...

592
00:32:56,257 --> 00:32:58,524
That's rider number one.

593
00:32:58,526 --> 00:33:00,827
Don't call me "baby."

594
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:02,228
(grunting)

595
00:33:03,931 --> 00:33:04,997
Ah!

596
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:10,870
My name is Fish Mooney.

597
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:13,439
I'm in charge now.

GCPD!

604
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:44,370
Dad, they are going
to arrest you

605
00:33:44,372 --> 00:33:46,038
once they come in here.
We have to go now!

606
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,441
There's still time.
We can complete the protocol.

607
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,109
Coming in.

608
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,444

(panting):
What are you doing?

611
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,689
We have to finish the protocol.

612
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:06,092
It's the only way.
Dad, that's too much.

613
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:08,394
(whispers):
It's the only way.

614
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,899
Look, Dad...

615
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:14,834
there's not enough time.

616
00:34:14,836 --> 00:34:17,069
It'll be fine.

617
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,140
I love you, son.
Stop!

Or do you want to wait
and watch the sunrise?

664
00:36:46,448 --> 00:36:49,283
Like you did with your dad.

665
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:54,521
Well, Alfred...

666
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:57,524
...we can only stay
if you think you can handle it.

667
00:36:57,526 --> 00:37:00,394
If I can handle it?

668
00:37:00,396 --> 00:37:03,263
Mate, this place
is positively cushy

669
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:06,800
compared to some
of the places I've slept at.

670
00:37:06,802 --> 00:37:08,335
Cup of tea,
you cheeky monkey?

671
00:37:08,337 --> 00:37:10,070
(quiet laugh)

Penguin.

682
00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:43,971
Where you going?

683
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:49,643
Don Maroni.

684
00:37:49,645 --> 00:37:52,679
It's such a pleasure to see you.

685
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:54,014
Look at you.

686
00:37:54,016 --> 00:37:56,650
From the trunk of my car
to running your own club.

687
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:59,319
The place looks
good, Penguin.

688
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:01,488
Hell of a turnout.

689
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,990
(henchman chuckles)

690
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:04,858
HENCHMAN:
Yeah.
How 'bout a table?

691
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,993
Drinks?

692
00:38:05,995 --> 00:38:08,228
My compliments, of course.

693
00:38:10,732 --> 00:38:12,199
Expensive stuff.

694
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:13,900
Let me see.

695
00:38:17,572 --> 00:38:20,907
I had a little chat
with Falcone.

696
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:24,111
I came here to let you know
that all is kosher between us.

697
00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:28,882
Long as you don't go giving
Falcone any more of my secrets.

698
00:38:28,884 --> 00:38:30,083
Huh?

699
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:31,418
No.

700
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,253
Nothing like that.

701
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:34,521
Of course not.

702
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:35,956
Grab a glass.

703
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:43,096
You better hope that old man,
Falcone, lives a long life.

704
00:38:43,098 --> 00:38:46,833
'Cause the second
he's out the picture,

705
00:38:46,835 --> 00:38:48,335
so are you.

706
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:00,881
(birds chirping)

707
00:39:07,522 --> 00:39:09,589
Master B.

708
00:39:20,034 --> 00:39:21,435
ALFRED:
Sunrise.

709
00:39:35,783 --> 00:39:37,117
(knocking)
Oh, hey.

710
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,251
How are you?

711
00:39:38,253 --> 00:39:40,153
I heard your suspect was killed.

712
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:41,955
Came after Harvey and me
with a gun.

713
00:39:41,957 --> 00:39:44,291
Didn't have a choice.
I'm so sorry.

714
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:46,727
What about his son?
(sighs)

715
00:39:46,729 --> 00:39:49,563
Paramedics were able
to stabilize him.

716
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:52,032
I'm heading over to the hospital
now, to check in on him.

717
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:53,633
Well, let me know how he is.

718
00:39:53,635 --> 00:39:55,702
I will.

719
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:58,939
So, settled in here, huh?

720
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:01,274
Uh, almost.

721
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,409
Think you're gonna like it here?

722
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:05,078
I do. So far.

723
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:08,582
Good.

724
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:11,118
Um, I have tickets
to the circus.

725
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,586
Do you want to
come with me?

726
00:40:12,588 --> 00:40:15,422
The circus?
Yeah.
They're good.

727
00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:17,457
No, uh, sad elephants.
(chuckles)

728
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,195
The circus. Sure. Why not?

729
00:40:22,197 --> 00:40:24,564
Look, Lee...

730
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:27,434
Um...

731
00:40:27,436 --> 00:40:30,804
no kissing, here, on the job.

732
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:32,639
Okay?
I'm serious.

733
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:34,307
Okay.

734
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:35,709
Okay?

735
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:38,979
If your hard-ass reputation
is worth that much to you.

736
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:41,581
This is a place of work.
Cops have feelings, too.

737
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,650
It's not unprofessional
to show your feelings.

738
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:46,586
Yeah, it is.
Those kinds of feelings, yeah.

739
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:49,156
Fine. Be that way.

740
00:40:49,158 --> 00:40:51,158
Hey...

741
00:40:52,193 --> 00:40:53,960
I'm just joking.

742
00:40:53,962 --> 00:40:55,095
I'll be discreet.

743
00:41:02,703 --> 00:41:06,540
All right,
everyone gather round!

744
00:41:10,077 --> 00:41:13,547
Up until now,
there's been no order in here.

745
00:41:15,716 --> 00:41:18,318
No... structure.

746
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:28,328
Things are gonna change.

747
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:32,032
(gate opens,
weapons clicking)

748
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:35,035
(woman crying)

749
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:37,504
(grunting)

750
00:41:37,506 --> 00:41:39,105
(gate creaks shut)

751
00:41:39,107 --> 00:41:40,640
(crying)

752
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:42,576
She's back.

753
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:44,644
(woman sobbing)

754
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:49,249
(sobbing):
My eyes.

755
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:54,020
They took my eyes.

756
00:42:00,828 --> 00:42:02,262
DOCTOR:
<i>The boy received a massive dose</i>

757
00:42:02,264 --> 00:42:04,431
of condensed hormones--

758
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:06,266
cortisol, adrenaline--

759
00:42:06,268 --> 00:42:10,470
and another compound we're
still trying to identify.

760
00:42:10,472 --> 00:42:13,440
The combination
nearly killed him.

761
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:15,709
But he's gonna live?

762
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:17,310
Yes.

763
00:42:17,312 --> 00:42:18,778
But we ran a CAT scan

764
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,481
in order to determine
if he suffered any brain damage.

765
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:22,749
The results...

766
00:42:22,751 --> 00:42:24,518
we've never seen anything
like them before.

767
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,187
The hormones themselves
have long since worn off,

768
00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:28,455
but the effects,

769
00:42:28,457 --> 00:42:31,191
they seem to be lingering.

770
00:42:31,193 --> 00:42:32,592
What are you saying?

771
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:34,127
That he's still in fear?

772
00:42:34,129 --> 00:42:36,029
Well, not just fear.

773
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:37,163
Jonathan's brain activity shows

774
00:42:37,165 --> 00:42:40,367
he's in a constant state
of intense terror.

775
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:41,601
How long until this goes away?

776
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:42,669
Well...

777
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:45,338
that's just the thing,
Detective.

778
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,675
We can't be certain
it ever will.

779
00:42:48,677 --> 00:42:52,512
Imagine the thing
you fear most in the world.

780
00:42:53,481 --> 00:42:56,650
Imagine that
it's all you see.

781
00:42:56,652 --> 00:42:58,919
Every waking hour.

782
00:43:13,234 --> 00:43:15,302
(gasping)

783
00:43:16,337 --> 00:43:18,672
<i>(heart beating rapidly)</i>

784
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:20,574
No, no, no!

785
00:43:20,576 --> 00:43:23,176
(panting)

786
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:27,547
(distorted growling)

787
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,651
(panting)

788
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:35,088
(Jonathan screaming)
