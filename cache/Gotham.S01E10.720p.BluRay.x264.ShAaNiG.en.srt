1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,924
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham:

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,844
I need to siphon his strength.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,004
So when the time is right,
taking over his organization...

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,889
...will be like slipping on a glove.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,801
The point wasn't to steal that money,
Butch.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,371
It was to hurt Falcone.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,363
- What's her name?
- Selina Kyle.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,251
- So she saw everything?
- Yes.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,562
Her being here
will put Master Bruce in danger.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,849
She's the best chance we have
of finding who killed my parents.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,486
You are gonna keep working for Fish.

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,726
You are gonna tell me every little thing
that she says.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,406
Lovecraft, I have a witness
who ties you to the crime.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,006
You and all the others involved.

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,006
- So tell me, Dent, who did I kill?
- Thomas and Martha Wayne.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,770
You lost, miss?

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,490
This is Wayne Manor?

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,927
Yeah, but not sure you should be here.

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,169
- I'll point you back to the road if you're lost.
- No, thanks.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,721
I am where I need to be.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,800
Open him.

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,524
Keep it tight here.

23
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,447
Better?

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,125
Better.

25
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,042
If you wanna test yourself, you should
come with me to the Midtown Bridge.

26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,448
- You've climbed it?
- Yeah, to the top.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,002
Kids go up there to make out all the time.

28
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,771
I could take you if you want.

29
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,607
Okay. I'd like that.

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,686
Let me ask you a question.

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,651
What's up with all the weird homework
about your mom and dad?

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,128
- I'm trying to understand why it happened.
- There's no why.

33
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,170
Bad stuff happens.
You-- You gotta get over it.

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,085
Maybe you're right.

35
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,765
Of course I'm right.

36
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,080
You wanna kiss me?

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,291
No, thank you.

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,921
No?

39
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,803
I would like to, but I can't help feeling
you have an ulterior motive.

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,170
I don't imagine you consider me
a suitable romantic partner.

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,402
So why would you wanna kiss me?
I don't know.

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,327
You think too much, kid.

43
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,369
I'm just trying to be nice.

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,484
No offense,
you don't strike me as a nice person.

45
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,929
What do you mean? I'm nice.

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,243
I don't mean you're not a good person,
but you're not nice.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,446
You don't care much for other people.

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,645
Screw you, orphan.

49
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,565
Climb the damn bridge on your own.

50
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,844
Yes, hello, miss. How can I help--?

51
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,840
- Oh, dear.
- My car-- It went off the road.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,002
- Please.
- Please, come in.

53
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,850
Come in at once.

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,926
- If you could call an ambulance--
- Where exactly are you hurt?

55
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,131
Alfred.

56
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,045
Is everything all right?

57
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,363
No, Master Bruce. This lady's
been involved in a car accident.

58
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,610
Run. Run!

59
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,241
- This better be a way out.
- Through the closet.

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,482
- We need to help Alfred--
- There's no time.

61
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,285
- Bruce, come on.
- Alfred might be hurt. I can't leave him.

62
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,849
He told you to run.

63
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,806
Fine.

64
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,962
Stay, but I'm out.

65
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,561
Bruce!

66
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,523
Local P.D. is searching the woods.
So far, no sign of Bruce or Selina.

67
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,887
What can you tell me about this woman?

68
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,646
She was in her early 30s.

69
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,928
Pretty tasty fighter, actually.

70
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,570
Mate, it's just a scratch.

71
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,690
Shove off, will you? I got stuff to do.

72
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,606
Look, we got 50 police in the woods,
even more on the roads.

73
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,888
We need to focus on this woman
and her people.

74
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,611
- What can you tell me?
- They were trying to kill us.

75
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,764
- Your little girl brought them here.
- We don't know that yet.

76
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,001
Jim.

77
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,722
You must be Alfred Pennyworth.

78
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,770
- Nice job out there.
- Yeah, well, not nice enough, eh?

79
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,322
This was taken off the dead guy.
Nothing else. No keys, no ID, nada.

80
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,049
Now, I know this girl.
She was grabbed by the child snatchers.

81
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,682
And now she's getting attacked
by assassins at Wayne freaking Manor?

82
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,167
What the hell is going on, compadre?

83
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,846
- What, you hadn't told him?
- Told me what?

84
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,288
Selina Kyle was in the alley
the night the Waynes were murdered.

85
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,410
- Saw the killer's face.
- For Pete's sake, don't do this to me.

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,570
Harvey Dent in the DA's office
is investigating Dick Lovecraft.

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,291
He thinks Lovecraft is connected
to the Wayne killings.

88
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,482
So he leaked that we had a witness.

89
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,844
He thought he could spook Lovecraft.
Get him to reveal himself.

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,288
Why, that's a hell of a plan.
How did it work out? Bravo.

91
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,602
Thought she was safe.
No one knew she was here.

92
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,001
Well, you were wrong,
weren't you, you plank?

93
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,449
How did they know?

94
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,683
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You would've tried to stop me.

95
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,042
Of course I would've, you putz.

96
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,647
What the hell are you thinking?
The Wayne case is closed. It is closed!

97
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,888
- You know it's not--!
- Don't tell me what I know!

98
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,168
Would you shut up? The pair of you!

99
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,729
You can argue later.

100
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,602
Right now we need to find Master Bruce.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,047
All right.

102
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,091
If they don't come back soon, they would've
gone to Gotham. Selina feels safe there.

103
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,130
Good luck trying to find her in the city.
Street kid like that?

104
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,171
- But you will help us find her, right?
- Yeah.

105
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,051
Of course I will,
because I have to be crazy.

106
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,244
Thank you. All right,
I'll focus on Lovecraft. I'll find him.

107
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,165
If he's behind this,
I'll get him to call off the contract.

108
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,800
- How you gonna do that?
- I'll think of something.

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,731
Run the streets, huh?
Focus on your contacts.

110
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,605
- Go to work.
- I'll come with you.

111
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,761
All right.

112
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,524
You're pretty handy for a valet.

113
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,242
Butler, mate.

114
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,129
I'm a butler.

115
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,205
- We need to call Alfred.
- You see any phones?

116
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,051
No.

117
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,403
Perhaps we should go back to my house.

118
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,643
- If the police are there, we'll know it's safe.
- Yeah, right.

119
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,041
The police will make it safe?

120
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,166
We have to contact the police
at some point.

121
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,368
Someone tried to kill you.

122
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,806
Me?

123
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,167
Nobody knew I was there.

124
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,811
It's your house.
Someone wants to kill you. Duh.

125
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,125
Why would anyone wanna kill me?

126
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,284
Must be all that lame detective work
you're doing.

127
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,528
Paid off good, huh?

128
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,484
Cheer up.

129
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,610
We're cool.

130
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,886
We lost them.

131
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,931
- I'm worried about Alfred.
- Relax.

132
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,923
Once I got you safely hidden in the city,
I'll find you a phone.

133
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,770
Thank you.

134
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,289
- I appreciate your help.
- Hey.

135
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,489
Just trying to be nice.

136
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,248
How did Maroni know
where my money was?

137
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,207
Well, that's a very good question.

138
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,961
Not to criticize,
but you could've just called me.

139
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,923
I'm going to ask you once more.

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,004
How did Maroni know
where I kept my money? No one knew.

141
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,686
The robbery at the armory--

142
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,486
That wasn't Maroni.

143
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,205
I thought we were friends.

144
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,930
We had an understanding.

145
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,130
You tell me every move Maroni makes.

146
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,001
What happened?

147
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,810
When did you turn on me?

148
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,962
Never, Don Falcone.

149
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,610
I swear. Never.

150
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,481
Maroni had nothing to do
with the armory job.

151
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,566
I would know. I would've told you.

152
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,167
Who was it if not Maroni?
And how did they know about my money?

153
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,687
Thank you, Liza. Won't be long.

154
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,450
I'll come back.

155
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,365
I asked you a question.

156
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,490
Oh, you have a mole, obviously.

157
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,088
Which is not Maroni's forte, is it?

158
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,044
This is someone else.

159
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,361
Someone artful.

160
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,124
Someone close to you.

161
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,766
I know who you're going to name.

162
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,528
But your hatred of Fish makes me doubt
anything you say against her.

163
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,728
With respect...

164
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,408
...I don't understand
why you still tolerate her existence.

165
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,089
She has proved her disloyalty
a hundred times.

166
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,605
She wants your head.

167
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,441
Like half the people who work for me.

168
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,008
Fish makes me a lot of money.

169
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,642
I can handle Fish Mooney
or whatever son of a bitch did this to me.

170
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,567
Tell me how to find the mole.

171
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,725
You leave that to me, Don Falcone.

172
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,130
Dirty work. I'll find your mole for you.

173
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,604
Trust me...

174
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,410
...he'll belong to Fish.

175
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,685
Bring me proof.

176
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,771
- I don't get it.
- You, Gabe, not get it?

177
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,924
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>

178
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,242
What, pray, don't you get?

179
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,449
Why not just tell Falcone the truth?

180
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,122
It was that Liza girl that betrayed him.

181
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,008
Timing, Gabriel.

182
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,889
Timing is everything.

183
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,361
And Liza is a time bomb.

184
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,886
Just wait a while.

185
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,642
Then watch and learn.

186
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,404
Stay there in case he shows.

187
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,291
Lovecraft's not home. Housekeeper
hasn't seen him since yesterday.

188
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,240
Allen says he didn't come into his office.
He and Montoya are watching.

189
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,850
How'd the killer find my witness?

190
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,809
Let's keep calm here. It's a win.

191
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,721
We made Lovecraft panic.
This is a panic move.

192
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,805
A win? There's two children out there
with professional assassins after them.

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,650
Bruce and Selina could end up dead.

194
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,649
We'll get Lovecraft to call them off.

195
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,607
How did they know?

196
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,445
I never told you her name,
let alone where she was hiding.

197
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,608
- So you couldn't have--
- I should say not.

198
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,646
And you never mentioned my name
to anyone, right?

199
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,929
No, we agreed.
I didn't mention any names out loud.

200
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,090
No names out loud?

201
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,210
What about whispering?

202
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,440
Don't hold out on me. I'll know.

203
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,088
For deep background, I leaked your name
to a couple select sources.

204
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,811
I had to for credibility.
You're the Wayne-murders cop.

205
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,042
Damn it. That's how they got to her.

206
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,124
I'm surprised it took them this long
to find her.

207
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,566
This is on you, Dent.

208
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,405
I'll stipulate mea culpa.
Kick my ass, be my guest.

209
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,360
But let's find Lovecraft first
and get him to call off the killers.

210
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,369
He's not at home. Not at his office.
He could've left Gotham.

211
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,284
Someone could be hiding him.

212
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,809
Lovecraft has got a couple of condos
that he keeps under his mistress's name.

213
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,561
One up in Stevensburgh and one uptown.

214
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,290
I'll take the one uptown.

215
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,760
If anything's happened to these kids...

216
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,050
We know you ran with a girl called Cat.

217
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,690
She's in serious danger.

218
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,491
Who isn't, right? Crazy world.

219
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,921
How much?

220
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,525
There's 100.

221
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,324
All right, listen.
I don't know where Cat lives, all right?

222
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,568
She's private about stuff like that.

223
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,645
But I heard that she got a new fence
because her old one got popped.

224
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,326
- He'd know where to find her.
- Who's the fence?

225
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,891
I don't know.

226
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,842
- But I know who would know.
- Yeah? Who's that?

227
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,845
Damn it. Save your cheese.

228
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,850
I'll beat the truth out of this kid
with a roll of quarters.

229
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,405
Yo, ask Fish Mooney.

230
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,446
She runs all the fences.

231
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,285
Forgive me for shocking you.

232
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,646
But let me give you some context here.

233
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,769
I love Bannion. We came up together.

234
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,322
But he was supposed to guard the armory,
and he didn't.

235
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,487
And maybe, just maybe,
he looked the other way.

236
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,363
I don't know.

237
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,080
So, what do I do?

238
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,881
- Let it lie?
- Boss, we understand.

239
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,570
Whoever else was involved...

240
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,964
...will very soon wish
they could die quickly like Bannion.

241
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,166
In the meantime, all of us must
do what's right for the family.

242
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,690
Each of your tariffs will increase 25
percent until we've built the reserves again.

243
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,084
No disrespect, that's high.

244
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,762
- A little bit.
- What do you think, Fish? Am I being fair?

245
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,449
We're family. We sink or swim together.

246
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,400
You could all learn from Fish.
She trusts me.

247
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,610
Trust me and I'll trust you.
It goes both ways.

248
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,364
Let's eat.

249
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,000
There's a phone. Come on.

250
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,810
I don't-- I don't carry coins.
Do you have any coins?

251
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,482
Nope, not a dime.

252
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,484
Why does Alfred matter so much?
He's just your butler.

253
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,290
He's my family.

254
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,648
Good luck, kid. See you around maybe.

255
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,285
What? Wait.

256
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,330
Look, those bad guys were there for me.

257
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,165
Not you.

258
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,801
You have nothing to worry about.

259
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,200
- Go home.
- But you said--

260
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,089
I was just trying to freak you out.

261
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,531
- I was playing with you.
- You were playing with me?

262
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,087
- That's kind of cruel, isn't it?
- Yeah.

263
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,808
No, look. You're right about me.

264
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,041
I'm not nice.

265
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,288
Not like you.

266
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,761
- You got a nice way about you.
- A nice way?

267
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,126
Yeah.

268
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,320
That's why I said you were the target.
So we could hang out a while longer.

269
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,485
I see.

270
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,810
It's very convoluted reasoning.

271
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,041
Whatever.

272
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,204
Anyhow, it's been cool.
I'm gonna disappear.

273
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,044
- You can't.
- I wasn't asking.

274
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,806
You can't disappear.
You have to come home with me.

275
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,567
When Detective Gordon finds the man
who killed my parents, you have to testify.

276
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,131
You really think
that was ever going to happen?

277
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,642
Grow up, B.

278
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,850
No, don't. You won't make it.

279
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,167
Help.

280
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,407
- You're crazy.
- Don't run off again. I'm out of breath.

281
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,489
Okay, kiddo.

282
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,645
You earned it.

283
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,771
You wanna hang with me? That's cool.
But my world, my rules. You do what I say.

284
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,251
Yes, ma'am.

285
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,523
Why can't I call Alfred
or Detective Gordon to say I'm okay?

286
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,125
Because we're disappearing.

287
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,040
You gotta be like smoke.

288
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,400
Smoke doesn't make phone calls.

289
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,401
- What is this place?
- The Flea.

290
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,769
It's like the mall for street kids.
Without the crappy music.

291
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,082
We'll be safe here until dark.

292
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,364
Falcone's making me nervous.

293
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,445
If he suspects it was us who blew up
his money, why hasn't he made a move?

294
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,329
Because he can't be sure.

295
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,881
There are 10 other people
who could've done this.

296
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,884
- So, what now?
- You're going to stick to the plan.

297
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,162
You're gonna reach out
to Saviano and Turski.

298
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,005
They are both very angry
their taxes have been raised.

299
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,811
And they're worried
about ending up like Bannion.

300
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,686
They're ready. The old man
is herding his sheep toward me.

301
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,045
- You got it, boss.
- All right.

302
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,363
You know what, let's just take five, okay?

303
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,608
- We are.
- Thank you.

304
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,411
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Hi there.

305
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,521
Busy day, Harvey.

306
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,761
Come back next year.

307
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,083
Hand to God, Butch, I'll be quicker
than a sailor on shore leave.

308
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,170
Thief we're tracking down. Look familiar?
Goes by Cat.

309
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,322
- Nope.
- Maybe Fish knows her.

310
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,165
Fish knows everyone. Fish is busy.

311
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,802
- Works with one of your fences, a new guy.
- What's a fence?

312
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,729
Come on. Butch, be nice.

313
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,285
This is important.

314
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,967
- Where's Fish?
- I told you, she's busy.

315
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,726
I once knew a fella called Butch.

316
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,087
Yeah, he was a Whitechapel lad.

317
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,087
We called him Butch, you see,
because he wasn't.

318
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,924
It was a windup. It was like a joke name.

319
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,243
- In fact, he was a horrible little toerag.
- Wait.

320
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,331
I can't tell. Are you-- Are you
threatening me? ls he threatening me?

321
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,281
Heh. Yeah? You gotta--

322
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,366
Now, where is this Fish?

323
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,487
Right here.

324
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,408
So, what's the fuss?

325
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,045
They're just fooling around.

326
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,122
We're looking for this girl.

327
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,203
Street thief, goes by Cat.

328
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,805
Works with one of your fences.

329
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,166
Looks familiar.

330
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,526
What's the urgency?

331
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,247
- Professional killers are looking for her.
- Professionals, hmm?

332
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,801
This wouldn't be the Lovecraft witness,
would it?

333
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,450
How'd you know?

334
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,329
Streets talk.

335
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,488
Using her to scare Lovecraft.

336
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,450
She saw the Waynes' killer, supposedly.

337
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,728
- Yeah.
- Mm.

338
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,362
And you're here because you want me
to help you find her, don't you?

339
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,681
Yes.

340
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,481
Harvey.

341
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,725
Why in the world
would I help you find her, of all people?

342
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,888
She has Bruce Wayne with her, miss.

343
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,404
Really?

344
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,289
Yes, miss.

345
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,001
I'm Alfred Pennyworth,
the boy's legal guardian.

346
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,322
- I'm pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

347
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,962
- Miss Mooney, we need your help.
- Well, you see, I would love to help you.

348
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,010
But it would infringe
upon my personal interests.

349
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,083
And why would I do that?

350
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,321
You have a very eloquent gaze,
if I may say so, Miss Mooney.

351
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,527
And I can see that you're not a woman that
would let petty self-interest outweigh...

352
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,484
...honor...

353
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,721
...and compassion.

354
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,291
I'll make some calls.

355
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,011
But remember this kindness.

356
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,166
Much better.

357
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,171
Really?

358
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,091
- I'm not sure.
- You look bad-ass.

359
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,646
No lie.

360
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,529
Hey, Cat.

361
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,440
Ivy, what are you doing here?

362
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,804
What've you been up to? I thought--?

363
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,564
Yeah, juvie caught me.

364
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,802
- I got adopted upstate.
- Didn't take?

365
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,322
Good people, but they wanted
me to cut my hair, dress nice...

366
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,524
I know you.

367
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,089
- You're Mario Pepper's daughter.
- Yes. Who are you?

368
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,801
I'm Bruce Wayne.

369
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,411
Yes, you are. Billionaire Bruce Wayne.

370
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,001
- Stay cool now, Ivy.
- I am cool.

371
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,242
Why are you telling me what to do?

372
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,365
I'm not, I'm just saying I don't want you
to get mad at him. He's a friend.

373
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,171
Why would I get mad at him?
It's not his fault, is it?

374
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,883
Did you kill my father?
Did you make my mother cut her wrists?

375
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,721
- No.
- Somebody did.

376
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,281
Somebody did, but not him.

377
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,842
- How are you doing? You doing okay?
- I'm okay.

378
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,725
- And you?
- I'm doing great. How do I look?

379
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,531
You look good.

380
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,126
- Have you seen Clyde the fence around?
- Yeah.

381
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,090
He's working out of the factory
on the Narrows.

382
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,288
- He's cute, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.

383
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,851
Thanks, Ivy. Good to see you.

384
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,322
- Oh, we gotta go run and see Clyde.
- Oh. Okay, fine.

385
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,567
Bye, then.

386
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,042
Keep moving.

387
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,486
She's just a little girl.

388
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,803
- Why are you so scared of her?
- Because she's scary. Don't look back.

389
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,090
Drop it.

390
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,970
Kick it over.

391
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,121
You're under arrest.
Conspiracy to commit murder.

392
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,527
Murder? Me, murder?

393
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,809
- What are you talking about?
- You put a hit out on Selina Kyle.

394
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,485
No, not me.

395
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,086
Same people that came after her
came after me too.

396
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,570
Attacked me on the street.
Why do you think I'm hiding in here?

397
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,121
- Why would they come after you?
- Why do they ever?

398
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,441
Because I know too much.

399
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,331
Cut the crap. Who are you so scared of?

400
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,925
You have no idea, do you?

401
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,287
You think I'm the big wheel.

402
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,161
When it comes to the crunch, kid,
I'm nobody. Just like you.

403
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,845
And the people who truly run this city,
they're watching you huff and puff...

404
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,083
...and run around crusading.
And they are laughing at you.

405
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,891
You're so deep in the maze
you can't see over the wall.

406
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,361
- Tell me something I don't know.
- My briefcase.

407
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,682
- Under the bed. Files.
- Go.

408
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,811
Right before the Waynes got killed...

409
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,281
...there was a run
on Wayne Enterprises' stock...

410
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,807
...like somebody knew
something bad would happen.

411
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,849
So I figured I deserved a cut.

412
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,724
So I started digging.

413
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,088
I have come for that man.

414
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,890
You need not get hurt.

415
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,122
Mm.

416
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,248
That was nice.

417
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,120
Let's do it again sometime.

418
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,845
- Yeah?
- Fish got a lead on the kids.

419
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,923
Place in the Narrows called The Factory.

420
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,970
<i>Word is Cat used a fence named Clyde.
He hangs there.</i>

421
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,201
<i>We're on our way now.</i>

422
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,287
Alfred, let's go.

423
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,329
Fish, thank you.

424
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,806
You owe me.

425
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,201
Who don't I owe?

426
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,766
Mr. Lovecraft?

427
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,251
No, no, no.

428
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,766
Detective Gordon.

429
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:08,927
Badge number 231611.
Reporting a body at 1257 Antioch.

430
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,209
Cat.

431
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,731
My babe.

432
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,120
Hey, Clyde.

433
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,971
Well, what have you got for me?

434
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,291
- Hey.
- Shh.

435
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,241
Wow.

436
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,606
Sweet swag.

437
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,931
- Not your usual junk.
- I'm moving on up.

438
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,091
- Where'd you get this?
- You want a story or the swag?

439
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,849
- How much?
- A thousand bucks.

440
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,402
- Please, give me a break.
- That's rock bottom. You know it is.

441
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,731
- Fifty bucks.
- Fifty?

442
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,690
This pen is real gold.
That's an antique jade netsuke.

443
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,490
It's worth $2000 on its own.

444
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,885
And who is this well-spoken little dude?

445
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,487
Never mind who he is.
Look, 500 is rock bottom.

446
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,247
- Why are you wasting my time?
- Relax.

447
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,244
I'm sure we can make a deal.

448
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,920
No, thanks. We'll go elsewhere.

449
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,368
Cool down, Cat.

450
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,604
Or we'll poke your little
friend's eyes out. That's it.

451
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,649
Relax.

452
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,728
I've got some friends coming over
who would just love to meet you.

453
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,611
It's all there.

454
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,205
Don't look so anxious.

455
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,129
Yeah, well, um...

456
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,567
...you guys are kind of sporty.
- Where is she?

457
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,965
She's upstairs.

458
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,406
She better be.

459
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,525
Find me something heavy.

460
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,766
Am I the only one in this damn town
who waits for backup?

461
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,043
Bruce!

462
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,127
Follow!

463
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,601
- Where's Alfred?
- He's in there.

464
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,410
Go.

465
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,686
Down!

466
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,891
Where's your girlfriend?

467
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,804
- I have no idea.
- Don't make me hurt you.

468
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,485
You're not on the contract.

469
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,050
She's gone.

470
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,089
Some advice, kid.

471
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,323
Don't ever mistake bravery
for good sense.

472
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,965
Alfred.

473
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,647
Fancy seeing you here.

474
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,566
Are you all right?

475
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,610
I'm fine.

476
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,647
How are you?

477
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,649
You really scared me, Master Bruce.

478
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,924
If you die...

479
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,122
...who employs butlers anymore?

480
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,528
Oh, thank God.

481
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,322
Lovecraft was a beloved pillar
of this community.

482
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,241
A dedicated servant of Gotham.

483
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,523
So, what do I tell the media, huh? Huh?

484
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,011
Any ideas?

485
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,601
He was a crook.

486
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,651
We nearly had him, and he was killed
by whoever he would've implicated...

487
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,923
...if he had lived to testify. Say that.

488
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,807
Forgive me
if I can't get behind your approach.

489
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,200
It was your gun.

490
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,729
- I didn't kill him.
- On balance, I believe you. On balance.

491
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,365
- Suicide is cleaner--
- It wasn't suicide. It was murder.

492
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,721
It was suicide.

493
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,408
He went mad
under your relentless questioning...

494
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,087
...overpowered you,
and killed himself with your gun.

495
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,362
And don't tell me otherwise.

496
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,651
What do you say, counselor?

497
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,283
I'm at your disposal, Mayor James.

498
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,920
I'm sorry if we've caused you
any disquiet.

499
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,162
Disquiet.

500
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,808
You arrogant clowns.

501
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,725
You're hacking away
at the very foundations of this city.

502
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,281
Trying to take me down.

503
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,082
Should have you both stuffed in a sack
and thrown in the river.

504
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,448
But I can't do that.

505
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,201
Two scapegoats would look like panic.

506
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,562
But one of you is going down,
mark my words.

507
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,881
Sir, that's not right.

508
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,804
Hush.

509
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,844
It's not you, Dent.

510
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,767
Obviously, it's Mr. Gordon.

511
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,763
Sir, I protest.

512
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,160
But not too much.

513
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,727
You see, Counselor Dent
knows how to walk the line.

514
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,085
He knows where the edge is.

515
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,330
You, Mr. Gordon,
do not know where the edge is.

516
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,124
Mayor James...

517
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,364
...kiss my ass.

518
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,401
Dick Lovecraft's suicide
is a terrible, terrible tragedy.

519
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,966
Fighting the trumped-up charges
of an overzealous police officer...

520
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,168
...was too much for him.

521
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,361
You have my word, Dick.

522
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,566
This officer is being dealt with.

523
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,849
Arkham Asylum?

524
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,766
- A security guard for nutjobs?
- Criminal nutjobs, yeah.

525
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,840
- Are you taking the assignment?
- It's that or quit.

526
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,445
So quit.

527
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,125
That's what they want me to do.

528
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,929
Damn, Jim.

529
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,449
Whoever your next partner is, he or she
will be a lot easier than me.

530
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,968
- Ed?
- Detective Gordon.

531
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,481
You've been thrown out in disgrace,
is this true?

532
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,687
Yeah, it is.

533
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,802
- I'm gonna write a letter to the boss.
- You do that.

534
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,611
Which boss should I write to?

535
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,803
Forget it, Ed.

536
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,485
That's the breaks, huh?

537
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,721
You take care.

538
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,561
Maybe you should take him with you.

539
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,286
- You'd miss him if he was gone.
- No, I wouldn't.

540
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,530
Let me buy you a drink sometime.

541
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,491
Soon.

542
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,047
Your security still sucks.

543
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,562
No one's hunting for me.

544
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,848
I didn't expect to see you again.

545
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,048
Never said goodbye.

546
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,849
No, we didn't.

547
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,128
Didn't want to be rude.

548
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,687
- It's good to see you.
- Here.

549
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,641
Thank you, but you could keep this.

550
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,246
- You need it more than I do.
- No.

551
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,880
Let's keep things honest between us.

552
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,687
I'm keeping this one anyway.

553
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,001
Having a little chat, Master Bruce?

554
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,130
Thinking out loud.

555
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,964
Right.

556
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,805
Right. Of course you are.

557
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,406
Shall I take that for you?

558
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,569
The old house seems very quiet
without her, doesn't it?

559
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,966
Yes, it does.
