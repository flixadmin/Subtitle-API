1
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,143
Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

2
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,819
A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

3
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,861
- It is almost here.
- What is it?

4
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,280
What if it's the Demogorgon?

5
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,404
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

6
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,530
It's not the Demogorgon.

7
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,863
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

8
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,073
- Troglodytes?
- Told ya.

9
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,002
Wait a minute.

10
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,588
Did you hear that?

11
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,085
That... that sound?

12
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,839
Boom... boom...

13
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,669
Boom!

14
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,630
That didn't come from the troglodytes.
No, that...

15
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,386
That came from something else.

16
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,845
The Demogorgon!

17
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,395
- We're in deep shit.
- Will, your action!

18
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,768
- I don't know!
- Fireball him!

19
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,144
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

20
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,066
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

21
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,691
- Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
- Cast Protection.

22
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,489
The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

23
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,362
It stomps towards you.

24
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,442
- Boom!
- Fireball him!

25
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,823
- Another stomp, boom!
- Cast Protection.

26
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,748
He roars in anger!

27
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,324
Fireball!

28
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,034
- Oh, shit!
- Where'd it go?

29
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,835
- Where is it?
- I don't know!

30
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,458
- Is it a 13?
- I don't know!

31
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,709
- Where is it?
- Oh, my God!

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,382
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

33
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,549
- Mike!
- Can you find it yet?

34
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,717
No, I can't find it!

35
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,466
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,342
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

37
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,549
You mean the end?
Fifteen after.

38
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,852
- Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
- Why do we have to go?

39
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,601
- Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
- It's a school night, Michael.

40
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,149
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

41
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,771
- But that'll ruin the flow!
- Michael...

42
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,102
I'm serious, Mom.

43
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,654
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

44
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,652
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

45
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,608
You've been playing for ten hours?

46
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,743
- Dad, don't you think that 20 more...
- I think you should listen to your mother.

47
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,292
Dumb piece of junk.

48
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,294
Oh, I got it!

49
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,247
- Does the seven count?
- It was a seven?

50
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,463
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

51
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,260
Yo, hey, guys.

52
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,216
- Does anyone want this?
- No.

53
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,850
Yeah.

54
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,231
No, I don't think...

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,942
Yeah, he's cute.

56
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,362
Barb, no, I don't think so.

57
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,906
- Barb, you're not...
- Hey, Nancy.

58
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,150
There's a slice left if you want it.

59
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,577
- Sausage and pepperoni!
- Hold on.

60
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,376
- There's something wrong with your sister.
- What are you talking about?

61
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,253
- She's got a stick up her butt.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,834
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

63
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,669
Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

64
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,096
She's always been a real jerk.

65
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,048
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

66
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,509
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

67
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,844
Four years ago!

68
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,348
- Just saying.
- Later.

69
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,977
- It was a seven.
- Huh?

70
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,808
The roll, it was a seven.

71
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,112
The Demogorgon, it got me.

72
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,153
See you tomorrow.

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,838
- Good night, ladies.
- Kiss your mom 'night for me.

74
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,262
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

75
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,010
- Any comic?
- Yeah.

76
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,009
Hey! Hey!

77
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,094
I didn't say "go"!

78
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,143
Get back here!

79
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,351
I'm gonna kill you!

80
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,857
<i>I'll take your X-Men 134!</i>

81
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,697
Son of a bitch.

82
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,129
Mom?

83
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,761
Jonathan? Mom?

84
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,414
Hello? Hello?

85
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,398
<i>And that's it
for News Center this morning.</i>

86
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,821
<i>Thanks for joining us.</i>

87
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,194
<i>Let's hand off now to Liz
at the news desk.</i>

88
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,695
<i>All right, thank you, Donna.</i>

89
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,867
<i>Turning now to local news,</i>

90
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,367
<i>we're getting reports of surges
and power outages all across the county.</i>

91
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,416
<i>Last night, hundreds of homes
in East Hawkins were affected,</i>

92
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,869
<i>leaving many residents in the dark.</i>

93
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,828
<i>The cause of the outage is still unknown.</i>

94
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,165
<i>We reached out to Roane County
Water and Electric,</i>

95
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,794
<i>and a spokesperson says</i>

96
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:57,674
<i>that they are confident power will be
restored to all remaining homes</i>

97
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,300
<i>within the next several hours.</i>

98
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,036
Mmm.

99
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,699
<i>In other news,
you might wanna stay home tonight</i>

100
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,071
<i>or at least pack an umbrella.</i>

101
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,575
<i>We turn to everybody's favorite
morning weather guy, Charles.</i>

102
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,077
Where the hell are they?

103
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,584
- Jonathan?
- Check the couch!

104
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,789
Ugh, I did.

105
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,383
Oh... Got them.

106
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,845
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

107
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,763
- Yeah, see you later.
- Where's Will?

108
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,931
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.

109
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,134
He's probably still sleeping.

110
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,345
- Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
- Mom, I'm making breakfast.

111
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,271
I told you this a thousand times.

112
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,976
Will! Come on, honey.
It's time to get up.

113
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,732
- He came home last night, right?
- He's not in his room?

114
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,113
- Did he come home or not?
- I don't know.

115
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,445
- You don't know?
- No.

116
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,575
I got home late.
I was working.

117
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,701
You were working?

118
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,703
Eric asked if I could cover.
I said yeah.

119
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,250
I just thought we could use
the extra cash.

120
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,045
- Jonathan, we've talked about this.
- I know, I know.

121
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,043
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

122
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,295
Mom, it's not a big deal.
Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.

123
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,048
- I'm sure he just stayed over.
- I can't believe you.

124
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,721
I can't believe you sometimes.

125
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,269
That's disgusting.

126
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,564
- You're disgusting!
- Hello?

127
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,391
Hi, Karen.
It's Joyce.

128
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,522
- Oh, Joyce, hi.
- What the hell, Mike?

129
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,773
- Hey!
- Quiet!

130
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,570
- Language.
- Are you kidding?

131
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,023
Was that Will I heard back there?

132
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,607
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

133
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,112
Will didn't spend the night?

134
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,616
<i>No, he left here
a little bit after 8:00.</i>

135
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,037
Why? He's not home?

136
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,958
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

137
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,036
<i>- Thank you so much. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.</i>

138
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,898
That's weird.
I don't see him.

139
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,524
I'm telling you, his mom's right.

140
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,446
He probably just
went to class early again.

141
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,025
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

142
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,031
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

143
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,363
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

144
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,074
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

145
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:19,751
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

146
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,343
I'd go with Toothless.

147
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,889
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

148
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,716
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

149
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,847
"I told you a million times."

150
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,929
Do the arm thing.

151
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,064
Do it, freak!

152
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,648
God, it gets me every time.

153
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,819
- Assholes.
- I think it's kinda cool.

154
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,074
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

155
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,031
Like Mr. Fantastic.

156
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,367
Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

157
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,509
So, did he call?

158
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,134
Keep your voice down.

159
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,805
Did he?

160
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,633
I told you, it's not like that.

161
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,971
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

162
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,976
We just...

163
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,600
made out a couple times.

164
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,062
"We just... made out a couple times."

165
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,488
Nance, seriously,

166
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,657
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

167
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,154
No, I'm not.

168
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,908
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

169
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,786
If you become friends with Tommy H.
or Carol...

170
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,162
Oh, that's gross!

171
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,414
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

172
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,338
Two-time thing.

173
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,465
You were saying?

174
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,356
- Steve...
- Mmm-hmm?

175
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,104
- I have to go.
- In a minute.

176
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,857
Steve.
I really, like...

177
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,780
Seriously, I have to go.

178
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,232
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's...

179
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,192
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

180
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,199
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

181
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,531
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

182
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,332
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

183
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,581
- Well, then, just let me help.
- You failed chem.

184
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,663
- C-minus.
- Well, in that case...

185
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,089
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

186
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,134
- Are you crazy? My mom would not...
- I'll climb through your window.

187
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,382
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy like a ninja.

188
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,713
You are crazy.

189
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,639
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

190
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,011
We can just...

191
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,059
We can just, like, chill in my car.

192
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,059
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

193
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,563
Steve... I have to study.

194
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,359
I'm not kidding.

195
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,733
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

196
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,482
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

197
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,041
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

198
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,244
To study.

199
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,762
Good of you to show.

200
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:21,516
Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

201
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:25,270
- Hey, Chief.
- Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

202
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,349
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

203
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,982
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

204
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,692
While you were drinking or sleeping,

205
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,741
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

206
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,817
Phil Larson called.

207
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,575
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

208
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,121
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

209
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,450
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

210
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,079
On a more pressing matter,

211
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,207
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

212
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,040
Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

213
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,341
- Just give me a minute.
- Joyce is very upset.

214
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,293
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

215
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,720
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

216
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,675
- Chief, she's already in your...
- Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

217
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,942
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

218
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,615
And I apologize again.

219
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,067
I'm going out of my mind!

220
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,745
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

221
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,823
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

222
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,453
- He wouldn't do that.
- Well, you never know.

223
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,251
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

224
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,919
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

225
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,667
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

226
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,716
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

227
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,294
He's not like... most.

228
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,257
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

229
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,182
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

230
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,352
- They laugh at him, his clothes...
- His clothes?

231
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,349
- What's wrong with his clothes?
- I don't know.

232
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,726
- Does that matter?
- Maybe.

233
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:50,855
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

234
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,655
Lonnie...
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

235
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,072
Called him a fag.

236
00:17:56,158 --> 00:18:00,072
- Is he?
- He's missing is what he is.

237
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,948
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

238
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:10,420
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

239
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,249
- But he has nothing to do with this.
- Why don't you give me his number?

240
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,208
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

241
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,512
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

242
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,715
the kid is with a parent or relative.

243
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,299
What about the other time?

244
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,761
- What?
- You said, "99 out of 100."

245
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,847
- What about the other time, the one?
- Joyce.

246
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,056
The one!

247
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,982
Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?

248
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,809
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

249
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:33,984
in the four years I've been working here?

250
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,232
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

251
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,441
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

252
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,241
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

253
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,991
Okay, fine.
I will call Lonnie.

254
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,787
He will talk to me before he talks to...

255
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,831
- What, a pig?
- A cop!

256
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,911
Just find my son, Hop.

257
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,871
Find him!

258
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,638
Dr. Brenner.

259
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,267
This way, gentlemen.

260
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,191
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

261
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,111
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

262
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,135
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

263
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,920
- This is where it came from?
- Yes.

264
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,004
And the girl?

265
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,758
She can't have gone far.

266
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,737
All right, and one more.

267
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,611
Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

268
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,237
Hey, I don't know.
I don't know.

269
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,661
I don't know,
37 points per game average...

270
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,454
- Thirty-seven now, but...
- Mr. Basket.

271
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,103
Hey!

272
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,313
Come here!

273
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,360
Hey, come here!

274
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,075
You think you can steal from me, boy?

275
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:58,746
What in the hell?

276
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:03,130
Remember, finish chapter 12

277
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,004
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

278
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,211
and other forms of science investigation.

279
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:13,174
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

280
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:16,351
It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

281
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,346
So, did it come?

282
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,806
Sorry, boys.

283
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,766
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

284
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:24,897
it came.

285
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,480
Yes!

286
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,362
The Heathkit ham shack.

287
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,909
- Whoa.
- Ain't she a beaut?

288
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,032
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

289
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,283
Think bigger.

290
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,365
- California?
- Bigger.

291
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,825
Australia?

292
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,376
Oh, man!

293
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,331
When Will sees this,
he's totally gonna blow his shit.

294
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,505
Lucas!

295
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:47,958
Sorry.

296
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,925
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

297
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,723
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

298
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,510
What are you doing?

299
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,720
Hello, this is Dustin,

300
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,806
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

301
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,062
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

302
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:12,073
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow
Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

303
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,617
Okay, okay, okay.

304
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,666
One at a time, all right?
You.

305
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,369
- You said he takes what?
- Mirkwood.

306
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,046
- Mirkwood?
- Yeah.

307
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,625
- Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
- I have not. That sounds made up to me.

308
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,506
<i>No, it's from Lord of the Rings.</i>

309
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,464
<i>- Well, The Hobbit.
- It doesn't matter.</i>

310
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,389
- He asked!
- "He asked!"

311
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,092
- Shut up, guys!
- Hey, hey, hey!

312
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,098
- What'd I just say?
- Shut up.

313
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,477
One at a damn time.
You.

314
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,775
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

315
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,227
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

316
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,813
- Yeah, all right, I think I know that one.
- We can show you, if you want.

317
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,239
I said that I know it!

318
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,237
- We can help look.
- Yeah.

319
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,239
No.

320
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,447
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

321
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:01,748
Immediately.

322
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,623
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

323
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:06,794
no nonsense.

324
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,837
<i>This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.</i>

325
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,712
<i>- The Hobbit.
- Shut up!</i>

326
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,168
- Hey!
- Stop it!

327
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,383
Do I make myself clear?

328
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:26,140
Do I make myself... clear?

329
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,938
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

330
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,496
Ring-a-ding-ding!

331
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,290
Anybody home?

332
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,992
Password?

333
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,043
Uh, Rada...

334
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,873
Radagast?

335
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,380
Yeah. You may enter.

336
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,928
Thank you, sir.

337
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,547
So, guess what?

338
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,099
I got off early and...

339
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,849
<i>Ta-da!
Poltergeist.</i>

340
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,474
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

341
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,931
I changed my mind.

342
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,816
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

343
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,395
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

344
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,479
Oh, yeah?

345
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,235
Not even of clowns?

346
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,406
No.

347
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,860
What about my witch?

348
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,364
- No. Mom...
- Ooh...

349
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,287
- I'm not five anymore.
- But Will Byers...

350
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,831
- I'm going to cook you up in my...
- Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

351
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,288
Will?

352
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,963
- Will?
- Will?

353
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,751
Will?

354
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,304
- Will?
- Will!

355
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,099
- Will!
- Will?

356
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,767
Will!

357
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,469
Where are you?

358
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,071
Geez.

359
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,691
Your parents forget to feed you?

360
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,204
Is that why you ran away?

361
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:09,876
They, uh...

362
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,040
They hurt you?

363
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,632
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

364
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,380
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

365
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,638
All right.

366
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,844
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

367
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,933
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

368
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,106
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

369
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,435
We got a deal?

370
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,440
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff.

371
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,528
My name's Benny.
Benny Hammond.

372
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,328
See? Like this. Here.

373
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,328
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

374
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,877
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

375
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,258
Eleven?

376
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,594
What's that mean?

377
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,263
What's it mean?

378
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,555
- No.
- Well, I'll be damned.

379
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,355
She speaks.

380
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,104
"No"? No, what?

381
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,904
All right.
I guess no more food, then.

382
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,151
Eleven.

383
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,570
Yeah.

384
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,448
What's it mean?

385
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,618
Eleven.

386
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,497
All right, then.

387
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,328
Here you go.

388
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,163
Take it easy, take it easy.

389
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,168
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

390
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,379
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

391
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,089
kidnapped or something.

392
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,218
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

393
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:54,727
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane.
Yeah, Randolph.

394
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,376
Will Byers?

395
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,547
Will!

396
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,096
Will Byers?

397
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,056
Come on, kid!

398
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,390
Will?

399
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:42,316
Hey! I got something.

400
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,284
- That his bike?
- Yeah, he must have crashed.

401
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,199
You think
he got hurt in the fall?

402
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,622
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

403
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,625
Bike like this is like
a Cadillac to these kids.

404
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,331
He would've walked it home.

405
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,342
<i>...get off work if I win.</i>

406
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,053
<i>Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...</i>

407
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,935
<i>...but we will cover
whatever the damages are to your property.</i>

408
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,687
<i>- It's just, um...
- That's for sure.</i>

409
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,197
<i>Is Lonnie there?</i>

410
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:32,574
<i>- Lonnie isn't here right now.
- Can you please...</i>

411
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,530
<i>- I told you, Lonnie's not here.
- Who is this?</i>

412
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,616
<i>- His girlfriend, Cynthia.
- Cynthia.</i>

413
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,418
<i>- Who the hell is this?
- Cynthia, this is Joyce.</i>

414
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,245
<i>- Who?
- Lonnie's ex-wife.</i>

415
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,377
<i>- I really need to speak to him...
- Lonnie's not here.</i>

416
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,333
<i>- Can you please put... No!
- Why don't you call back later?</i>

417
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,634
No, not later. Now!

418
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,881
Can...

419
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,382
- Bitch!
- Mom.

420
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,931
- What?
- You have to stay calm.

421
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,728
<i>Hey, you've reached Lonnie.</i>

422
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,026
<i>Leave a message
and I'll holler right back at ya.</i>

423
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,856
Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me.

424
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,441
Will is... is missing.
I don't know where he is.

425
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,696
I need...

426
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,370
I just need you to call me back,
please, just...

427
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,783
Damn it! Damn it!

428
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,539
Mom?

429
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:21,619
What?

430
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,834
Cops.

431
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,228
- It was just lying there?
- Yeah. Cal?

432
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,816
- Did it have any blood on it, or...
- No, no, no, no, no...

433
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,397
Phil?

434
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,904
If you found the bike out there,
why are you here?

435
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,821
- Well, he had a key to the house, right?
- Yeah.

436
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,243
So...

437
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,370
maybe he came home.

438
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,497
You think I didn't check
my own house?

439
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,374
I'm not saying that.

440
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,041
- Has this always been here?
- What? I don't know.

441
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,969
Probably. I mean, I have two boys.
Look at this place.

442
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,758
You're not sure?

443
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:26,725
Hey.

444
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,112
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

445
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,690
Nothing, he's probably just hungry.
Come on.

446
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,317
- Hey!
- Jesus!

447
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,989
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

448
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:58,534
What's going on?

449
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,821
Hello?

450
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:04,999
- Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
- Listen, I want you to call Flo.

451
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,417
I want to get
a search party together, all right?

452
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,621
All the volunteers she can muster.
Bring flashlights, too.

453
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,001
Do you think
we got a problem here?

454
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,800
We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

455
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,805
We've been over this, Mike.
The chief says...

456
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,352
- I don't care what the chief said.
- Michael!

457
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,100
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

458
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,397
More reason to stay put.

459
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,520
- Mom!
- End of discussion.

460
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,653
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

461
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,156
- That's cool, right?
- No, not cool.

462
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,487
What? Why not?

463
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,790
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?

464
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,913
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.

465
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,791
- This is such bullshit.
- Language.

466
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,291
So we're under house arrest?

467
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,294
Just because Mike's friend got lost
on the way home from...

468
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,671
- Wait, this is Will's fault?
- Nancy, take that back.

469
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,297
- No!
- You're just pissed off

470
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,345
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

471
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,216
- Steve?
- Who is Steve?

472
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,768
- Her new boyfriend.
- You are such a douchebag, Mike!

473
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,595
Language!

474
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,685
Nancy, come back.

475
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,767
Come back!

476
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:16,275
It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

477
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,026
You see, Michael?

478
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,403
- You see what happens?
- What happens when what?

479
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,077
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

480
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,201
That is really unfair, son.

481
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,498
We care.

482
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,167
- Mike!
- Let him go.

483
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,298
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.

484
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,591
What did I do?

485
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,550
Hey! What'd I do?

486
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,601
- Will!
- Will Byers!

487
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,727
Will!

488
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,649
Will, we're here for you, bud!

489
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,738
He's a good student.

490
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,238
- What?
- Will. He's a good student.

491
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,944
Great one, actually.

492
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,367
I don't think we've met.
Scott Clarke.

493
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,746
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

494
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,827
I always had
a distaste for science.

495
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,878
Well, maybe you had
a bad teacher.

496
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,297
Yeah, Ms. Ratliff
was a piece of work.

497
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,001
Ratliff?
You bet.

498
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,257
She's still kicking around,
believe it or not.

499
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:26,136
Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.

500
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,304
Sarah, my daughter...

501
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:33,807
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

502
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,358
I always figured there was enough
going on down here.

503
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,185
I never needed to look elsewhere.

504
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,479
Your daughter,
what grade is she?

505
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,361
- Maybe I'll get her in my class.
- No, she, uh...

506
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,989
She lives with her mom in the city.

507
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,538
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

508
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,619
- She died a few years back.
- Sorry?

509
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:55,954
His kid.

510
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,017
Lucas, do you copy?
It's Mike.

511
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:12,891
<i>- Lucas?
- Hey, it's Lucas.</i>

512
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:13,971
I know it's you.

513
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,229
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

514
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,934
I'm done. Over.

515
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,441
I'm worried about Will. Over.

516
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,568
Yeah.

517
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,322
This is crazy. Over.

518
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,028
I was thinking...

519
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,374
Will could've cast Protection last night,
but he didn't.

520
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,450
He cast Fireball.

521
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:38,288
<i>- Over.
- What's your point? Over.</i>

522
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:43,092
My point is... he could've played it safe,
but he didn't.

523
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,044
He put himself in danger
to help the party.

524
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,254
<i>Over.</i>

525
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,516
Meet me in ten.
Over and out.

526
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,290
What are you doing here?

527
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,671
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

528
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,596
- I figured we'd just study here.
- No. No way.

529
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,923
Oh, come on.
I can't have you failing this test.

530
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,849
So just... bear with me.

531
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:36,845
What'd I tell you?

532
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,390
Ninja.

533
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,913
You like that ice cream, huh?

534
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,578
Smile looks good on you.

535
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,001
You know, smile?

536
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,754
All right.
You just sit tight.

537
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:14,263
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

538
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,096
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

539
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,725
- Hey, can I help you?
- Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

540
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,061
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

541
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,897
- So try back tomorrow morning.
- Connie Frazier. Social Services.

542
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,859
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

543
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,786
- That's a heck of a drive.
- Not too bad this time of night.

544
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,114
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

545
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,167
I didn't want her running off again.
Uh, she's a tad skittish.

546
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,870
- Children I work with usually are.
- Right, right.

547
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,298
- So, where is she?
- Right. She's in the kitchen.

548
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,216
- Come on up. I'll introduce you.
- Thank you.

549
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,090
Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

550
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,215
- It's fine.
- You know, it's funny.

551
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,719
Your, uh, voice sounds different on the...

552
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,460
Ah, man.
This is it.

553
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,091
Hey, guys.
You feel that?

554
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,767
- I think maybe we should go back.
- No.

555
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,474
We're not going back.
Just stay close.

556
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,684
Come on.

557
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,154
Just stay on channel six.
Don't do anything stupid.

558
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,160
Hey, guys, wait up.

559
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,116
Wait up!

"Which polymers occur naturally?"

Wow.
Jesus, how many of these did you make?

566
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,395
You said you wanted to help.

567
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,648
How about this? How about...

568
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,270
How about every time

- Come on.
- No.

Yeah, that's not what you said.

What?

585
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,445
Are you crazy?
My parents are here.

586
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,658
That's weird, I... don't see them.

587

Was this your plan all along?
To... to get in my room and then...

588
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,843
- get another notch on your belt.
- No. Nancy, no.

589

I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

590

You mean, you're not a slut.

591

That's not what I'm saying.

592

You know, you're so cute when you lie.

593

Shut up.

Bad Steve.

595
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,107
Bad.
Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

596
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,734
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

597

working so hard and I...

605
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,441
I just feel bad.
I don't even...

606
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,986
barely know what's going on with you.

607
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,815
All right?
I am sorry about that.

608
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,489
Hey, what is it?

609
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,745
What is it, honey?

610
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,913
- Nothing.
- Tell me. Tell me.

- No.

It's just...

613
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,294
I should've been there for him.

614
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:59,377
No. Oh, no.
You can't do that to yourself.

615
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,679
This was not your fault.
Do you hear me?

616

- He is... close.
- I know it. I...

617

I feel it in my heart.

618
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,353
You just have to...
You have to trust me on this, okay?

619
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,774
- Yeah.
- Oh, look at this.

620
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:20,231
Look at this one.
Look at this one.

621
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,739
- I mean, that's it, right?
- Yeah.

Will?

629
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,222
- Will?
- It's Will?

630
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,435
Mom, it's Will?

631
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,850
Who is this?

632
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,057
- What have you done to my boy?
- What? What?

633
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,642
Give me back my son!

634
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,445
Hello?

635
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,772
Hello, who is this?

636
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,609
Hello? Who is this?

637
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,160
Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?

638
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,908
- It was him.
- Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?

639
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,205
- Yes.
- What did he say?

640
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,408
He just breathed.
He just breathed.

641
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,458
- And was someone else there?
- I...

642
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,253
- Mom, who was there? Who was it?
- It was him.

643
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,048
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.

644
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,710
Will!

645
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,213
- Will!
- Byers!

646
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:29,050
<i>I've got your X-Men 134!</i>

647
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,935
Guys, I really think
we should turn back.

648
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,228
Seriously, Dustin?

649
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:35,601
You wanna be a baby,
then go home already!

650
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,398
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!

651
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:39,477
No, you're just being a big sissy!

652
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,480
Did you ever think Will went
missing because he ran into something bad?

653
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:46,442
And we're going to the exact same spot
where he was last seen?

654
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,369
- And we have no weapons or anything?
- Dustin, shut up.

655
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,447
I'm just saying,
does that seem smart to you?

656
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,657
Shut up. Shut up.

657
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,413
Did you guys hear that?

658
00:45:55,437 --> 00:46:03,437
