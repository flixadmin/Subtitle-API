1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,314
So how's it look?

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,508
Meaning, do I see it?

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,799
Yes.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,399
Do you see it?

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,513
Basically, any lawman worth his salt is gonna spot that, yeah.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,391
Assuming that's a deal breaker?

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,194
Yes, it's a deal breaker.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,628
Well, if stealth is what you're aspiring to...

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,118
...you best go with something more compact.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,953
Thirty-eight Special.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,115
Snub nose.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,878
Got a concealed hammer...

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,594
...so it don't catch on your belt when you draw.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,758
Tried and true. No nonsense about it.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,439
- Five shots.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,358
Automatic has how many?

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,676
Ten in the mag, one in the chamber.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,031
If you can't get it done with five, you're into spray and pray...

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,074
...in which case, I wouldn't count
on another six closing the deal.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,955
You load that with 158-grain hollow points...

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,914
...instead of standard wadcutters,
it's got plenty of stopping power.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,475
Can't get more dependable than a wheel gun.

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,588
Try it on with this.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,197
That snubbie will conceal up real nice if you carry it IWB.

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,312
Little harder to draw from, but there's no substitute...

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,193
...if you're intent on fooling a vigilant eye.

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,833
Comes in polymer too.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,429
I prefer the feel of leather.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,995
Old school, I guess.

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,029
Sure it's on the correct side?

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,912
If you're right-handed, it is.

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,390
I don't know, ma- Are you sure?

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,239
Maybe it'll feel better on the left side.

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,715
General rule, you don't wanna cross-draw.

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,115
Not unless you're gonna be sitting.

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,756
You know, store clerks, card gamers and such.

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,311
Either way, you're gonna wanna practise your draw. A lot.

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,636
Because if you're all fingers...

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,150
...well, it might could be him keeping the peace instead of you.

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,873
Catch my drift?

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,438
What's this?

42
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,349
That is why you're gonna pay me five times...

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,154
...what you'd pay your neighbourhood gun store.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,673
Serial number's been filed off.

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,511
So to state the obvious...

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,473
...I don't wanna be caught with this on me.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,956
No. To state the obvious, you don't.

48
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,432
You know, mister, I've been providing
my services for the past 30-odd years.

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,912
Think I'd learn better than to ask a man his business...

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,395
...especially not one referred by the lawyer.

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,511
But I do feel the urge to ask you...

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,954
...are we strictly talking defence here?

53
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,799
Yes, absolutely.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,955
Defence.

55
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,559
Why?

56
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,355
Because if it's just personal protection...

57
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,154
...aside from a bucket of money...

58
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,830
...you'd save yourself a potential felony two-spot...

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,113
...for carrying a weapon with a defaced
serial number if you buy it legally.

60
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,917
But if you did have to use it,
wouldn't it still be better to use one...

61
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,519
...that couldn't be traced?

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,039
This is the West, boss.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,517
New Mexico's not a retreat jurisdiction.

64
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,870
Man steps to you bent on doing you harm...

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,868
...you got every right to plant your feet and shoot to kill.

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,596
Some call it a moral right,
and I do include myself within that class.

67
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,039
All this to say, I'm happy to take your money.

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,397
But if you're not a convicted felon...

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,400
...you might best be advised to bear your arms...

70
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,160
...within the confines of the law.

71
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,556
It's for defence.

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,392
Defence.

73
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,474
I'll take it.

74
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,597
Thanks, Bonnie.

75
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,789
Jesse.

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,672
What's up, brother?

77
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,194
Dude, sounds like an earthquake out there.

78
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,955
New sound system.

79
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,199
- Check it out.
- Bodacious subwoofers, yo.

80
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,879
Serious cannons.

81
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,196
Eighteen-inchers, six of them.

82
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,949
Aluminium cones, so they're really,
really, like, sonically neutral.

83
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,434
Tweeters are killer too.

84
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,837
Dig all them lines jumping around. Psychedelic.

85
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,879
Kind of like just wanna stare at them.

86
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,674
Yeah, man, totally makes me wanna crank old Sabbath and blaze one.

87
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,110
It's got, like, parametric equalisation.

88
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,199
Automatically adjusts the levels to
changes in air pressure and whatnot.

89
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,192
It's totally digital.

90
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,949
Vacuum tube amp, which is by far the best, anti-distortion-wise.

91
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,311
Hits 120 decibels without breaking a sweat.

92
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,910
Hold onto your hats, bitches.

93
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,558
Hey, man, I saw Andrea at a meeting yesterday.

94
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,830
She asked about you.

95
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,075
Thanks, man, but 12 steps and all that.

96
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,439
Seriously?

97
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,992
Maybe just a little bump.

98
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,318
Left 4 Dead. Bitches get all cranial
when you cap them in the head, like:

99
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,592
No, no, no, man. Resident Evil 4 takes it by a long shot.

100
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,473
- Please, brother. You're fronting.
- No, seriously.

101
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,797
That chick, the one you gotta rescue? She's smoking, bro.

102
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,037
And then you're, like, the last undead dude on earth.

103
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,117
How can you not be dipping into that?

104
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,880
Talk about inspiring a brother to kick zombie ass.

105
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,789
They're trying to eat your brain.
A dude don't need no more motivation.

106
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,394
Fair point, I guess.

107
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,873
Okay, okay, okay.

108
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,594
Call of Duty: World at War, zombie mode.

109
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,473
Now, that's the bomb, man. Think on it, bro.

110
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,353
They're not just zombies, they're Nazi zombies.

111
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,392
Nazi zombies.

112
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,591
Yeah, man. SS Waffen troopers too...

113
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,634
...which are like the baddest ass Nazis of the whole Nazi family.

114
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,389
What difference does it make what
their job was when they was living?

115
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,556
Dude, you are so historically retarded.

116
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,992
Nazi zombies don't wanna eat you just
because they're craving the protein.

117
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,713
They do it because -

118
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,754
They do it because they hate Americans, man.

119
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,431
Talibans. They're the Talibans of the zombie world.

120
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,313
I played the game. They ain't exactly fleet of foot.

121
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,351
I'm saying, where's the challenge?

122
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,279
The zombies in Left 4 Dead clock a respectable 40.

123
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,994
- You gotta lead them.
- They're not even zombies.

124
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,474
They're just infected.

125
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,477
They got, like, this rage virus...

126
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,319
...amps them up like they been smoking the schwag.

127
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,513
Apples and oranges, bro. Totally unfair to compare the two.

128
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,514
Yo, Jesse, where do you come out on all this?

129
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,077
Agree. Totally.

130
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,393
Did that just happen?

131
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,718
Damn, man.

132
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,071
It's quiet.

133
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,913
You know what this place needs?

134
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,389
You okay?

135
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,113
Fine.

136
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,631
Can't you sleep?

137
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,910
Actually, yes, Marie. This is me sleeping. What's it look like?

138
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,237
It looks like you're looking at a rock.

139
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,311
At 2:24 in the morning.

140
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,672
This is not a rock, this is a mineral, for, like, the 10th time.

141
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,959
Okay.

142
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,195
Got it.

143
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,356
Blue corundum, to be precise.

144
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,869
Blue corundum. Well, it's very pretty.

145
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,914
It's encrusted with igneous biotite in a mica schist.

146
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,317
Would you like some more detail? Because I can give it to you.

147
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,399
You can keep acting like you give the first shit -

148
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,794
Hank.

149
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,308
Found in the Central Cordillera of Irian Jaya.

150
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,795
Blue corundum.

151
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,949
I'm just saying.

152
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,196
It's 2 in the morning.

153
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,597
I'm just asking if maybe -

154
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,713
You know, last I counted, Marie,
there were four bedrooms in this house.

155
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,950
You know, I mean, if I'm keeping you awake and all.

156
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,358
You've reached Walter White. Please state your name...

157
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,994
...number and reason for your call. Thank you.

158
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,679
Walt?

159
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,510
Hello? Walt?

160
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,233
Okay, Walt, could you call me back, please?

161
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,750
Hank's bills are really starting to pile up here.

162
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,439
And in the meantime...

163
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,757
...I haven't received a cheque from you in quite a while.

164
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,270
Second order of business is the car wash.

165
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,358
- God!
- So it's time to take the next step here.

166
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,393
We need to look into buying this car wash while we -

167
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,160
Skyler, what are you doing?

168
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,679
What do you mean?

169
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,113
- Wait, are you screening all my calls?
- No, no, no, I'm just -

170
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,630
What are you thinking leaving a message like that on my machine?

171
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,432
What are you-? What did I say?

172
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,111
You just left recorded proof of our intention to buy a car wash.

173
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,914
- Now, you think that was wise?
- Proof of our what?

174
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,519
What are you talking about?

175
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,996
Skyler, we should not even be mentioning the words "car wash"...

176
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,792
...on the phone at all. Period.

177
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,117
Walt, it is a car wash, not a brothel.

178
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,029
I mean, if we can't even say what it is,
why are we buying it at all?

179
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,196
God, look, Skyler, please, just -

180
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,389
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, hon.

181
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,637
Look, there's some cereal on the breakfast table.

182
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,071
I'm telling you, if you're not willing to pull the trigger...

183
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,635
...I'm more than happy to call Goodman myself.

184
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,276
No, no, no, I will handle it, okay?

185
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,749
I could so use a brain transplant right now.

186
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,713
Yeah. I'm going to work.

187
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,310
Wake up, bitch.

188
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,951
Damn.

189
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,158
You're way too sensitive about your zone, bro.

190
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,473
Come on, man. Cleanup time.

191
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,990
Right on. Least we can do.

192
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,193
Hey, the hell with cleaning up.

193
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,949
Just go out and get everybody some breakfast.

194
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,914
Stock up on liquor while you're at it. Keep this party going.

195
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,189
I mean it, yo.

196
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,439
I mean, I want this place kicking
harder than a sensei when I get back.

197
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,672
- All right.
- You got it, bro.

198
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,077
Come on, damn it!

199
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,475
Wake up and party!

200
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,109
Hello.

201
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,109
- Yo, you the new guy?
- Yeah.

202
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,878
You got something for me?

203
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,073
Two hundred and one point six.

204
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,632
What's the count?

205
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,791
Two-oh-one point six.

206
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,874
Give it a second weigh, if you would, please.

207
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,957
New policy.

208
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,077
What, Walter?

209
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,835
- Where's Gus?
- Why?

210
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,510
Because I would like to speak with him.

211
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:57,989
Because the way we left things,
I would like the chance to clear the air.

212
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,959
What?

213
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,873
Walter, you're never gonna see him again.

214
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,953
Oh, look who woke up hungry.

215
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,354
Are you hungry?

216
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,755
Yeah, that's good. Drink that up.

217
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,470
Just a little longer, okay, my sweetie?

218
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,272
Okay?

219
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,118
There you go.

220
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,470
Okay, now.

221
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,874
The Dodge gets a detail...

222
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,359
...and the Corolla...

223
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,199
...gets a hand wax.

224
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,436
Right? Hand wax.

225
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,198
Okay.

226
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,758
Hello. Hello. Just a few more minutes
and then we're on our way home.

227
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,632
Okay, my sweet girl?

228
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,434
Mama's just doing her work here.

229
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,836
Mama's doing her work.

230
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,317
Way to go, Hank.

231
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,836
Come on, way to soldier up.

232
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,272
You're doing it. Come on.

233
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,191
Another few yards.

234
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,913
Dig.

235
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,312
Jesus.

236
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,758
Look at you. Way to go, honey.

237
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,315
Come on. Come on, Hank.

238
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,672
Keep it going.

239
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,509
Just ten more steps.

240
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,835
Nine.

241
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,033
Eight.

242
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,389
Seven.

243
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,596
- Six.
- Six.

244
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,312
You're almost there, Hank.

245
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,277
All right, buddy. That's what I call kicking some ass.

246
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,199
Oh, that was awesome, babe.

247
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,153
- Hells, yeah.
- Very nice.

248
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,588
Yeah!

249
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,472
Hey!

250
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,551
You're a good man, Chuck. Thanks.

251
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,591
It's an honour, my friend.

252
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,075
Same time tomorrow?

253
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,395
Damned straight...

254
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,352
...if I'm still alive.

255
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,279
Great session. Lots of positive energy.

256
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,118
Lots.

257
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,474
It's just- It's so great to see that.

258
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,910
It's just...

259
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,269
Yeah.

260
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,715
One day at a time.

261
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,273
All we can do.

262
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,471
I know. It's just...

263
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,352
You've got a real way with him.

264
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,273
It's...

265
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,077
You wanna go full time? We've got a spare bedroom.

266
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,077
I'll see you tomorrow.

267
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,595
Wow, you were so strong today.

268
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,155
Did you work up an appetite? I'm sure you did.

269
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,920
Listen, I was thinking about cooking tonight, so -

270
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,314
Marie.

271
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,713
Get out.

272
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,351
Oh, yo, about time. Oh, my God.

273
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,994
Yo, what's up with the pie, man? It ain't cut.

274
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,873
- Yeah, right. That's the gimmick.
- What gimmick?

275
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,868
This place, they don't cut their pizza,
they pass the savings on to you.

276
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,071
How much can it be to cut a damn pizza?

277
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,157
Maybe it's, like, democratic, bro.

278
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,511
You know, cut your own Christmas tree, cut your own pizza.

279
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,119
Yeah, it's democratic.

280
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,359
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Don't sweat it.

281
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,755
You got some, like, scissors?

282
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,598
I will cut this bitch up good.

283
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,036
Yo, come in.

284
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,799
Hey, would you...?

285
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,993
Gotta figure, you make, like, 10 million pizzas a year.

286
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,636
Each pizza takes, like, 10 seconds to cut?

287
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,035
In man-hours, that's...

288
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,279
I don't know.

289
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,995
A lot?

290
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,269
Hey, Jesse?

291
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,719
You got...

292
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,959
Yeah.

293
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,274
So how you doing?

294
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,198
I'm dealing.

295
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,112
How's Brock?

296
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,551
Good. He's...

297
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,594
Brock, honey, wait in the car, okay? Let the grown-ups speak.

298
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,439
Go on, little man. We'll catch up later.

299
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,956
Guess you know I've been calling.

300
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,673
Yeah.

301
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,832
I'm really busy at work and...

302
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,914
Jesse, I'm not here to make you come up with excuses.

303
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,395
You got other things going on. I get it.

304
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,393
There's just one thing you and me gotta talk about.

305
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,157
And that's this.

306
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,911
After Tomas was murdered, two dudes...

307
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,475
...bangers he used to hang with, get run over.

308
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,754
One of them shot in the head.
Same night, I get this in my mailbox.

309
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,672
This was you?

310
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,229
You know what?

311
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,479
Whatever it is you had to do with my
brother's killers, I don't wanna know.

312
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,431
But you gotta tell me one thing...

313
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,514
...is someone gonna come looking for this?

314
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,633
No.

315
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,559
What exactly am I supposed to do with this?

316
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,354
Use it to get you and Brock out of
that shit hole of a neighbourhood.

317
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,955
Or you can go out and spend it on glass...

318
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,230
...and I'd have no way of stopping you.

319
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,953
But I gotta believe you won't do that.

320
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,231
Go home, Walter.

321
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,232
How you doing?

322
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,318
Hi.

323
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,748
Ton of bricks?

324
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,958
Rocks.

325
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,998
You want me to wheel them inside?

326
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,792
Thank you.

327
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,915
Marie, is that my minerals?

328
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,348
Yes, Hank.

329
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,515
How many boxes?

330
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,508
I don't know. Three, four hundred.

331
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,597
A million.

332
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,955
I don't know.

333
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,991
Did you check them for damage?

334
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,349
Oh, my God.

335
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,589
- They're rocks, Hank.
- No, they're minerals.

336
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,759
Jesus, Marie. I got some geodes coming
that are very delicate, all right?

337
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,155
I'll not accept any boxes that have damage.

338
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,114
Those delivery jagoffs, I'm not
getting ass-raped by those bastards.

339
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,719
Just...

340
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,436
Honey, would you check?

341
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,110
Just check, please?

342
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,478
Hey, you, too much wax.

343
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,113
Stop wasting it.

344
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,517
Look, tell your brother that if he doesn't show up tomorrow...

345
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,280
...I'm gonna have to fire him. So now, go back.

346
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,232
And no more excuses.

347
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,836
Mr. Wolynetz, my name is Skyler White.

348
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,632
How do you do?

349
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,793
- You wanna buy my car wash?
- I do.

350
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,549
And I am prepared to talk numbers right now, if you'd like.

351
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,035
You think this is an easy job?

352
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,596
You are willing to get down on your hands and knees...

353
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,473
...and scrub like a housemaid...

354
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,797
...with all the chemicals eating into your nice skin...

355
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,479
...and stinging in your eyes?

356
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,110
Well, I know a thing or two about scrubbing.

357
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,517
Any other advice for me? Because I am serious about this.

358
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,914
Good.

359
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,156
I am serious too.

360
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,229
I have worked 30 years on building this business from nothing...

361
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,438
...with my own hands and my own sweat and blood.

362
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,596
I can appreciate that. Truly.

363
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,833
So with that in mind...

364
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,429
...is there a figure you can quote me?

365
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,198
One which you think would -

366
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,436
Ten million dollars.

367
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,069
Well, let's try 879,000.

368
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,875
Where do you come up with this number?
You pull it from your behind?

369
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,673
On a typical day, you average 19 cars per hour.

370
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,759
Extrapolating, I added the extra
revenues for hand waxes and detailing.

371
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,871
Subtracted your overhead in salary...

372
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,514
...maintenance, operating fees, depreciation...

373
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,792
...which I obtained from businesses in Albuquerque area...

374
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,231
...giving me an estimate of your annual cash flow here.

375
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,317
I applied industry-standard multiplier,
added market value of your real estate.

376
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,991
Giving me a total estimated value of $829,000.

377
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:17,479
On top of which I generously added an extra $50,000.

378
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,395
So as not to be insulting.

379
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,432
Twenty million dollars.

380
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,752
Okay, Mr. Wolynetz, this -

381
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,428
This is the price for Walter White.

382
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,392
Oh, yes. You don't think I know who you are?

383
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,669
I remember.

384
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,190
- Well, I have not pretended to be a -
- Your husband.

385
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,755
He quit without giving me notice.

386
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,518
He broke my air fresheners, he cursed at me, and grabbed himself.

387
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,790
And now he wants to buy my car wash.

388
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,231
But he's not man enough to come in here and face me himself.

389
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,476
- Instead he sends his woman.
- Excuse me.

390
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,194
Walter White wants to buy my car wash.

391
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,234
The price he pays is 20 million dollars.

392
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,395
Now, please leave.

393
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,673
Have you recently lost a loved one in an aviation disaster?

394
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,958
Have you suffered injury, shock to the senses...

395
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,277
...or property damage as a result of airplane debris...

396
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,755
...or, God forbid, falling body parts?

397
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,030
Then call me, Saul Goodman.

398
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,595
It goes without saying, that the six, seven...

399
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,156
...perhaps eight-figure cash settlement that I can win for you...

400
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,035
...will never fill the hole in your
heart caused by your tragic loss.

401
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,674
But you deserve justice.

402
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,713
So if you want to tip the scales back in your favour...

403
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,229
...better call Saul.

404
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,399
Saul Goodman, attorney-at-law. 505-503-4455.

405
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,672
We are just about ready to go...

406
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,995
You might wanna learn how to tail better...

407
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,953
...if you're planning on making a habit of it.

408
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,516
May I buy you a drink?

409
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,396
Next round, when you're done.

410
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,753
Why not? You make a hell of a lot more than I do.

411
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,634
Another round for him, and I'll have the same.

412
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,273
No ice.

413
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,870
I feel like I need to explain myself.

414
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,115
There were some actions that I took
which I want you to understand.

415
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,077
I didn't want any of this to happen.

416
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,312
Everything I did, I did out of loyalty to my partner.

417
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,918
And then, later...

418
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,832
...of course...

419
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,549
...purely out of self-defence.

420
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,069
I hope you can appreciate that.

421
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,273
Just like I appreciated that...

422
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,315
I appreciate that when you were going to kill me...

423
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,559
...you were simply following orders. I get that. Completely.

424
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,598
And I harbour no ill will.

425
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,634
Well, there's a load off my mind.

426
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,877
- Mike, I'm trying to tell you -
- I get it.

427
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,274
Fine.

428
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,471
Drink up, Walter.

429
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,794
Hell of a last couple of weeks.

430
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,039
Makes a man wonder exactly where he stands.

431
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,753
I mean, I cannot be alone in feeling this way.

432
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,432
Not after what happened to Victor.

433
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,713
So, what's with the piece?

434
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,719
Right hip, inside your waistband.

435
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:45,675
I noticed it the other day at the lab.
You wear it if it makes you feel better.

436
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,872
But if push comes to shove, it's not gonna help.

437
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,078
Mike, do I have to come right out and say this?

438
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,992
You and I...

439
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,679
...we're in the same boat.

440
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,029
Drink your drink.

441
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,152
If it happened to Victor, it could happen to you.

442
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,874
And what the hell was that, anyway?

443
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,638
A message?

444
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,798
He cuts a man's throat just to send a message?

445
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,956
You won, Walter.

446
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,430
You got the job.

447
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,308
Do yourself a favour and learn to take yes for an answer.

448
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,710
Yeah, I got the job.

449
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,399
But for how long?

450
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,833
Get me in a room with him.

451
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,435
Mike, just get me in a room...

452
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,031
...and I'll do the rest.

453
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,318
You done?

454
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,033
Yeah.

455
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,110
Thanks for the drink.

456
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,314
Pinkman, man, you know how to party, brother.

457
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,875
Epic. Epic.

458
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,634
Seriously? Where you two going?

459
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,594
Jesse, I've been awake for, like, three straight days.

460
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,552
I'm turning into a Sleestak.

461
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,954
So crash here.

462
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,071
It's not like I ain't got the space.

463
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,273
Yeah, that's cool and all, but I think I got, like, this cat.

464
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,109
Think I'm, like, supposed to feed it.

465
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,550
Whatever, you little bitch. What about you?

466
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,070
You sticking or do I gotta flip you over, check you for a slizz?

467
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,669
Bro, I'm kind of pushing flowers here, yo.

468
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,633
I ain't proud of it, but it's God's honest truth.

469
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,239
Hell, brother, you know we got mad love for you.

470
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,638
Now that you're back in the mix, it's,
like, nothing but good days ahead.

471
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,957
Plenty of time to pace it out, is all I'm saying.

472
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,198
Yeah, man.

473
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,518
Totally.

474
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,153
I was thinking, like, next week?

475
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,999
Yeah, sure, man. Next week.

476
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,792
We cool?

477
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,996
We are cool.
