00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,240
Brilliant Chang is dead.

167
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,680
Perhaps.

168
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,840
Sometimes I wonder,

169
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,080
"Is this heaven?"

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,240
(CHUCKLES)

171
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,560
Doesn't smell like heaven...

172
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
...so I would say I have survived.

173
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,680
- What happened to Maggie?
- You don't like me?

174
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,120
I like everything.

175
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,440
I like fucking everything.

177
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,080
You should answer the phone, Mr Shelby.

178
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,560
Micky, bring that phone here now.

179

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,240
Hello?

181
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,160
FINN: <i>Arthur! Arthur!</i>

182
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,040
I sent a woman with a gun
to your youngest brother's office.

183
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,640
ARTHUR: All right, Finn.

184
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
FINN: <i>Right, right.</i>

185
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,400
<i>What the fuck is going on?</i>

186
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,920
Do you want to die again, Chang? Huh?

187
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,200
Good.

188
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,200
The guns are pointed.

189
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,760
Now we are all concentrating.

190
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,680
The moment is now pure.

191
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,040
Purity is not necessary.

192
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,760
Displays are not necessary.

193
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,400
They said, "Tommy Shelby.
That door will need some kicking down."

194
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,960
When you walked through that door,
it was open.

195
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,840
You don't need to do anything
to get my attention.

196
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,720
Now, what exactly do you want?

(SIGHS)

198
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,840
Do you have a match, Mr Shelby?

199
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,160
Anything happens to my brother, Chang...

200
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,920
...you die.

201
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,480
If you die here today,
we'll bury you face down with no hands.

202
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,640
- You'll go straight to hell.
- I don't care about rituals.

203
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,800
I am a rationalist, Mr Shelby.

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,120
Well, tell your friend on the phone

205
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,320
to put her gun down
and we can all have a talk.

206

<i>(GUNSHOT)</i>

207
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,800
Hold your fire, brother!

Hold your fire!

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm all right.

211
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,640
She fired into the ceiling.

212
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,640
Finn's all right.

213
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,040
Finn's OK.

214
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,280
Give me your order! Mm.

215
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,920
Give me your order, Tommy!

216
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,080
Yes or no.

217
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,360
At ease.

218
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,880
I said at ease.

219
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,040
May I take something
from my pocket, Mr Shelby?

220
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,920
(COUGHS)

221
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,280
And it's the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

222
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,200
No salt, no flour, no lies.

223
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,520
Pure truth.

224
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,960
Came off a ship called the <i>Capital,</i>

225
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,720
out of Shanghai.

226
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,680
Docked at Poplar a week ago.

227
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
The stevedores
were held at gunpoint,

228
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Chinese unloaded the cargo
by the light of lanterns.

229
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,120
A foreman at the dock estimated there was
seven tonnes of the stuff.

230
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,240
I made a note at the time.

231
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,720
I spoke to that particular foreman

232
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,080
and I worked out that

233
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,000
seven tonnes of pure opium crystals
would be worth...

234
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,480
...approximately, £ 1, 190,000

235
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,320
on international markets.

- What are you playing at?

a piece of business.

She had a gun to my fucking head!

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,480
But your trousers are dry.

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,760
You didn't piss yourself.

246
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,920
- He didn't piss himself, Arthur.
- Well done, Finn.

247
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,480
You had a dispute with a lady
and you didn't piss yourself.

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,200
And Arthur here tells me
we should put you on the tracks.

Gonna be a good day for you after all,

Hey!

Always have your whores
searched at the door.

253

If I see that bitch on the street,
I'll fucking cut her.

Yeah, all right. All right, come on.

This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

257
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,400
A gesture of goodwill.

258
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,640
I'll throw it in the canal.

259
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,880
Canals are the idea. Right, Chang?

260
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,680
I'm sorry for calling the meeting here,
but the location is part of the deal.

261
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,160
ARTHUR: What fucking deal?

262
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,560
How does it feel
to be barefoot in the mud again, Pol?

263
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,800
It makes me feel young.
What fucking deal?

264
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,000
Four boats.

265
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,040
Four days.

266
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,560
Up the Grand Union from Poplar to here.

267
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,320
Half the cargo is coal
and underneath the coal,

268
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,800
pure opium crystal.

269
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,000
Opium.

270
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,280
I vote against it.

271
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,800
They can't use trucks

272
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,480
because the Chinese drivers
get stopped by the police.

273
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,840
They need to get it out of London

274
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,440
because all the warehouses
are being searched by Customs.

275
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,880
The seven tonnes
is bound for San Francisco,

276
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,960
but the outward ship doesn't sail
for seven days from Liverpool.

277
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,640
They need somewhere safe to store it.

278
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,720
All we have to do is take it up the canal
and keep it here for a week.

279
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,320
We don't fuck with the Chinese, though,
Tom. Dad always said it.

280
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,080
Ask yourself, would he turn down £250,000

281
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,520
to drive four boats up the canal

282
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,560
with no prospect of inspection?

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,280
I vote against it, Tom. Hm.

284
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,360
- Mm-mm.
- Polly?

285
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,000
£250,000.

286
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,720
That's half of what Michael lost
in Chicago.

287
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,880
I will ask him to take charge
of this business.

288
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,560
Michael's position will be reinstated
in the company?

289
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,480
His period of quarantine would be over.

290
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,320
Think about it, brother.

291
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,840
Four boats sailing up the cut,

292
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,320
smelling of wood smoke and bacon.

293
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,600
And which one
of Charlie's Gypsy didicoy friends

294
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,240
do you trust, Tom, eh,
with a cargo worth £ 1 million?

295
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,600
I've already made provision.
I'm needed at a meeting.

296
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Let's vote.

297
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,560
Those in favour.

298
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,920
(ARTHUR GRUNTS)

299
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,600
Motion carried.
Arthur, tell Charlie we need four boats

300
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,360
and four tonnes of coal
before it gets dark.

301
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,920
They sail south tonight.

302
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,920
And don't forget to go to the Bull Ring
and get them three songbirds, Arthur.

303
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,200
Yes, Tommy.

304
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,480
Fuck!

305
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,640
What have you heard, Pol?

306
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,160
The man you cut went to the police...

307
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,400
...but we dealt with it.

308
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,800
Is she with him?

309
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,480
If she was, it would be your fault,
Arthur.

310
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,280
But they say his face is so badly cut
he's hard to look at.

311
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,760
So I would say not.

312
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,120
I would also say
it is time to give up on Linda,

313
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,920
find someone else
who might be able to put your fires out.

314
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,720
I can't, though, Pol.

315
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,040
I fucking can't!

316
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,200
And that's it.

317
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,720
That's it.

318
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,680
Whiskey?

319
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,040
Thank you, no.

320
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,880
For reasons I can't divulge,
I need to keep Jimmy McCavern alive.

321
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,920
I've already got a time and a place
for the killing.

322
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,160
You see?

323
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,960
A little alleyway by a shipyard canteen.

324
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,320
A girl called Karen who hates him,
who will give him up.

325
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,200
I have the sound of cranes and winches
to cover the gunshot.

326
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,920
I've got a Bentley to get me away.

327
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,880
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.

328

We've made peace.
We're gonna do business together.

When that business is done,
he's all yours.

You can avenge the death of your son
in any way you see fit.

331

You mean when <i>you</i> say.

332

334
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,240
Yeah.

335
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,360
And then you will marry
and you will settle.

336
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,720
Marry? Marry who, Mr Shelby?

337
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,360
Just let me understand you.

338
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,560
Do you mean
that Polly is part of this deal?

339
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,600
Yeah.

340

Well, Holy Lord God,
Tommy Shelby OBE,

341
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,560
does your vanity have no limits?

342
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,840
I believe it is called the ego these days.

343
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,160
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)
I read books.

344
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,800
You sit on your throne
and you instruct Polly Gray,

345
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,520
who is of far richer blood than you,

346
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,440
as to when she can
and when she can't marry.

347
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,840
Oh, no, she instructs herself.

348
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,000
She has her own strategies.

349
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,520
And we are of the same blood.

350
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,400
She will marry you, but only if you agree
to postpone any attack on McCavern

351
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
until this business is done.

352
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,720
So she <i>is</i> some young Gypsy bride
that's yours to give away.

353
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,680
Young she is,
when she's barefoot on the cobbles.

354
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,880
What about a dowry, then, Mr Shelby?
If it's gonna be done in the old way,

355
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,280
well, you know, you throw in
a few coloured ponies or...

356
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,480

357

You are invited.

358
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,160
Polly will be there.

359
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,720
There will be candles and violins

360
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,160
and dancing.

361
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,520
Polly wants you to propose
in the proper way,

362
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,960
and then she will give you
her terms of acceptance.

363
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,440
Inviting you for this purpose
was Polly's idea.

Yeah.

Apparently, it's about love.

to come to your bloody house?

00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,760
It's an independent dance company

is your wife's birthday.

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,960
Yeah.

391

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,240
And she likes ballet, your wife?

393
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,600
Why wouldn't she?

394
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,440
It's just...

395
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,680
Well, you see,
I did some research into her.

396

Into her past.

397
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,640
If you want to buy her a gift,
she likes diamonds.

Now that we are going to be
conquering the world together,

399
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,720
we need to have no secrets.

Your wife has led an interesting life.

402
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,960
It may even be possible that,
as a younger man in Birmingham,

403
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,040
I came across her.

404
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,200
My friends and I would sometimes go
to nightclubs in the south of town.

405
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,320
Well, if you recognise her,
maybe you can talk about old times, eh?

406
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,520
Maybe, if we have met before,
your wife and I

407
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,680
could even renew our acquaintance.

I too have done some research,
Sir Oswald.

410
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,160
Yeah.

411
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,880
I researched your wife
and your wife's younger sister

412

all of whom you are fucking.

If such things were to take place
on a narrow boat,

...it's not happening on a narrow boat.

418
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,360
No. It's taking place in your apartment,
in your country house,

419
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,800
sometimes even in your office
here in the House of Commons.

420
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,240
So no secrets. And, yes,

finds favour.

423
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,040
Now, if you don't mind,
I was about to leave,

424
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,480
I need to lock up my office.

425
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,760
Actually, I will come alone.

In society, you are judged

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,040
And I keep finding myself there.

488
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,960
And only <i>the January can</i> get me away.

489
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,720
Will you at least try
the doctors again, Tom?

490
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Well, then at least throw away your opium.

491
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,240
It's that that causes the visions.

492
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,000
Just...throw it away.

493
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,920
While it's there, it's a temptation.

494
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,480
- (SIGHS)
- How much have you got left?

495
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,040
Seven tonnes.

496
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,400
- Seven tonnes?
- Yeah.

497
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,560
I'd hate for it to run out, Ada.

498
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,000
(SCOFFS)

499
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,520
You do me a favour?

500
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,240
When that kid of yours arrives,
keep it away from me.

501
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,880
A fucking ballet.

502
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,720
He wants to impress someone.

503
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,480
And I'm invited?

504
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,800
You and Gina.

505
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
Why?

506
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,720
Because he wants to give you
the chance to come back properly.

507
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,520
Coal haulage?

508
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,880
Yeah.

509
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,040
Tommy wants you to reopen those books
and become managing director.

510
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,600
So I've come back from Detroit
to become a coal man?

511
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,600
The first delivery
is bound for San Francisco,

512
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,160
but if it works...

513
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,920
...Tommy thinks he can find
distribution for it here.

514
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,160
And this, erm, this coal...

515
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,240
- ...is it snow white?
- No.

516
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,880
Golden brown.

517
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
Fuck.

518
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,040
This is your opportunity, Michael.

519
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,480
There is more money in this
than there is

520
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,680
in all the other parts of our business
put together.

521
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,160
Tommy knows
what opium does to people.

522
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,760
Tommy knows
what whiskey does to people.

523
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,960
He got an OBE for selling it.

524
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,040
I'll speak to Gina.

525
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,920
(SCOFFS) You'll what?

526
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,520
I will consult my wife.

527
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,840
Your father ran this business
for a bit.

528
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,760
1901.

529
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,640
And he shipped coal. Real coal.

530
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,400
Just coal.

531
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,760
And his fingernails and his eyelids
and his ears were black with it.

532
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,480
And the merchants would offer them
one price

533
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,440
and then only pay half

534
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,360
because they could.

535
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,120
And <i>that was</i> wrong, Michael.

536
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,280
Run your hands through it,
get it under your skin...

537
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,400
...and then see if Gina will let you
lay a finger on her.

538
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,480
(COAL CLATTERS)

539
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,360
I think golden brown
is more to her taste.

540
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,720
Especially when you tell her
how much money you're going to earn.

541
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,840
(DOOR OPENS)

542
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,240
(DOOR CLOSES)

543
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,960
Now we're in business together,
I should ask,

544
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,200
which foot do you kick the ball with,
Mr Shelby?

545
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,480
I have no religion.

546
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,240
Some nights I wish I had.

547
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
He's kin?

548
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
Yeah.

549
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,400
And the simple fellow?

550
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,160
He's a lot less simple
than you might at first think.

551
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,120
Do you trust them?

552
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,160
Right. So I take a boatload.

553
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,600
No.

554
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,440
Ten sacks to start with,
so you can test the market.

555
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,640
Then we'll deal in boatloads.

556
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,320
Cash payment on loading.

557
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,600
£ 1 O,000.

558
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,440
For that amount,
it'll have to be a cheque.

559
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,760
I don't take cheques.

560
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,720
It'll be a cheque.

561
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
I will take a cheque

562
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,880
if it's guaranteed
by our mutual friend in London,

563
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Mr Mosley.

564

(CHUCKLES)

565
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,400
Well, who would've thought
I'd be doing business

566
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,400
with fucking Gypsy Catholic scum?

567
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,000
Yeah, who'd have thought,
eh, Charlie?

568
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,600
CHARLIE: Who would have thought it?

569
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,040
Aye, but you're OK.

570
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,640
THOMAS: Yeah, I'm only OK
until I'm not OK.

571
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,880
Then I'm really not.

572
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,480
Delivery in seven days.

573
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,000
Cheque guaranteed.

574
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,400
Won't your Chinese friends
expect the seven tonnes that leaves London

575
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,840
to still be seven tonnes
when it reaches Liverpool?

576
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,680
You leave that to me, Mr McCavern.

577
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,520
Oh, you mean you're bold enough
to skim the Chinese? (CHUCKLES)

578
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,120
You have some kind of death wish,
Mr Shelby?

579
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,120
An evening with a tribe of Gypsies.

580
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,720
When you've unpacked,
there should be a girl laid on for you.

581
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,480
Mr Shelby is a socialist

582
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,000
and believes in equality of service
for all classes.

583
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,960
According to the invitation,
there'll be an interval at nine o'clock.

584
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Say that you're feeling tired
and we'll leave.

585
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,720
Well, if you see a duke,
introduce me.

586
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
My God, at last!

587
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,880
Something you like about England.

588
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,720
Gina, I've been made an offer.

589
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,560
To come back into the company.

590
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,960
Michael, we agreed,

591
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,920
the baby will be born in New York.
Remember?

592
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,240
The job is haulage.

593
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,960
Supply. Transport.

594
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Opium.

595
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,800
- Tommy has made contact...
- Tommy!

596
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,520
Tommy has made contact
with Chinese suppliers

597
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,440
who have plantations in the Afghan hills.

598
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
Pure grade.

599
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,200
We will take delivery
and ship it all over Europe.

600
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,960
You mean heroin?

601
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
Yes.

602
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,600
And how much would you make?

603
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,840
Conservative estimate,
three shipments a year from Shanghai,

604
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,480
seven tonnes each,

605
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,160
stand to make approximately
£ 1 million.

606
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
Per annum.

607
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,920
The company will make three.

608
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,520
We could go to New York
whenever we wanted.

609
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,080
On our own fucking plane.

610
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,560
- We always have to come back, right?
- Yes.

611
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,640
For £ 1 million a year, we do.

612
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,240
What happens if you get caught?

613
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,440
Tommy has friends.

614
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,400
If the ship gets stopped,
it'll be the Chinese who hang.

615
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,240
Think about it, Gina.

616
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,360
When we move into our house...

617
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,360
...our room for entertaining
will be twice this size.

618
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
Will it now?

619
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,840
The magazines say that

620
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,160
it's all straight lines and simplicity
in the 1930s.

621
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,800
Deco is dead.

622
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,160
We'll be able to afford
dukes and duchesses.

623
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,760
And maybe...

624
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,480
...maybe a princess or two.

625
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,920
And the painting on the wall
will be of you.

626
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,240
Because Tommy Shelby will be gone

627
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,120
and it will be Michael Gray
arranging the ballet.

628
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,720
Where will Tommy be?

629
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,520
Where he wants to go to most.

630
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,960
<i>Ah.</i>

631
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
There.

632
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,840
A lord.

633
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,000
Actually, I think Mr Mosley's a baronet.

634
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,040
Where the fuck is Tommy anyway?

635
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,080
Tommy...

636
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,560
(GROANS) My house.

637
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,000
- My wife.
- (MOANS)

638
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,280
Let 'em wait.

639
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,120
Sir Oswald.

640
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,240
Do I not get announced?

641
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,800
Mr Shelby asked me to tell you

642
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,080
that he's busy
with the catering preparations

643
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,040
and will be joining you shortly.

644
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,040
In the meantime,
and while you're waiting,

645
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,280
we have opium, cocaine and brandy.

646
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,440
I don't use opium or cocaine,

647
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,200
and brandy is for after dinner,
not before.

648
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,440
I also have a list of options
for the end of the evening.

649
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,040
You'll notice that
the maids wear name tags.

650
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,000
We hired them specially...

651
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,040
...for those guests staying the night.

652
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,440
All things are available
except the ballerinas.

653
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,040
And who, might I ask, are you?

654
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,680
I am a queen amongst the Romanies.

655
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,440
And I too am unavailable.

656
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,360
Lizzie.

657
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,760
There's something I didn't tell you
about this evening.

658
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,600
Something about our guest.

659
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,120
Mosley.

660
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,680
It's possible that...

661
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,600
...that you've met him before.

662
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,720
Before when?

663
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,440
Before you became who you are.

664
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,400
Would you even remember him?

665
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,320
Would he remember you?

666
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,560
All I remember is,
I drank too much champagne.

667
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,200
I wasn't taking cash.

668
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,600
Lizzie...

669
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,120
There's a pile of bodies...

670
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,480
...floating by.

671
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,680
Let 'em go, Lizzie.

672
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,760
Let 'em go.

673
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,720
So that's why you brought me
in here.

674
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,520
To lay your claim.

675
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480
Yeah.

676
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,360
Well, it's a start, I suppose.

677
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:24,640
He lays a fucking hand on you,
he will be meat for Johnny Dogs.

678
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,840
You were indisposed when I arrived.

679
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:43,400
In society, you greet a guest,
you don't leave them hanging...

680
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,680
...looking around like a fucking dog.

681
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,880
(CLEARS HIS THROAT) Before we join
the others, I have some business.

682
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,280
I need a signature.

683
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,840
By the way,
your brandy before dinner thing amuses me,

684
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,600
but none of the maids are of interest.

685
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,880
And I despise the use of drugs.

686
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,960
Your strategies are very transparent.

687
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,360
I'm involved in a transaction
with Jimmy McCavern,

688
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,840
your acquaintance from the north.

689
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,000
I have no idea who you mean.

690
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,440
I don't trust him.
He wants to pay by cheque.

691
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,960
I need your signature
as a guarantor on the transaction

692
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,840
should his cheque fail to be honoured.

693
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,880
The sum is £ 1 O,000.

694
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,080
And what is it he's buying from you?

695
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,280
A gin distillery.

696
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,320
He's buying my old one.
I'm buying a new one.

697
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,640
Hmm.

698
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,840
So not only is the truce holding,

699
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,440
but you two
are actually doing business.

700
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,160
Yeah. But I still don't trust his cheques.

701
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,080
If I sign a cheque guarantee
for this man,

702
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,840
it is proof of a connection
between me and him.

703
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,200
Something you could later use
against me.

704
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,600
Why would I want to move against you?

705
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,320
You're curious about my weaknesses.

706
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,560
And you've learned it's not cocaine,

707
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,400
not maids.

708
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,520
But now you will learn my weakness
is a tendency to trust people.

709
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,040
Do you have a pen?

710
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,000
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

711
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,120
Mr Shelby.

712
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,200
I know you have no classical education,

713
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,400
but just realised you are
the perfect balance between the gods

714
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,480
Dionysus and Apollo.

715
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,760
Irrational frenzy
controlled by reason and self reflection.

716
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,720
Do you know the work
of Fried rich Nietzsche?

717
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,680
- No.
- Freud?

718
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,120
Yes.

719
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,720
<i>Ah.</i>

720
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,880
There.

721
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,240
Your guarantee of trust.

722
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,280
Now perhaps you would introduce me
to your wonderful wife.

723
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,080
So, did you know?

724
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,880
What?

725
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,240
Oh, that tonight's special guest
might have fucked you

726
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,440
when you were a nightclub hostess?

727
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,560
Yeah.

728
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,040
Lizzie, if we were to strike
from our guest lists

729
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,600
every man in Birmingham who you...

730
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,160
- Yes or no?
- Fucking yes.

731
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,280
Shit.

732
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,680
Sir Oswald,
this is my wife Elizabeth.

733
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,680
Lizzie, Sir Oswald Mosley.

734
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,680
Since we all appear to know,

735
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,040
and since knowledge is permission,

736
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,240
I'm sure, Mr Shelby, in the spirit
of our honest relationship,

737
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,040
you won't mind me saying

738
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,880
it was a bottle of Champagne
and an evening well spent.

739
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,760
Actually, it was an evening wasted.

740
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,000
For the Champagne
and brandy you bought me,

741
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,440
as I recall, it was the booze that put you
to sleep a little prematurely.

742
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:42,360
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
the dance is about to begin.

743
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,800
Mr Mosley!

744
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,120
A toast, if I may.

745
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,760
To the end of our deal,

746
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,280
and the beginning of something more.

747
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,200
Happy Birthday, Lizzie.

748
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,720
This way.

749
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,120
(CLASSICAL MUSIC)

(SNORES)

751
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,120
Polly Gray, Gypsy queen,

752
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,880
will you marry me,

753
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,400
a poor commoner who loves you?

754
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,400
Let's fuck before the swan dies.

755
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,960
I heard there was a family occasion.

756
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,360
Look, I'm sorry, Linda.

757
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,960
That animal inside me,

758
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,640
it comes out and I can't stop it.

759
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,320
Fuck, Linda.

760
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,160
Without you, I c...

761
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,280
Come inside, please.

762
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,000
His name was Frederick.

763
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,440
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

764
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,880
He just listened.

765
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,600
And now he has no face.

766
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,120
He's as ugly on the outside
as you are on the inside.

767
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,960
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

768
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,600
...in fucking hell.
