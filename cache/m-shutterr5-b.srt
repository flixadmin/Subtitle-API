1
00:00:01,254 --> 00:00:03,934
Hey, Hey!

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,534
Teddy!

3
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:47,894
Listen to me!

4
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:51,854
Listen!
I don't want to leave here, allright?

5
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:56,014
I mean, why wouldn't anybody want to?
We hear things here.

6
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:58,614
About the outside world.
About atolls,

7
00:00:58,654 --> 00:01:01,134
about H-bomb tests.

8
00:01:01,254 --> 00:01:04,134
You know how
a hydrogen bomb works?

9
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:06,614
- I know that, with hydrogen, with hydrogen.
- Now that's funny.
- Boss!

10
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,214
Other bombs explode, right?

11
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:12,894
But not the hydrogen bomb
It's implodes-

12
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:17,214
Creating an explosion thousandth
a millionth degree.

13
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:19,014
- Get it?
- Yeah, yeah.

14
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:20,654
- Do you?
- I get it, I get it.

15
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:22,534
Go!

16
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:37,734
No!

17
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,014
What are you doing?

18
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,934
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

19
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:45,134
You got Billings?

20
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:48,214
What's the fuck's the matter with you guys?
Catch 'em, not kill them!

21
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:49,854
He jumped us.

22
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:53,254
You give me a hand with him,
we've got to get him to the infirmary

23
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:55,534
No, no, not you, not you,
take a walk.

24
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,574
Come on!

25
00:01:57,614 --> 00:02:00,134
Poe's gonna have my goddamn balls for this.

26
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:31,454
Laeddis ..

27
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:51,834
Laeddis ....

28
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:02,254
Ten thousand times the air.....

29
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:06,054
Please ...

30
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:07,454
Why kill

31
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:10,214
Stop me or I'll kill more.

32
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:18,814
AHH!!

33
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:22,934
Please, please!

34
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:33,154
Laeddis ...

35
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:42,934
You told me I'd be free of
this place.

36
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:44,654
You promised.

37
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:47,854
You lied.

38
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:49,454
Laeddis?

39
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,334
Laeddis?

40
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,614
That's pretty damned funny.

41
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:02,254
Your vioce ...

42
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,134
Don't you recognize it?

43
00:04:05,134 --> 00:04:07,574
After all the talks we've had?

44
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,054
After all the lies
you told me.

45
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:11,934
Let me see your face.

46
00:04:12,214 --> 00:04:14,454
They say I'm theirs now.

47
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:17,234
They say I'll never leave here.

48
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:20,214
Your match is about to go out.

49
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:25,214
Let me see your goddamn face now!

50
00:04:25,254 --> 00:04:26,214
Why?

51
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:28,574
So you can lie to me more?

52
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:30,894
- This isn't about the truth.
- Yes it is.

53
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:33,534
- It's about exposing the truth.
- It's about you.

54
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,014
And Laeddis.

55
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:40,014
That's all it's ever been about.

56
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:41,654
I was incidental.

57
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:43,134
A way in.

58
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:47,934
George?

59
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,734
George Noyce?

60
00:04:50,534 --> 00:04:53,814
No, it is not possible,
you can't be here.

61
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:54,934
Do you like it?

62
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:58,854
Who did this to you, George?

63
00:04:58,854 --> 00:05:00,134
You did!

64
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:01,894
What the hell do you mean?

65
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,934
What of your talk
and your fucking talk,

66
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:06,254
And I'm back in here because of you!

67
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:08,494
George, I'm gonna get you out of there tomorrow.

68
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:11,734
However this happened, I'm gonna find a way to fix this
Do you understand me?

69
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:13,094
I'll never get out now.

70
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:15,734
I got out once, not twice, never twice.

71
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,934
- Tell me how they got you here?
- They knew!

72
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:20,334
Don't you get it?

73
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:23,334
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

74
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:25,914
This is a game. All of this ...

75
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:27,014
is for you.

76
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:29,534
You're not investigating anything.

77
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:32,734
You're a fucking rat
in a maze.

78
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:35,014
Georgie ...

79
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:37,454
you're wrong,
youre wrong

80
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:38,634
Really?

81
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:42,214
Been alone much since
you got here?

82
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:45,334
I've been with my partner.

83
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:48,334
You've have never worked
with him before, have you?

84
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:50,134
He's a ...

85
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:51,234
He's a US Marshall.

86
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:54,854
You have never worked
with him before, have you?

87
00:05:57,134 --> 00:05:58,294
George, look ...

88
00:05:58,334 --> 00:06:01,614
I know people.
I trust this man.

89
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:08,054
Then they've already won.

90
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:14,654
Fuck!

91
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:17,734
They're going to  ...

92
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:20,134
take me to the lighthouse.

93
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,654
They're going to
cut into my brain.

94
00:06:23,334 --> 00:06:27,654
And I'm only here because of you!

95
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,934
I'm going to get you out of here.
You're not going to the lighthouse,
Your not.

96
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:35,854
You can't dig up the truth 
and kill Leaddis at the same time.

97
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:39,654
You gotta make a choice
you understand that, don't you?

98
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:41,134
I'm not here to kill anyone.

99
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:44,854
Liar!
- I not gonna kill him! I swear to you, I swear.


100
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:47,454
She's death.


101
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:50,134
Let her go ...

102
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:51,534
Let her go.

103
00:06:52,654 --> 00:06:53,934
Tell him Teddy ..

104
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:57,134
Tell him why.

105
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:01,134
You've got to do it
There's no other way.

106
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:04,134
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day you brought my locket.

107
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:06,934
You gotta do it

108
00:07:07,054 --> 00:07:10,334
How I told you my heart was breaking,
and you asked me why?

109
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:12,094
She's fucking with your head.

110
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:15,214
And I told you
it was from happiness.

111
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,734
She gonna kill you. she's going to kill you.

112
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:23,454
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

113
00:07:24,054 --> 00:07:26,814
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

114
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,854
I can't!
I can't.

115
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,814
Then you'll never leave
this island.

116
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:44,454
Dolores?

117
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,614
He's not in this ward.

118
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:55,814
He was transferred ...

119
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:57,134
Out of here.

120
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:01,454
If he's not in ward A

121
00:08:02,134 --> 00:08:04,934
There's only one place he can be.

122
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:10,934
The lighthouse.

123
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:19,214
Hey!

124
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:23,334
God help you.

125
00:08:30,734 --> 00:08:34,414
Boss, we got problems.
McPherson and Cawley are in the building.

126
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:37,134
They heard an orderly went batshit on a patient,
There lookin all over the place for him.

127
00:08:37,174 --> 00:08:40,854
There on their way to the roof.
Let's get the hell outta here.

128
00:08:39,934 --> 00:08:41,214


129
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,214
This way.

130
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:47,134
Just keep going,
we belong here.

131
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,154
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

132
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:00,094
Where were you?

133
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:03,094
After we got that guy to the infirmary,

134
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,254
I took a little detour
to patient records.

135
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:07,814
Did you ever find Laeddis?

136
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,214
No.

137
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:12,114
- No. I never found him.
- I got the next best thing,

138
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:13,234
 his intake form.

139
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:17,054
It's the only thing in his file, there's
no session notes, no incident reports,

140
00:09:17,054 --> 00:09:18,934
no photographs,... just this.
It was weird.

141
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:20,734
Here, take a look.

142
00:09:21,534 --> 00:09:22,814
I'll look at it later.

143
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:25,854
What's the matter boss?

144
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:28,734
I'll look over later,
that's all.

145
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,334
Ashecliff's that way.

146
00:09:32,454 --> 00:09:34,214
I'm not going to Ashecliff.

147
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:37,134
I'm going to that lighthouse.

148
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:40,654
I'm going to find out what
the fuck is happening on this island.

149
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:54,734
There it is.

150
00:09:55,134 --> 00:09:56,454
Damn!

151
00:09:57,034 --> 00:09:59,254
Were too far south
We'll have to double back.

152
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:01,254
There's no way we can cross those rocks.

153
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:04,054
There could be a way behind those trees.

154
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:06,814
Maybe, maybe a path that goes around the rocks
that leads over to the lighthouse... Come on.

155
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:09,654
What, what are we doing?
We've get the intake form.

156
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:13,534
It proof there's a 67th patient,
which they've said repeatedly doesn't exist.

157
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:17,933
I'm getting to that lighthouse,
you understand?

158
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:22,053
What the hell can I say to you to stop you.

159
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:24,453
Why would you want to Chuck?
Why?

160
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:28,933
Because climbing down there
when it's dark is a thin step short of suicide.
That's why.

161
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:29,933
Ok.

162
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:33,333
Maybe it's better you sit this one out then.

163
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:38,453
You brought me into this, boss.
And now I am trapped here, on this rock,

164
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:39,333
on this island.

165
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:42,133
With  no one to rely on but each other,
and now you acting like .........

166
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:43,573
Like what? Like what?

167
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:45,653
How are my acting?

168
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:53,453
What the hell happened back there 
in those cells, Ted?

169
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:03,253
- What do you think weather is like in Portland, Chuck?
- I'm from Seattle.

170
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,533
Seattle?

171
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:13,253
I'll go on... alone.

172
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:16,733
I'm going with you boss.

173
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,333
I said alone.

174
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,653
Fine.

175
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:46,453
Damn it!

176
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,733
 Oh damn it.

177
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:58,613
I knew it wouldn't take long,
but I couldn't get to it, the tide was up.

178
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:07,933
Chuck!

179
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,533
Chuck!

180
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:12,053


181
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:46,853
Chuck!

182
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,933
Where are you Chuck!

183
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:13,933
Chuck!

184
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:16,933
Chuck!

185
00:14:58,613 --> 00:15:00,853
Who are you?

186
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,613
I am Teddy Daniels.

187
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,133
I'm a cop.

188
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,053
You're the Marshal.

189
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,053
That's right.

190
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,333
Would you mind ...

191
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:16,133
taken your hand from behind
your back please?

192
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:17,133
Why?

193
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:18,233
Why?

194
00:15:19,533 --> 00:15:22,333
I wanna make sure what you
holding wont hurt me.

195
00:15:29,453 --> 00:15:31,533
I'm gonna keep this.

196
00:15:32,733 --> 00:15:34,213
If you don't mind.

197
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:36,813
Fine by me.

198
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:49,853
You're Rachel Solando.

199
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:52,333
The real one.

200
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,153
Did you kill your children?

201
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:00,333
I never had children.

202
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:02,133
I was never married.

203
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:07,453
And before I was a patient
at Ashecliff, I worked here.

204
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:11,533
You were a nurse?

205
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:15,813
I was a doctor, Marshal.

206
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:20,813
You think I'm crazy?

207
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,933
- No...No, I
- And if I say I'm not crazy ...

208
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:27,213
Well that hardly helps, does it?

209
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,733
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

210
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:35,933
People tell the world you're crazy,

211
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,013
and all your protests to the contrary,

212
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:39,653
just confirm what they're saying.

213
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:43,733
I'm not following you.
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,333
Once you are declared insane,

215
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:49,853
then anything you do is called
part of  that insanity.

216
00:16:49,853 --> 00:16:52,453
Reasonable protests
or denial,

217
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:54,653
valid fears,
paranoia.

218
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:57,733
Survival instincts are

219
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:58,733
defense mechanisms.

220
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,613
You're smarter than you look Marshal,
that's probably not a good thing.

221
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:05,133
Tell me something ...

222
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,453
Yeah ...

223
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,933
What happened to you?

224
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:13,333
I started asking about this 
large amount of sodium amytal.

225
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:17,133
- And opium based hallucinogens.
- Psychotropic drugs.

226
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:19,933
I asked about the surgeries, too.

227
00:17:22,913 --> 00:17:24,813
Ever heard of transorbital lobotomy?

228
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:28,013
They zap the patient with electroshock,

229
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:32,853
then go through the eye with an ice pick.....

230
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:35,533
Pull out some nerve fibres,

231
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:39,853
makes the patients much more obedient.

232
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,653
Tractable.

233
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:44,453
It's barbaric.

234
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:46,933
Unconscionable

235
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:51,833
Do you know how pain enters the
body Marshal? Do you?

236
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:54,813
Depends on where you hurt.

237
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:56,013
No, it has nothing to the flesh.

238
00:17:57,613 --> 00:17:58,933
The brain controls pain.

239
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:03,933
The brain controls fear, empathy,
sleep, hunger, anger ... everything.

240
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:07,613
What If you could control it?

241
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:09,813
The brain?

242
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:11,453
Recreate a man,

243
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:13,133
so he doesn't feel pain,

244
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,533
or love, or sympathy.

245
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:22,213
A man who can't be interrogated
because he has no memories to confess.

246
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:26,733
You can never take away all a
man's memories,

247
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,213
Never.

248
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:31,733
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

249
00:18:32,533 --> 00:18:33,933
during their brainwashing experiments.

250
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:36,453
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

251
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:41,933
They're creating ghosts to go out in the world,
and do things, sane man, sane men never would.

252
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:44,718
To have that kind of ability, that kind of knowledge,

253
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:56,013
that would take years.

254
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:50,333
Years of research,
hundreds of patients to experiment on.

255
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,453
For 50 years now,
people will look back

256
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:57,013
and say here, this place
is where it all began.

257
00:18:58,233 --> 00:18:59,313
The Nazis used the Jews
the Soviets

258
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:02,613
used prisoners in their own gulags'
and we...

259
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:04,453
We tested patients,

260
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:07,333
on Shutter Island.

261
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:11,333
No, they won't ...
No

262
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:15,933
You do understand.

263
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,533
That they can't let you leave?

264
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:22,053
I'm a federal Marshal ...

265
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:24,233
they can't stop me.

266
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,653
I was an esteemed psychiatrist,

267
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,013
from a respected family.

268
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:34,533
It didn't matter.

269
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:38,033
Let me ask you ...

270
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,453
Any past trauma in your life?

271
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:46,053
Yes, why... why would that matter?

272
00:19:46,213 --> 00:19:48,813
Because they gotta point to
some event in your past

273
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,213
and this is the reason you lost your sanity......

274
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,533
so that when they commit you here,

275
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:57,733
your friends, and colleagues will say...
cause he cracked.

276
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,253
Who wouldn't,
after what he'd been through.

277
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:01,613
That could say that about anyone.

278
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:05,253
- anyone at all.
- The point is they're going to say it about you.

279
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,053
How's your head?

280
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,653
- My head?
- Any funny dreams lately?

281
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,333
Trouble sleeping, headaches ...

282
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:22,533
I am prone to migraines, yes.

283
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:23,533
Jesus!

284
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:27,653
You haven't taken any pills, have you?

285
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:30,870
- I mean even aspirin?
- The aspirins?

286
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,375
Jesus!

287
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:35,733
And you, you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank the
coffee they gave you.

288
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:38,333
You tell me at least that you've been
smoking your own cigarettes.

289
00:20:40,933 --> 00:20:43,733
Not ... no.

290
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,333
No I haven't.

291
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:49,853
It takes 36 to 48 hours for
neuroleptics narcotics 

292
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,333
to reach workable levels in the 
blood stream.

293
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:54,133
Pulse will become first

294
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:58,133
First the finger tips, then
eventually the whole hand.

295
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,333
Seen any walking nightmares lately,
Marshal, huh?

296
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,333
Tell me what's goes on in that lighthouse?

297
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:11,133
Tell me.

298
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,213
Brain surgery.

299
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:18,653
"Now let's open the skull and see
what happens if we pull on this kind"..............

300
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:21,453
They learned it from the Nazi's kind.

301
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:25,853
That's where they create the ghost.

302
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,333
Who knows about this?

303
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,653
On the island, I mean. Who?

304
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:35,333
Everyone.

305
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:38,733
O'come on, the nurses, the.. the, the orderlies?

306
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:42,133
- They couldn't possibly know...
- Everyone.

307
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,453
You can't stay here.

308
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:06,253
They think I'm dead, that I drowned. I'm afraid
if they come looking for you, they might find me.

309
00:22:07,253 --> 00:22:08,613
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

310
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,213
I'm gonna come back for you.

311
00:22:17,453 --> 00:22:20,333
I wont be here. I move during the day,
new places every night.

312
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,653
But I could come get you,
get, get you out of this island.

313
00:22:22,653 --> 00:22:23,733
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

314
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:28,533
The only way off the island
is a ferry and they control it.

315
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:30,733
You'll never leave here.

316
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:41,652
I had a friend.

317
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:44,452
I was with him yesterday,
but we got seperated.

318
00:22:45,212 --> 00:22:46,732
Have you seen him?

319
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:49,532
Marshal ...

320
00:22:50,932 --> 00:22:52,652
You have no friends.

321
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:26,132
There you are.

322
00:23:28,012 --> 00:23:30,332
We were wondering when
you'd show up.

323
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:33,532
Have a seat.

324
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:35,332
Come on.

325
00:23:45,852 --> 00:23:48,132
Taking a leisurely stroll? were we?

326
00:23:49,332 --> 00:23:50,732
I was a...

327
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:52,732
just, just looking around.

328
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:57,332
Did you enjoy
God's latest gift?

329
00:23:58,932 --> 00:24:00,932
- What?
- God's gift.

330
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:03,932
The violence.

331
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,932
When I came downstairs in my home
and saw that tree in my living room,

332
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:14,932
it reached out for me, a divine hand.

333
00:24:16,532 --> 00:24:18,212
God loves violence.

334
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:23,812
- I, I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.

335
00:24:24,452 --> 00:24:26,132
Why else would there be so much of it?

336
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,332
It's in us.

337
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:29,732
It's what we are.

338
00:24:31,452 --> 00:24:34,652
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,
and pillage and plunder

339
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,292
and tear at the flesh
of our brothers

340
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:40,132
and why? Because God gave us violence
to wage in his honor.

341
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:45,492
I thought God gave us moral order.

342
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:48,132
There is no moral orders
as pure as this storm.

343
00:24:49,012 --> 00:24:51,012
There's no moral order at all.

344
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:54,932
There's just this-
Can my violence conquer yours?

345
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,132
- I'm not violent.
- Yes you are.

346
00:25:03,732 --> 00:25:05,532
You're as violent as they come.

347
00:25:06,612 --> 00:25:09,332
I know this, because I am as violent as they come.

348
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:12,212
If the constraints of society
were lifted..............

349
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:18,332
and I was all that stood between you and the meal, you
would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts.

350
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,532
Wouldn't ya?

351
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:27,852
Cawley thinks you're harmless, but you can be
controlled, but I know different.

352
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:30,932
- You don't know me.
- Oh but I do.
- You don't know me. 

353
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:36,012
Oh, I know you
We've known each other for centuries.

354
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:48,132
If I was to sink my teeth into your hide
right now,

355
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:51,332
would you be able to stop me before I blinded you?

356
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:56,852
Give it a try.

357
00:25:58,332 --> 00:26:02,332
That's the spirit.

358
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:47,012
Where have you been?

359
00:26:48,132 --> 00:26:50,212
Wandering, just looking at your island.

360
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:54,452
Oh I forgot your leaving,
now that Rachel's been found.

361
00:26:54,932 --> 00:26:56,332
Sure.

362
00:26:58,532 --> 00:26:59,732
Big meeting

363
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:02,732
Oh, yes ...

364
00:27:02,812 --> 00:27:05,332
Apparently there was an unidentified man
in ward C yesterday,

365
00:27:05,372 --> 00:27:08,732
he subdued a highly dangerous patient.
quite handly.

366
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:10,932
Is that so?.........

367
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:15,452
It seems he had a long conversation with a
paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce.

368
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:21,212
This Noyce,
so you said his name was,

369
00:27:22,132 --> 00:27:25,172
- he's delusional?
- Oh extremely, he can be quite upseting.

370
00:27:25,212 --> 00:27:28,212
In fact, two weeks ago, a patient
got so wound up

371
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:32,012
by one of Noyce's stories
that he beat him up.

372
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:33,852
Cigarette?

373
00:27:35,212 --> 00:27:36,932
No, thanks.
I quit.

374
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,532
So, your taking the ferry?

375
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:42,452
Yes, absolutely ...

376
00:27:43,132 --> 00:27:44,852
I think we've gotten
all we came here for.

377
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:46,852
"We" Marshal?

378
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:50,652
Speaking of a which-

379
00:27:51,132 --> 00:27:53,452
- Have you seen him, Doctor?
- Who?

380
00:27:54,332 --> 00:27:55,852
My partner, Chuck.

381
00:27:58,532 --> 00:28:00,452
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

382
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,412
You know, I've built something valuable here,

383
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:08,812
but valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

384
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:10,812
Everyone wants a quick fix,
they always have.

385
00:28:10,932 --> 00:28:14,332
I'm trying to do something that people
your self included don't understand.

386
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:16,812
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

387
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:20,652
I can see that ...

388
00:28:24,332 --> 00:28:26,132
So tell me again
about your partner.

389
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:29,852
What partner?

390
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:33,852
Marshal ...

391
00:29:35,132 --> 00:29:36,532
Going somewhere?

392
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:40,532
No. Just ... heading out
to the ferry.

393
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:43,732
I'm afraid, I'm afraid it's the other way.

394
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,452
If you wait a moment,

395
00:29:49,012 --> 00:29:51,852
I'll find you someone that can take you
to the dock.

396
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:57,972
What's this, Doctor?
Huh, What's this?

397
00:29:58,012 --> 00:30:00,452
It's just a sedative?

398
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,052
- It's a precaution.
- Precaution?

399
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:09,532
What are you going to do,
kill me?

400
00:30:10,052 --> 00:30:11,332
Do you think you deserve it

401
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,532
For what? Provoking you?

402
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:17,532
And forgive me
what doesn't provoke you?

403
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,052
Remarks ...

404
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:20,812
- Words ...
- Nazis

405
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:23,132
Well that too.

406
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:25,332
And of course, memories, dreams ...

407
00:30:26,532 --> 00:30:30,452
Did you know that the word "trauma" comes
from the Greek- for wound?

408
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:35,012
And what is the German word for "dream"
is "traume".

409
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:36,132
I like traume.

410
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:40,132
Wounds can create monsters.

411
00:30:40,452 --> 00:30:42,932
And you ...
you are wounded, Marshal.

412
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:46,732
And wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster

413
00:30:47,532 --> 00:30:48,932
you must stop it.

414
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:53,932
- I agree.
- Yes.

415
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:40,332
What are you doing, baby?

416
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:47,012
You've gotta get to the ferry.

417
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:49,732
No, no, ... no.

418
00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:57,532
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he is perfect for their experiments.

419
00:31:58,132 --> 00:32:00,612
There's only one place they'd take him.

420
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:05,532
You go there and you'll die.

421
00:32:05,612 --> 00:32:09,452
He's my partner, if they are hurting him, if they're
holding him against his will, I have gotta bring him out.

422
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:11,812
I can't lose anyone else.

423
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:16,452
Don't go Teddy, please, 
please don 't do this, don't go.

424
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:21,212
I'm sorry, honey.

425
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:25,532
I love this thing because
you gave it to me,

426
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,132
but the truth is ...

427
00:32:30,212 --> 00:32:33,132
it's one fucking ugly tie.

428
00:33:11,932 --> 00:33:13,052
No!

429
00:34:31,532 --> 00:34:33,332
Don't move!
Stay where you are.

430
00:34:34,932 --> 00:34:36,532
Are you gonna kill me?

431
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:40,852
No
I'm not going to kill you.

432
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:31,211
Why are you all wet, baby?

433
00:36:32,331 --> 00:36:34,731
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

434
00:36:47,651 --> 00:36:50,011
The rifle's empty by the way.

435
00:36:55,451 --> 00:36:57,251
Have a seat.

436
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:06,811
For God's sake dry off,
you'll catch cold.

437
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:08,931
All right.

438
00:37:11,531 --> 00:37:14,211
How badly did you hurt the guard?

439
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:18,931
I, I don't know what 
you're talking about.

440
00:37:21,651 --> 00:37:23,211
Yes, he's here.

441
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:26,651
Have Dr Sheehan take a look
at your man before you send him up.

442
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,131
So, Dr Sheehan,

443
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:31,931
came in on the ferry
this morining?

444
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:33,931
Not exactly.

445
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:38,131
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

446
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:41,131
Sorry to hear about that.

447
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:46,011
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

448
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:48,531
How are the hallucinations?

449
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:50,931
Proud of you Teddy.

450
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:53,931
This place is gonna be the end of you ..

451
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:59,531
- Not bad.
- They'll get worse.

452
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,051
I know.

453
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:03,331
Dr. Solando,

454
00:38:04,251 --> 00:38:06,611
she told me about neuroleptics.

455
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:09,931
Did she now?
and when was this?

456
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:14,811
I found the doctor, in a cave, out by the cliffs.
But you'll never get to her.

457
00:38:14,931 --> 00:38:16,451
I don't doubt it.

458
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:18,811
Considering she's not real.

459
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,731
But your delusions are
more severe than I thought.

460
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:26,131
You are not on neuroleptics.

461
00:38:27,131 --> 00:38:29,451
You're not on anything, 
as a matter of fact.

462
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:31,731
Then what the fuck is this?
Huh, what the fuck is this?

463
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,851
Withdrawal.

464
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:34,331
Withdrawal?

465
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:37,531
From, from  what? I haven't even had a goddamned
drink since I've been on this island.

466
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,851
Chlorpromazine.

467
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:42,851
I'm not a fan of pharmacology,
but I have to say in your case.

468
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:46,011
- Clorpro, chlorproma what?
- Chlorpromazine.

469
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:51,131
The same thing we've
been giving you for the past 24 months.

470
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:54,931
So for the past two years

471
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:57,531
you, you have had somebody slipping
me drugs in Boston, is that it?


472
00:38:57,571 --> 00:38:59,851
Not Boston, here.

473
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:05,131
You've been here for two years,
a patient of this institution.

474
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:11,731
After everything I've seen here, Doctor,

475
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:14,651
you, you really think you can
convince me I'm crazy huh?

476
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:18,931
Do you know the kind of people I deal with 
everyday? I'm a U.S. marshal for God sakes.

477
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:23,091
You were a U.S. Marshal.
Here's a copy of the intake form.

478
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:26,331
You broke into ward C for
proof of the 67th patient.

479
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:29,331
If you'd gotten it to the mainland, then
you could have blown the lid off this place.

480
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:31,131
- Wait ...wait
- But somehow

481
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:32,931
you couldn't find time
to look at it yet. read it now

482
00:39:34,131 --> 00:39:35,331
Go ahead.

483
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:41,131
The patient is highly intelligent,
highly delusional.

484
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:42,651
Decorated army veteran.

485
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:44,651
Present for the
liberation of Dachau.

486
00:39:45,531 --> 00:39:47,651
Former US Marshal,

487
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,331
known proclivity for violence.

488
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:51,131
shown no remorse for his crime because
he denies  

489
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:54,531
the crime ever, ever took place.
Highly developed and fantastical

490
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:57,731
narratives which preclude facing
the truth of his actions-

491
00:39:57,851 --> 00:39:58,931
I had enough of this bullshit.

492
00:39:59,011 --> 00:40:00,331
Where's my partner huh?

493
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:01,931
Where's Chuck?
Where is he?

494
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:04,931
Let's try this another way.

495
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:07,411
Your wife's maiden name was
"Chanal" am I correct?

496
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:09,651
- Don't you even talk about her, don't you..
- I'm afraid I have to.

497
00:40:11,331 --> 00:40:14,211
Notice anything these four names have in common?

498
00:40:14,731 --> 00:40:15,811
It's your rule 4.

499
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,731
- Andrew, what do you see?
- If you've done anything

500
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:22,811
- to my partner, Doctor, that is a violation ...
- Focus, Andrew. What do you see?

501
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,931
The names 
have the same letters.

502
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:28,451
Edward Daniels has exactly same
13 letters

503
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:31,011
as Andrew Laeddis.
The same as Rachel Solando

504
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:33,451
and Dolores Chanal. The names

505
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,851
- are anagrams for each other.
- The...the tactics their not gonna

506
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:37,811
work on me.

507
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:40,131
You came here for the truth.
Here it is.

508
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:41,931
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

509
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:45,851
The 67th patient at Ashecliff
is you, Andrew.

510
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:47,931
Bullshit.

511
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:50,651
You were committed here by
court order 24 months ago.

512
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:53,931
Your crime is terrible.
One you can't forgive yourself for.

513
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:55,731
So you invented
another self.

514
00:41:00,611 --> 00:41:01,731
Allright, let's, let's get down to the facts.

515
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:06,131
You've created a story in which
you're not a murderer, you're a hero,

516
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:08,011
Still a U.S. Marshal,

517
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:09,451
only here at Ashecliff
because of a case,

518
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:11,051
and you've uncovered a conspiracy.

519
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,811
So that anything we tell you about
who you are, what you've done,

520
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:16,931
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

521
00:41:16,971 --> 00:41:18,051
My name is Edward Daniels.

522
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:21,451
I've been hearing this fantasy
for two years now. I know every detail.

523
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:24,211
Patient 67, the storm,
Rachel Solando,

524
00:41:24,331 --> 00:41:26,851
your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

525
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,211
You were at Dachau,
But you may not have killed any guards.

526
00:41:33,131 --> 00:41:36,011
I wish I could let you just
live in your fantasy world,

527
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:37,731
I really do.

528
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:42,851
But you are violent, trained, dangerous.
You're the most dangerous patient we have.

529
00:41:43,211 --> 00:41:45,651
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

530
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:48,211
Two weeks ago
you attacked George Noyce.

531
00:41:48,251 --> 00:41:49,731
No, no, I'm fuckin on to you doctor..

532
00:41:49,931 --> 00:41:51,731
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't.

533
00:41:51,931 --> 00:41:53,931
Give me one reason
why I'd even touch him.

534
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:55,851
Because he called you Laeddis,

535
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:58,131
and you'd do anything not to be him.

536
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,931
I have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

537
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:06,131
"This is about you and Laeddis.
That's all it's ever been about."

538
00:42:08,251 --> 00:42:10,731
No, no, he's saying this is about
"me and Laeddis".

539
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:13,211
When you asked him what happened
to his face,

540
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:15,531
he said, and here I'm quoting again,
"You did this".

541
00:42:16,051 --> 00:42:19,451
- No, no he meant it was my fault ...
- You almost killed him.

542
00:42:21,811 --> 00:42:25,451
The warden and the board of overseers
are determined that something be done, it's been decided

543
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:30,211
that unless we can bring you back to sanity
now, right now.

544
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:33,731
permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you can't hurt anyone ever again.

545
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:39,651
They lobotomise you, Andrew.

546
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:41,131
Do you understand?

547
00:42:45,011 --> 00:42:46,211
Yeah, I understand.

548
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,011
I understand just fine.

549
00:42:50,211 --> 00:42:54,091
If , if I don't play along
with your little game here,

550
00:42:54,131 --> 00:42:56,651
Dr Naehring gonna turn me into
one of his ghosts.

551
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:58,251
What about my partner?

552
00:42:58,931 --> 00:43:03,051
You gonna tell  U.S. Marshals' office
that he's a  defense mechanism?

553
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:06,251
Hello boss.

554
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:26,931
What the fuck is going on here?

555
00:43:30,011 --> 00:43:31,531
You, you working for him?

556
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:36,931
I'm sorry there wasn't any other way.
Someone had to stick with you, keep you safe.

557
00:43:39,011 --> 00:43:40,851
You've been watchin me, huh?

558
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:43,331
Watching me every minute.

559
00:43:45,131 --> 00:43:46,451
Who ... who are you?

560
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:48,131
Who are you?
Tell me.

561
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:50,331
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

562
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:54,651
I've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

563
00:43:55,931 --> 00:43:57,331
I am Lester Sheehan.

564
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:05,731
I told you, I told you about my wife.

565
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:08,931
- I know.
- I climbed down a cliff to get you.

566
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:13,571
I , I trusted you. I, I risked
everything, to come in here after you, everything!

567
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,691
I know boss.

568
00:44:14,731 --> 00:44:16,331
We're running out of time here, Andrew.

569
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:20,211
I swore before the board of
overseers that I could construct

570
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:22,651
the most radical, cutting edge role-play

571
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:25,211
ever attempted in psychiatry and
will bring you back.

572
00:44:25,251 --> 00:44:27,731
I thought if we let you play
this out,

573
00:44:28,451 --> 00:44:31,331
we could get you to see how
untrue, how impossible it is.

574
00:44:33,011 --> 00:44:34,331
You've had the run of the place for two days.

575
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:37,731
Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments.

576
00:44:38,651 --> 00:44:40,331
The satanic ORs

577
00:44:53,051 --> 00:44:54,651
Andrew, listen to me.

578
00:44:57,011 --> 00:44:58,531
If we fail with you,

579
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,931
then everything we've tried
to do here will be discredited.

580
00:45:02,051 --> 00:45:03,131
Everything.

581
00:45:05,451 --> 00:45:07,611
We are on the front lines of a war here old boy,

582
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:11,451
and right now, 
it all comes down to you.

583
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:20,131
Don't move! 
Don't move!

584
00:45:20,211 --> 00:45:23,211
- Andrew, Andrew, no, no.
- My name is Edward Daniels.

585
00:45:24,131 --> 00:45:26,851
This one is loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

586
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:28,931
I see and that's your firearm Marshal?
You're sure?

587
00:45:29,451 --> 00:45:30,931
My initials are on the side. There's a dent in
the barrel from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

588
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:35,131
You're not going to fuck with my mind
on this one doctor.

589
00:45:35,171 --> 00:45:38,131
Then blast away, because that's the
only way you're ever getting off this island.

590
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:46,131
Andrew, please don't.

591
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:57,851
My gun ...

592
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:06,251
What have you done to
my goddamned gun?

593
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,811
It's a toy, Andrew.

594
00:46:11,531 --> 00:46:13,051
We're telling you the truth.

595
00:46:14,531 --> 00:46:17,731
Dolores was insane, manic-depressive.
suicidal.

596
00:46:18,211 --> 00:46:21,291
You drank, stayed away,
ignored what everyone told you.

597
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:24,211
You moved to that lake house after
she, purposely,

598
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:26,851
set your city apartment on fire.

599
00:46:27,011 --> 00:46:28,651
- You're lying.
- Andrew... Andrew stop, stop

600
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:31,851
All you've done is lie.

601
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,011
Your children, Andrew your children.

602
00:46:34,851 --> 00:46:36,011
Streme,

603
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:39,531
- Henry,
- I have no children.

604
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:41,131
Your wife drowned them

605
00:46:41,531 --> 00:46:44,011
at the cabin by the lake.

606
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:46,211
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

607
00:46:46,851 --> 00:46:47,931
every night.

608
00:46:48,651 --> 00:46:49,811
I never had a girl.

609
00:46:49,851 --> 00:46:53,731
The one who tells you over and over that
you should saved her,

610
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,931
saved them all.

611
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:56,651
Your daughter ...

612
00:46:57,131 --> 00:47:00,011
Her name is Rachel. Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

613
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,331
Andrew, are you?

614
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:26,930
I'm so sorry, baby.

615
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,130
I told you not to come in here.

616
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,010
I told you ...

617
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,130
This would be the end of you.

618
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:00,130
I'm back.
we got him,

619
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,730
just outside of Oklahoma.
Must've stopped ten places

620
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,730
in between here and Tulsa.
I could sleep for a week.

621
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,210
Dolores?

622
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:19,930
Dolores?

623
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,130
Dolores?

624
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:41,930
Dolores?

625
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,450
Baby ...

626
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:10,930
Why are you all wet?

627
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:15,330
I missed you.

628
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,930
I want to go home.

629
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:28,650
You are home.

630
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,450
Where are the kids?

631
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,210
They're at school.

632
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,850
It's Saturday, honey.

633
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,210
School's not in on Saturday.

634
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,610
My school is.

635
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,450
Oh my God!

636
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,130
Oh my God!

637
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,850
Oh my God!

638
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:33,850
Oh my God, no!

639
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,130
Come on!
Come on!

640
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,930
No please, God, no please, god no.

641
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:01,530
No!

642
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:03,530
No!

643
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,050
No!

644
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,450
No!

645
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,810
Put them around the table Andrew.

646
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:19,930
We'll dry them off,

647
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,050
we'll change their clothes.

648
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:27,010
They'll be our living dolls.

649
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,450
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

650
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:39,530
If you ever loved me Dolores-

651
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,730
Please stop talking.

652
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:49,650
I love you.

653
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,530
Just set me free.

654
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:05,810
Baby.

655
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,050
We'll give them baths.

656
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:19,130
- I love you baby.
- I love you too.
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much. I love you.

657
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,330
Andrew?

658
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:54,450
Andrew, can you hear me?

659
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:59,250
Rachel!
Rachel, Rachel.

660
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:02,250
Rachel?

661
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,130
Rachel who?

662
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:10,730
Rachel Laeddis. 

663
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,450
My daughter.

664
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,730
Why you here?

665
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,650
Because I killed my wife.

666
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:25,210
And why did you do that?

667
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,730
Because she murdered our children.

668
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:36,530
And she told me to let her go.

669
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:43,650
- Who's Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

670
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,530
Neither does Rachel Solando,
I made them up.

671
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,930
Why?

672
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,010
We need to hear you say it.

673
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,610
After she tried to kill
herself the first time,

674
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,330
Dolores told me she ...,

675
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,530
she has an insect ...

676
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,450
living inside her brain.

677
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:12,810
She could feel it,

678
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,130
clicking across
her skull ...

679
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:21,730
pulling the wires,
just for fun.

680
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:26,330
She told me that.

681
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,210
She told me that, but I didn't listen.

682
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,130
I loved her so much.

683
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:38,650
Why do you make them up?

684
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:44,130
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

685
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:55,850
And I killed them, because
I didn't get her help.

686
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,130
I killed them.

687
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,650
Here's my fear, Andrew,
we broke through once before,

688
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,450
nine months ago,
and then you regressed.

689
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,330
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

690
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,530
You reset, Andrew,
like a tape,

691
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:26,730
playing over and over, on an endless loop.

692
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:29,850
I hope that what we've done will be enough
to stop it from ever happening again.

693
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,330
but I need to know, 

694
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:34,850
you've accepted reality.

695
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,930
You came after me, huh doctor?

696
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:49,530
You tried to help me when no one else would.

697
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,330
My name is Andrew Laeddis,

698
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:13,450
and I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

699
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,850
How we doing this morning?

700
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,850
Good.
and You?

701
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:43,010
Can't complain.

702
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,050
So what's our next move?

703
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:56,130
You tell me.

704
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,130
I've gotta get off this rock,
Chuck.

705
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:07,810
Get back to the mainland. Whatever the
hell is going on here it's bad.

706
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,330
Don't worry partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

707
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:39,330
That's right we're too smart for them.

708
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:43,130
Yeah, we are,
aren't we?

709
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,610
You know this place makes
me wonder.

710
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:03,050
Yeah? What's that boss?

711
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,130
Which would be worse?

712
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:09,130
To live as a monster,

713
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,050
or to die as a good man?

714
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:21,450
Teddy?

715
