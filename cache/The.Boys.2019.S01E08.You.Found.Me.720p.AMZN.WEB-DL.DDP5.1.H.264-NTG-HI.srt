1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,953
Howdy, boys.

2
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:37,785
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,670
(quietly):
How are you guys doing? Good?

4
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:43,207
Why don't you, uh, go have
a smoke or something, okay?

5
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,212
I got this.

6
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:48,513
Oh, and, uh, you guys...

7
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,469
you are the real heroes.

8
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,930

God bless America.

Captain.

33
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,615
I found this.

34
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:43,083
The Islamic State is not exactly

35
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:47,542
a hotbed
of scientific expertise.

36
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,665
But they've counterfeited

37
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:52,632
this Compound V shit of yours?

38
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,473
It seems that way,
Mr. Secretary.

39
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,970
How did they get the formula?

40
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,523
Honestly, we have no idea.

41
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,137
Well, you must have some idea.

42
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,555
Some tourist shoplift it
from your lab?

43
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:11,106
Or maybe an inside job?

44
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,070
Sir, we would like to get
to the bottom of this

45
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,451
as much as you would.

46
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,737
Ms. Stillwell,

47
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,830
if I had my way,
the Justice Department

48
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,037
would haul your smug,
tennis-toned ass

49
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,457
into Congress
and make you testify

50
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,457
to corporate fraud.

51
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:31,799
What is Lockheed Martin's
number one product?

52
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:32,797
Sorry?

53
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,588
Its top seller.

54
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:35,972
You should know this,

55
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,178
you served
on their board of directors.

56
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,218
- The Patriot missile.
- Correct.

57
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,602
Northrop?

58
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,019
B-2 Stealth.

59
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,637
General Dynamics?

60
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,853
Tomahawk and the M1 Abrams.

61
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,935
Billions of dollars
of bleeding-edge hardware.

62
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:55,241
Do you know what all of that
is as of today?

63
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,317
A worthless pile of shit.

64
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:01,874
Because Naqib and other
super terrorists like him

65
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,409
can flick away that junk
like flicking a flea.

66
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:08,123
So it doesn't matter
where heroes really come from.

67
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,125
Frankly, it doesn't even matter

68
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,457
how the enemy got
the Compound V.

69
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,173
What matters is they've got it.

70
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,634
It is a whole new world now.

71
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,796
And there is only one company

72
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,644
that has the product
to fight back.

73
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,404
My company.

74
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,397
My product.

75
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,939
SUSAN:
What can I say?

76
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,824
The Pentagon's agreed to keep
Compound V classified.

77
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,451
Classified?

78
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,118
What the fuck are you on about?

79
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,826
Because of the Naqib asshole
that is out there,

80
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,117
we have to keep Vought
happy now.

81
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,001
Vought are the ones that fucking
created the cunt.

82
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,579
- We have no solid proof on that.
- No hard proof?

83
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,995
I fucking well rescued
the proof from a basement.

84
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,884
She's sitting on a bloody bog
as we speak.

85
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,472
Listen. Listen.

86
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,467
Vought's manufacturing
super villains.

87
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,759
It's the story of the century.

88
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,102
Don't you want
a fucking Pulitzer?

89
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,059
Well, fuck you, too, then.

90
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,853
(Butcher speaking indistinctly)

91
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,659
(chuckles)
Susan, come on.

92
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:26,038
There must be something
we can do here, yeah?

93
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,116
Look, the military deal
is signed and sealed.

94
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,963
Do you think one mute girl
is going to derail that?

95
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,539
Especially coming
from the fugitives

96
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,504
- that killed Translucent?
- Fugitives?

97
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:40,505
Vought insisted and...
and the DOJ agreed.

98
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,179
You're wanted men now.

99
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,137
- (knocking on door)
- Hello?

100
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:45,428
This isn't a day spa.

101
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,261
Other people got
to use the facilities.

102
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,463
Look, I gave you the V.

103
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,829
I gave you everything
you asked for and more.

104
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,729
I trusted you, and this is
the fucking thanks I get.

105
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,713
Butcher, I will still protect
your families.

106
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,086
Yeah, and keep
your bleeding career even safer.

107
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,183
Well, what about me
and the Boys, then, eh?

108
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,639
You cut bait and run
for your lives.

109
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,219
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,436
(click over phone)

111
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,267
Yeah, mm-hmm.

112
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,442
Right.

113
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,980
All right, then, love.

114
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,244
Well, that's all under control,
isn't it?

115
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,067
- Oh. We need to split up.
- Mm-hmm.

116
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,704
Oi, what the fuck are you doing?

117
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,120
We ain't, we ain't done yet.

118
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,788
The hell we ain't.

119
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,304
We got Vought, the Supes,
and the Feds on our asses.

120
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,538
I'm going to Montreal.

121
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,765
MOTHER'S MILK:
Yeah, and how you gonna get

122
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:54,808
your crazy-ass girlfriend
over the border?

123
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:55,792
She has a name.

124
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,043
(speaks French)

125
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,794
It's Kimiko. Okay?

126
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,246
- Kimiko.
- Oi, listen.

127
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,705
Shut your fucking traps.

128
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,085
We're on the verge of nailing
these cunts.

129
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,763
And you want to cut bait and run

130
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,681
before we've played
our final card.

131
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,179
Okay, what is it, man?

132
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,482
Give us a couple hours. Yeah?

133
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,557
Hughie, you're with me.

134
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,813
Come on, son.

135
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,855
Chop, chop.

136
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,167
Oh! Annie.
(exhales)

137
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,668
You scared me.

138
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,750
You didn't say you were coming.

139
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,548
I hid this under my floorboards
right after Daddy left.

140
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,894
I thought that maybe

141
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,139
he would come back
for it, but...

142
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,848
- Still smells like him.
- It was a bad habit.

143
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,524
His father smoked a pipe,
so, you know...

144
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,443
What's Compound V?

145
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,032
Uh, Compound V?

146
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,437
I don't know, sweetheart.

147
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,485
Should I?

148
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,622
How old was I?
Hmm?

149
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:20,916
How old was I when you let
Vought pump me full of drugs?

150
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,188
- Annie, honestly, I don't know what you're talk...
- How old,

151
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,462
when you let them turn me
into a freak?

152
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,255
You're not a freak.

153
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,549
Never say that.

154
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,509
So it's true.

155
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,982
Annie...

156
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,822
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

157
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,320
(breathing heavily)

158
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,834
- Did, did Vought tell you all this?
- No.

159
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,577
No. A friend told me.

160
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,672
How much did they pay you?

161
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,339
- It wasn't about money.
- How much?

162
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,340
There was no money.

163
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,971
They, they, they just paid

164
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,547
for the medical bills,
that's it.

165
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,053
I did it because they,
they promised

166
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:17,596
that you'd have a chance
at an extraordinary life.

167
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,941
To be strong and successful
and special.

168
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,808
I mean, who wouldn't
want that for their...

169
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,734
You made me think that I was
chosen by God.

170
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:26,944
You were!

171
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,364
God brought Vought
into our lives.

172
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,612
He made this possible.

173
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,573
Bullshit!

174
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,203
You did!

175
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,660
And then you controlled
every single minute of it.

176
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,873
You woke me up at 5:00 a.m.

177
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,253
to train
for those stupid pageants,

178
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,961
and the tap dancing
and the tae kwon do.

179
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,173
I gave up every moment
of my life.

180
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,673
I-I... and I was happy to do it.

181
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:50,665
This was our dream.

182
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,086
This was your dream!

183
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:56,724
I never got a chance
to choose my own dreams.

184
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,273
No wonder I don't know who
the fuck I'm supposed to be!

185
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,848
Annie.

186
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,493
Was it really bad investments?

187
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,447
- What?
- You told me that Daddy left

188
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,987
because he lost
all of our savings.

189
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,620
He agreed to all of it.

190
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:26,083
And then, one day,
he... he didn't,

191
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,126
so he walked out on us.

192
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,343
Maybe he didn't want
to lie to me.

193
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,465
So I'm the monster?

194
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,312
You have a good life.

195
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:43,058
- (sighs)
- People would give anything to be what you are.

196
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,101
I thought I did what was right.

197
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,317
Annie, Annie.

198
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:53,569
Annie! Annie!

199
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,072
DEEP: It's time to knock back
some of this per diem, buddy.

200
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,704
(chuckles):
Oh, it's a pretty fancy bottle.

201
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:02,502
(chuckles) What are we, uh,
what are we celebrating?

202
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,349
What are you talking about?
The Seven getting called up.

203
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,543
Yeah.

204
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,205
You know the whole reason
the Navy discontinued

205
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,513
their Sea Mammal
mine clearance program?

206
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,968
It's because it cost
way too much

207
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,088
to train the fucking dolphins.

208
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,675
Yeah.

209
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,350
But with me on board,

210
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,889
it's like a, it's like
a pick-up game of basketball.

211
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,603
(sighs)

212
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,693
I've always wanted to lead
my own unit, Jeff.

213
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,149
It's like a dream
come true for me.

214
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,529
(blender running)

215
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,435
(blender stops)

216
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,736
(sniffs)

217
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,119
Smells like a comeback.
(chuckles)

218
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,867
- Anyways...
- Hmm.

219
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,659
- Cheers, buddy.
- (chuckles)

220
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,212
So, when?

221
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,167
When, what?

222
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,997
When do I ship out?

223
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,922
Oh. (chuckles)

224
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:52,671
Gosh.

225
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,512
You know that water park's
opening up a new splash zone,

226
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,929
and, and they are real excited

227
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,486
to have you cut that ribbon.
(chuckles)

228
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,890
(laughing)

229
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,426
You know, I'm seriously
leaving, Jeff.

230
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,103
Fuck Ohio.

231
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,064
Here's the sitch.

232
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,015
I-I talked to New York.

233
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,985
And... you're not.

234
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,696
So much.

235
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,736
Leaving.

236
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,912
What?

237
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,489
They didn't share details.

238
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,456
(chuckles):
But hey, look...

239
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,787
the boys in marketing have
created a primo tag for you:

240
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,495
The Savior of Sandusky!

241
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,006
(laughs)

242
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,427
That has a nice ring,
doesn't it?

243
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,178
(door creaks)

244
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,765
(birds chirping)

245
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,666
William.

246
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,256
What are you looking at
out there?

247
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,890
Eastern meadowlarks.

248
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:26,177
It was either bird-watching
or alcoholism, so...

249
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,933
birds.

250
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,394
I thought we agreed that you

251
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,774
were never going
to come out here.

252
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,611
Yeah, well,
you taught me a thing or two

253
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,608
about broken promises.

254
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,781
Didn't you?

255
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,112
This is Hugh Campbell.

256
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,827
We're working
with M.M. and Frenchie.

257
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,908
I got the Boys back together.

258
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,294
Grace Mallory.

259
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,750
I'm the founder
of your little club.

260
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,841
- You're, uh...
- So, let me hear it.

261
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,508
I need your help.

262
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,179
Sorry, I can't.

263
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:05,637
I'm hoping to photograph
a snowy owl in the dunes.

264
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,431
Look...

265
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,234
I didn't want to come here,

266
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,809
but I need your help.

267
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,654
And you're going to
fucking help.

268
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,481
Why's that?

269
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,204
Because you owe me.

270
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,714
You fucking owe me, goddamn it.

271
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,127
(faucet dripping)

272
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,880
(blows)

273
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,735
(gasps)

274
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,377
(sniffs)

275
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,627
(thump in distance)

276
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,603
Look at you, mon coeur.

277
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,676
Run! Run!

278
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,941
(banging on door)

279
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,605
(grunting)

280
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,025
(man yelling in pain)

281
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:49,913
(weapon hisses)

282
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,829
(man yells, groans in pain)

283
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,122
(man's groaning distorting)

284
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,785
(distorted radio chatter)

285
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,796
MAN:
Who's got eyes on her?

286
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,338
MAN 2 (in distance):
Over here!

287
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,593
(indistinct shouts)

288
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,597
(panting)

289
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,390
MAN:
Good job.

290
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,984
We won't let her get away.

291
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,940
(indistinct shout in distance)

292
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,292
(over radio):
This is Alpha Team.

293
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,646
Suspect is in custody.

294
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:28,154
MALLORY: There's simply nothing
else to say. I can't help you.

295
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,799
Well, you're gonna have to do
better than that.

296
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:33,163
- Do I? Why?
- 'Cause you made me a promise.

297
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,041
But then my grandchildren
got incinerated.

298
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,618
Tends to change
one's perspective.

299
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,124
There weren't even teeth left,

300
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,085
Lamplighter had burnt them alive
so thoroughly.

301
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,259
Well,

302
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:50,217
I think I've had
enough sun for one day.

303
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,430
Pleasure meeting you, Hugh.

304
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,890
Butcher.

305
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,684
Well, what about
what you've done?

306
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,136
What I've done?

307
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,016
To who?

308
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:07,864
To me, goddamn it. To me.

309
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,862
You trained me up,
manipulated me,

310
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,324
aimed me at Homelander
like a fucking howitzer.

311
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,905
And then when it didn't suit you
anymore, you just threw me away.

312
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,372
And not a day goes by
I don't regret it.

313
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,583
Day late, dollar short, love.

314
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,380
Now, I'm going to finish
what you started,

315
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,421
and I need your help.

316
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,051
Please.

317
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,231
You can leave with something,

318
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,521
if you never come back

319
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,185
and you keep your
goddamn promise this time.

320
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,697
Madelyn Stillwell.

321
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,490
Vought's VP?

322
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,136
- Homelander's her main account.
- Yeah, that ain't news.

323
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,120
(chuckles)
No, but this is:

324
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,423
They have a...
what shall we say?

325
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,877
a very special relationship.

326
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,498
Complicated, intimate,
hard to quantify.

327
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,045
And you know this how?

328
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,468
Still have a few fingers
in a few pies.

329
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,638
I don't know
if Homelander has a weakness,

330
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:16,806
but if he does, she'll know it.

331
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,395
Good-bye, Grace.

332
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,068
You want to kill yourself,
that's your right...

333
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,737
I won't stop you...
but, Billy, not the others.

334
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,952
Vengeance isn't a path
to glory, Hugh.

335
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,832
It's a one-way ticket
to a dead end,

336
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,250
looking at fucking birds.

337
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,050
Oh... No, go ahead.

338
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,973
Sure.

339
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,558
(sniffles)

340
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,163
(sighs)

341
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,788
(quietly):
Dude. Dude, it's A-Train.

342
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,044
Really?

343
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
It's fucking A-Train.

344
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,626
Can I help you?

345
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,216
I'm just keeping an eye out.

346
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,507
(chuckles)
That's funny, um,

347
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:45,266
it really looks like you're
only keeping an eye on me.

348
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,400
You know I'm A-Train, right?

349
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,687
Yeah, and I'm Homelander.

350
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,572
Dude, whip back to A-Train.

351
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,487
Oh.

352
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,739
Listen, I'm sorry about that.

353
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,161
We're good.

354
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,789
(chuckles):
Oh. Wait, so now that you...

355
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,497
now you know I'm A-Train,
now we're good?

356
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,828
Listen, man, I'm sorry.
It was my mistake.

357
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,875
Yeah, you're damn right
it's your mistake.

358
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,300
I'm A-Train.

359
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,048
I'm the fastest
fucking man alive!

360
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,430
(indistinct chatter)

361
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:21,848
What are you all
fucking looking at?

362
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,561
- You missed it.
- Eyes front.

363
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,605
Eyes fucking front, Hughie.

364
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,609
- Boys are gone.
- What?

365
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,191
Someone's grabbed them.

366
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,195
Oh, yeah? How do you know that?

367
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,107
The window's new,
the front path is scrubbed,

368
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,156
and there's a black van
with "Flowers" on it,

369
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,120
probably full of cunts
waiting to jump us.

370
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,540
- Vought?
- Nah, someone else doing

371
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,829
their dirty work for them,

372
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,292
probably some
Fed black ops unit.

373
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,469
Okay. Okay, what are we...
what-what are we gonna do?

374
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,298
How are we gonna get
the guys back?

375
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,723
BUTCHER: We're on our own.
We've got to get to Stillwell

376
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,240
- before the walls close in.
- Who gives a fuck about Stillwell?

377
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,117
- We have to go back for them.
- You don't get it, Hughie.

378
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,191
We got about a couple hours
before they find us,

379
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,517
and that's if we're lucky.

380
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,231
We got to hit back
and hit back now.

381
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,732
You're abandoning them.

382
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,824
I mean, they all...
they risked their...

383
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,860
Mother's Milk has a daughter.

384
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,131
They'd want us
to finish the job.

385
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,365
Your job.

386
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,908
Your job, not theirs.

387
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,333
It's all about Homelander,
isn't it?

388
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,632
And A-Train. This is your
fucking shit, too, Hughie.

389
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,627
I promised you payback,
didn't I?

390
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,335
Mallory give you the same speech
back in the day?

391
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,721
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

392
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,087
But she broke her promise.

393
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:43,715
I'm keeping mine.

394
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,968
I'm so fucking stupid.

395
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,694
You never cared about me.

396
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:54,058
Or Robin, did you?

397
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,895
I was just useful to you.

398
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,321
Fuck, Hughie.
Of course you're useful.

399
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,740
I mean, that's why you're here,
isn't it?

400
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:06,279
Now we just got to take
one more step.

401
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,285
Yeah?

402
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,287
Come on.

403
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,249
HUGHIE:
No.

404
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,830
We have to save them.

405
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,996
For fuck's sakes, Hughie,
we don't have time

406
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,005
for this shit right now, okay?

407
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,837
We get Stillwell.
Now, get in the fucking car.

408
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,843
Then what?

409
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:26,215
Becca comes back from the dead?
Robin, too?

410
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,102
This is never gonna stop...
it's just gonna be more blood

411
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,350
and... awfulness.

412
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,187
That's the fucking game.

413
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,609
If you don't like to play, why
did you join the fucking team?

414
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,881
Mallory's right... you're just
gonna drag us all down with you.

415
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,373
Not me.

416
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,237
Not anymore.

417
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,962
You're a fucking pathetic cunt

418
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,578
and an insult to Robin's memory.

419
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,125
I think I'm doing this for her.

420
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,842
Good-bye, Hughie.

you like to come here to listen

444
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,769
to the choir rehearse,
so I, I figured I'd take a shot.

445
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,522
You've got a lot of balls.

446

Just two.
(chuckles)

to arrest you.

HUGHIE:
Actually, uh...

449
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:38,786
Annie... I need your help.

450
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,127
- Please just listen to me.
- Why?

451
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,183
More awful secrets
you want to tell me,

452
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,177
more drugs that I was dosed
with as a kid, maybe?

453
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,969
Look, that just came out.
I'm sorry.

454
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,698
I-I thought you... maybe
you wanted to know the truth.

455
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,892
Oh, okay, so you're
all about the truth.

456
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,733
Vought is giving Compound V
to some bad fucking people,

457
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,149
like really bad.

458
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,187
Like, that Supe terrorist.

459
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,567
That's insane.

460
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,609
No, it's true.

461
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,823
Look, my friends want to stop
it, but they got caught

462
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,453
on Vought's orders,
and I, and I figured,

463
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:18,911
because you had
security clearance,

464
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,003
maybe you could help find them.

465
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:27,037
Hughie, I was almost arrested
just for knowing you.

466
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,046
I had to convince them that I
was an idiot that you threw out

467
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,879
and you used,
and now you want me

468
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,434
to help
your psycho killer friends?

469
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:37,428
When you put it like that...
(chuckles)

470
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:41,771
You have 30 seconds
to get the hell out of here.

471
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,517
Okay.

472
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,565
I'm sorry to bother you.

473
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,360
STARLIGHT:
I mean, why the hell

474
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:56,414
would I ever help you?

475
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,621
Because Vought's up
to some evil shit?

476
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,088
'Cause it's your job.

477
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,339
Because you're a superhero.

478
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,381
Really?

479
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,845
I can't remember the last time
I saved anyone.

480
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,309
You saved me.

481
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,269
When did I ever save you?

482
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Bowling alley.

483
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,775
What are you talking about?

484
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:39,242
I was, I was angry after Robin.

485
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:44,873
I was headed for this cliff, and
then you and me went bowling.

486
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:48,129
Bowling?

487
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,127
Yeah.

488
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,129
Bowling.

489
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,091
That's it.

490
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:58,801
That's not saving you,
that's, that's just being there.

491
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,518
The thing is...

492
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,487
...I don't care.

493
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,665
- (grunting)
- (heart beating)

494
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,304
(metal creaking)

495
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,976
- (horn honking)
- NATHAN: Hey!

496
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,440
What the hell are you doing?

497
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,281
Doc said six weeks minimum
after a fracture like that.

498
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,147
(panting):
I'm all good, man.

499
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,904
Look, I'm back to training.

500
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:01,196
I feel fucking great.

501
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,620
- You're healed?
- I'm healed.

502
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,698
How the fuck are you hea...

503
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,293
(laughs)

504
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,748
You back on that Compound V.

505
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,892
- (groans)
- You promised me that you would stay clean.

506
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,916
No. I am clean.

507
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,210
A-1, all-natural A-Train, baby.

508
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,844
Your fucking bones fused back
together overnight?

509
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:21,643
- That sound natural to you?
- Maybe I'm just strong.

510
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,097
- Oh, yeah.
- I am the world's fastest man.

511
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,314
Bet you can't outrun this.

512
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:33,312
Hey. Wait, hey, where you going?

513
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,525
I'm not gonna sit here
and watch you kill yourself.

514
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:41,157
(chuckles) You know what?
I don't need this shit.

515
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:44,157
You've always just been jealous
of me, so go ahead,

516
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,450
slow-ass fucking loser.

517
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:46,663
(tires screeching)

518
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,372
(grunting)

519
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,587
(piano playing)

520
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:22,359
(piano stops)

521
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:26,414
Huh... I'm just, yeah, I'm just
gonna... (clears throat)

522
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:40,012
- MAN: There he is!
- WOMAN: Our hero.

523
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,967
(cheering, applause)

524
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:45,427
(laughs)
Stop it.

525
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,099
Stop, please.

526
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:59,024
Amazing. Great job, everybody.

527
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,794
- You're gonna make me blush here.
- EDGAR: Madelyn?

528
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,568
- HOMELANDER: Stop, please.
- Mr. Edgar.

529
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,242
Uh, I, uh, I didn't know
you were gonna come.

530
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,202
Let me borrow you for a moment.

531
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,920
(sighs)

532
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,344
The Pentagon's shelling out
north of $40 billion per year.

533
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,593
You should enjoy a bonus
that reflects that.

534
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,013
I-I don't know what to say.

535
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,425
Well, say thank you.

536
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,853
(chuckles)
Thank you.

537
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,852
Don't get too excited.

538
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,484
It comes with strings.

539
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,651
You're gonna need to move
your office down to 82.

540
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,650
- That's your floor.
- And

541
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:44,452
I'm gonna want you to start
riding shotgun on my meetings.

542
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,486
Hey, don't go planning
my retirement yet.

543
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,620
I'm just saying, someone
needs to run this shit show

544
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:51,237
when I move to Belize.

545
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,865
Enjoy yourself, Madelyn.

546
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,171
Start thinking
about the view from 82.

547
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,843
Thank you.

548
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,880
- (clatters)
- (laughs)

549
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:14,309
Electricity goes in,
blast comes out.

550
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,482
That's a hell of a party trick.

551
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:24,192
Do you ever, um, use it for fun?

552
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:27,824
Can I tell you a secret?

553
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:32,493
Sometimes,
my eyes light up when I...

554
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,914
you know.

555
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,082
(both chuckle)

556
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,629
- Will you excuse me?
- Uh...

557
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,920
Just a second.

558
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:54,769
(Starlight vomiting)

559
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,477
(groans)

560
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:57,847
(coughs)

561
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,943
(sighs)

562
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,768
- You want me to hold your hair back?
- (groans)

563
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,935
Don't touch.
(grunts)

564
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,193
(toilet flushes)

565
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:08,105
Leave me alone,
I'm not in the mood.

566
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,863
Not in the mood for what?

567
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:10,945
(Starlight grunts)

568
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,619
Your bottomless casual cruelty.

569
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,410
So just make
whatever shitty comment

570
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:18,163
you're gonna make and then go.

571
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,841
(sniffles)

572
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,719
Look.

573
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,798
What am I supposed to be
looking at?

574
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:35,974
No... my radius
never healed straight.

575
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,227
I really did break every bone
in my right arm.

576
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,981
- What?
- Stopping the bus from falling.

577
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,233
You said the marketing guys
made it up.

578
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,606
It was me.

579
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,196
23-year-old, bright-eyed,

580
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,701
ass you could bounce
a quarter off of...

581
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,204
me.

582
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,128
I really did want
to make a difference.

583
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,799
I really did care.

584
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,257
I was just like you.

585
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,804
And then...

586
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:17,644
I started giving pieces
of myself away and...

587
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:20,431
I guess I gave away everything.

588
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,235
So you know what? Be...

589
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,857
just be original.

590
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,905
For fuck's sake.

591
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,621
My position is already taken.

592
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,923
Be the annoying goody two-shoes
asshole that you are.

593
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,420
(Maeve chuckles)

594
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,763
One of us has to be.

595
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,517
(door opens)

596
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:10,065
(piano playing)

597
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,708
HOMELANDER:
You've been avoiding me.

598
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:27,128
- No, I haven't.
- Really?

599
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,167
Seems that way.

600
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,876
You do know that I went to see
Vogelbaum, though...

601
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,594
right?

602
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,176
And you do know what he told me?

603
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:42,682
I never meant for you
to find out that way.

604
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,274
Let me guess.
You wanted to protect me.

605
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,480
Well, we all did.

606
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,441
Of course.

607
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,691
You think I'm fragile?

608
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,324
No, I do not.

609
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,151
You try doing any of this...

610
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:59,276
I mean fucking any of it...

611
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,664
without me...

612
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,622
I couldn't.

613
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,332
Madelyn.

614
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:11,133
Did it ever occur to you that...

615
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,629
a Supe terrorist showing up

616
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,052
exactly when
we needed him to was...

617
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,722
a pretty fucking
incredible coincidence?

618
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,813
It's almost like...

619
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,099
someone planned it.

620
00:36:27,311 --> 00:36:30,191
- (Madelyn sighs)
- Mm-hmm.

621
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,860
Me.

622
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:38,862
Me.

623
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,196
I made him.

624
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,040
What do you mean you "made him"?

625
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:47,917
Well, I borrowed
some Compound V,

626
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,626
had A-Train run it
all over the globe,

627
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,547
and I supercharged some jihadis.

628
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,258
(chuckles)

629
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,258
Uh, not to oversimplify it.

630
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,819
I mean, it-it was actually
very difficult

631
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,603
and very messy,
using adult subjects.

632
00:37:02,638 --> 00:37:04,928
There's a good reason
that Vought doesn't do it.

633
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,683
But... well, enough survived

634
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,476
to call the operation
a huge success.

635
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:15,072
Huge.

636
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,988
And now...

637
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:22,197
we have villains
all over the globe...

638
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,120
that only we can fight.

639
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,709
In sequel after sequel...

640
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,628
after sequel.

641
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:38,466
Well?

642
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,549
Say something.

643
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,493
(Madelyn moans)

644
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,786
No.

645
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,541
Take off your pants.

646
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,765
Sit down.

647
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,786
(both grunt)

648
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,583
(exhales)

649
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,085
- Gentle.
- I'm...

650
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,587
(grunts)

651
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,169
No.

652
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:05,094
(exhales)

653
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,135
(Homelander grunting)

654
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,016
Oh, my sweet boy.

655
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:15,268
My special, special, sweet boy.

656
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:17,862
- (grunts)
- (moans)

657
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,938
I'm gonna take care of you.

658
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,993
(grunting loudly)

659
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,280
I'm sorry.

660
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:30,365
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

661
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,750
- No, you did good.
- (exhaling): I'm sorry.

662
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:35,078
- Oh, my boy.
- (panting)

663
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,633
I'm proud of you.

664
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,707
That was so lovely.

665
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,881
Well, you know,
in, uh, medieval times,

666
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:48,256
they locked prisoners
inside a pillory barrel.

667
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,616
Then they'd kneel
in their own excrement

668
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,350
till they got sepsis
and died, so...

669
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,149
Thank you, Frenchie,

670
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:01,858
for that disgusting
yet fascinating piece of trivia.

671
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,990
I'm just saying
it could be worse, huh?

672
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,487
Right.

673
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,530
(sighs)

674
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,082
Why didn't you tell us?

675
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:16,621
Tell you what?

676
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,455
That you had a daughter.

677
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,922
I don't know.

678
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,415
I mean...

679
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,096
I guess she's...

680
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:34,429
...the only good thing
I ever did, man.

681
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,806
I just wanted just to leave her
clean out of it, you know?

682
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,025
But I fucked that up
to high heaven.

683
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,994
Probably never see her again.

684
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,029
I understand.

685
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,448
She made you a better person.

686
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,881
Hey, man.

687
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,839
Kimiko's gonna be okay.

688
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,890
So you do know her name.

689
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,636
- Hmm.
- MADELYN: Do you like that?

690
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,520
- No.
- (Madelyn chuckles)

691
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,268
Um...

692
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:22,732
Mr. Edgar came
to the party tonight

693
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:26,322
and he practically
offered me his job.

694
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,989
Well, not right away.

695
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:29,908
But he, um...

696
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,566
wants me to move
to the 82nd floor

697
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:33,195
so that I can be closer to him.

698
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,831
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

699
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:38,248
Okay, but y-you'll still be
my day-to-day, right?

700
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,498
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

701
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,460
Of course.

702
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,170
I will be there for you always.

703
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:46,922
Okay, good.

704
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:51,299
Good.

705
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,215
Madelyn.

706
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,723
From now on,

707
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,925
no more secrets.

708
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,516
Promise me.

709
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,192
I promise.

710
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,822
No more secrets.

711
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,649
Okay.

712
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:16,204
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you about your baby.

713
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,748
It's just that...

714
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:22,618
you carry so much, and...

715
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:27,498
...the pain of losing
a child to...

716
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,585
miscarriage is...

717
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,885
I just wanted
to spare you that burden.

718
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:36,177
Do you understand?

719
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,221
Yes.

720
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,859
(clicks)

721
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,901
(exhales)

722
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:05,751
(Hughie grunts, yells)

723
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,172
What the fuck?!

724
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,210
(door unlocks)

725
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:12,671
(Hughie panting)

726
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:18,906
- (Hughie grunts)
- MOTHER'S MILK: Hey, easy with him, man.

727
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,930
Fuck wrong with you? Shit.

728
00:43:21,975 --> 00:43:24,845
- (door slams, locks)
- Bitch ass.

729
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,274
You okay? You break any bones?

730
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,653
- No, no. No.
- No?

731
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:29,019
Did they get Butcher, too?

732
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,145
- No.
- They got you separated?

733
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,652
When? When?

734
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,034
Well, um,

735
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,110
he went after Homelander.

736
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:37,406
But I...

737
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,699
(muffled):
I came to save you.

738
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:42,583
Yay. (chuckles weakly)

739
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,920
So, you came here?
You meant to come here?

740
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,827
- Without Butcher.
- Yeah.

741
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:50,707
C'est incroyable.

742
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,842
HUGHIE:
Oh...

743
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,052
Never has a man
thrown his life away so...

744
00:43:58,094 --> 00:43:59,905
completely like
you've thrown yours away today.

745
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,809
No...

746
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,478
no, what I mean is,
you rescuing us

747
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:07,687
is the most useless,
futile gesture I can think of.

748
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,609
- Yeah, I-I got it.
- Unbelievable.

749
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,397
- All right, so what's the plan?
- Okay.

750
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,031
Okay, um...

751
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,608
all right, so they searched me.

752
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,742
Very, very thoroughly.

753
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,330
But I managed to Poligrip
in my 12th grade retainer.

754
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:21,886
- Let me see.
- So it looks like a permanent bridge,

755
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,870
- and it totally worked.
- Shit.

756
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:25,806
Frenchie, you can pick a lock
with anything, right?

757
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,142
- (Frenchie exclaims)
- There's premium metal wire in this thing.

758
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,536
- Come on, take it out.
- Okay, one second.

759
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,335
MOTHER'S MILK: Come on, man.
Spit that bitch out.

760
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,380
- (mutters) It's stuck.
- (Frenchie shushes)

761
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,223
- Okay, okay, stand still.
- Wait, what?

762
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,638
- Stand still. Open.
- What...

763
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,216
- Open the mouth... (mutters)
- (Hughie grunts)

764
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,852
Come on, get up in there,
Frenchie.

765
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,309
(Hughie grunts)

766
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,559
MOTHER'S MILK: Just go deeper.
Just a little deeper.

767
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,620
All right, all right, all right,
h-h-hold...

768
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:48,814
- whoa, whoa, whoa.
- (gags)

769
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,063
HUGHIE:
What the fuck, man?

770
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,895
Let me get this.
Let me get this.

771
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,860
- (panting)
- Relax, okay?

772
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,030
- Look. Look, focus. Focus.
- Okay, okay. What?

773
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,381
I'm-a knock that bitch
out your mouth.

774
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,195
- Okay?
- We're not at that step yet.

775
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,717
- We don't have to do that.
- (stammers)

776
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,135
It's just gonna sting
a little bit. A'ight?

777
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,659
- Sting?
- On three.

778
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,514
- One to three.
- Okay, well, if you count down...

779
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,958
- (grunts, groans)
- MOTHER'S MILK: You all right?

780
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,328
- (groans)
- You okay, buddy?

781
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,285
- FRENCHIE: Yes.
- MOTHER'S MILK: Yes!

782
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,355
- (Frenchie shushing)
- MOTHER'S MILK: Good job, Hughie.

783
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,379
(guard grunts)

784
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,392
(camera beeping)

785
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,450
DRIVER:
Good night, Ms. Stillwell.

786
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:39,856
Good night, Miles.

787
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,414
(door closes)

788
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:43,318
Maria.

789
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:49,463
Maria, I'm home.

790
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:53,959
Maria?

791
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:56,092
BUTCHER:
Your kid's a sound sleeper.

792
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,603
Don't worry.

793
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,769
He's all right.

794
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,478
So's the nanny.

795
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,398
She's out the back sleeping off
a little bit of propofol.

796
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,031
Put your phone on the table.

797
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:35,882
William Butcher.

798
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,631
CIA showed me your file.

799
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,755
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.

800
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,222
I don't know how
breaking into my home

801
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:50,233
and threatening my child
is gonna get you Homelander.

802
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,766
All these years...

803
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,229
I've been searching
for that cunt's weakness.

804
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,230
He doesn't have any weakness.

805
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:58,732
- No?
- There isn't a weapon on Earth

806
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:00,735
that they haven't thrown at him.

807
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:02,317
They've all failed.

808
00:47:02,362 --> 00:47:04,572
That's not
what I'm talking about.

809
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:09,372
I'm talking... about you.

810
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,200
Me?

811
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:14,746
Yeah, you're the only thing
he gives two shits about.

812
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,882
You're his weakness.

813
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:27,682
It's a fucking maze.

814
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,350
Where is she?

815
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,601
Ready... go on.

816
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:46,701
Mon coeur.

817
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,489
Frenchie, what the fuck?

818
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,543
(monitors beeping steadily)

819
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,183
- Fuck! Move. Move.
- (Frenchie groaning)

820
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,980
(panting)

821
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:20,864
Fuck.

822
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,318
(grunts)

823
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,700
- No! God.
- Just stay down.

824
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,947
(panting)

825
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,419
Aw, fuck.

826
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,498
She better be fucking worth it.

827
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,213
Wait, what?

828
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,923
- You cover him. Cover him!
- Wait, what?

829
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,482
No, I don't... I don't...
I can't do this.

830
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,256
You just pull the fucking
trigger right now!

831
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,590
- Okay!
- (shouting)

832
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:51,596
Sorry! I'm sorry!

833
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:52,718
(shouting)

834
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,097
Shit, it's out, it's out.
What do I do?

835
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:58,102
Take this. Take it.

836
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,913
- Reload.
- What the fuck do I know about reloading?

837
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,607
Reload the magazine.

838
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:03,818
How do I do that? Okay.

839
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,568
- Let's go.
- Good? It's good.

840
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,360
(shouts)

841
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:09,945
(panting)

842
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:15,044
M.M.! M.M.!

843
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,458
M.M.!

844
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:24,504
Go!

845
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,955
(screaming)

846
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:29,839
(grunting)

847
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:39,814
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

848
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:42,312
(panting):
I'm out.

849
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:46,919
- Oh, shit. - Drop your weapon!
- Get down!

850
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:48,295
- Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
- On your knees.

851
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,047
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
- On your fucking knees!

852
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,071
Face the wall!

853
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:54,655
Hands on your heads!

854
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:01,208
(agents screaming)

855
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,269
(grunting)

856
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,700
(laughs softly)

857
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:41,616
You came.

858
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,208
Like you said...

859
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:50,379
I'm a fucking superhero.

860
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:55,388
- (grunting)
- Come on.

861
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:57,388
Hughie, check the doors.

862
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,220
(panting)

863
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,635
Is it working?

864
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,273
- No, no, no, um...
- Fuck.

865
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,650
Try this.

866
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,977
Yes.

867
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:10,711
- (shouts) Son of a...
- HUGHIE: Go, go, go.

868
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:14,235
- Go. Go, go, go.
- A-TRAIN: Holy shit.

869
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:18,868
Oh, shit. Go.

870
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:22,120
- Hughie, let's go.
- Go! I'll be okay. Go.

871
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,581
(heart beating)

872
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:30,514
A-TRAIN:
Homelander was right.

873
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:34,336
You are a fucking rat.

874
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:39,467
Oh, and you're the jailbreaker?

875
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:42,434
Are you fucking kidding me?

876
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:44,845
Turn around and walk away,
A-Train.

877
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,774
(laughs)

878
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:48,233
I got this. Go.

879
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:51,232
No. I'm the one he wants.

880
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,275
I'm not leaving you.

881
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,413
Please, just go.

882
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
(exhales)

883
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:30,768
(knuckles crack)

884
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,260
(grunts)

885
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,392
(groans)

886
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:09,435
Hughie!

887
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:13,228
You killed the only person
I've ever loved.

888
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:16,114
I didn't kill her.

889
00:53:16,152 --> 00:53:18,152
(labored breathing)

890
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,448
I know.

891
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,910
I did.

892
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,248
(heart beating)

893
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,955
But it was your fault.

894
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,215
(shouts)

895
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,005
(grunts)

896
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:46,055
(heart beating rapidly)

897
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:52,769
(grunts)

898
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,983
(heart stops)

899
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:57,614
(shouts)

900
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:01,909
Holy shit.

901
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:03,948
What? What?

902
00:54:05,368 --> 00:54:09,248
I-I think he's having
a heart attack.

903
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:12,878
(gasps, exhales)

904
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,591
Oh, fuck.

905
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,590
All right.

906
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:26,098
One, two, three.

907
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:28,098
Call an ambulance.

908
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,060
One...

909
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,271
He'll never stop coming for you.

910
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,441
I know.

911
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,150
This is Starlight.

912
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:44,065
I have a code 78-65.
A-Train is down.

913
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:46,905
I think he's had a heart attack.

914
00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:50,995
You have to go. I'll take over.

915
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,789
Hughie, go!

916
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:56,844
Or else you'll get caught.

917
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:09,972
(door opening)

918
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,979
(grunts)

919
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:24,695
(thunder rolls)

920
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:34,539
(whooshing)

921
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,252
(thudding)

922
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,379
Well, well, well.

923
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:44,132
About fucking time.

924
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:48,385
I know you can see
through the ceiling.

925
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:53,018
You try to kill me...

926
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:56,439
and my trigger finger goes soft.

927
00:55:56,479 --> 00:56:02,319
Now... why don't you stop
playing rapey Santa...

928
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,359
and come down and join us?

929
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:11,327
(shushing)

930
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,158
Take it easy.

931
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,334
We don't want
to upset Teddy, right?

932
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,332
MADELYN:
What are you doing?

933
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,044
Hey, look: Mommy.

934
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,035
You all right?

935
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:21,626
- No.
- Madelyn...

936
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:22,630
Take him upstairs.

937
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,631
All good. I got it.

938
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,763
I got it.

939
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:34,767
Billy Butcher.

940
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:37,849
You don't mind
if I call you Billy, right?

941
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,855
Y-You are
pretty darn impressive.

942
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:44,737
I mean, especially for,
you know, one of you.

943
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:48,527
See, even now, most people
standing where-where you are

944
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:51,122
would be pissing their pants
terrified, but you...

945
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:56,658
uh, sure, y-your heart's
pounding, but you're not afraid.

946
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,075
(Teddy crying)

947
00:56:58,124 --> 00:56:59,504
It's anger.

948
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:01,382
That's a new one for me.

949
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:05,298
Homelander, will you please
take the baby upstairs?

950
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:09,469
All because
of your lovely wife Becca.

951
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:10,890
Right?

952
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,098
Okay. Let's cut
the bullshit, huh?

953
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:15,139
You know that we, uh...

954
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:18,942
Uh, bro, not my fault, okay?

955
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:21,518
- She came on to me. It happens.
- Will you stop?

956
00:57:21,564 --> 00:57:23,333
HOMELANDER: You know, it's-it's the fame.
They get crushes.

957
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,897
There's nothing
I can do about it.

958
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:28,572
But what I will tell you is,
she was a hell of a lay.

959
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,162
(laughs):
Oh!

960
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:32,157
She came three times, eh?

961
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,739
Three times.

962
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,204
All right, little man,
have a little lie-down.

963
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:37,745
Good boy.

964
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,538
I want you to take him
out of here.

965
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,132
There you go.

966
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:42,917
(brushes hands)

967
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,550
(sighs)

968
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:47,668
But that's not really it.

969
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:49,675
No, no, no, no, no.

970
00:57:50,718 --> 00:57:53,348
No, it's more than just that.

971
00:57:55,848 --> 00:58:00,188
You think I'm responsible
for her death, don't you?

972
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:01,897
So now

973
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:07,227
you have a hostage
that-that I care about, right?

974
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:09,196
Someone I love.

975
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:13,866
So, what's your plan...
from here?

976
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:15,278
Uh, what do you want?

977
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,616
Do you want a confession, or...

978
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,751
What's your endgame?

979
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:29,009
I'm just gonna hurt you.

980
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:32,718
I mean really fucking hurt you,

981
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,930
and that will be
good enough for me.

982
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:39,100
So, y-you don't really want
anything, per se?

983
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:42,651
You just, you want to blow her
up in front of me.

984
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:44,356
Right?

985
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:48,066
(laughs):
Wow, fuck.

986
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,660
Uh...
(stammers)

987
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:56,116
You are dark,
and I kind of like it.

988
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:58,578
Will you please
take Teddy upstairs?

989
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:02,119
It's okay.
(shushing)

990
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:05,424
Just answer one question for me.

991
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,709
Just one.

992
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,763
How do you know?

993
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,220
How do you know?

994
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:17,049
I mean, you must have
some rock-solid proof, right?

995
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:21,056
That it was actually me
who killed your wife.

996
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,690
You must have that, right?
So what is it?

997
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:28,358
Share. We're all
very interested.

998
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:32,824
Now's not the time
to be strong and silent.

999
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,321
Go for it.

1000
00:59:34,363 --> 00:59:36,323
(Teddy crying)

1001
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:40,825
Are you telling me
that this whole thing

1002
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:45,249
i-is based on fucking feelings?

1003
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:47,041
- On a hunch?
- Will you please

1004
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,020
- take him upstairs?
- A little bit... Madelyn, hold on.

1005
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:51,804
- Take him upstairs!
- Shut the fuck up!

1006
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:58,218
Excuse me.

1007
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,641
You promised me no more lies.

1008
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:06,313
You fucking promised me.

1009
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:12,026
You and Vogelbaum should have
got your stories straight.

1010
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:14,027
They were so close.

1011
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:17,569
So fucking close, but there
was a few little details

1012
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,124
that were different.

1013
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:22,329
So I went back to Vogelbaum,

1014
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:25,909
and I managed to squeeze
the truth out of him.

1015
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:28,246
The real truth.

1016
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:34,918
Yes, that's it.

1017
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,393
(whispering indistinctly)

1018
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:44,558
I'm so sorry.

1019
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,560
I should never have lied to you.

1020
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:51,573
I know now that you don't need
to be protected.

1021
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,567
I'm so sorry.

1022
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:56,069
(crying): Will you please
take Teddy upstairs?

1023
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:59,741
(Homelander exhales)

1024
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:02,622
Did you ever really care
about me?

1025
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,289
You mean everything to me.

1026
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,288
No.

1027
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,620
No, no.

1028
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,674
I mean everything to your job.

1029
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,254
You care more
about that fucking baby

1030
01:01:14,296 --> 01:01:15,956
- than you do about me.
- No.

1031
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,966
I love you.

1032
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,338
I love you. I love you.
I swear I love you.

1033
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:22,926
But?

1034
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:27,271
Tell me the truth,
or I walk out right now.

1035
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:33,323
I'm scared.

1036
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,900
I'm scared of you.

1037
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,364
What?

1038
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:42,196
I said I'm scared.

1039
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:44,871
- Of?
- Of you.

1040
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,580
I'm scared of you.

1041
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:50,081
Thank you.

1042
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:54,503
Thank you
for finally being honest.

1043
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:06,143
(Homelander sighs deeply)

1044
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:19,315
(gasps)

1045
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:37,802
(sighing deeply)

1046
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,719
(sighs)

1047
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,761
Now...

1048
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:52,101
...what was that plan again?

1049
01:02:53,145 --> 01:02:55,475
Oh, well...

1050
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,526
(sprinkler whirring)

1051
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:22,051
Wakey, wakey.

1052
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,050
Hey, buddy.

1053
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:26,352
You were out for quite a while.

1054
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,306
You can thank me for, uh,
saving you sometime later,

1055
01:03:29,348 --> 01:03:31,598
but, for now,

1056
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:32,732
time to get up.

1057
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:34,478
Come on. You're gonna love this.

1058
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,520
- Come on.
- (door opens)

1059
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,107
Mom!

1060
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:45,162
Wow,
look at this handsome devil.

1061
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,737
Hey, pal.

1062
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:51,285
You know who I am?

1063
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,828
BOY:
Homelander.

1064
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,831
HOMELANDER (laughs):
Yeah, that's right, but...

1065
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:57,714
("Sleepwalk"
by The Shadows playing)

1066
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:59,711
...you know who else?

1067
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,513
No.

1068
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:09,596
Becca?

1069
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:11,678
- What?
- HOMELANDER: Huh.

1070
01:04:11,723 --> 01:04:13,733
Mommy didn't tell you.

1071
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,727
Well...

1072
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:23,235
I'm your father,

1073
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:28,157
and we are a family.

1074
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:30,827
(Homelander chuckles)
