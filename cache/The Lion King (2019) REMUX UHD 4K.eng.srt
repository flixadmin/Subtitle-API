1
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,474
From the day we arrive.

2
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,552
On the planet.

3
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,436
And blinking
Step into the sun.

4
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,669
There's more to see
than can ever be seen.

5
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,875
More to do
than can ever be done.

6
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,432
There's far too much
to take in here.

7
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,918
More to find
than can ever be found.

8
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,551
But the sun rolling high.

9
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,595
Through the sapphire sky.

10
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,436
Keeps great and small
on the endless round.

11
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,116
It's the circle of life.

12
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,869
And it moves us all.

13
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,716
Through despair and hope.

14
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,877
Through faith and love.

15
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,637
Till we find our place.

16
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,797
On the path unwinding.

17
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,594
In the circle.

18
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,877
The circle of life.

19
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,276
It's the circle of life.

20
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,757
And it moves us all.

21
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,878
Through despair and hope.

22
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,399
Through faith and love.

23
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,117
Till we find our place.

24
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,356
On the path unwinding.

25
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,871
In the circle.

26
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,269
The circle of life.

27
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,676
Life's not fair...

28
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,796
is it, my little friend?

29
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,712
While some are
born to feast...

30
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,598
others spend their lives
in the dark,

31
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,352
begging for scraps.

32
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,311
The way I see it...

33
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,594
you and I
are exactly the same.

34
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,590
We both want to
find a way out.

35
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,239
The king approaches!

36
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,839
This is not a drill.

37
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,638
His Majesty has requested
an audience.

38
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,270
Upon his entrance,
you will rise and genuflect.

39
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,873
Zazu...

40
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,876
you've made me lose my lunch.

41
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,276
You will answer to Mufasa

42
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,776
for missing the ceremony
this morning.

43
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,109
I answer to no one.

44
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,193
Scar? Scar. Scar.

45
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,396
No, no.
Don't look at me like that.

46
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,949
Are you hungry, Zazu?

47
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,917
Perhaps we could have
a bite together!

48
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
You can't eat me!

49
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,630
It is forbidden to eat
a member of the king's court!

50
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,154
Ow! No, please! Stop it!

51
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,197
Scar!

52
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,394
Well, look who's come down
to mingle with the commoners.

53
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,669
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

54
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,952
Was that today?

55
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,030
Must've slipped my mind.

56
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,872
Of course
I meant no disrespect

57
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,316
towards His Majesty or Sarabi.

58
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,635
As you know, I have tremendous
respect for the queen.

59
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,828
As the king's brother,

60
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,638
you should've been
first in line.

61
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,358
I was first in line.

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,718
Or don't you remember?

63
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,115
That is, until the precious
prince arrived.

64
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,312
Don't turn your back on me,
Scar.

65
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,708
Oh, no, Mufasa,

66
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,189
perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

67
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,829
Is that a challenge?

68
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,357
I wouldn't dream
of challenging you again.

69
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,349
A wise decision.

70
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,750
You are no match
for His Royalness.

71
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,157
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

72
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,918
But when it comes
to brute strength,

73
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,070
I'm afraid my big brother...

74
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,913
will always rule.

75
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,355
Not always, Scar.

76
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,791
One day,
it'll be my son who rules.

77
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,076
Simba will be your king.

78
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,269
Then long live the king.

79
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,714
- What am I gonna do with him?
- Oh, come on.

80
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,056
We both know he should've been

81
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,514
expelled from the Pride Lands
long ago.

82
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,592
He's my brother, Zazu.
This is his home.

83
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,389
As long as I am king,
that will never change.

84
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,232
Well, there's one
in every family, sire.

85
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,630
I had a cousin who thought
he was a woodpecker.

86
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,638
He slammed his head
into trees,

87
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,976
and our beaks
aren't built for it.

88
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,833
He was concussed regularly.
Oh, you've gone.

89
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,036
Uh, sire, coming back!

90
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,478
Simba.

91
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,276
Dad, you awake?

92
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,477
Dad, wake up!

93
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,639
Dad!

94
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,630
Dad, Dad, Dad!

95
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,519
Your son's awake.

96
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,830
Before sunrise, he's your son.

97
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,832
Come on, Dad, let's go.

98
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,592
You said I could
patrol with you today.

99
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
And today has started.

100
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,639
You promised!
You up?

101
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,668
Let's do this!

102
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,558
- Let's do this.
- So, what's first?

103
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,837
Give orders for the hunt?
Chase away evil intruders?

104
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,558
Dad! You're going
the wrong way!

105
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,794
Dad?

106
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,515
I'm not supposed
to go up here.

107
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,309
Look, Simba.

108
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,274
Everything the light touches
is our kingdom.

109
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,989
You rule all of that?

110
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,633
Yes.

111
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,189
But a king's time as ruler...

112
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,272
rises and falls like the sun.

113
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,032
One day, Simba...

114
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,192
the sun will set
on my time here...

115
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,954
and will rise with you
as the new king.

116
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,990
All of this will belong to me?

117
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,751
It belongs to no one,
but will be yours to protect.

118
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,876
A great responsibility.

119
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,351
Everything the light touches?

120
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,189
Those trees?
And the watering hole?

121
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,072
And that mountain?

122
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,549
And beyond those shadows?

123
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,711
You must not go there, Simba.

124
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,075
But I thought a king could do
whatever he wants.

125
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,508
Take any territory.

126
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,637
While others search
for what they can take...

127
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,633
a true king
searches for what he can give.

128
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,480
Everything you see
exists together

129
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,437
in a delicate balance.

130
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,917
As king, you need to
understand that balance...

131
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,196
and respect
all the creatures...

132
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,033
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

133
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,438
But, Dad,
don't we eat the antelope?

134
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,149
Yes, Simba.
But let me explain.

135
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,558
When we die,
our bodies become the grass...

136
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,632
and the antelope
eat the grass...

137
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,237
and so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

138
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,956
- Sire!
- Morning, Zazu.

139
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,599
Do you have
the morning report?

140
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,318
Yes, sire.

141
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,470
Ten flamingos
are taking a stand.

142
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,073
Two giraffe
were caught necking.

143
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,355
The buzz from the bees...

144
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,536
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

145
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,560
Ready for some fun?

146
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,480
The birds are tweeting
at 4:00 in the morning.

147
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,112
I'm like, "Birds, we get it."

148
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,793
Stay low to the ground.

149
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
I got this.

150
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,878
Check the wind,
the shadows...

151
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,875
and wait for
the perfect moment to pounce.

152
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,176
The cheetahs stole
the baboons' dinner,

153
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,416
and now the baboons
are going ape.

154
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,510
Of course, as I say,
cheetahs never prosper.

155
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,715
That's what I say.

156
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,936
Do you get...
I'll say it again.

157
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,552
Cheetahs never...

158
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,991
Come on! It's the news!

159
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,798
That's very good!

160
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,839
Sire!

161
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,631
Sire!
Hyenas in the Pride Lands.

162
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,795
They're on the hunt!

163
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,758
- Where's Sarabi?
- She's leading the charge.

164
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,239
Zazu, take Simba home.

165
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,072
Dad, let me come! I can help.

166
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,756
No, son.
You stay with the other cubs.

167
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,228
I am not a cub.

168
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,999
Come on.

169
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,873
Let's go home.

170
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,908
Here we are.

171
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,590
Now you go along
and play with the other cubs.

172
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,517
Great.

173
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,478
If you wish
to kill something...

174
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,636
you might want
to stay downwind.

175
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,831
I know how to hunt,
Uncle Scar.

176
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,072
Well, let's hope we're never
attacked by a beetle.

177
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,869
Go back to your den, Simba.
I don't babysit.

178
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,913
Babysit? I'm gonna be the king
of Pride Rock.

179
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,152
My dad showed me
the whole kingdom.

180
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,356
Said I'm going to rule it all.

181
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,112
Is that so?

182
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,315
Think about it.

183
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,438
When I'm king,
I'll have to give you orders.

184
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,352
Tell you what to do.

185
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,351
How weird is that?

186
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,556
You've no idea.

187
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,352
So, your dad showed you
the whole kingdom?

188
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,271
Did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders?

189
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,558
No. He said I can't go there.
Ever.

190
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,508
And he's absolutely right.

191
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,670
An elephant graveyard is
no place for a young prince.

192
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,549
An elephant graveyard? Whoa.

193
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,754
Oh, dear. I've said too much.

194
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,976
Though I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later...

195
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,719
you being king and all.

196
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,239
You've been there?

197
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,710
We've all been there.
And it's no place for a cub.

198
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,229
All those rotting bones...

199
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,472
and burning pools
of oozing mud.

200
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,830
Rotting bones?
Oozing mud?

201
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,276
Promise me
you'll stay away, Simba.

202
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,032
Now, you run along.

203
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,551
And remember...

204
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,914
it's our little secret...

205
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,198
Your Majesty.

206
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,751
Nala! Come on.
We have to go.

207
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,632
- Where?
- Watering hole.

208
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,836
Simba, she's having her bath.

209
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,831
And it's time for yours.

210
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,149
But, Mom...

211
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,159
I can do it myself.

212
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,548
Hold still.

213
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,398
You're messing up my mane!

214
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,437
Come on. Behind the ears.

215
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,358
Come on, Mom!

216
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,758
See? All clean. Can we go?

217
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,435
There's no hyenas.
You just chased them all off.

218
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,512
Just to the watering hole
and no further.

219
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,717
And stay downwind.

220
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,757
And one more little thing.

221
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,717
Zazu will be going with you.

222
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,915
Zazu?

223
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
Zazu goes...

224
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,678
or you don't.

225
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,958
Come along. Keep up.
Let's move in a unit.

226
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,599
Okay, buddy system.

227
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,438
So, where are we really going?

228
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
How did you know?

229
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
You hate the water.

230
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,110
I heard
about this place, Nala.

231
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,758
The most incredible,
amazing...

232
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,638
Just tell me where.

233
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,598
An elephant graveyard.

234
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,871
Whoa. How far is it?

235
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,871
Not far. Just to the shadows.

236
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,917
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

237
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,433
We've never been
that far before.

238
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,477
- What if we get lost?
- Relax, Nala.

239
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,110
I patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad.

240
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,713
There's nothing
to worry about.

241
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,757
Well, there is one thing.

242
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,400
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

243
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,471
Oh, wait, scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

244
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,512
How we getting rid
of the dodo?

245
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,318
Trust me, I got this.

246
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,833
Follow me to freedom.

247
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,117
Oh, how lovely it is...

248
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,477
to see the future king
with his future queen.

249
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,398
I could just molt.

250
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,192
What do you mean,
"future queen"?

251
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,193
Well, one day the two of you
will be betrothed.

252
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,158
Intended. Affianced.

253
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,394
Simba, you speak bird?

254
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,629
Married!

255
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,075
Come on.
One day you will be married.

256
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,999
To each other.

257
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,440
Mmm-mmm. That's not
gonna happen, Zazu.

258
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Never ever.

259
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,794
Nala and I are friends.

260
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,116
And besides,
she's afraid of rhinos!

261
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,376
And he's never eaten
an impala.

262
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,435
I've tried it once.

263
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,953
We are never
getting married, Zazu.

264
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,872
A monarch
who ignores tradition?

265
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,792
With an attitude like that,

266
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,155
I'm afraid you'll be
a pretty pathetic king.

267
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,709
Well, I'm not letting anyone
tell me where to go,

268
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
what to do...

269
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,154
and even who to marry.

270
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,151
There will never be a king
like me.

271
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,517
Simba, you can't escape
your destiny.

272
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,193
Just watch.

273
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,392
I'm gonna be a mighty king.

274
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,437
So enemies beware.

275
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,553
Well, I've
never seen a king of beasts.

276
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,596
With quite so little hair.

277
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,517
I'm gonna be the main event
Like no king was before.

278
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,520
I'm brushing up
on looking down.

279
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,318
Working on my roar.

280
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,836
Thus far
a rather uninspiring thing.

281
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,755
Oh, I just can't wait
to be king.

282
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,036
You have rather a long way
to go, young master.

283
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,315
If you think...

284
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,680
No one saying "do this".

285
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,080
Now, when I said that...

286
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,479
No one saying "be there".

287
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,640
What I meant was...

288
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,671
No one saying
"stop that".

289
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,353
No one saying "see here".

290
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,709
Now see here!

291
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,872
Free to run around
all day.

292
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,439
Well,
that's definitely out.

293
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,036
Free to do it all my way.

294
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,194
I think it's time
that you and I.

295
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,077
Arranged a heart-to-heart.

296
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,431
Kings don't need advice.

297
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,080
From little hornbills
for a start.

298
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,912
If this is where the monarchy
is headed, count me out.

299
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,509
Out of service
Out of Africa

300
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,870
I wouldn't hang about.

301
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,676
This child is getting
wildly out of wing.

302
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Simba!

303
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,953
Oh, I just can't wait
to be king.

304
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,028
Simba!

305
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,919
I can't see you, Simba.

306
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,838
You must be in my sight
at all times.

307
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,228
I've lost him!

308
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,189
I know what you're doing!

309
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,032
Where are you going, Simba?

310
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,633
Come on!

311
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,836
You can't hide from me, Simba.

312
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,639
It is my sworn duty
to keep you safe.

313
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,274
You listen to me right now.

314
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,336
I'm sorry to flutter about
in your face,

315
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,395
have you seen...

316
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,715
He's a little lion.

317
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,838
He's small,
but he's cute.

318
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,790
Everybody look left.

319
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,110
Everybody look right.

320
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,597
Everywhere you look I'm.

321
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,512
Standing in the spotlight.

322
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Not yet.

323
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,275
Let every creature go
for broke and sing.

324
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,478
Let's hear it in the herd
and on the wing

325
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,600
I see you down there!
I see you down there!

326
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,110
It's gonna be King Simba's
finest fling.

327
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,152
Oh, I just can't wait
to be king.

328
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,275
Simba!

329
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,433
He just can't wait to be king.

330
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,672
Oh, I just can't wait.

331
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,274
Just can't wait.

332
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,951
To be king

333
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,829
I've lost him!

334
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,911
Mufasa's gon na have
my feathers.

335
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,752
This is not good!

336
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,638
Simba, we really lost him.

337
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,153
I know what you're thinking.

338
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,594
"The future king is a genius."

339
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,034
You can't be serious.

340
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,509
You would've never gotten away
without your queen.

341
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,033
Aren't you
forgetting something?

342
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,838
There is no queen.

343
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You could say that again.

344
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,513
I'd rather marry an aardvark.

345
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,392
Good luck finding one
that will say yes.

346
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,256
Good luck getting out of here
without a bruising.

347
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,111
Give it your best shot.

348
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Pinned ya!

349
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,552
You owe me an apology.

350
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,994
Never!

351
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,038
Pinned ya.
Again.

352
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,434
Nala, stop!

353
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
What is that?

354
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,278
You're not gonna trick me,
Simba.

355
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,635
I know that there's nothing...

356
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,872
This must be it.

357
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,308
Come on!

358
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,236
Simba, we're way
beyond the Pride Lands.

359
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,709
We found it, Nala.
You know what this means?

360
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,279
It means we can go home.

361
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,591
It means they won't
treat us like cubs anymore.

362
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,029
Simba, get down!
It could be dangerous.

363
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,519
Danger?

364
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,876
I laugh in the face of danger.

365
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,109
Cool!

366
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,668
You hear that, Nala?

367
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,798
Simba, come on!

368
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,598
You've proved
how brave you are.

369
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,875
Now the sun is going down,

370
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,916
I'm not just
gonna sit here and...

371
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,070
Well, look at this.

372
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,230
We weren't
expecting guests today.

373
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,755
Would you two cubs...

374
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,879
like to stay for dinner?

375
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,917
Yeah, stay for dinner.

376
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,355
'Cause you look
like a midnight snack!

377
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,216
Can you just give me
a little bit of space?

378
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,275
I'm helping.

379
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,913
We have talked
about this before.

380
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,195
I come in alone.

381
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,630
I'm the lead distraction
so everyone can circle.

382
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,995
Okay, okay. Sorry.

383
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,792
Don't be sorry.
Just do it.

384
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,191
Now, this is a meal
I've waited my whole life for.

385
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,955
What an unexpected treat,
to eat the son of a king.

386
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,680
Wait a second, the king?
As in you-know-who?

387
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,199
Who rules you-know-where?

388
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,874
Mufasa does not rule me!

389
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,909
You can't do anything to me!

390
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,911
'Cause I'm the future king!

391
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,558
He's telling me what to do.

392
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,234
His father's strength
flickering inside.

393
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,640
I wonder...

394
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,356
how all that bravery
will taste.

395
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,435
Let them go, Shenzi!

396
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,034
They made a mistake,
a horrible mistake!

397
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,153
But if you do this, you will
start a war with Mufasa!

398
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,992
Hyenas and lions
have been at war

399
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,798
since the beginning of time.

400
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,231
But Mufasa's bloodline
will end here!

401
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,719
Run!

402
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,751
Don't let them get away!

403
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Come on!

404
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,473
Did you hear that?

405
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,119
The future king!

406
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,753
Oh, don't hurt me!

407
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,512
Do it again!

408
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,240
If you ever come
near my son again...

409
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,392
No, Mufasa. Never.

410
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,229
Never again.

411
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,068
You've been warned, Shenzi.

412
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,674
I thought
you were very brave.

413
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,309
Zazu?

414
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,516
Take Nala back to Pride Rock.

415
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,512
Yes, sire.

416
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,671
Don't be too hard
on him, sire.

417
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,150
I remember a cub,
a certain headstrong cub...

418
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,197
who was always getting
into scrapes.

419
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,999
And he achieved
some prominence,

420
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,115
did he not, sire?

421
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,194
I have to teach my son
a lesson.

422
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,711
Nala, come along.

423
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,751
Simba?

424
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,512
You deliberately disobeyed me.

425
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,795
I know.

426
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,718
You could
have been killed.

427
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,629
And what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

428
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,229
Do you understand
what's at stake?

429
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,829
You jeopardized
the future of our pride.

430
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,072
I just wanted to show you
I could do it.

431
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,196
That I could be brave
like you.

432
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,555
I'm only brave
when I have to be,

433
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,551
when there's no other choice.

434
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,075
But you're not scared
of anything.

435
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,079
I was today.

436
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
You were?

437
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,433
Yes. I thought
I might lose you.

438
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,232
I guess
even kings get scared, huh?

439
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,830
More than you could ever know.

440
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,837
- But guess what?
- What?

441
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,669
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

442
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,758
That's 'cause nobody messes
with your dad.

443
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,069
Come here.

444
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,075
- Dad?
- Uh-huh?

445
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,879
- We're pals, right?
- Right.

446
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,316
And we'll always
be together...

447
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,993
right?

448
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,830
Simba, let me tell you
something my father told me.

449
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,911
Look at the stars.

450
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,509
The great kings of the past...

451
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,672
look down on us
from those stars.

452
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,110
- Really?
- Yes.

453
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,589
So whenever you feel alone...

454
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,553
just remember
that those kings...

455
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,479
will always be up there
to guide you.

456
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,231
And so will I.

457
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,511
But I can't see them, Dad.

458
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,836
Keep looking, son.

459
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,718
Keep looking.

460
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,837
Mufasa is strong.

461
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,911
Like, way stronger than us.

462
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,638
- Please give me some space.
- What?

463
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,518
You could lay anywhere
in this cave.

464
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,936
- Where do you want me to...
- I need some personal space.

465
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,712
- Okay?
- Okay.

466
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Not to take anything away
from you. You were great.

467
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,959
But he is...

468
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,856
See, now I know you're
doing this on purpose.

469
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,348
Very brave, too.
Tough, good energy.

470
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,536
Now you're just
being spiteful.

471
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Good posture.

472
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,834
Next time I see Mufasa...

473
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,600
I'm gonna teach him a lesson
he will never forget.

474
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,910
Well, you're in luck!
He's right behind ya.

475
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,513
Mufasa?

476
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,476
That's not the king.

477
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,750
You fools have stripped your
land of every living thing.

478
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,912
And yet I send
two little cubs your way...

479
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,593
and they come back alive.

480
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,514
I guess
we'll have to eat you instead.

481
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,237
Why eat one meal...

482
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,551
when you can be feasting
the rest of your lives?

483
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,072
What could you possibly
offer us?

484
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,879
A place where you can fill
your bellies.

485
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,871
Where everything
the light touches

486
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,030
is yours for the kill.

487
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,270
The Pride Lands
are not yours to give.

488
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,829
The king controls
those hunting grounds.

489
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,668
That's why
we're going to kill him.

490
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,560
Mufasa has always shown
too much restraint...

491
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,836
when it comes to hunting.

492
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,556
When I am king...

493
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,870
the mighty will be free to
take whatever they want.

494
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,712
Because a hyena's belly
is never full.

495
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,874
Mufasa's far too powerful
to challenge.

496
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,032
Mufasa is yesterday's message.

497
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,110
A clapped-out,
distracted regime.

498
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,993
Whose failings
undoubtedly presage.

499
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,078
The need for a dif'rent dream.

500
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,197
Yes, leonine times
are a-changing.

501
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,431
Which means
that hyenas must too.

502
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,399
My vision is clear
and wide-ranging.

503
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,399
And even encompasses you.

504
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,190
So prepare
for the coup of the century.

505
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,232
Prepare for the murkiest scam.

506
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,037
Meticulous planning.

507
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,111
Tenacity spanning.

508
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,795
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll.

509
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,151
Be king
Undisputed.

510
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,231
Respected
Saluted.

511
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,437
And seen for the wonder I am.

512
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,919
Yes, my teeth
and ambitions are bared.

513
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,957
Be prepared.

514
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,595
- Be prepared.
- Be prepared.

515
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,398
Be prepared
Be prepared.

516
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,596
- Be prepared.
- Be prepared.

517
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,398
Be prepared
Be prepared.

518
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,348
Be prepared.

519
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,636
Be prepared.

520
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,719
Yes, our teeth and ambitions
are bared.

521
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,270
Be prepared.

522
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,110
My dad was pretty upset
with me.

523
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,350
That's why we're here, Simba.

524
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,398
I think I know a way for you
to make it up to him.

525
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,950
A gift that will make him
forget it ever happened.

526
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,998
But he's the king.
What could I give him?

527
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,718
Your roar.

528
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,880
My roar?

529
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,393
Yes!

530
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,998
Did you hear that?

531
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,990
This gorge is where all lions
come to find their roar.

532
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
All lions?

533
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,954
Even my dad?

534
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,312
Even Mufasa came here
when he was your age.

535
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,879
Refused to leave...

536
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,919
until his roar could be heard
above the rim.

537
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,159
All the way up there?

538
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,197
That's when you know
you've found it.

539
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,112
With a little practice...

540
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,113
you'll never be called
a cub again.

541
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,438
Watch this.

542
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,556
You'll get it, Simba.

543
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,915
Just takes time.

544
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,752
I'll check on you later.

545
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,280
Dad will be so proud,
won't he?

546
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,079
It's a gift
he'll never forget.

547
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,992
Mufasa! Quick!

548
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,832
Stampede in the gorge!

549
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,189
Simba's down there!

550
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,588
Simba?

551
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,793
I'll find him.

552
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Zazu!

553
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,794
Hold on!
Help is coming!

554
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,275
There he is!
On that tree!

555
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,155
I'm coming, Simba!
Hold on!

556
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,234
I'll help them, Zazu!
You get the pride!

557
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,628
Go!

558
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,435
Dad!

559
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,435
Simba!

560
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,918
Come to me, son.

561
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,554
Jump!

562
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,195
Dad!

563
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,788
Scar!

564
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,959
Help me.

565
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,270
Long live the king!

566
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,235
No!

567
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,949
Dad?

568
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,919
Dad?

569
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,479
Dad?

570
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,033
Dad?

571
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,750
Come on, wake up.

572
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,357
Help! Somebody help!

573
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,232
Simba!

574
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,910
What have you done?

575
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,677
It was a stampede.

576
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,239
He tried to save me.

577
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,595
It was an accident.

578
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,673
- I didn't mean for it to...
- Of course you didn't.

579
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,276
No one ever means
for these things to happen.

580
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,158
But the king is dead...

581
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,958
and if it weren't for you...

582
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,835
he'd still be alive.

583
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,753
Your father had such hopes
for you...

584
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,071
gave you so many chances.

585
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,196
And this is how you repay him.

586
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,479
I didn't know.
I didn't know.

587
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,517
Oh, what will
your mother think?

588
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,036
A son who causes
his father's death.

589
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,796
A boy who kills a king.

590
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,790
What am I gonna do?

591
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,148
Run.

592
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,513
Run away, Simba.

593
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,390
Run away and never return!

594
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,750
Kill him.

595
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,472
Go down
and make sure he's dead.

596
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,633
Seriously?

597
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,472
Oh, I'm sorry.

598
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,360
That's a good distance
right there.

599
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,435
Okay.

600
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,160
No little cub
could survive that fall.

601
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,273
Listen,
we're gonna tell her...

602
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,398
we went down there
and we ate him.

603
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,311
Uh-huh. That's perfect,
'cause I am starving!

604
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,038
We're not gonna eat him.

605
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,349
Simba is dead.

606
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,954
That's all she ever
has to know.

607
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,199
Works for me.

608
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,509
Mufasa's death
is a terrible tragedy.

609
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,678
The greatest leader
the pride has ever known.

610
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,351
To lose a brother...

611
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,470
such a deep, personal loss.

612
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,194
And little Simba,
who had barely begun to live.

613
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,909
A cub whose blood
held our future.

614
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,231
It's almost too much
to endure.

615
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,397
I only wish I had gotten
to the gorge in time...

616
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,597
been there to save them.

617
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,231
And so it is
with a heavy heart...

618
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,030
that I must assume the throne.

619
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,319
Mufasa and Simba are gone...

620
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,393
which means I am your king.

621
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,319
But I must admit...

622
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,233
I cannot bear
this burden alone.

623
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,875
And I will need some help...

624
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,071
to ensure

625
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,196
the safety of the pride.

626
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,717
Nala, stay close.

627
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,039
And so, from the ashes
of this tragedy...

628
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,398
we shall welcome
the dawning of a new era.

629
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,159
A great...

630
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,237
and glorious future!

631
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,551
Oh, dear.

632
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,114
I missed 'em!

633
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,000
I'm gonna get one of
those vultures one day.

634
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,160
I'm gonna get one!

635
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,880
I don't know why it's
so important to you.

636
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,230
I just feel like it would
make me feel better.

637
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,390
Oh, no.
It's a little lion!

638
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,560
- That is not a lion.
- Well then, go check it out.

639
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,696
- What is it?
- That is not a lion,

640
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,755
it's a furry bird!

641
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,068
It looks like a lion!

642
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,959
That's not a lion. Let me get
a closer look. Excuse me.

643
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,634
All right, let me see
what we're dealing with here.

644
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,800
It's a lion!

645
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,456
- Run for your life, Pumbaa!
- Wait! Hey, Timon.

646
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,199
- Wait, Timon, wait!
- It's a little lion!

647
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,554
It gets bigger.

648
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,557
Can we keep him?
Can we please keep him?

649
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,640
Oh, oh, okay. I promise
I'll walk him every day!

650
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,216
If he makes a little mess,
I'll clean it up.

651
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,309
You'll be his little mess!

652
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,640
He's gonna eat you and then
use my body as a toothpick!

653
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,676
But one day,
when he's big and strong,

654
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,988
he'll be on our side!

655
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,515
I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

656
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,874
Hear me out!

657
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,033
Having a ferocious lion around
might not be such a bad idea!

658
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,514
Well then, can we keep him?

659
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,908
Yes, of course
we can keep him!

660
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,640
My God, who is the brains
of this operation?

661
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,597
We're gonna name him Fred!

662
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,512
Who are you?

663
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,776
Uh, we're the guys
who saved your life.

664
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,800
Yes.

665
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,115
Risked everything.
Fought off angry vultures!

666
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,918
Hordes of them. Flocks.

667
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,399
I'm Pumbaa.

668
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,834
- This is Timon.
- Did I mention

669
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,148
that we saved your life?

670
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,356
It doesn't matter.

671
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,390
Whoa. How bleak is that?

672
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,616
It doesn't even matter?

673
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,790
Like I don't have enough
that I'm dealing with, right?

674
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,359
Now his problems
are my problems?

675
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,640
But we can help him. We're
in a position to help him.

676
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,714
So, how are you,
in as few words as possible?

677
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,071
I did something terrible.

678
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,077
I don't wanna talk about it.

679
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,874
Look, kid,
we've all made mistakes.

680
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,679
Uh, there must be something
we can do, right?

681
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,831
Not unless you can change
the past.

682
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,416
Well, you know,
that's a lot to ask...

683
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,536
That's pretty hard.
That's a biggie.

684
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,616
...if I'm being honest.

685
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,336
I mean, change the past?
It already happened.

686
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,032
Yeah, so you can't
change that.

687
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,480
But you know
what you can change?

688
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,516
The future.
That's our specialty.

689
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,033
Kind of our thing.

690
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,634
How can you change something
that hasn't happened?

691
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,870
Well, to change the future,

692
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,393
you gotta put your past
behind you.

693
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,600
Way behind.

694
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,955
Look, kid, bad things happen

695
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,190
and you can't do anything
about it, right?

696
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,280
Right.

697
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,000
Wrong! When the world
turns its back on you...

698
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,957
you turn your back
on the world!

699
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,357
And only embrace what's next!

700
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,397
And turn the "what"
into "so what?"

701
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,676
Well, that's not
what I was taught.

702
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,717
Well, then maybe
you need a new lesson.

703
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,351
Repeat after me, kid.
Hakuna matata.

704
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,871
- What?
- Hakuna matata.

705
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,393
Hakuna matata.

706
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,656
Most people
get a bigger reaction

707
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,795
when we say it the first...

708
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,359
Okay, well anyway.
Hakuna matata.

709
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,976
Some people
start clapping immediately.

710
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,230
It means "no worries."
One and a...

711
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,436
I do the counting here.

712
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,480
- I wanna count!
- Why don't we count together?

713
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,096
- Okay, that's a good idea.
- All right.

714
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,519
One and a two and a...

715
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,678
Hakuna matata.

716
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,989
What a wonderful phrase.

717
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,551
Hakuna matata.

718
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,556
It ain't no passing craze.

719
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,670
It means no worries
For the rest of your days.

720
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,875
It's our problem-free.

721
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,836
Philosophy.

722
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,192
Hakuna matata.

723
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,073
- Hakuna matata?
- Yeah, it's our motto.

724
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,753
What's a motto?

725
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,296
Nothin'.
What's-a-motto with you?

726
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,435
- Nice.
- Boom!

727
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,029
Those two words
will solve all your problems.

728
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,634
Yeah. Take Pumbaa here.

729
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,549
Why,
when he was a young warthog.

730
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,917
When I was a young warthog.

731
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,750
- How are you feeling?
- It's an emotional story.

732
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,559
He found his aroma
lacked a certain appeal.

733
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,598
He could clear the savannah
after every meal

734
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,796
I'm a sensitive soul.

735
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,395
Although I seem thick-skinned.

736
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,349
And it hurt that my friends
never stood downwind

737
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,795
I was always here for you
and I resent that.

738
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,428
- And, oh, the shame.
- Yes, he was ashamed

739
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,158
I thought of changing my name

740
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,833
I mean, to what, "Brad"?

741
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,719
And I got downhearted.

742
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,634
Ev'ry time that I farted.

743
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,074
Are you gonna stop me?

744
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,118
No, I'm not! You disgust me!

745
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,952
Hakuna matata.

746
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,354
What a wonderful phrase.

747
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,678
Hakuna matata.

748
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,595
Ain't no passing craze.

749
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,991
It means no worries
For the rest of your days.

750
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,388
Yeah, sing it, kid.

751
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,632
It's our problem-free.

752
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,029
Philosophy.

753
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,077
Hakuna matata.

754
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,951
Welcome to
our humble home.

755
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,348
You live here?

756
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,976
Well, we live
wherever we want.

757
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,274
We do as we please.

758
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,509
It's beautiful.

759
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,671
Yeah,
it's really nice, huh?

760
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,113
Everyone, this is Simba.

761
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,197
That, my friend, is a lion.

762
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,515
What about food?

763
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,856
Have you thought
about feeding that thing?

764
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,394
Yeah, I'm starved!
I could eat a whole zebra.

765
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,549
Here we go.

766
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,513
Uh, no, no, no, kid,
we're fresh out of zebra.

767
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,829
Any antelope?

768
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,752
No, listen, kid...

769
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,036
if you want to live with us,
you have to eat like us.

770
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,078
And most importantly,
not eat us!

771
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,632
This looks like a good
spot to rustle up some grub!

772
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,680
- Yeah!
- It's perfect!

773
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,080
Step aside, fellas!

774
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,513
Ugh. What's that?

775
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,840
Ooh. Too chewy.

776
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,319
This one's got some nuttiness!

777
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,960
Mmm. Now that's what
I call umami!

778
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,508
Slimy, yet satisfying.

779
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,640
Mmm. Extra crunchy.

780
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,200
- They're local.
- Yeah. Oh, are they?

781
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,435
They're from right there.

782
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,830
I'm telling ya, kid,
this is the great life.

783
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
No rules.

784
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,037
No responsibilities.

785
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,759
The little cream-filled kind.

786
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,989
I love these!

787
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,216
- Those are good.
- I love these.

788
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,240
Those are the best.

789
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,376
Can I have the head?

790
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,400
Well, kid?

791
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,993
Oh, well.

792
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,798
Hakuna matata.

793
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,598
Slimy...

794
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,159
yet satisfying.

795
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,912
- That's it!
- We didn't lie!

796
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,719
Egg sac!
I got an egg sac!

797
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,016
Hakuna matata.

798
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,234
Hakuna matata.

799
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,758
Hakuna matata
Hakuna matata.

800
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,353
Hakuna matata.

801
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,909
It means no worries
For the rest of your days.

802
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,992
It's our problem-free.

803
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,555
Philosophy.

804
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,678
- Hakuna matata, oh.
- Hakuna matata, hakuna matata.

805
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,308
- Hakuna matata, yeah.
- Hakuna matata, hakuna matata.

806
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,677
- Hakuna matata.
- Hakuna matata, hakuna matata.

807
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,036
Hakuna matata
Hakuna matata.

808
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,236
- It means no worries.
- Hakuna matata.

809
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,914
- For the rest of your days.
- Hakuna matata, hakuna matata.

810
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,035
Hakuna.

811
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,873
It's our problem-free.

812
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,190
Philosophy.

813
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,830
Hakuna matata.

814
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
One more time.

815
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,256
Oh, no,
I think we did it. Yeah.

816
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,376
I think we got this one.

817
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,496
But we're just getting
in the groove, guys.

818
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,656
No, let's leave 'em
wanting more.

819
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,376
Yeah, you've grown
400 pounds since we started.

820
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,038
Meanwhile I look
exactly the same.

821
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,416
It means no worries.

822
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,536
Will you tell him
to stop?

823
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,656
But you insisted
we sing the song.

824
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,816
I insisted?
You started singing it!

825
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,896
Well,
it's our signature song...

826
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,056
we shouldn't be sharing it
with everyone.

827
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,136
Look at that sunset.

828
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,296
But it's our signature
song, so we have to.

829
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,356
Look, just tell him to stop.

830
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,033
It means no worries.

831
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,296
Oh, now he's riffing,
Pumbaa.

832
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,355
This is a nightmare.

833
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,400
It actually is
becoming better and better.

834
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,153
Nala.

835
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:18,920
Come.

836
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,639
Sit with us.

837
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,269
Zazu, where have you been?

838
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:36,116
I'm sorry, Nala.
I came as soon as I could.

839
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,272
The morning report, Zazu.

840
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,672
Your Majesty, the Pride Lands
are in imminent danger.

841
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,798
The hyenas are chasing off
the last of the herds.

842
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,029
The bird's back!

843
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,113
Get him!

844
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,157
Don't come here again,
unless you want to be eaten!

845
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,512
We have to do something,
Sarabi. We have to fight!

846
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,269
Nala. Scar is the king.

847
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,072
But you are our queen!

848
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,350
We should leave
before it's too late!

849
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,638
We must all stay together
and protect the Pride Lands.

850
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,349
This is our home.
We must never abandon it.

851
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,511
This isn't the home
I remember.

852
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:47,399
Our time will come, Nala.

853
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,788
Be patient.

854
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,359
Sarabi.

855
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,877
The king wishes to see you.

856
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,312
Don't go.

857
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,949
I'm not afraid of him.

858
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,475
Won't you join me, Sarabi?

859
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,517
There's plenty to go around.

860
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,552
You're overhunting, Scar.

861
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,756
I've simply perfected
the kill.

862
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,193
With the help of my army.

863
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,510
You're killing everything.

864
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,157
Don't you see? There is nobody
to challenge me.

865
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,709
We can finally take
whatever we want.

866
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,753
We?

867
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,549
Long ago
you chose Mufasa over me.

868
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,676
But now there is a new king.

869
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,316
So stop being so selfish.

870
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,512
You are the selfish one.

871
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,636
The other lions look to you.

872
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,712
As long as you resist
they will reject me.

873
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:58,116
Take your place by my side,
and we will feast together.

874
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,598
I will never be your queen!

875
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,032
Then from now on...

876
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,318
the lions will eat
after the hyenas.

877
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,154
And they don't
leave much behind.

878
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,176
Just what do you think

879
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,156
you are doing, young lady?

880
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,719
Go away, Zazu.

881
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,598
I'm going to find help.

882
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,512
I will very much not go away.

883
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:54,116
I am sworn to protect you and
must order you back to bed.

884
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,959
I don't need
protecting anymore.

885
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:50,033
Uh, Scar!
Uh, wonderful to see you.

886
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,191
Sorry to drop in like this!

887
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,633
Have I ever told you
about my brother

888
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,836
who thought he was
a woodpecker?

889
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,072
Nala...

890
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,560
Oh, I'm gonna get ya!

891
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,358
I'm gonna get ya!
Oh, I got ya!

892
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,997
Simba! It's you!

893
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,433
Did you see that?

894
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,920
Man, that butterfly
was right there!

895
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,195
I almost had him.

896
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,834
I thought it was a lion.

897
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,640
You know,
the other kind of lion.

898
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,039
You know, a real lion?

899
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,792
I mean, not that
you're not a real lion.

900
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,711
But you know,
the kind that eats...

901
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,074
I'm gonna go.

902
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,638
Hey, where you going?

903
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,995
You wanna get some grubs?

904
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,552
What's up with that guy?

905
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,640
Um, Simba...

906
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,112
How can I say this?

907
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,032
- He's prey.
- Yeah.

908
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:18,273
And he is never gonna want to
frolic with a carnivore.

909
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,396
No. You two will never frolic.

910
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,232
Why not?

911
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:26,632
You see, in nature
there's a delicate balance.

912
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,677
Oh, yeah. The circle of life.
I know that.

913
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,432
- No.
- No, no, no.

914
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,656
I don't know where
you're getting "circle" from.

915
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,680
No, yeah.

916
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,800
There's no circle of life.

917
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,976
- No, it's no circle.
- No, not at all.

918
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,150
- In fact, it's the opposite.
- Yeah.

919
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,480
- It's a line.
- Yeah.

920
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,108
It's a meaningless line
of indifference.

921
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,709
And we're all just running
towards the end of the line.

922
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,156
And then one day we'll reach
the end, and that'll be it.

923
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,536
- That's it.
- Line over!

924
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,312
- Nothing.
- Nada.

925
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,720
And you can really
just kinda...

926
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,518
do your own thing
and fend for yourself...

927
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,616
'cause your line doesn't
affect anyone else's lines.

928
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,835
You're alive and then
you're not. Like this guy.

929
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,078
You sure it's not a circle?

930
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,238
That we're all connected?

931
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,630
A circle would mean
we're all this.

932
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,115
That would mean
what I do affects him...

933
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,800
affects that thing,
affects that thing.

934
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,440
Yeah. No.
That's not how it goes.

935
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,118
Which would make
doing whatever we wanted

936
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,394
not that cool.

937
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,033
Let me simplify this for you.

938
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,918
- Life is meaningless.
- Yes.

939
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,960
That's why you just gotta
look out for yourself.

940
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,479
That's why you do you, Simba.

941
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,835
Yeah, Simba,
for the first time...

942
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,309
we're entrusting you to
make a plan for us today.

943
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,074
This is important. Think about
all you've been taught.

944
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,236
What do you wanna do?

945
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,078
Absolutely nothing.

946
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,238
- Whoo-hoo!
- Exactly! He gets it!

947
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,072
Jackpot!

948
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,296
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

949
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,959
- Crunchy!
- All right! Time to eat!

950
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,750
Hello!

951
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,751
Nice one, Simba.

952
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,559
Oh, thanks.
Must've been the termites.

953
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,551
Or the crickets.

954
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,679
And you wonder why I prefer
to sleep underground.

955
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,157
Hey, Timon.

956
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,548
Do you ever look up there

957
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,949
and wonder
what those sparkly dots are?

958
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:19,835
Oh, Pumbaa.
I don't wonder. I know.

959
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,031
Really? What are they?

960
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,918
They're fireflies.

961
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,073
Fireflies that got stuck on
that big, bluish-black thing.

962
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,588
I guess that makes sense.

963
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,756
I always thought
they were balls of gas

964
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,910
burning
billions of miles away.

965
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,389
Oh, Pumbaa, why is everything
always gas with you?

966
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,999
I know.

967
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,992
- What do you think, Simba?
- Yeah.

968
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,390
Oh, I don't know.

969
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,471
But somebody once told me...

970
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,835
the great kings of the past
are up there...

971
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,037
and they're all
watching over us.

972
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,995
That's a good one!
That's insane!

973
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,991
That's insane!

974
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,151
Royal dead guys
watching over us!

975
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,276
Well, I hope they don't
fall out of the sky!

976
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,000
Hang on, Your Majesty!
Don't let go!

977
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,479
Oh, that would be a mess.

978
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,709
Oh, man!

979
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,936
I mean, Simba,
think about it.

980
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,269
Why would a bunch of kings
be looking out for us?

981
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,431
- We're outcasts.
- Royal warthogs!

982
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,154
- I can't! I can't!
- I can't! I actually can't.

983
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,949
- I can't.
- No, you can. I can't.

984
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,073
Yeah. Yeah.

985
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,271
Yeah.

986
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,953
That's stupid.

987
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,159
I'm gonna go get some grubs
or something.

988
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,674
- What did you say to him?
- I don't know.

989
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,108
As you were saying it,

990
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,553
I thought,
"This won't end well."

991
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,995
- You just start laughing.
- You laughed too.

992
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,550
I did not. I would never.

993
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,671
Man, I blew it.

994
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:04,872
Simba.

995
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:13,755
Simba is alive!

996
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,350
A-weema-weh
A-weema-weh.

997
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,514
A-weema-weh
A-weema-weh.

998
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:50,831
Wee.

999
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,077
Uh wee bum bum buh-weh.

1000
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:57,835
Wee.

1001
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,151
Uh wee bum bum buh-weh.

1002
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,676
In the jungle,
the mighty jungle.

1003
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,116
The lion sleeps tonight.

1004
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,511
In the jungle,
the quiet jungle.

1005
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:15,036
The lion sleeps tonight.

1006
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,512
Wee.

1007
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,478
Uh wee bum bum buh-weh.

1008
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:25,630
Wee.

1009
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,519
Uh wee bum bum buh-weh.

1010
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,954
Near the village,
the peaceful village.

1011
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,068
The lion sleeps tonight.

1012
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,476
Near the village,
the quiet village.

1013
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:42,552
The lion sleeps tonight.

1014
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,396
Wee.

1015
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,677
Uh wee bum bum buh-weh.

1016
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,516
Wee.

1017
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Pumbaa!

1018
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,516
Run for your life!

1019
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,235
Run, Pumbaa, run!

1020
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,840
Timon, help!

1021
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,599
Pumbaa!

1022
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,549
Pumbaa?

1023
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,718
I'm gonna die!

1024
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,472
I'm coming, Pumbaa!
Hang in there!

1025
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,237
Move! Move! Move!

1026
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,040
No!

1027
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,479
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1028
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
No!

1029
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,600
Nala?

1030
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,111
Simba?

1031
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,472
Is that really you?

1032
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:07,834
Yeah.

1033
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,831
It's me, Simba!

1034
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,216
Nala, what're you doing?
Oh, my...

1035
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,240
I don't believe it!

1036
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,719
Look at you!

1037
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,800
Pumbaa...

1038
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,518
I don't think
you're getting eaten.

1039
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,558
Oh, where have you been?

1040
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,153
I thought you were dead!

1041
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,198
You thought he was
dead. I thought I was dead!

1042
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,391
I thought
you were gonna eat me.

1043
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,516
What fun!

1044
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,557
I'm so sorry,
before we move on,

1045
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,840
how do you two
know each other?

1046
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,075
Timon, Pumbaa...

1047
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,151
I want you to meet
my best friend, Nala.

1048
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,629
Best friend? Well, that hurts.

1049
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,399
Nala, you're gonna
love it here!

1050
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,560
This place is amazing.

1051
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,232
It's everything
you could ever want.

1052
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:45,597
Simba, we need to leave.

1053
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,758
Scar has taken over
with the hyenas.

1054
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,953
You have to take your place
as king.

1055
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,394
King? Simba?

1056
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,069
We kneel before you
as loyal servants.

1057
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,196
Pumbaa, relax.
She's wrong.

1058
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,760
Lady, you've got
your lions crossed.

1059
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,800
Nice.

1060
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,438
Seeing you again,

1061
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,397
you don't know what this will
mean to everyone.

1062
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,630
What this means to me.

1063
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,871
You have to come home.

1064
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,071
This is my home.

1065
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,159
Please stay.

1066
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,799
This place is incredible.

1067
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,598
I know you'll love it.

1068
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,159
I can't.

1069
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,594
Come on!

1070
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,557
At least
let me show you around.

1071
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,711
Where are you going?

1072
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,959
Simba, it's so beautiful.

1073
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,992
I can see what's happening

1074
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,160
I can't. What?

1075
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,992
And they don't have a clue.

1076
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,115
Who's "they"?

1077
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,556
They'll fall in love
And here's the bottom line.

1078
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,911
Our trio's down to two.

1079
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Oh, I get it.

1080
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,832
The sweet caress of twilight.

1081
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,920
Yeah.

1082
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,797
There's magic ev'rywhere.

1083
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,035
It's ev'rywhere.

1084
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:58,074
And with all this
romantic atmosphere.

1085
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:03,151
Disaster's in the air.

1086
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,994
Can you feel the love tonight?

1087
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,072
The peace the evening brings.

1088
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:25,469
The world for once
in perfect harmony.

1089
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:30,191
With all its living things.

1090
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,718
So many things
to tell her.

1091
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:40,837
But how to make her see
The truth about my past?

1092
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,109
Impossible.

1093
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,191
She'd turn away from me.

1094
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,280
He's holding back,
he's hiding.

1095
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,070
But what, I can't decide.

1096
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,277
Why won't he be the king
I know he is?

1097
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:58,274
The king I see inside?

1098
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:04,029
Can you feel
the love tonight?

1099
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:10,356
The peace the evening brings.

1100
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:17,516
The world for once
in perfect harmony.

1101
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,112
With all its living things.

1102
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:29,714
Can you feel the love tonight?

1103
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:36,349
You needn't look too far.

1104
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:43,353
Stealing through
the night's uncertainties.

1105
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:48,031
Love is where they are.

1106
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:55,670
And if he falls
in love tonight.

1107
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:01,312
It can be assumed.

1108
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:08,353
His carefree days
with us are history.

1109
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:15,558
In short, our pal is doomed.

1110
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,835
I told you.
Isn't it great here?

1111
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,877
You know, maybe it could be
like this forever.

1112
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,871
It's amazing.

1113
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:39,517
But there's something
I don't understand.

1114
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,910
If you've been alive
all this time...

1115
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,991
why haven't you come home?

1116
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,270
We've really needed you.

1117
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,839
They're fine, all right?

1118
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,359
Nobody needs me.

1119
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,238
You're the king.

1120
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:54,073
Nala, Scar is the king.

1121
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,118
Simba, he's decimated
the Pride Lands.

1122
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,077
There's no food, no water...

1123
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,151
There's nothing I can do.

1124
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,878
What about your mother?

1125
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,996
This is your responsibility.

1126
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,559
You need to challenge Scar.

1127
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,553
I can't go back. Ever.

1128
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:10,914
Why?

1129
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,832
Because of what happened
at the gorge?

1130
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,115
Scar told us that...

1131
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,508
You wouldn't understand!

1132
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,079
None of it matters. Okay?

1133
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,593
Hakuna matata.

1134
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,760
What?

1135
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,672
It's something
I learned out here, okay?

1136
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,478
You see,
sometimes bad things happen,

1137
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,198
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

1138
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,793
So, why worry?

1139
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,911
Why worry?

1140
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,997
What happened to you?

1141
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,435
You're not
the Simba I remember.

1142
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:36,313
And I never will be.
Are you satisfied?

1143
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,198
No, I'm disappointed.

1144
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,480
You know, now you're starting
to sound like my father.

1145
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:43,313
Good. I'm glad one of us does.

1146
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,389
You have no idea
what I've been through!

1147
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,160
I came here looking for help.

1148
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,349
I guess I made a mistake.

1149
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,152
Goodbye, Simba.

1150
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,273
"Disappointed"?

1151
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,070
She wants me to go home?

1152
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,196
I am home.

1153
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,236
"Best friend"?

1154
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,709
I don't need best friends.
I don't need anybody.

1155
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,679
Never did.

1156
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,630
Go away.

1157
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,360
Going away will not
answer the question.

1158
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,159
What question?
Who are you?

1159
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,516
I know exactly who I am.

1160
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,114
The question is, who are you?

1161
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,589
I'm nobody. So leave me alone.
All right?

1162
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,919
Everybody is somebody.
Even a nobody.

1163
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,111
Yeah,
I think you're confused.

1164
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:18,798
I am confused?

1165
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,800
You don't even know
who you are.

1166
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,916
Oh. And I suppose you do?

1167
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,150
I held the son of Mufasa.

1168
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,794
You knew my father?

1169
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:32,880
Correction.

1170
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,798
I know your father.

1171
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,150
He died a long time ago.

1172
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,833
He's alive!

1173
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,078
And I can take you to him.

1174
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,192
Follow me. I will show you!

1175
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,360
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey!

1176
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:45,520
If you can keep up!

1177
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,673
Wait!

1178
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,798
Follow me!

1179
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,954
Quickly, quickly!
Come through!

1180
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:13,439
Hey! Slow down!

1181
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:18,600
Hey, you better hurry.

1182
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,519
Hold on.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1183
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,879
Come.

1184
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,513
Your father is waiting.

1185
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:09,471
Do you see him?

1186
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,916
I don't see anything.

1187
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,319
Look closer.

1188
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,471
You see?

1189
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,240
He lives in you.

1190
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,638
Simba.

1191
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,159
Dad?

1192
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,552
Simba.

1193
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:46,510
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

1194
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,120
I can't.

1195
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,158
You must remember who you are.

1196
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,709
The one true king.

1197
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:55,949
I'm sorry.

1198
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,151
I don't know
how to be like you.

1199
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,799
As king, I was most proud
of one thing.

1200
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:06,520
Having you as my son.

1201
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,916
That was a long time ago.

1202
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:15,233
No, Simba. That is forever.

1203
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,759
Please.

1204
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,672
Don't leave me again.

1205
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,116
I never left you.

1206
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,396
And never will.

1207
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,440
Remember who you are.

1208
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:35,070
Remember.

1209
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,193
And so, I ask again.

1210
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,435
Who are you?

1211
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,990
I am Simba.

1212
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,435
Son of Mufasa.

1213
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:24,559
Yeah
Spirit.

1214
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:29,029
Watch the heavens open.

1215
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,110
Yeah.

1216
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,717
Spirit.

1217
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,995
Can you hear it calling?

1218
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,869
Yeah.

1219
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,635
Simba?

1220
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,155
Come on!
What are you waiting for?

1221
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,873
Let's go home!

1222
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:00,790
Spirit.

1223
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:06,116
Watch the heavens open, open.

1224
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,033
Yeah.

1225
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,310
Your destiny is coming close.

1226
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,593
Stand up and fight.

1227
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:26,510
So, go in to a far-off land.

1228
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:33,074
And be one with the great I am.

1229
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,915
I didn't wanna believe you.

1230
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,150
So, what are you gonna do?

1231
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,072
My father
once told me to protect

1232
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:53,912
everything the light touches.

1233
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,799
If I don't fight for it,
who will?

1234
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:59,798
I will.

1235
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,518
It's going to be dangerous.

1236
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,636
Danger? Ha!

1237
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,917
I laugh in the face of danger.

1238
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:12,717
It can't be!

1239
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,711
Hello, Zazu.

1240
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,871
Your Majesty.

1241
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,799
Welcome home.

1242
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,120
We're here!

1243
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,758
Oh, everyone, calm down.
We're here.

1244
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,592
The backup has arrived!

1245
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,273
What are you guys doing here?

1246
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:31,716
- Um, we were not worried!
- Um... No, not worried.

1247
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,480
- 'Cause no worries.
- Nope. Hakuna matata.

1248
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:36,950
- We were concerned, because...
- Because, you know...

1249
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,439
You're our friend.

1250
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:41,359
What about the meaningless
line of indifference?

1251
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,868
Well, we were thinking...

1252
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,160
- maybe it curves a little bit.
- That's a good point.

1253
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,474
I mean, Simba, look,

1254
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,471
I'm happy to admit
when Pumbaa's wrong...

1255
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:49,696
and this is
one of those instances.

1256
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:50,800
What? That wasn't my thing.

1257
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,069
You told me about the line.

1258
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,240
Wait, hold on.

1259
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,193
Now, this is the place
you're fighting for?

1260
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,590
Yes, Timon.
This is my home.

1261
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,950
Is it behind
that terrifying rock?

1262
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:02,997
Talk about your fixer-upper.

1263
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,513
I like what
you've done with it,

1264
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:06,318
although a bit heavy
on the carcass.

1265
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,118
Hey, hey, look. A bird.

1266
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,874
Timon, Pumbaa, this is Zazu.

1267
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,237
Oh, wow! It's a puffin.

1268
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,759
Charming.

1269
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,909
Simba, we are with you
until the end.

1270
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,310
We are at your service,
my liege!

1271
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,398
Follow me.

1272
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:39,113
Hyenas everywhere.

1273
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,554
I hope it's a quick death.

1274
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,040
You know,
just not a lot of chewing.

1275
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,256
What's your plan
for getting us

1276
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,429
past the slobbering guards?

1277
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,991
Live bait.

1278
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,912
That's a great idea.

1279
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:55,355
Those guys could never
resist fresh meat.

1280
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:58,552
So all we need to do is find
something that's, like, big...

1281
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,756
and plump, and juicy.

1282
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:03,036
Maybe like a gnu?

1283
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,556
Why is everyone looking at me?

1284
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,515
It is with deepest pride

1285
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,636
and greatest pleasure...

1286
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,951
that we proudly present...

1287
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,678
your dinner.

1288
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:28,028
Be our guest.

1289
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,874
It's working, Pumbaa!

1290
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:08,874
My old friend.

1291
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,750
Sarabi,
why put yourself through this?

1292
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,548
All you have to do
is be my queen.

1293
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:16,153
You're suffering for what?

1294
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,151
The memory of a life
you once knew?

1295
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,311
A king you once loved?

1296
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,876
I tried to make you understand
what a true king can be.

1297
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:29,716
Scar, a true king's power
is his compassion.

1298
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:31,950
I am ten times
the king Mufasa was!

1299
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,720
You are nothing
compared to Mufasa!

1300
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,354
Mufasa?

1301
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:48,555
It can't be.

1302
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:51,036
Get away from my mother.

1303
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,039
Simba.

1304
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,476
You're alive?

1305
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:01,949
How can that be?

1306
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,236
I'm here, Mother.

1307
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:05,440
I'm home.

1308
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,999
Simba...

1309
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,436
I'm so happy to see you.

1310
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:10,520
Alive.

1311
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,959
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1312
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:18,230
I can give you more than one.

1313
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,515
You see...

1314
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,757
they think I'm king.

1315
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:25,951
Well, we don't.

1316
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,156
Your reign is over, Scar.

1317
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,720
Simba is the rightful king!

1318
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:36,395
If you wanna get him,
you have to get through us.

1319
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,636
Are you with me, lions?

1320
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,788
The choice is yours, Scar.
Step down or fight.

1321
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,879
Must this all end in violence?

1322
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,790
I'd hate to be responsible for
the death of a family member.

1323
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:57,273
To feel the shame
of knowing...

1324
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,749
I took the life
of someone I love.

1325
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,753
I put all that behind me.

1326
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:05,157
But have they
put it behind them?

1327
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:08,118
Do your faithful subjects
know what you've done?

1328
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,793
What is he talking about?

1329
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:13,236
So you haven't told them
your little secret?

1330
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:15,755
Well, Simba...

1331
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:19,192
now's your chance to confess.

1332
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,996
T ell them who's responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1333
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,031
It was me.

1334
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,231
It's not true.

1335
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:38,236
Tell me it's not true.

1336
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,118
It's true. I'm sorry.

1337
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,077
He admits it.

1338
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,240
Murderer!

1339
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,277
No, no.
It was an accident.

1340
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,351
If it weren't for you
the king would be alive.

1341
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,080
It's your fault he's dead!
Do you deny it?

1342
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:51,240
I'm not a murderer.

1343
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,074
We should believe a son who
takes the life of a father?

1344
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,674
We should believe a son
who takes the life of a king?

1345
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:59,156
A son who abandons his mother?

1346
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:00,839
No. I'm...

1347
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,912
You're what? Say it!
Are you the king?

1348
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,229
No. No, I'm...

1349
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,816
- Are you the king?
- No, I'm...

1350
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,512
- You're what? Say it!
- I'm...

1351
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,155
I'm nothing.

1352
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:12,993
Then bow to your king!

1353
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:16,949
Simba!

1354
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,636
This looks familiar.

1355
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:39,118
Where have I seen this before?

1356
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:42,233
Oh, yes, I remember.

1357
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:46,232
This is the way Mufasa looked
before he died.

1358
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:49,437
I looked down...

1359
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,194
saw the fear in his eyes.

1360
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:59,157
And here's my little secret.

1361
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:02,198
I killed Mufasa.

1362
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,439
No!

1363
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:17,360
My father!

1364
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:18,720
Your own brother!

1365
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:19,869
How could you?

1366
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,758
First he kills Mufasa...

1367
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:23,719
and now he wants to kill me!

1368
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,108
You killed him!

1369
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,599
Tell them the truth!

1370
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,273
Don't believe his lies!

1371
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,674
Scar...

1372
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,037
you told us you didn't get
to the gorge in time.

1373
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:34,708
That's true!

1374
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,031
Then how did you see
the look in Mufasa's eyes?

1375
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:41,199
Murderer!

1376
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,319
Kill them all!

1377
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,639
Lions, attack!

1378
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,198
Simba!

1379
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:16,792
- Pumbaa, I think we lost them.
- That was terrifying.

1380
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,832
Do you hear a low growl?

1381
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:23,274
Looks like we'll be
having pig for dinner.

1382
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,396
Plump and chubby.

1383
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:27,148
Chubby?

1384
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:29,556
- Did he just call me chubby?
- Uh-oh.

1385
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:32,154
It sounded a lot like
he just said "chubby".

1386
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,117
Which would be
a mistake because...

1387
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,555
I will not be made to feel
ashamed of who I am!

1388
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:37,640
Oh, boy.

1389
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,517
I may run from hyenas...

1390
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,830
but I will always
fight a bully!

1391
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:51,719
- You feel better, Pumbaa?
- I do.

1392
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,896
You got that
out of your system?

1393
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:53,920
I did.

1394
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,790
Now, this is a meal
I've waited my whole life for.

1395
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,949
I've been waiting too.

1396
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,076
And I'm not a cub anymore!

1397
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,356
For king and country!

1398
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,035
It's the bird!

1399
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,599
I got him! I got him!

1400
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:32,479
Tally-ho!

1401
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:33,720
Oh! No! He's got me!

1402
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,994
He's got me! Ooh!

1403
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:39,680
Get that bird!

1404
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,909
Please! Let's discuss this.

1405
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,918
That never gets old!

1406
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:34,434
It's over, Scar.

1407
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,999
Have mercy.
I beg you.

1408
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,593
Mercy?

1409
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,034
After what you did?

1410
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,317
It was the hyenas.

1411
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,835
Those revolting scavengers
made me do it.

1412
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,116
I was planning
on killing them all.

1413
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,959
You fooled the hyenas.

1414
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:55,472
Just like you fooled me.

1415
01:41:58,480 --> 01:41:59,754
Simba...

1416
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:02,076
you wouldn't kill
your only uncle.

1417
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:04,955
No, Scar.

1418
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:08,238
I'm not like you.

1419
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,872
Oh, Simba...

1420
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,315
you are truly noble.

1421
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:15,198
And I will make it up to you.

1422
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,238
Just tell me how
I can prove myself.

1423
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,994
Tell me what
you want me to do.

1424
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:24,559
Run.

1425
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,036
Run away, Scar.

1426
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:32,672
Run away and never return.

1427
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:35,599
Yes.

1428
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,391
Of course.

1429
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,315
As you wish...

1430
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,708
Your Majesty.

1431
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,919
You can't win, Scar!

1432
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,559
This is my kingdom!

1433
01:42:58,720 --> 01:42:59,948
My destiny!

1434
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:54,479
My friends.

1435
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,039
It will take some time,

1436
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,594
but together
we will build our army.

1437
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:00,159
"Friends", huh?

1438
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:04,315
I thought you said we were
"revolting scavengers"?

1439
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:07,392
Yeah.
That you wanted to kill us?

1440
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:08,560
No.

1441
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:09,874
No, let me explain.

1442
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,909
I was trying to fool him.

1443
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:14,513
We will rule together!

1444
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,872
There's only one true thing
you ever said, Scar.

1445
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:23,196
"A hyena's belly...

1446
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,271
"is never full."

1447
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,429
No!

1448
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:27,516
Your Majesty.

1449
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:23,556
Remember.

1450
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:18,238
Till we find our place.

1451
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:23,074
On the path unwinding.

1452
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:28,710
In the circle.

1453
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:33,192
The circle of life.

1454
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,073
Circle of life.

1455
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,870
It's never
too late to turn things around.

1456
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:31,953
Recover, unravel the path
to confound.

1457
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:35,749
The doubters and losers
that line up despair.

1458
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,594
Who tell you it's over,
you're goin' nowhere.

1459
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:44,515
It's never too late, I hope
It's never too late.

1460
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:51,279
It's never too late
to get back on track.

1461
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:55,148
To get at least some,
if not all of it back

1462
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:58,949
I thought I was happy,
and sometimes I was.

1463
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:02,510
But sadness is just
as important because.

1464
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:05,831
Got to carry the weight
and hope.

1465
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,399
It's never too late.

1466
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,638
Never too late
to fight the fight.

1467
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,836
Never too late
to cheat the night.

1468
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:16,717
Never too late to win the day.

1469
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,518
Never too late to break away.

1470
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:20,477
Time will start
to move too fast.

1471
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,232
But time is now,
my friend

1472
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:25,955
I'm a long way from the start
But further from the end.

1473
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:30,712
Oh, no, it's never too late.

1474
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:37,754
It's never too late
to get up off the ground.

1475
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:41,515
Don't have to be noticed,
don't have to be crowned

1476
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:45,434
I did what I've done,
and I don't try to hide

1477
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,399
I've lost many things,
but never my pride.

1478
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:54,429
It's never too late, I know
It's never too late.

1479
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,157
Never too late
to fight the fight.

1480
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:01,231
Never too late
to cheat the night.

1481
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:03,231
Never too late to win the day.

1482
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,157
Never too late to break away.

1483
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:06,958
Time will start
to move too fast.

1484
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:08,758
But time is now,
my friend

1485
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:12,674
I'm a long way from the start
But further from the end.

1486
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:17,237
Oh, no, it's never too late.

1487
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:24,912
Never too late.

1488
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:33,916
I used to say
I don't have time

1489
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,718
I'm sleepin' tonight.

1490
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:39,679
A day doin' nothin'
is doin' it right.

1491
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:43,514
No hurry, no hurry,
it takes as long as it takes.

1492
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:45,113
You might as well sleep

1493
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:47,111
for all the difference
it makes

1494
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:50,954
I didn't find love
or peace on the breaks.

1495
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,828
These aren't excuses,
but a string of mistakes

1496
01:50:54,920 --> 01:50:57,798
I won't go back there.

1497
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:01,672
Not going back there.

1498
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:07,076
Never too late
to fight the fight.

1499
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,037
Never too late
to cheat the night.

1500
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,031
Never too late to win the day.

1501
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:12,951
Never too late to break away.

1502
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,871
Never too late
to fight the fight.

1503
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,712
Never too late
to cheat the night.

1504
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:18,756
Never too late to win the day.

1505
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,592
Never too late to break away.

1506
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:22,398
Time will start
to move too fast.

1507
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,317
But time is now, my friend

1508
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:27,830
I'm a long way from the start
But further from the end.

1509
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:33,315
Oh, oh, it's never too late.

1510
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,877
It's never too late.

1511
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:40,396
Oh, never too late.

1512
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,311
Oh, it's never too late.

1513
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:48,274
No, it's never too late
