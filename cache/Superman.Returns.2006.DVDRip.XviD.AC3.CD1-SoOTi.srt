1
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,700
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

2
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,300
But we will never leave you...

3
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,300
...even in the face of our deaths.

4
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,900
You will make my strength your own.

5
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,400
You will see my life through your eyes...

6
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,000
...as your life will be seen through mine.

7
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,100
The son becomes the father,
and the father the son.

8
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,700
In spite of your past...

9
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,500
...I know you're a good man.

10
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,700
And all good men...

11
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,600
...deserve a second chance.

12
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,300
From the moment
I received your first letter...

13
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,200
...I knew you were not like the rest.

14
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,400
You came from nothing...

15
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,700
...and you worked so hard
to get where you are.

16
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,400
You might have made a few mistakes.

17
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,400
- Gertrude, for God's sake!
- Damn it, Gertrude, let us in now!

18
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,000
You said that if I helped you
get out of prison...

19
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,500
...you'd take care of me.

20
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,500
And you have.

21
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,900
You've shown me pleasures
that I've never known.

22
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,600
That's why you deserve...

23
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
...everything.

24
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,400
I love you...

25
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,900
...Lex Luthor.

26
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
Gertrude, let us in. He's a crook.

27
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,900
He doesn't love you, Gertrude!

28
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,400
He's a monster! Gertrude!

29
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,500
- You can keep that.
- Oh, God.

30
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,900
The rest is mine.

31
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,700
We're done.

32
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,100
Bye, Martha.

33
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Oh, Clark.

34
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, my boy.

35
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,600
Will you get that thing out of my face!

36
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,900
Lex, your friends give me the creeps.

37
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,900
Prison is a creepy place, Kitty.

38
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,400
One needs to make creepy friends
in order to survive.

39
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,000
Even a man with my vast talents
is worth less inside...

40
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,900
...than a carton of cigarettes and
a sharp piece of metal in your pocket.

41
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Do you know the story of Prometheus?
No, of course you don't.

42
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,500
Prometheus was a god who stole
the power of fire from the other gods...

43
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,300
...and gave control of it to mortals.

44
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,000
In essence, he gave us technology.
He gave us power.

45
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,600
So we're stealing fire? In the Arctic.

46
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,200
Actually, sort of. You see, whoever
controls technology controls the world.

47
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,000
The Roman Empire ruled the world
because they built roads.

48
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,900
The British Empire ruled the world
because they built ships.

49
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,500
America, the atom bomb,
and so on and so forth.

50
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
I just want what Prometheus wanted.

51
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,100
Sounds great, Lex, but you're not a god.

52
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,900
Gods are selfish beings
who fly around in little red capes...

53
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,300
...and don't share their power
with mankind.

54
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,000
Hey, boss.

55
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,200
We found something.

56
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,500
No, I don't wanna be a god.

57
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I just wanna bring fire to the people.

58
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,100
And I want my cut.

59
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,300
Was this his house?

60
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,600
You might think so. Most would.

61
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,700
This is more of a monument
to a long dead...

62
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,300
...and extremely powerful civilization.

63
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,000
This is where he learned who he was.

64
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,100
This is where he came for guidance.

65
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,500
Possibilities.

66
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,600
Endless possibilities.

67
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,600
You act like you've been here before.

68
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,300
My son...

69
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,100
...you do not remember me.

70
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I am Jor-El.

71
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
I'm your father.

72
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,500
By now, I will have been dead
many thousands of your years.

73
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,000
- He thinks I'm his son.
- You are the only survivor of Krypton.

74
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Embedded in the crystals before you is
the total accumulation of all literature...

75
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,500
...and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds...

76
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,000
...spanning the 28 known galaxies.

77
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,800
There are questions to be asked.

78
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,000
Here in this...

79
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,600
This Fortress of Solitude...

80
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,500
...we shall try to find
the answers together.

81
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,100
Can he see us?

82
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,400
No, he's dead.

83
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,800
So, my son...

84
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,000
...Kal-El...

85
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,300
...speak.

86
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,800
Tell me everything...

87
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,500
...starting with crystals.

88
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,500
Hey, boy.

89
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,400
- on Tuesday, between support...

90
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,800
- hindered the firefighting efforts
for all those...

91
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,500
Police have finally arrived and it's
still complete mayhem down here.

92
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,100
Fighting broke out in the
southernmost region...

93
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,500
...with border fire
and small-arms attacks prevalent.

94
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,400
Don't worry, I buried it this morning.

95
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,500
- it was futile trying to force him
to testify before a grand jury.

96
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,100
Mom?

97
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,400
Five years.

98
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,500
If your father was alive,
he never would have let you go.

99
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,700
I almost gave up hope.

100
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,000
I just thought
I would never see you again.

101
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,100
Oh, Clark.

102
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,700
Did you find what you were looking for?

103
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,000
I thought, hoped...

104
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,600
...it might still be there.

105
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,000
Your home?

106
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,600
That place was a graveyard.

107
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,400
I'm all that's left.

108
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,900
Clark, the universe is a big place.

109
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,600
And you don't know who's out there.

110
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,700
And even if you are the last...

111
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,900
...you're not alone.

112
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,100
I know.

113
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,900
- Sorry.
- Look out!

114
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,300
Watch out, will you?

115
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,900
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

116
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,700
Sorry.

117
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
Great. Would you be careful?

118
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,300
- Jimmy.
- Mr. Clark! I mean, Kent! Mr. Kent!

119
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Welcome back! Oh, my God!

120
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,300
Hey, come... Wait right there.
I'll be right back.

121
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,700
Oh, hey, sorry, guys,
I'm still looking for a place to live...

122
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,500
...if you know of anything reasonable.

123
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,200
Behind you, Mr. Kent.
I made it myself. It's a cake.

124
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,400
Oh, it looks...

125
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,600
...delicious.

126
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,900
Olsen! Where are the photos
of that birthday-clown-massacre thing?

127
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,500
I'm on it, chief. Hey, look who's back.

128
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,300
- Kent?
- Hey, chief.

129
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,800
- Thank you for giving me my job back.
- Don't thank me.

130
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,300
Thank Norm Palmer for dying.

131
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,000
It was his time.

132
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,600
- Let's get you set up, huh?
- Olsen!

133
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,000
Okay, so I gotta run...

134
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,300
...but I will be back to check on you
in a sec, Mr. Kent.

135
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Oh, hey, do you know
where I can find Lois?

136
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,100
The timing of this
automated-ignition countdown...

137
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
...is the most precarious part
of the launch.

138
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,100
Lois Lane, Daily Planet.

139
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,400
You also stated that the shuttle
will usher in a new era of travel...

140
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,400
...enabling the average person
to afford transcontinental flights.

141
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
But can you tell us the exact price...

142
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,200
...an "average person"
will be expected to pay?

143
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,000
The answer to that question
is in your press packet.

144
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,800
The Earth is surrounded
by a blanket of air...

145
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,200
...which we call the atmosphere.

146
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,800
It reaches over...

147
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,700
Yeah. He looks just like his mom.

148
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,700
Already takes after her too, especially
when it comes to getting into trouble.

149
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,300
Mother?

150
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,500
Oh, yeah, well, I guess you've been gone.
Fearless reporter Lois Lane is a mommy.

151
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,900
Oh, you know, I'll just...
I'll take that. That's good.

152
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,900
- Sorry.
- No. She's got plenty.

153
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,900
- Wait, she's married?
- Yes.

154
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,300
No. Not really. It's more like
a prolonged engagement.

155
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,800
But don't ask Miss Lane
when they're tying the knot...

156
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,300
...because she hates that question.

157
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,800
- like this follow the same stringent
safety guidelines set by NASA?

158
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,500
Since this is a joint venture
with the Air Force...

159
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,000
You all right? You look like
you could use a drink.

160
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,400
This place is so tacky.
Why are we back here?

161
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,100
Kitty, while you were doing your nails
and ordering fur coats online...

162
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,900
...I was busy unlocking the secrets...

163
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,800
...of one of the most advanced
civilizations in the universe.

164
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,200
Weren't there two of those?

165
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,400
You see, unlike our clunky
earthbound forms of construction...

166
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,900
...the technology on Krypton,
Superman's home world...

167
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,400
...was based on manipulating
the growth of crystals.

168
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,900
Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.

169
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,700
Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,
any sufficiently advanced technology...

170
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,900
...would be indistinguishable from magic.

171
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,200
But imagine: cities, vehicles, weapons...

172
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,400
...entire continents...

173
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,300
...all grown.

174
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,900
To think that one could create
a new world...

175
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,900
...with such a simple little object.

176
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,700
It's like a seed.

177
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,100
And all it needs is water.

178
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,600
Like...

179
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,300
...Sea-Monkeys.

180
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,100
Exactly, Kitty.

181
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,200
Like Sea-Monkeys.

182
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,700
Clark has been doing a little
soul-searching for the last couple years.

183
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,800
- He saw Ilamas.
- Yeah?

184
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,900
- Yeah.
- Must be tough coming back.

185
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,700
- Coming back?
- To work.

186
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah.

187
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,800
Well, you know, things change.

188
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,900
I mean, of course things change...

189
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,700
...but sometimes things that you didn't
think would change could change.

190
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,700
Take Lois.

191
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,700
A woman like her,
I never thought she'd settle down.

192
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,600
You know, if you ask me...
Because she'll never tell you this...

193
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,500
...but if you ask me,
she's still in love with you-know-who.

194
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,200
The original space shuttle
generated 7.5 million pounds of thrust...

195
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,000
...just in the initial launch phase.

196
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,700
But, by piggybacking
on this Boeing 777... Yes?

197
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,800
If this launch is as pivotal as you claim...

198
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,200
...why is it being covered
by one news network?

199
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Why don't we save those questions
for the post-launch briefing.

200
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
How about that, Miss Lane?

201
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,600
When we hit 40,000 feet,
the shuttle will detach, ascend...

202
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,300
...and then fire the first of two propellant
systems, the liquid fuel boosters.

203
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
When the shuttle
reaches the stratosphere...

204
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,700
...the secondary
insertion booster will fire...

205
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,100
...propelling the craft
at 4gs into the mesosphere.

206
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
- Careful.
- I know.

207
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,500
- Careful. Careful.
- I know.

208
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,000
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

209
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,300
Wait for it.

210
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,300
Wow, that's really something, Lex.

211
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,200
It's freaking Gone With the Wind.

212
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,800
- Shut off the camera.
- But I'm getting it.

213
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,900
I said, shut off the damn camera.

214
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,700
I think I did something wrong.

215
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,000
No. That wasn't you.

216
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,000
Ignition is at T minus one minute
and we are prepping for separation.

217
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,600
CDR., start the clock.

218
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,400
Three minutes and counting.

219
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,700
Body signs normal. Crew is looking good.

220
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,500
Shuttle readouts are holding steady.

221
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,800
- We're still a go for launch.
- Roger.

222
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,800
- Houston, you copy?
- Houston, do you copy?

223
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Oh, God.

224
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,700
Electrical variance.

225
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,800
What the...?

226
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,300
Please, there's nothing to worry about.

227
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,600
It seems that we are experiencing
a slight power outage.

228
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,700
- What did you do?
- It wasn't me. It just cycled back up.

229
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,800
Genesis, radio check from Houston.

230
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,700
There we have it.
We were experiencing a power outage.

231
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,500
- Climbing to 40,000 feet.
- Roger, 40,000 feet.

232
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,200
And it's gone! A blazing fastball...

233
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,900
Is that it?

234
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,100
I don't think so.

235
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,900
Dual engine failure,
but they're up and running again.

236
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,800
Genesis, I hate to say this, but it looks
like we're gonna have to scrub the launch.

237
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,300
- Aborting booster ignition.
- Roger. Aborting booster ignition.

238
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,100
Boosters are non-responsive.
We're still counting down for ignition.

239
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,900
- Platform, we have a problem.
- Go.

240
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,400
Looks like something faulted
during the power outage.

241
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,800
Both boosters are
counting down for ignition.

242
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,800
Platform, you have 30 seconds.

243
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,200
- What?
- Release couplings.

244
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,700
We can't shut down boosters.

245
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,100
We should be able to manage the launch
and recover to the emergency field.

246
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,800
T minus 23 seconds to ignition.

247
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,300
Genesis, you're a go
for evac procedures.

248
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,200
Twenty-one, 20...

249
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,800
...19...

250
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,300
Couplings are non-responsive.

251
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,300
- We're still attached.
- Seventeen.

252
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,300
- Platform, couplings are jammed.
- Fifteen.

253
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,200
Fourteen.

254
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,700
Don't be alarmed. It's absolutely normal.

255
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,300
We're still attached.
Couplings are non-responsive.

256
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,900
- Nine, eight...
- Houston, can you do a remote override?

257
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,600
...seven...

258
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,400
- Remote override is unresponsive.
...six, five...

259
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,700
- I repeat, remote override is unresponsive.
...four, three...

260
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,700
And if you're lucky, you may hear
the faint pop of the sonic boom.

261
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,200
- Houston, we have ignition.
- Roger, ignition.

262
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,300
- This is Python 21, she's pulling away.
- Okay, all flight control is on the...

263
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,200
This is not a drill.
Clear nonessential personnel.

264
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,500
Switch to emergency band frequencies.

265
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,200
Warning, warning.

266
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
Oh, no! Oh, no!

267
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,500
Can I get a little help?

268
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,400
This is UPV breaking news.
From Washington, Frank Jacobs.

269
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,700
We've just received word...

270
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,600
...that the inaugural flight
of the Genesis space shuttle...

271
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,800
...is experiencing a midair emergency.

272
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,900
- a problem with the launch
of the new orbital shuttle, Genesis.

273
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,100
The reports are telling us
the shuttle failed to disengage...

274
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,100
...sending both crafts
rocketing towards space.

275
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,700
We're now going live to Cape Canaveral
for the latest update on this story.

276
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,200
Jim, all we know right now...

277
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,000
...is that the couplings
which hold the shuttle to the 777...

278
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,300
...malfunctioned
and did not release as planned.

279
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,900
- We're uncertain...
- I should do...

280
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,600
...why the ignition sequence
continued and boosters fired.

281
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,500
However, there's speculation here
that the blackout, which...

282
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,900
Help me sit up.

283
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,600
Mach one.
Still tied to the shuttle at 42,000 feet.

284
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,300
- Houston, we need some help. Houston!
- Running diagnostics check. Stand by.

285
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,200
Insertion booster ignition in five seconds.

286
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,200
Warning, warning.

287
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,800
What the hell is that?

288
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,400
There's some kind of unidentified bogey
coming from the north.

289
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,600
- Roger that.
- And it's coming in fast.

290
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,800
Declaring an emergency.

291
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,900
Overspeed, overspeed.

292
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,700
Altitude...

293
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,500
Do you see that?

294
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,400
Fly up, fly up.

295
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,700
Is everyone all right?

296
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,300
Are you okay?

297
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,400
Well, I hope this experience
hasn't put any of you off flying.

298
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,500
Statistically speaking,
it's still the safest way to travel.

299
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,700
Superman! Superman! Superman!

300
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,200
Superman!

301
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,700
Okay, everybody, listen up.

302
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,500
I wanna know it all, everything.

303
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,500
Olsen, I wanna see photos of him
everywhere. No, I want the photos.

304
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,300
Sports, how are they gonna get
that plane out of the stadium?

305
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,900
Travel, where did he go?
Was he on vacation? If so, where?

306
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,000
Gossip, has he met somebody?
Fashion, is that a new suit?

307
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,600
Health, has he gained weight?
What's he been eating?

308
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,200
Business, how is this gonna affect
the stock market? Long-term, short-term.

309
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,900
Politics, does he still stand for truth,
justice, all that stuff? Lifestyle:

310
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,100
"Superman Returns."

311
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,600
Come on.

312
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,200
Gil, how many F's in "catastrophic"?

313
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,900
None. What's the usage?

314
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,100
"This mysterious electromagnetic pulse
knocked out portable devices...

315
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,100
...and entire power grids,
causing a catastrophic event during..."

316
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,800
- Lois!
- Yes.

317
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,500
In my office.

318
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,600
This goes for everyone.

319
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,300
The story isn't the blackout,
it's Superman!

320
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,100
The story is the EMP, chief.

321
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,700
Every electronic device
on the East Coast goes dark.

322
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,900
- First, are you okay?
- Yes, thank you.

323
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,900
Lois, three things sell papers:
tragedy, sex and Superman.

324
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,500
People are sick of tragedy, we know
you can't write worth a damn about sex.

325
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,100
That means one thing. That one thing
is Superman. And you know it, Lois.

326
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,100
Lois?

327
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,800
- Are you all right? You sure?
- Yeah.

328
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,600
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Thank God.

329
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,300
- Where's Jason?
- I don't know. Isn't he with you?

330
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,700
- No.
- Well, where is he?

331
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,400
Hi.

332
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,200
Hello.

333
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,200
Who are you?

334
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,400
I'm Clark Kent, an old friend of
your mom's from before you were born.

335
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,300
Really? She never mentioned you.

336
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,700
Really? Never?

337
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,100
- No.
- Jason.

338
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,700
- What are you doing here, honey?
- Daddy's office is boring.

339
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,700
Daddy's office is boring?

340
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,400
Clark, hey! Welcome back.

341
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,700
- I see you've already met the munchkin.
- Yeah, we were just talking...

342
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,800
- Did you take vitamins? Eye drops?
- Yes. Yes.

343
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,100
- Albuterol? Poly-Vi-Flor?
- Yes. Yes, Mom.

344
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,100
Good boy. He's a little fragile,
but he's gonna grow up...

345
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,500
...to be big and strong
like his dad, won't you?

346
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,900
- Yes?
- Yes.

347
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,300
Oh, I saw you on the...

348
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,400
Oh, yeah. That was nothing.

349
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,400
- Hey, can I borrow your stapler?
- Oh, yeah.

350
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,900
Thanks.

351
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,500
Congratulations on the Pulitzer.
That's incredible.

352
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,700
Yeah. Can you believe it? It's...

353
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,400
So I wanna hear all about your trip.

354
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,200
Where did you go? What did you see?
Meet anyone special?

355
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,700
Well, there's so much. Where to begin?

356
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,200
Where's the little guy? Hey, kiddo.

357
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,500
- How are you?
- Good.

358
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,700
Can you work some magic
to get your uncle...

359
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,400
...to stop giving me
such a hard time on this article?

360
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,400
- Please?
- Again?

361
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
- Again.
- You got it.

362
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,700
- How are you, kiddo?
- Good.

363
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,600
Oh, this is Clark.

364
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,100
- Clark, Richard. Richard, Clark.
- Richard White.

365
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,500
Hi.

366
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,800
Richard's an assistant editor here who's
basically saved our International section.

367
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,700
He's also a pilot
and he loves horror movies.

368
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,500
Clark is...

369
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,000
Well, he's Clark.

370
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,900
Well, it's great to finally meet you.
I've heard so much.

371
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,900
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah, Jimmy won't shut up about you.

372
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,300
- Gotta run.
- Where?

373
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,500
You heard Perry. Superman's back, and
he thinks I'm the only one equipped to...

374
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,200
To what?

375
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,600
- I don't know, you know.
- So don't listen to him.

376
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,500
I'm not. Going to the power plant
to check out the blackout.

377
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,000
Okay.

378
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,300
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

379
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,500
- Bye, Lois.
- And she's gone.

380
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,500
No matter how close we are,
that woman will always be a mystery.

381
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,000
If you need anything,
I'm right over there.

382
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,700
Nice to finally meet you.

383
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,900
Where do you wanna go?
Wanna go to the park?

384
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,700
And he's got the whole world
In his hands

385
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,900
He's got the whole world

386
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,500
And he's got the whole world in his...

387
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,200
Oh, he's cute.

388
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,800
Run into trouble?

389
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,100
- Should see the other guy.
- What are we gonna do?

390
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,900
Modify it, attach it to the stern.

391
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,900
I don't care if the instructions
are Russian.

392
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,700
- Lois?
- Hey, Clark.

393
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,600
How does it feel to be back at work?

394
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Pretty good. You know,
kind of like riding a bike, I guess.

395
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,400
- A bike?
- Yeah, you know...

396
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,900
Never mind.

397
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,300
But I was wondering...

398
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,500
...since I've gotten back, we haven't
really had a chance to catch up.

399
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:25,500
I thought maybe, if you'd like,
we could go grab some food...

400
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,700
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

401
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,100
Have you ever met someone and it's like
you're from different worlds...

402
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,800
...but you shared such a connection you
knew you were destined to be together?

403
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,300
Then he just takes off
without explaining why...

404
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,200
...or without even saying goodbye?

405
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,500
Sounds cheesy, I know.

406
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,200
- Well, maybe...
- Taxi!

407
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,100
...it was hard to say goodbye
because he had to go...

408
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,500
...and he wanted to say goodbye,
but maybe it was too difficult for him.

409
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,900
Difficult? What's so difficult about it?
"Goodbye." It's easy.

410
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,600
What's so hard about saying goodbye?

411
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,300
Who are we talking about?

412
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,200
Nobody, just forget I said anything.

413
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,200
Taxi! Hey!

414
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,600
Taxi!

415
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,900
Wow, thanks.

416
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,700
312 Riverside Drive, please.

417
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,300
Good night, Clark.

418
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,600
Superman!

419
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,600
I want egg rolls.

420
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,700
Nice try, kiddo. Only steamed chicken
and snow peas for you.

421
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,900
Why do we order Chinese if he's allergic?

422
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,800
Because he loves the peas...

423
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,100
...and I think we all prefer egg rolls
over macrobiotic shakes.

424
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,700
It's a good point.

425
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,100
So I noticed you've been acting
a little different lately.

426
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,900
Have I?

427
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,100
You know, Lois,
that article that you wrote.

428
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,100
"Why the World
Doesn't Need Superman"?

429
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,000
No, no, no. No, the other one,
from years ago, before we met.

430
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,500
Which article? I wrote dozens about him.
I was practically his press agent.

431
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,500
"I Spent the Night With Superman."

432
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,400
Richard, come on.

433
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,400
It was the title of an interview.

434
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,500
Plus, it was your Uncle Perry's idea.

435
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,600
- No, I know, I know. It's okay, it's okay.
- Richard.

436
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,100
It was a long time ago.

437
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,500
Were you in love with him?

438
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,300
He was Superman.
Everyone was in love with him.

439
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,700
But were you?

440
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,600
No.

441
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,900
Lois, I shouldn't have brought it up.

442
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,100
Even though you've been
raised as a human being...

443
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,300
...you are not one of them.

444
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,400
They can be a great people, Kal-El.
They wish to be.

445
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,500
They only lack the light
to show the way.

446
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,500
For this reason above all,
their capacity for good...

447
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,600
...I have sent them you...

448
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,700
...my only son.

449
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,200
Load them up.

450
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,700
Holy sh...

451
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,300
Attention, the Metropolis
Museum of Natural History...

452
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,100
...will be closing in 10 minutes.
We hope that you've...

453
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,100
Sir, we're closing in 10 minutes.

454
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,900
We only need five.

455
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,000
You're done, the museum's closed.
Thank you.

456
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,000
Are you all right, miss?

457
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,700
- My heart. I... I...
- I'm sorry?

458
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:52,900
I have a palpitation,
a heart palpitation. And a murmur.

459
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:56,300
Please, take me to the hospital.

460
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,400
Take me to the hospital.

461
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,500
Just hold on tight.

462
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,700
Bingo.

463
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,600
- There you are, ma'am.
- My heart.

464
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,500
My palpitations, they're gone.
What did you do?

465
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,100
I didn't do anything.

466
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,500
Call me Katherine.

467
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,700
Katherine. I'm glad you're feeling better.

468
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,600
- You have places to go, people to save?
- Yes.

469
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,200
Would you like to get
a cup of coffee sometime?

470
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,800
- I know that's forward. Or a drink?
- Good night.

471
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,500
Good night.

472
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,200
It's like this on every channel.

473
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,100
He was in Manila at 10:55 P.M.
and then spotted...

474
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,900
- Hey, Kent, chief wants to see you.
- Oh, thanks.

475
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,800
But as this security footage
from a simple deli robbery proves...

476
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
...there's really no feat too big
or too small for the Man of Steel.

477
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,300
Reports are flooding in from Metropolis,
Houston, Gotham and as far...

478
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,100
Satellites have proven
most ineffective at tracking him.

479
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,600
He might literally be moving
near the speed of light.

480
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,100
- Our map is illuminated with sightings...
- Kent!

481
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,100
- The chief is waiting.
...on every continent, giving citizens...

482
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,400
These are iconic, and they were taken
by a 12-year-old with a camera phone.

483
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,600
- What do you got, Olsen?
- I got those.

484
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,500
- Look, in the sky, chief.
- It's a bird.

485
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,100
- It's a plane.
- No, look, it's...

486
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,000
You wanted to see me?

487
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,600
Yeah, Kent, come on in. Sit down.

488
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,600
I wanna talk a little strategy. Okay.

489
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,600
First off, Lois, I don't understand
what you're doing...

490
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,900
...sneaking around covering the blackout.
- It wasn't just a blackout.

491
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,000
Cellphones, pagers,
automobiles, airplane...

492
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,500
Every other paper in town
has got a female reporter...

493
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,000
...a good-looking female reporter,
stashed on the roof covering Superman.

494
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,700
- And you two are the ones with history.
- Chief, I've done Superman.

495
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:28,200
Covered him. You know what I mean.

496
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,500
Yeah, that makes you an expert.
Do him again.

497
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,300
- There are a dozen other stories out there.
- Yeah? Name one.

498
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,900
Well, there was a museum robbery
last night.

499
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,700
Even Superman missed that one.
He was too busy saving this hooker.

500
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,500
Why don't you guys
track down Lex Luthor?

501
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,300
Well, no one's seen him
since his fifth appeal.

502
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,500
He's got more history
with Superman than anyone.

503
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,100
Maybe he's got something to say.

504
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:52,900
- Luthor's yesterday's news.
- No, I like that idea.

505
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,200
Perry, Lex Luthor is a career criminal
who nearly killed him, for God's sakes.

506
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,500
Jimmy, how did Lex Luthor
get out of prison?

507
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:04,500
Well, the appeals court called Superman
as a witness and he wasn't around.

508
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,200
How much do you think
that pisses off Superman?

509
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,000
- Give him to someone else.
- A lot.

510
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,900
- A lot.
- Polly. Give him to Polly.

511
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:17,400
Lois, Superman.

512
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,600
- What about the blackout?
- Kent, blackout.

513
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,300
Great. Thanks, chief.

514
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:32,000
Lois, I'm sorry. I'd hate if this
damaged our relationship.

515
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,300
Relationship?

516
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,400
- Yeah.
- Hi, Mommy.

517
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,400
- Hi, you.
- Hey, guys.

518
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,200
He got an A in science, but a D in gym,
so we're doing something right.

519
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,300
- Yeah, at least one of us is.
- What?

520
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,200
It's Perry. He just shoved Superman
back into my life.

521
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,100
Well, honey, I'm sure you can
find a way to interview Superman...

522
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,200
...without bringing him
back into your life.

523
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,500
There's really no way around it, folks.
Superman is back in all of our lives.

524
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,600
We're coming to you from Sydney...

525
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,400
...where people have gathered
on these rooftops to scour the sky...

526
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,700
Okay, how about this?
We'll stay late. We'll get dinner.

527
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,300
I'll help with Superman, and you and
Clark can work on the blackout together.

528
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,300
- Is that all right with you, Clark?
- Swell.

529
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:40,100
I was gonna pretend
the brakes were out.

530
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,300
Pretend. Like we talked about.

531
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,100
You didn't actually have to cut them!

532
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,500
Of course I did.

533
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:52,300
A man can always tell when a woman
is pretending, especially Superman.

534
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,300
So did you get your rock?

535
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,400
I did.

536
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:07,600
U.S. Coast Guard issuing a small-craft
advisory for the Metropolis ocean area.

537
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,500
High-wind advisory is in effect...

538
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,500
...ocean currents and tides
becoming increasingly dangerous.

539
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,700
All warnings lasting
until later this evening.

540
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,100
Security, security.

541
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:22,500
This is U.S. Coast Guard issuing
a small-craft advisory for northeast seas.

542
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,900
Winds reaching 50 miles per hour,
high tides in the morning.

543
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,800
Waves reaching 20 to 30 feet.

544
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,800
This warning is in effect for
all small crafts for the next four hours.

545
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,500
Weird. If these times are right...

546
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,600
...the blackout spread
from a specific origin point.

547
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,100
Where?

548
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,000
I'm not sure yet.

549
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:08,200
With the super-hearing, does he hear each
sound by itself or everything at once?

550
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,700
Both.

551
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,000
- He's certainly taller than I thought.
- 6'4".

552
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,800
I love that he can see through anything.
I'd have fun with that.

553
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,800
Anything but lead.

554
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,100
- I bet he's...
- 225 pounds...

555
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,900
...faster than a speeding bullet...

556
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,300
...draws his power from the sun,
invulnerable to anything but kryptonite...

557
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,500
...and he never lies.
- Kryptonite?

558
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,900
Radioactive pieces of his home world.

559
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,100
It's deadly. To him.

560
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,800
Lois, how tall would you say Clark is?

561
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,200
About 6'3", 6'4".

562
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,000
About 200, 215 pounds?

563
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,400
Jimmy, Jason, let's go get these intrepid
reporters something to keep them going.

564
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,400
- Burritos!
- Come here, canhead.

565
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,600
We're going this way. Do they have
anything other than burritos?

566
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,700
I think they have fries and burgers.

567
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,300
So have you found a place to live yet?

568
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,900
No. I'm still looking.

569
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,100
You know, Lois, I wanted to ask you
about that artic...

570
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,600
Hey, I'm gonna run downstairs
for some fresh air. Great!

571
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,400
Thanks.

572
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,600
- Let's talk when I get back.
- Sure.

573
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,500
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke, Miss Lane.

574
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,100
- Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.
- I'm fine. Really.

575
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:52,100
I just wasn't expecting you.

576
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,300
With all the press on the plane...

577
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,700
...I wasn't sure it was
the best time for us to talk.

578
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:00,000
Well, there's no press around now.
Except for me, of course.

579
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,400
I know people are asking questions
now that I'm back.

580
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,200
I think it's only fair
that I answer those people.

581
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,000
So you're here for an interview?

582
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,200
Okay, then.

583
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,800
- Where did I put that thing?
- Right pocket.

584
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:29,300
Let's start with the big question.

585
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,900
- Where'd you go?
- To Krypton.

586
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,300
But you told me it was destroyed.
Ages ago.

587
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,900
It was.

588
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,300
But when astronomers
thought they found it...

589
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,000
...I had to see for myself.

590
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,100
Well, you're back, and everyone
seems to be pretty happy about it.

591
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,600
Not everyone.

592
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,100
- I read the article, Lois.
- So did a lot of people.

593
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,100
- Tomorrow they're giving me the Pulitzer...
- Why did you write it?

594
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,600
How could you leave us like that?

595
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,400
I moved on. So did the rest of us.

596
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,300
That's why I wrote it.

597
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,100
The world doesn't need a savior.

598
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,400
And neither do I.

599
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:29,900
Lois.

600
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,900
Will you come with me?

601
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,100
Why?

602
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,500
There's something I wanna show you.

603
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,300
Please.

604
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,900
I can't be gone long.

605
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,900
You won't be.

606
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,400
Clark said the reason you left
without saying goodbye...

607
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,800
...is because it was
too unbearable for you.

608
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,500
Personally, I think that's a load of crap.

609
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,100
- Clark?
- He's just a guy I work with.

610
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,100
Maybe Clark's right.

611
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,400
You know, my...

612
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,400
Richard, he's a pilot.
He takes me up all the time.

613
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,500
Not like this.

614
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,000
I forgot how warm you were.

615
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,800
Listen.

616
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:31,500
What do you hear?

617
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:33,400
Nothing.

618
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,800
I hear everything.

619
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,700
You wrote that the world
doesn't need a savior...

620
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,200
...but every day
I hear people crying for one.

621
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,000
I'm sorry I left you, Lois.

622
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,700
I'll take you back now.

623
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,000
Richard's a good man.

624
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,300
And you've been gone a long time.

625
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,400
I know.

626
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,300
I...

627
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,200
So will I see you around?

628
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,100
I'm always around.

629
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,000
Good night, Lois.

630
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,900
We're having beef, honey. Do you want
the tofu wrap or the veggie wrap?

631
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,100
You all right?

632
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:17,300
Where have you been?

633
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:26,100
I was up on the roof, getting some air.

634
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:29,000
Tell the truth now.

635
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,400
Were you smoking?

636
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,600
No.

637
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,200
Is this real?

638
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,000
- Where'd you find him?
- He found me.

639
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,800
Oh, this is great. I can't wait to read it.

640
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,300
So, Mr. White, about the blackout...

641
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,900
Lois, this is the biggest night
of your life.

642
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,100
Have you picked out a dress?
Something snazzy?

643
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,700
It just feels a little weird
winning for that article.

644
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,700
- It just doesn't seem right.
- What doesn't seem right?

645
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:13,300
Winning an award for an article called
"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."

646
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,900
When, according
to this newspaper, they do.

647
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,800
Lois, Pulitzer Prizes
are like Academy Awards.

648
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Nobody remembers what you got one for.
It's just that you got one.

649
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,100
- But...
- This is your night. You enjoy it.

650
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,700
I'm sure Kent's on the blackout.

651
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,900
Department of Water and Power, please.

652
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,900
7782, great.

653
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,700
Metropolis Public Works.

654
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:35,300
Hi, Stephen, Lois Lane
from the Daily Planet. Blackout?

655
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,000
I just need a little info
on a few outstanding power grids.

656
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,700
Yeah, I do have it here, actually.

657
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:43,700
So the uptown grid went dark at 12:36
and midtown 10 seconds before.

658
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,300
Which grid was hit first?

659
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,800
It just reads Vanderworth.

660
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,200
- Across the river?
- 6 Springwood Drive.

661
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,500
6 Springwood Drive.
A residence or a business?

662
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,400
- Residence.
- Sure? Nothing before that?

663
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,800
- That's all it shows.
- Thank you very much.

664
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,800
Oh, Jason.

665
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:08,400
- There's your mom, Jason.
- You're late, Mommy.
