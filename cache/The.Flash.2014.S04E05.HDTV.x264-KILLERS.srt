1
00:00:00,134 --> 00:00:01,627
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,203
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,206 --> 00:00:07,047
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,117
But secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:13,286
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:15,288
But I became lost in time.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,190
It took everything in my friends' power

8
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:18,234
to bring me back.

9
00:00:18,237 --> 00:00:21,406
And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.

10
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:23,796
And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

11
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:26,600
I am the Flash.

12
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,402
Previously on "The Flash"...

13
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,738
Each of these heat scans
indicates a human body.

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,740
12 markers, 12 metas.

15
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,409
Why would anyone wanna create metas?

16
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,811
What's happening to me?

17
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:39,148
Clearly, this guy is a bus meta.

18
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:40,612
- Stretch these cells.
- Like Silly Putty.

19
00:00:40,614 --> 00:00:41,613
Like Silly Putty.

20
00:00:41,616 --> 00:00:42,562
I'm Silly Putty?

21
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:44,536
Let my team and I train you.

22
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:46,253
What made you look into Mayor Bellows?

23
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,722
Oh, it was a client. Last name, DeVoe.

24
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:51,695
You do what Amunet says for
as long as she tells you.

25
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:54,953
Tell Amunet I'm done.

26
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:56,828
Joe, I'm pregnant.

27
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:05,138
Hey, you guys wanna see
something really cool?

28
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,974
Uh, sure, go for it.

29
00:01:07,976 --> 00:01:09,242
Stretch, Ralph.

30
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:10,778
Stretch.

31
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:14,656
- That is pretty cool.
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:18,084
Okay, look, a-are you sure
we can't find this DeVoe guy?

33
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:20,954
I mean, we were warned. We
had a heads-up that someday,

34
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,629
someone named DeVoe would
be one of my greatest foes.

35
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:24,958
And the other thing to think about is,

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
do you know how many people there are

37
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,062
in this state alone with the name DeVoe?

38
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:30,463
- No.
- Thousands.

39
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,976
And we still don't have an age.

40
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,135
Unless one of your greatest
foes is the three-month-old

41
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,637
William DeVoe who lives
four blocks from here.

42
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,006
I don't think one of my
greatest enemies is a baby.

43
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:41,308
Evil killer baby.

44
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,309
Ehh, could happen.

45
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,343
You're right.

46
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:44,578
Hey.

47
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,079
- Ho!
- Yo, Felicity!

48
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:48,140
How'd you get in here?

49
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:51,650
I literally walked in here. You
have... you have no security,

50
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,221
you have no alarms, you
have nothing on your door.

51
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:56,890
You guys might wanna consider
something, anything at all.

52
00:01:56,892 --> 00:01:57,898
You came prepared.

53
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,258
Well, yeah, Team Arrow
to Team Bride, you know,

54
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,827
very excited for that
bachelorette party.

55
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,731
Yep, getting inebriated with same gender

56
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:04,986
to celebrate an archaic institution?

57
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,182
Priceless.

58
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:08,068
I mean, you only get married once, so...

59
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,291
Well, actually,

60
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:11,438
pretty much everyone
gets divorced these days.

61
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,840
55% to be exact, I mean,
that's just statistics.

62
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,309
But not... not you and
Iris. That would just...

63
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,178
That would never happen to you guys...

64
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:20,780
Whose feet are those?

65
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:22,596
That's Ralph Dibny.

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,787
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go
meet up with the ladies.

67
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:29,822
That...

68
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,426

69
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:44,721
Well, here you are.

70
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:46,907
Okay, are you ready
for the ladies' nights

71
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,009
to end all ladies' nights?

72
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:51,177
And by that, she means
a quiet, low-key dinner

73
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:53,747
at a very classy restaurant.

74
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:55,282
Yeah. That's exactly what I mean.

75
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:57,017
Super low-key, super quiet...

76
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:58,852
Do you want a pink
or a blue feather boa?

77
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:00,041
Actually, Iris, if it's okay,

78
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:01,345
I don't think I'm gonna make it tonight.

79
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,888
I'm just not feeling up to it.

80
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,916
- What?
- Aww.

81
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,018
Are you feeling okay?

82
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:06,854
No, I'm fine, I just...

83
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:08,757
Sometimes life catches
up with you, you know?

84
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,816
It's 'cause you're
not wearing the tiara.

85
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:11,558
Put on the tiara.
Everything will change. Oh!

86
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,693
- Wearing the tiara, thank you.
- You're welcome.

87
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:15,631
Caitlin, please, come on,
we work together every day

88
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,482
and we never get to do
a dinner just us girls.

89
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:18,463
You have to come.

90
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:20,867
She's right. Just one dinner, please?

91
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,410
Wouldn't miss it.

92
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:29,974
This is so insane.

93
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,544
I can't believe you're
gonna be a mom again.

94
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,998
I know, well, you
always wanted a sibling.

95
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,508
And seven Doctor Whos later,
you totally came through.

96
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:38,349
You're a Doctor Who fan, Joanie?

97
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:39,993
Well, ever since he became a lady, I am.

98
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:41,628
#Feminism.

99
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:44,380
Bachelor party!

100
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,615
Girls, get out.

101
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:48,200
Oh, that's our cue.

102
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:50,003
Hey, Barry, congrats on getting hitched.

103
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:51,738
Thank you! I didn't
realize you were in town.

104
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,106
Well, I just stopped by for the weekend.

105
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,374
Awesome. Good to see you.

106
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:55,342
You too.

107
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,676
Ah.

108
00:03:56,678 --> 00:03:57,911
Have a great time.

109
00:03:57,913 --> 00:03:59,746
Don't get too crazy.

110
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:00,849
- No drinking.
- Mmmm.

111
00:04:00,852 --> 00:04:03,213
No, Iris promised me
a totally chill night

112
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:05,379
that even my pregnant
little booty can handle.

113
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:07,038
You should come with us, sweetie.

114
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,523
You know, I'm sure Iris wouldn't mind.

115
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:09,624
Uh, no, it's okay.

116
00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:10,847
I, um, I actually have plans.

117
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,192
But I will drop you off.

118
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:13,077
Okay.

119
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,633
- Have fun.
- Later, guys.

120
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:15,593
Bye!

121
00:04:15,596 --> 00:04:17,152
Okay, I'll get the lights.

122
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:18,288
Harry will get the brandy.

123
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,658
Hey, Harry, before you pour the brandy,

124
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,567
make sure you warm the glasses.

125
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,178
- What?
- For real?

126
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,045
It's cool.

127
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:28,041
Okay.

128
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:29,809
Barry Allen.

129
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,544
Are you ready to have your mind blown?

130
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:33,335
Meet Barry Allen.

131
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:35,104
Before he met Iris West,

132
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:37,916
before he became an
interdimensional time-traveling

133
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,422
speedster, he was an adorable
baby boy with Ewok-level chub.

134
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:45,030
Ugh, those cheeks.

135
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:47,499
Cisco, this is great, but
where did you get these videos?

136
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:48,795
Man, I'm a ninja. Watch this part.

137
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:52,132
Ah, I forgot you two got married.

138
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,738
Ah, you two were so young.

139
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,274
Damn. I was so young.

140
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:08,281
Gentlemen, I have arrived.

141
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:09,783
- Ralph.
- Dibny.

142
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:11,217
Wasn't expecting you.

143
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:12,405
You said see you later.

144
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:15,175
I assumed this was a superhero
hangout and this was a test

145
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:17,390
for my highly attuned
detective abilities, which,

146
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:19,559
for the record, nailed it.

147
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:20,819
Okay, or...

148
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:22,529
You weren't invited.

149
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,064
Wow, this house is, uh...

150
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:25,343
- Bitchin'?
- No.

151
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:27,467
Small. Looks much
bigger from the street.

152
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:28,735
What's all this crap?

153
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:30,170
This is my bachelor party.

154
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:34,311
Oh, dear God, you're serious.

155
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:36,909
This weinerfest is your bachelor party.

156
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:39,813
This weinerfest is
about to indulge in some

157
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:43,116
very fine cigars and a very
nice steak dinner at The Oak...

158
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:44,818
Okay. Stop.

159
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,053
You're gonna pay $50 for a steak dinner?

160
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,621
- Why not?
- I know a place...

161
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,723
Where you can get all-you-can-eat steak

162
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:55,499
and chicken for $4.99 and
they even throw in napkins.

163
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:57,602
Come on, ladies.

164
00:05:57,605 --> 00:05:58,944
No, really, Ralph.

165
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:00,047
We're gonna stay here,
we're gonna go have...

166
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:01,374
No, Slim Jim.

167
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:04,327
I insist. You can thank me later.

168
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,322
That was meant to be enjoyed.

169
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,458
I enjoyed it.

170
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:08,616
Cisco, don't worry.

171
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:11,910
Where we're going, the drinks
flow freely and the view is...

172
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,346
Ugh. Spectacular.

173
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,323
So fancy.

174
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:25,892
Yeah. A toast to the future Mrs. Allen.

175
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:27,794
- West-Allen.
- West-Allen.

176
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:29,796
Although your life with
Barry may be fast-paced,

177
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:32,232
I hope you guys take the time
to enjoy the special moments.

178
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:33,700
Aww, thank you guys for coming.

179
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:36,569
It really means a lot. Cheers.

180
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:39,239
Well, all right, who wants my champagne?

181
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:41,608
Craziest thing I get to do
tonight is order two desserts.

182
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:42,975
- I'll take it.
- That's right.

183
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:44,762
Iris told me you were
pregnant. How's that going?

184
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:46,218
Yeah, it's g... it's good.

185
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:48,046
I mean, it wasn't
exactly part of my plan,

186
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:50,683
but I just could not be happier.

187
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:53,046
I know exactly what you mean.

188
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:55,088
Oh, yeah, how is everything
with Oliver and William?

189
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:03,296
Do I hear wedding bells
ringing in your future?

190
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:05,148
Oh, no, the last time
we did anything that

191
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:07,900
resembled a wedding, Oliver
got shot with an arrow, so...

192
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:11,855
Uh, did you girls order a stripper?

193
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,195
Why didn't you tell me? I would've
brought all my singles.

194
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:14,530
No, I...

195
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,309
Girl, you into some freaky stuff.

196
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:20,313
Amunet wants you.

197
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,482
Uh, Caitlin, do you know him?

198
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,351
You need to come with me.

199
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:27,187
I'm not going anywhere with you.

200
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:31,124
Please tell me that this
is just part of his act.

201
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:32,625
If it is, it's taking too long.

202
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:34,160
Take it off!

203
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:37,499
Gross!

204
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:39,965
I meant take off your
pants, not your eye!

205
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:45,271
Oh, my God.

206
00:07:57,817 --> 00:07:59,850
Stand back, baby mama, we got this.

207
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:16,367
Holy...

208
00:08:16,369 --> 00:08:17,902
Please don't do this.

209
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:19,977
Didn't have to be this way.

210
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:24,175
What?

211
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:31,615
I was hoping to see you again.

212
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:33,117
Really?

213
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:35,619
So I could give you another scar?

214
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:48,032
Ugh. I hate pink.

215
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:00,811
Doesn't it just take your breath away?

216
00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:07,651
Ladies and gentlemen, that is Jade.

217
00:09:07,653 --> 00:09:10,120
Gentlemen, I welcome
you to The Golden Booty.

218
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:12,056
There ain't nothing
golden about any of this.

219
00:09:12,058 --> 00:09:13,490
- Nope.
- Came through for you.

220
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:15,259
Right, man? What do you think?

221
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:18,062
I think I should've
brought some hand sanitizer.

222
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:19,330
Always come prepared.

223
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:21,765
Ohh, yes.

224
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,667
Ralph, this isn't really my speed.

225
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:25,369
Speed jokes? You're
better than that, Allen.

226
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:26,437
I wasn't...

227
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:28,239
Hey, Ralphy.

228
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:30,808
Uh, Disney, you're a
regular in this joint?

229
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,876
Oh.

230
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:35,246
So much more than that.

231
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:37,014
The girls may not be bottomless,

232
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:40,217
but for yours truly, the
French fries always are.

233
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:42,086
Golden Booty policy.

234
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:44,922
Out of respect for the ladies...
No touching, no pictures,

235
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:47,224
no video, and no cell phones.

236
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:49,393
What?

237
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:53,130
I need a drink.

238
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:55,032
God, I wish I could have a drink.

239
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:58,469
Bro, do you really think
I'd let you down like that?

240
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:00,671
Your special concoction.

241
00:10:00,673 --> 00:10:03,073
Guaranteed to give you
that gentle, pleasant buzz

242
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:05,042
all night long.

243
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:06,469
What if we need the Flash?

244
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,446
I volunteer to be designated superhero.

245
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:11,448
Go for it, Bar, you deserve it.

246
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,818
To Barry and Iris.

247
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,953
To Barry and Iris.

248
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:26,597
They're not picking up.

249
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:27,665
What the hell just happened?

250
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,166
Who was that Medusa man?

251
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,968
You know that is not
a Cisco-approved name.

252
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,937
Don't worry about who that was.

253
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:36,826
Caitlin's taste in
clothes is matched only by

254
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:39,510
her taste in men... Both terrible.

255
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:42,746
Wait, how are you you? I
thought Caitlin was cured.

256
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:46,917
Caitlin shouldn't be keeping
secrets from her friend.

257
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,520
You are friends, right?

258
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:51,221
Yeah, of course we are.

259
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:53,724
Your friend was going
out of town tonight.

260
00:10:53,726 --> 00:10:54,774
What? Why?

261
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:57,327
Because she got herself into
something she couldn't handle.

262
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,665
Where are you going?

263
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:01,332
To find Norvock's boss and to kill her.

264
00:11:01,334 --> 00:11:03,498
And you need a change of
clothes for that because...

265
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:04,335
Whoa!

266
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:05,736
Whoa, okay, apparently somebody

267
00:11:05,738 --> 00:11:07,091
doesn't have boundary issues.

268
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:08,038
Uh, okay, girls,

269
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,606
can I talk to you in the Cortex?

270
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:11,475
Can we take it back for a minute?

271
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:13,911
Since when did her superpowers
make her a supervillain?

272
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:15,602
She is not a villain, okay?

273
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:17,427
I remember being
kidnapped by her last year.

274
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,275
- What?
- Okay, yes, but that is because she was

275
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,111
being manipulated by
Savitar, and in the end,

276
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,016
we wouldn't have been able
to stop him without her.

277
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,590
Look, I know that there
is some good in there.

278
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:29,141
I get it. Technically,
Caitlin is underneath

279
00:11:29,144 --> 00:11:32,095
all of that somewhere,
but she is still dangerous.

280
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:34,275
And she is also our friend, okay?

281
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,568
I am not just gonna
abandon our teammate.

282
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,702
Fine. I'm coming with you.

283
00:11:38,704 --> 00:11:40,738
No, Cecile, you're pregnant.

284
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,473
And your father will
kill me if you get killed

285
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:43,860
at your own bachelorette party.

286
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:45,876
That is some crazy logic
and that means I'm in too.

287
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:47,311
Oh, great, happy bachelorette.

288
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:48,612
What are you all talking about?

289
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:49,766
Oh, nothing, you know,

290
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,268
just talking about how cool
it is to kill people and such.

291
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:54,050
No pun intended.

292
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:56,053
It's been real, ladies.

293
00:11:57,845 --> 00:11:59,623
I'm gonna use the
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

294
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,068
to track her cold signature.

295
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:03,209
Great, I'm gonna try and
call for backup again.

296
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:05,262
And I'll remember that
it's Caitlin under there.

297
00:12:07,266 --> 00:12:08,766
You gotta stop doing that.

298
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:10,701
I'm just getting change for a five.

299
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:13,504
What? Did you think I was stealing?

300
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:17,441
It's not about your
sticky fingers, Ralph,

301
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:19,643
it's about your stretchy
arm outwardly displayed.

302
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:22,646
Oh, so I should be more like
Captain Discreet over there.

303
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:24,281
I'm the Flash!

304
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:27,381
Yeah! Whoo!

305
00:12:27,384 --> 00:12:28,852
I may have slightly miscalculated

306
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:29,887
his bachelor elixir.

307
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,989
I got this one.

308
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:35,159
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey!

309
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:37,227
- How you feeling?
- I feel good.

310
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:39,430
You're gonna need to walk this off.

311
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:40,497
Or run it off.

312
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:42,166
Because I'm the Flash.

313
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:46,804
Let's get you back to the table.

314
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:48,472
Hmm.

315
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:52,176
Barry?

316
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:53,510
What did you just do?

317
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:54,711
I just went

318
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:56,447
and got peanuts from the bar.

319
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:57,881
You didn't even move.

320
00:12:57,883 --> 00:12:59,013
Or did I?

321
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:00,784
- Drink up.
- Oh, I'm good.

322
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:02,240
Ah, it's cranberry juice, buttercup.

323
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:04,387
So I was talking to
Charity... Not her real name...

324
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,057
She tells me the dancers
here make more in a month

325
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:09,026
- than an average teacher...
- Blah, blah, blah.

326
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:10,961
Less talky, more dancey.

327
00:13:10,963 --> 00:13:13,430
Next dancer... it's Jasmine!

328
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:14,565
Whoo!

329
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:21,338
Whoo! Oh, yeah.

330
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,739
Whoo!

331
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:27,611
Oh, hell no.

332
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,680
Hey, she looks like Cecile's daughter.

333
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:32,983
Oh.

334
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:47,197
Ugh!

335
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,217
I'm sorry.

336
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,100
I thought touching without
permission is what you wanted.

337
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:58,185
I'd let me pass.

338
00:13:58,188 --> 00:13:59,483
Unless you wanna know what it feels like

339
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:01,410
when the liquid in your
eyeballs crystallizes.

340
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:04,281
Darling, you're here!

341
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:06,216
Let her in!

342
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:08,685
Let her in, let her in.

343
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:11,255
Amunet.

344
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:13,524
Next time you wanna talk, come yourself.

345
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:16,260
Don't send your eye-hole to attack me.

346
00:14:16,262 --> 00:14:18,428
Did you start a fight?

347
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,330
Honestly, Norvock.

348
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:22,766
That's why you're my
third favorite henchman.

349
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:24,935
I mean, what do I always say?

350
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:27,171
Never start a fight you can't finish.

351
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:29,206
Hmm?

352
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:33,043
And that, my dear, is
why you are my favorite.

353
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:34,311
You listen.

354
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:36,513
Well, apparently, you don't.

355
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:37,915
I'm out, Amunet.

356
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:39,082
Out?

357
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:41,218
Out of what?

358
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,029
Out of options? Out of your mind?

359
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:45,201
Out of the closet?

360
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:48,191
There's just so many
outs for the lady in blue.

361
00:14:48,194 --> 00:14:49,787
Are you asking me to dance?

362
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,857
You should know by now
I don't ask for anything.

363
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,362
I tell, and I take.

364
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:58,465
Now, come along.

365
00:14:58,468 --> 00:15:00,337
I want to show you something that could

366
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:02,773
make us both very rich.

367
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:08,979
All right, do you think
they're gonna be able to tell

368
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:10,614
that we don't exactly fit in here?

369
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:13,317
Well, it was your idea
to wear boas, so no.

370
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:15,219
Have we heard from the guys yet?

371
00:15:15,221 --> 00:15:17,054
No. Look.

372
00:15:17,056 --> 00:15:20,557
Ladies, okay, we are on our own, okay?

373
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,692
How about a little love?

374
00:15:21,694 --> 00:15:22,960
No! No, no, no, no, no.

375
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,328
No. No love.

376
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,029
- Engaged. Okay, bye.
- No love.

377
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:29,882
Is it just me, or does it seem like

378
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:32,201
everybody here already bought
what that guy is selling?

379
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:37,007
Uh, ladies, stay here, okay?

380
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:39,910
I think I know where Frost is.

381
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:42,512
You got a pet. Congratulations.

382
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:45,515
I call him The Weeper.

383
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:46,883
I love naming metas.

384
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:49,319
I know someone else like that.

385
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:52,256
Three weeks ago, this young
man became a meta-human

386
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:56,493
and I acquired my new favorite
product to sell in my network.

387
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:59,329
Did you notice?

388
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,565
Love...

389
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:04,234
is quite literally in the air.

390
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:07,504
Do you know why?

391
00:16:07,506 --> 00:16:09,439
Oh.

392
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Pure.

393
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:33,597
His tears are a drug?

394
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:35,632
His tears, my dear...

395
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:37,934
Are a gold mine.

396
00:16:37,936 --> 00:16:41,371
One taste and Central City

397
00:16:41,373 --> 00:16:43,507
will be hooked.

398
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,245
Then why do you need me?

399
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:49,607
Really?

400
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,548
Well, if I'm going to
be selling something

401
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,684
quite valuable, I'm
going to need protection.

402
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:56,653
That's what you've got
good old snake-eye for.

403
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,659
A deal like this

404
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:05,262
requires a lady's touch.

405
00:17:05,264 --> 00:17:07,164
I-in your case, strength,

406
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:09,373
and I'll cut you in for 10%.

407
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:14,271
15%, and I throw in not
killing you right now

408
00:17:14,273 --> 00:17:16,540
for your misguided rebellion.
And that is only because

409
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:19,743
I've got forgiveness
in my kidneys, right?

410
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,045
I think you meant heart.

411
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:24,348
No, there's no beat beat
in this chest, sister.

412
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:27,117
As much fun it is to play
"I'm the bigger badass,"

413
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,619
I'm bored. And like I said...

414
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:32,089
I'm done.

415
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:37,194
Do you know what everyone's
mistake in business is?

416
00:17:37,196 --> 00:17:39,096
Hmm?

417
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:43,967
Not realizing who has
the power in the room.

418
00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:53,777
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

419
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,879
Hey, hey, hey.

420
00:17:55,881 --> 00:18:00,016
Ladies, ladies, let's put
the meta-abilities down.

421
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:01,718
I'm sorry, who is this chick?

422
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,054
Oh, uh, this chick... Oh.

423
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:05,822
Is trying to stop a meta-fight

424
00:18:05,824 --> 00:18:08,974
from destroying your
very enchanting club.

425
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:10,127
Let's go.

426
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:17,801
Frost.

427
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:18,948
Let's go.

428
00:18:25,878 --> 00:18:27,444
Should I stop her?

429
00:18:27,446 --> 00:18:29,780
No.

430
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:33,013
Let her think she can walk away.

431
00:18:38,861 --> 00:18:40,694
You're lucky she didn't kill you, West.

432
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:41,657
Who was that?

433
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,293
That was Amunet Black.

434
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,470
Of the underground market?

435
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:45,971
Oh, I'm guessing this
chick has a criminal record.

436
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:48,044
Yeah, she's been linked to
the meta-human black market

437
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:49,228
selling stolen technology,

438
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:50,877
but we've never been
able to nail her down.

439
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,345
And how do you know her?

440
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:53,970
Through Caitlin. Six months ago,

441
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:55,906
Caitlin thought she had
everything under control.

442
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:58,244
Can't keep a good bad side
down for long, am I right?

443
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:00,280
She felt me becoming much stronger.

444
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:02,182
She found out that Amunet had some tech

445
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,084
that would let her stay in charge.

446
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:07,054
She got desperate, so
she decided to use it.

447
00:19:07,056 --> 00:19:08,397
But it came with a price tag.

448
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,923
Which... which was?

449
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,792
Being her muscle.

450
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:13,501
Did you kill anyone?

451
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:18,498
Some people lost their
fingers and their toes, but...

452
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,689
no, no one died.

453
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,269
And how are you here now?

454
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:24,972
While Caitlin sleeps, I am awake.

455
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:27,607
Oh, my God! You're like The
Incredible Hulk! That's...

456
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:29,170
I said that with too much chutzpah.

457
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:31,011
- Yeah.
- Dialing it back.

458
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:33,480
Look, what are Amunet's
plans for The Weeper?

459
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:34,815
Not my problem.

460
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:35,893
Look, he was on that bus.

461
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:37,629
We helped create him.
We need to save him.

462
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:39,885
No. I need to leave and escape Amunet.

463
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,134
And you're just gonna run away?

464
00:19:41,137 --> 00:19:43,589
Listen, there's a reason
the CCPD has not caught her.

465
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:45,125
And that you idiots just realized

466
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:46,727
there's a major crime lord living

467
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:48,528
under your noses for
the past three years.

468
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,465
She's too powerful. We can't stop her.

469
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:52,899
Guys, we have a responsibility

470
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,337
to The Weeper and to the city.

471
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,773
What do you suggest we do?

472
00:19:55,776 --> 00:19:57,375
We need to rescue him before Amunet

473
00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:58,978
does whatever she's planning, okay?

474
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,981
Cecile, you need to gather
information on Amunet,

475
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:03,176
and, Felicity, you need to pull
up the blueprint to the club.

476
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:05,178
We got this.

477
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,613
We're strong women.

478
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:08,015
Yeah.

479
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:09,282
#Feminism.

480
00:20:09,345 --> 00:20:10,970
#Feminism.

481
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:12,919
#Feminism.

482
00:20:14,957 --> 00:20:16,556
This isn't what you think, Joe.

483
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:18,058
Good, 'cause I thought I saw you dancing

484
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,826
on that stage in a gold sequin bikini.

485
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:22,062
No, I'm writing a book
on the female experience.

486
00:20:22,064 --> 00:20:23,296
I'd buy that book.

487
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:26,366
Shake it, baby!

488
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:28,468
Why does your female experience

489
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,303
include you dancing at The Golden Booty?

490
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:31,772
Because we live in a society

491
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:33,607
that's dictated by the male gaze.

492
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,076
I wanna control the
narrative of feminism, okay?

493
00:20:36,078 --> 00:20:39,046
I wanna show the world that
a powerful, strong woman...

494
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:40,347
She can wear anything,

495
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:42,849
be it a bikini or a pantsuit.

496
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:44,518
Or nothing. Feminism.

497
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,486
That's not how feminism works.

498
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:48,021
Will you cut it out?

499
00:20:48,023 --> 00:20:49,756
Joanie's practically his daughter.

500
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:52,325
Hey.

501
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:55,028
Sad Flash, why the face?

502
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,797
Nothing, I just...

503
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,501
I just love chicken wings so much.

504
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:10,010
Where are you gonna go?

505
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:12,245
I know a guy who can
breach me to another Earth.

506
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:14,381
Start over. Escape Amunet.

507
00:21:14,383 --> 00:21:16,116
Be who I wanna be.

508
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:20,220
And that's Killer Frost, right?

509
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:23,457
Don't be cute, West. You can't stop me.

510
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,592
I wasn't planning on it.

511
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:27,961
Look, I know you could kill me.

512
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:29,729
Just like you could've
killed Amunet tonight

513
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:32,599
or Cisco six months ago.

514
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:35,402
But you didn't.

515
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:38,638
There is a part of you that is good.

516
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,540
And decent.

517
00:21:40,542 --> 00:21:43,910
You just don't know how to accept it.

518
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:45,912
You think you know me now?

519
00:21:45,914 --> 00:21:47,212
No.

520
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:50,750
But I do know what Caitlin
looks like when she's scared.

521
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:54,888
And you have that same
look in your eyes right now.

522
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,823
You're just as afraid of being Caitlin

523
00:21:56,825 --> 00:21:59,559
as Caitlin is of being Killer Frost.

524
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,729
If you still wanna have a hand

525
00:22:02,731 --> 00:22:04,531
for Barry to put a ring on,

526
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,466
I suggest you move it.

527
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:15,041
There's a strong, powerful woman

528
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:18,945
that we both love and fear

529
00:22:18,947 --> 00:22:21,009
and her name is your mother.

530
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:23,382
- Does she know you work here?
- Of course not.

531
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,619
She would just jump to all the
same conclusions that you are.

532
00:22:25,621 --> 00:22:27,587
Joanie, your mother and I
just want you to be happy.

533
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:29,422
But I think you need to ask yourself

534
00:22:29,424 --> 00:22:32,526
why you're keeping
this a secret from her.

535
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:34,494
Joe?

536
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,029
Why didn't...

537
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:38,932
Rose make room for Jack on the door?

538
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:41,535
There was plenty of
room for both of them.

539
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:45,739
Uh, Cisco, when does this
gift of yours stop giving?

540
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,321
Man, I don't know.

541
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,179
I thought we'd be watching
home movies right now.

542
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:51,611
Again, you are welcome.

543
00:22:51,613 --> 00:22:53,280
You steal $20 from me, Ralphy?

544
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,015
When? I mean... No.

545
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:56,016
Yeah, you did.

546
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:57,321
I saw it.

547
00:22:57,324 --> 00:22:59,286
I've been waiting a
long time for this, Dibs.

548
00:23:00,389 --> 00:23:02,189
Oh!

549
00:23:02,191 --> 00:23:04,824
You monster!

550
00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:19,339
Everybody, stop! I'm a cop!

551
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:21,474
I'm the Flash!

552
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:27,981
You're late.

553
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:35,222
I'm right on time.

554
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:38,225
What, were you expecting
a different meta?

555
00:23:38,227 --> 00:23:41,161
Nobody walks away from me, Frost.

556
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:06,253
Did you really think
I was going to let you

557
00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:09,422
just breach into the sunset?

558
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:11,825
You owe me your life.

559
00:24:28,443 --> 00:24:30,377
And I always take what I'm owed.

560
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:32,746
Hands over your head, ma'am.

561
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:41,859
Is there any part of
the way that I'm dressed

562
00:24:41,862 --> 00:24:44,757
that leads you to believe
I want to be called ma'am?

563
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,893
Hmm?

564
00:24:54,469 --> 00:24:55,635
Ugh.

565
00:24:58,006 --> 00:24:59,606
Blood.

566
00:25:07,482 --> 00:25:09,703
Kill you later, Caity.

567
00:25:22,576 --> 00:25:24,777
Let me help you.

568
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,780
Please.

569
00:25:29,016 --> 00:25:31,750
Okay.

570
00:25:31,752 --> 00:25:34,219
It's already knotted, you
just have to pull it tight.

571
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:38,697
Thanks.

572
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,333
Yeah.

573
00:25:43,597 --> 00:25:45,798
What happened?

574
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,432
You don't remember?

575
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:49,034
When she's in control,

576
00:25:49,036 --> 00:25:52,271
I don't remember much of what happens.

577
00:25:52,273 --> 00:25:56,341
Did she... I hurt anyone?

578
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:59,380
Just that snake-eyed scumbag.

579
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:01,150
Didn't kill him, though.

580
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,860
So the cure, it...

581
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,122
Didn't work.

582
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,607
Not all the way.

583
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,254
Which is why you
wanted to leave tonight?

584
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:12,491
And why it took you
six months to come back?

585
00:26:12,493 --> 00:26:14,159
When Cisco said he was
gonna get Barry back

586
00:26:14,161 --> 00:26:17,129
from the Speed Force,
I thought that maybe

587
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:19,231
I could come back and make up for some

588
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:20,365
of the pain that I caused,

589
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:23,349
but she's getting stronger.

590
00:26:24,754 --> 00:26:26,387
I never should've come back.

591
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,669
That's not true, Caitlin.

592
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:29,575
You can always come
back to your friends.

593
00:26:29,577 --> 00:26:31,677
Why didn't you tell any of us?

594
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,364
I didn't know who to talk to.

595
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:35,147
Could've talked to me.

596
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:36,748
I'm your friend, Caitlin.

597
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,650
Work friend.

598
00:26:38,652 --> 00:26:40,853
I mean, it's not like you
and I have become besties

599
00:26:40,855 --> 00:26:43,555
over the last few years.

600
00:26:43,557 --> 00:26:45,290
Yeah, I guess we haven't.

601
00:26:54,101 --> 00:26:55,841
Hey!

602
00:26:55,844 --> 00:26:57,803
Jerry, buddy,

603
00:26:57,805 --> 00:27:00,339
we gonna get that phone call or what?

604
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:01,807
Hey! Come on, man.

605
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,108
I know you can hear me.

606
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,377
I'm right here. Hello!

607
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:08,480
Okay, great.

608
00:27:08,482 --> 00:27:11,016
You just know everybody, don't you?

609
00:27:11,018 --> 00:27:12,985
I've been in here a few times.

610
00:27:12,987 --> 00:27:14,920
You know, I could
wiggle through these bars

611
00:27:14,922 --> 00:27:16,161
and get us out of here.

612
00:27:16,164 --> 00:27:18,857
Maybe make my finger into a
key, that'd be pretty sweet.

613
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:21,260
A lot of pressure put on
the index finger, though.

614
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:23,778
Iron versus flesh.

615
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:25,247
What do you think?

616
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,265
I think you should stop
talking immediately.

617
00:27:27,268 --> 00:27:30,702
Oh.

618
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:32,437
Ugh.

619
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:34,840
I don't ever have to drink again.

620
00:27:34,842 --> 00:27:38,043
Words uttered by everybody
who's ever had too many.

621
00:27:38,045 --> 00:27:39,011
Here.

622
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:41,680
Ugh.

623
00:27:41,682 --> 00:27:44,082
This was a bust, huh?

624
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:46,818
Bachelor party.

625
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,621
Happens.

626
00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:51,456
What's up with you?

627
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,716
All night, you've seemed preoccupied.

628
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,156
I'm worried.

629
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,299
About what?

630
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:02,567
Being a dad again. I'm almost 50, Bar.

631
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:03,458
Mm-hmm.

632
00:28:03,461 --> 00:28:06,971
When I saw that video
Cisco made of you and Iris

633
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:08,974
when you were kids, I...

634
00:28:08,976 --> 00:28:12,244
Hit me like a ton of bricks.

635
00:28:12,246 --> 00:28:15,547
I was... I was young the
first time I did this.

636
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:19,084
- Mm-hmm.
- And seeing Joanie?

637
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:20,752
Ugh.

638
00:28:20,754 --> 00:28:23,088
It's hard raising humans, Bar.

639
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,489
You'll be fine.

640
00:28:24,491 --> 00:28:26,959
I barely get enough sleep as it is

641
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:29,461
worrying about you three.

642
00:28:29,463 --> 00:28:31,763
Especially with Wally being gone.

643
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:33,699
Add to that a crazy baby schedule.

644
00:28:33,701 --> 00:28:36,134
Feeding, the crying...

645
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:39,771
I'm honestly scared to death.

646
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:42,841
Joe, when you raised
Iris, you were alone.

647
00:28:42,843 --> 00:28:45,310
When you took me in, you were alone.

648
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:48,380
And, you know, when Wally
showed up, you were alone.

649
00:28:48,382 --> 00:28:50,949
You did all that by yourself.

650
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:52,193
Single parent.

651
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:54,786
No one could've done
a better job, no one.

652
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:57,656
Now you've got a partner.

653
00:28:57,658 --> 00:28:59,099
You've got family.

654
00:28:59,102 --> 00:29:01,259
You've always been there
for us when we've needed you,

655
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,328
and now it's just our
turn to do that for you.

656
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:06,331
We will.

657
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:13,271
I know you will.

658
00:29:16,343 --> 00:29:17,943
I'll take those three.

659
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:20,863
Four.

660
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,283
These tears are more than just water.

661
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:36,595
When ingested, the dark matter inside it

662
00:29:36,597 --> 00:29:39,364
alters the brain function like
that of a psychoactive drug.

663
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:41,153
So it's like, what, an opioid?

664
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:43,680
It's like a love drug.

665
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:44,974
From tears.

666
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:46,740
If this spreads, Central
City's gonna have a massive

667
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:48,241
- drug problem on its hands.
- Oh, yeah.

668
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,111
Okay, well, we need to stop Amunet

669
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:52,380
and save The Weeper before that happens.

670
00:29:52,383 --> 00:29:53,649
How do we find her?

671
00:29:53,652 --> 00:29:55,485
I don't know. She's smart.

672
00:29:55,488 --> 00:29:58,717
Off the grid, always on the
move, never leaves a trail.

673
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:00,099
Okay, well, what about her powers?

674
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:01,987
The metal that she controls.
Do you know what it is?

675
00:30:01,989 --> 00:30:04,356
Some kind of alnico alloy.

676
00:30:04,358 --> 00:30:06,591
Do you think you could use
our satellites to track it?

677
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:08,393
You mean run a geological
scan of the city for

678
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:11,096
small-scale signatures of
aluminum, nickel, and cobalt?

679
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:13,031
Girl, please.

680
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,027
There. She's headed to Lawrence Hills.

681
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,904
That's... that's all
industrial out there.

682
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:20,539
That's steel mills, docks, warehouses.

683
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:22,007
Okay, we need to stop her.

684
00:30:22,009 --> 00:30:24,042
- Okay.
- Guys, I can't go with you.

685
00:30:24,044 --> 00:30:28,213
If I lose control, I
could become a liability.

686
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:31,116
I'm sorry, Iris, I can't go.

687
00:30:31,118 --> 00:30:33,485
You don't have to.

688
00:30:33,487 --> 00:30:34,886
We got this.

689
00:30:34,888 --> 00:30:37,289
Okay?

690
00:30:58,278 --> 00:31:00,178
Ladies, what's your status?

691
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,780
We're in position.

692
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:04,683
I think you'll be pleased.

693
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:11,756
This is him?

694
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:13,146
Mm.

695
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:24,102
Good boy.

696
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,333
Sample?

697
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:45,056
I'll take him.

698
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:48,827
- On my count, we move.
- Okay.

699
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:50,829
One, two...

700
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:53,365
Three.

701
00:32:03,194 --> 00:32:06,461
I remember you.

702
00:32:06,463 --> 00:32:10,094
You are the chick from the bar, hmm?

703
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,132
Oh, no.

704
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:19,107
Hey, Amunet.

705
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:26,849
This is between you and me.

706
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:30,886
Let my friends go and I'll
come back and work for you.

707
00:32:30,888 --> 00:32:32,421
Oh.

708
00:32:32,423 --> 00:32:34,723
It's... it's too late for that, Caity.

709
00:32:34,725 --> 00:32:36,592
Do you know why

710
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:40,562
no one has ever testified
against me over the years, hmm?

711
00:32:40,564 --> 00:32:43,465
Well, it's because they're not alive to.

712
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:47,970
Sorry.

713
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:49,504
Take care of them.

714
00:32:53,377 --> 00:32:55,377
No!

715
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:07,489
Well, hello, Chilly.

716
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:09,324
We gotta get out of here.

717
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,096
And I thought I wasn't going

718
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:15,742
to be able to kill anyone today.

719
00:33:24,867 --> 00:33:27,001
Kill them!

720
00:33:28,946 --> 00:33:31,315
I don't think this is
gonna hold much longer.

721
00:33:31,318 --> 00:33:33,081
Well, this is a steel factory.

722
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,583
And you move steel plates with...

723
00:33:34,585 --> 00:33:35,817
Magnets.

724
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:37,653
Really, really big magnets.

725
00:33:39,556 --> 00:33:40,989
Cecile, turn the crane on.

726
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:42,591
What? How?

727
00:33:42,593 --> 00:33:44,059
Uh, should be in the schematics, just...

728
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:45,661
Just highlight it and turn it on.

729
00:33:45,663 --> 00:33:47,496
Okay, um...

730
00:33:59,276 --> 00:34:00,776
Ohh.

731
00:34:02,646 --> 00:34:05,781
You and I could have been gods.

732
00:34:05,783 --> 00:34:07,549
I used to work with a god.

733
00:34:07,551 --> 00:34:09,151
Over it.

734
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:11,406
Cecile, now!

735
00:34:26,537 --> 00:34:29,938
Not so scary without your
bling now, are ya, sister?

736
00:34:32,685 --> 00:34:33,775
Stop!

737
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,746
Caitlin, stop.

738
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:39,514
I'm not Caitlin.

739
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:41,450
And I'll never be free unless she dies.

740
00:34:41,452 --> 00:34:42,976
No, it's the opposite.

741
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:44,987
You are free right now.

742
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:47,889
But if you do this, you
will always be a killer.

743
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:49,174
Killer Frost, Caitlin...

744
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:50,759
You don't have to be one or the other.

745
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:52,794
You get to decide who you are.

746
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:01,937
Get out of here.

747
00:35:01,939 --> 00:35:04,306
You've ruined this for me today.

748
00:35:04,308 --> 00:35:08,477
And one day soon, I promise you
I will ruin something for you.

749
00:35:14,318 --> 00:35:16,084
Hold on.

750
00:35:16,086 --> 00:35:17,652
It's okay, okay?

751
00:35:17,654 --> 00:35:19,521
We're gonna help you.

752
00:35:19,523 --> 00:35:21,123
- Get away from me.
- Wha...

753
00:35:24,328 --> 00:35:26,561
The police are on their way.

754
00:35:26,563 --> 00:35:29,398
We did it, guys. We really did it.

755
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,100
Actually, it's girls.

756
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:43,241
I'm gonna have a headache
now until my wedding day.

757
00:35:43,243 --> 00:35:44,255
Worth it.

758
00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:46,211
Agree to never speak about
what happened tonight?

759
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:47,779
- Agreed.
- If I have to.

760
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,480
What?

761
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:50,849
- Hey.
- Hey.

762
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:53,318
I saw you called 17
times, everything okay?

763
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,053
Oh, yeah, everything is fine.

764
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:56,287
How was your night?

765
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:58,590
Ummm, good.

766
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,691
Quiet.

767
00:35:59,693 --> 00:36:01,226
- Uneventful.
- Yours?

768
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:03,628
Uh, yeah, yeah, not much happened.

769
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,297
You know what? We
actually had a few scrapes.

770
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:07,765
Honestly, so did we.

771
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:09,434
Some tears were involved.

772
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:10,868
Yeah, us too.

773
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,244
More crying. Then puking.

774
00:36:13,247 --> 00:36:14,505
Aww.

775
00:36:14,507 --> 00:36:17,242
Lost access to the
happiest place on Earth.

776
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:21,145
Pretty sure nothing could've
made tonight any worse.

777
00:36:23,817 --> 00:36:25,310
I'm so tired.

778
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:28,653
I'm so tired, can we just
do this tomorrow, please?

779
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:31,022
Aw, chicks with white hair.

780
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,257
Hot.

781
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:34,058
Why is Killer Frost here?

782
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,860
Guys...

783
00:36:35,862 --> 00:36:39,163
she has something that
she wants to tell you,

784
00:36:39,165 --> 00:36:41,566
and you all should listen.

785
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:54,412
Aww.

786
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:55,541
It's just Caitlin.

787
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,550
I can explain everything.

788
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,138
Hey, Joe.

789
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:11,540
Hey.

790
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:13,464
Uh, when you got arrested,

791
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:15,066
I figured you'd be okay
'cause you're a cop,

792
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,534
but still.

793
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:19,270
Yeah, we're all fine.

794
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:22,340
How was the rest of your night?

795
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:25,043
It was fine.

796
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:26,344
Joe, I'm gonna do what I want.

797
00:37:26,346 --> 00:37:28,179
I know. You're an adult.

798
00:37:28,181 --> 00:37:30,817
I was not trying to tell you what to do.

799
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,483
But if I'm being honest,

800
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:34,452
I know that I took it too far tonight.

801
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:37,155
And what about your feminist research?

802
00:37:37,157 --> 00:37:40,291
I still believe everything I was saying.

803
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:41,677
But after we talked, I realized

804
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,661
that's not why I'm working there.

805
00:37:43,663 --> 00:37:44,762
So I'm gonna quit.

806
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:48,132
Are you gonna tell Mom?

807
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:49,534
That's not my secret to tell.

808
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:52,303
But your mom loves you.

809
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:54,772
And she'll always listen if you let her.

810
00:37:56,576 --> 00:37:58,876
Just got my first craving.

811
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,480
Hi, you two.

812
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:04,182
How was your night?

813
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:06,551
Uh, it was fine. Nothing happened. You?

814
00:38:06,553 --> 00:38:08,186
Oh.

815
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:09,320
Same.

816
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:10,888
- Super chill.
- Mm.

817
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,239
I'm gonna head to bed, but, um,

818
00:38:12,242 --> 00:38:14,492
do you wanna do breakfast
in the morning and just talk?

819
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:16,194
Yeah, sweetie, I'd like that.

820
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:17,695
- Okay.
- Okay.

821
00:38:17,697 --> 00:38:20,231
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

822
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:24,836
- I gotta tell you something.
- Mm.

823
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,938
This kid of ours?

824
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,807
Definitely not a vegetarian.

825
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:33,578
This kid of ours.

826
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,413
Cecile, I gotta tell you.

827
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:38,291
I never thought I'd even
have a second chance at love,

828
00:38:38,294 --> 00:38:41,386
and here you are. You're my everything.

829
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:46,424
To top that miracle,
we're having this baby.

830
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:47,792
It's exciting.

831
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:50,795
Is it okay to say that I'm scared?

832
00:38:50,797 --> 00:38:53,197
I'm so glad that you told me that.

833
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,032
'Cause I am terrified.

834
00:38:55,034 --> 00:38:56,667
- Really?
- Yes. Really.

835
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:58,836
I-I thought that I'd
finally hit this groove

836
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:01,472
in my life and my career and with you,

837
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:06,144
and now this changes everything.

838
00:39:06,146 --> 00:39:08,613
The last thing I thought at
our age, we'd be having a baby.

839
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:11,215
I know.

840
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:12,717
It's scary.

841
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,753
But I figure pretty much all we gotta do

842
00:39:15,755 --> 00:39:18,823
is love this baby as much
as we love each other.

843
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:23,327
- That's a lot of love.
- Yeah.

844
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,529
- Mm.
- Mm.

845
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,399
So much for quiet and classy, right?

846
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:30,568
Not exactly the bachelorette
party you had in mind.

847
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,737
Well, saving the city wasn't
a bad way to spend the night.

848
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,939
But the best part of
the night was spending it

849
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:36,202
with the ladies of Team Flash.

850
00:39:36,205 --> 00:39:37,299
It was.

851
00:39:37,302 --> 00:39:39,043
When we weren't almost getting killed.

852
00:39:39,045 --> 00:39:40,978
Yeah, we should do it more often.

853
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,079
We should.

854
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:43,143
The hanging out part,

855
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:44,682
not the almost getting killed part.

856
00:39:44,684 --> 00:39:46,551
I'd like that.

857
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:50,021
Actually, I wanted to ask
you a favor about the wedding.

858
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:52,226
Oh, you want a custom ice sculpture?

859
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:53,858
No.

860
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,408
Um...

861
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:59,797
I wanted to know if you
wanted to be my maid of honor.

862
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:01,166
Me?

863
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:02,900
Yeah, we're more than work friends,

864
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:05,369
and we've been through a lot together.

865
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:08,539
Weddings are all about
new beginnings, right?

866
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:10,038
So what do you say?

867
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,610
You wanna stand up for me?

868
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:14,783
I do.

869
00:40:14,786 --> 00:40:16,647
I guess that's your line, though, right?

870
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,679
Thank you.

871
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:26,023
- I'm so excited.
- I know.

872
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,592
Do I have a bridesmaid's dress?

873
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,126
Of course.

874
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:59,756
I went to a lot of trouble...

875
00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:02,426
creating you.

876
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,098
I can't have you running away.

877
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:10,768
Not until you've completed the task

878
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,803
for which you were born.

879
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:23,314
