It could have been a burglary.

167
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,051
Maybe the killer didn't know
who the Comedian was.

168
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:06,973
RORSCHACH: An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.

169
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,978
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77...

170
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,314
...knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

171
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,401
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

172
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,860
Maybe.

173
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,281
Maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

RORSCHACH:
Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

180
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,632
He wrote that book. Said some bad things
about the Comedian in it.

A normal life?

Why does one death matter
against so many?

210
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:42,503
Because there is good and evil,
and evil must be punished.

that someone plans to murder him.

JON:
Good evening, Rorschach.

321
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,918
RORSCHACH:
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

322

JON:
Yes...

...but you're going to leave disappointed.

324

RORSCHACH:
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

JON:
The Comedian is dead.

331
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,900
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

332
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,694
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

333

Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

334

Even if I wanted to help...

335
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:58,540
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

336

-I cannot see it clearly.
-Interference? Caused by what?

337

In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

338

If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

339
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,599
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

340
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:20,729
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

341
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,691
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

someone wants us out of the way?

345

demands less obvious heroism.

2193
03:11:22,262 --> 03:11:24,263
Your...

2194
03:11:24,431 --> 03:11:29,393
...schoolboy heroics are redundant.
What have they achieved?

2195
03:11:31,021 --> 03:11:33,898
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation...

2196
03:11:34,858 --> 03:11:37,234
...is your only triumph.

2197
03:11:37,444 --> 03:11:39,361
JON:
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

2198
03:11:40,155 --> 03:11:43,657
I'm very disappointed.

2199
03:11:56,046 --> 03:11:59,215
Reassembling myself
was the first trick I learned.

2200
03:11:59,883 --> 03:12:02,259
It didn't kill Osterman.

2201
03:12:04,888 --> 03:12:07,264
Did you really think it would kill me?

2202
03:12:08,558 --> 03:12:11,727
I have walked across the surface
of the sun.

2203
03:12:12,229 --> 03:12:15,397
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast...

2204
03:12:15,565 --> 03:12:18,609
...they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all...

2205
03:12:18,777 --> 03:12:22,446
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.

2206
03:12:23,573 --> 03:12:26,075
The world's smartest man...

2207
03:12:26,368 --> 03:12:28,786
...poses no more threat to me...

2208
03:12:28,954 --> 03:12:32,122
...than does its smartest termite.

2209
03:12:34,376 --> 03:12:35,834
What's that?

2210
03:12:36,253 --> 03:12:38,128
Another ultimate weapon?

2211
03:12:38,755 --> 03:12:40,464
Yes.

2212
03:12:42,092 --> 03:12:43,551
You could say that.

--came under attack.

2214
03:12:49,849 --> 03:12:53,185
Millions of lives were suddenly ended...

2215
03:12:53,520 --> 03:12:58,732
...in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.

2216
03:13:00,527 --> 03:13:04,488
Since the attacks,
I have been in constant contact...

2217
03:13:04,656 --> 03:13:07,658
...with the premier of the U.S.S.R.

2218
03:13:08,034 --> 03:13:10,869
Putting aside our past differences...

2219
03:13:11,204 --> 03:13:13,372
...we have both pledged to unite...

2220
03:13:13,707 --> 03:13:17,042
...against this common enemy.

2221
03:13:17,544 --> 03:13:19,545
With the rest of the world...

2222
03:13:20,005 --> 03:13:22,006
...we will prevail.

2223
03:13:24,551 --> 03:13:27,553
This is a day we shall never forget.

2224
03:13:27,721 --> 03:13:31,932
And yet we go forward
to defend the human race...

2225
03:13:32,100 --> 03:13:36,729
...and all that is good
and just in our world.

2226
03:13:38,064 --> 03:13:42,318
Thank you. God bless us all.

2227

ADRIAN:
Do you see?

2228
03:13:46,698 --> 03:13:49,158
Two superpowers retreating from war.

2229
03:13:50,744 --> 03:13:53,203
I've saved the earth from hell.

2230
03:13:53,371 --> 03:13:55,331
We both have.

2231
03:13:55,790 --> 03:13:58,000
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

2232
03:14:02,797 --> 03:14:04,298
Now we can return...

2233
03:14:05,717 --> 03:14:07,301
...do what we were meant to.

2234
03:14:07,552 --> 03:14:10,429
We were meant to exact justice.

2235
03:14:10,764 --> 03:14:14,099
-Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
-Will they?

2236
03:14:14,267 --> 03:14:19,063
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

2237
03:14:19,230 --> 03:14:22,691
-Peace based on a lie.
-But peace...

2238
03:14:22,859 --> 03:14:25,069
-...nonetheless.
-He's right.

2239
03:14:25,612 --> 03:14:29,573
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world
to nuclear destruction again.

2240
03:14:29,741 --> 03:14:32,618
No. We can't do this.

2241
03:14:32,786 --> 03:14:34,578
On Mars...

2242
03:14:36,081 --> 03:14:37,915
...you taught me the value of life.

2243
03:14:38,875 --> 03:14:41,293
If we hope to preserve it here...

2244
03:14:42,087 --> 03:14:44,129
...we must remain silent.

2245
03:14:47,967 --> 03:14:49,927
Keep your own secrets.

2246
03:14:56,768 --> 03:14:57,976
Don't even think about it.

Wait.

03:15:06,653 --> 03:15:08,779
Never compromise.

2250
03:15:09,114 --> 03:15:11,990
Not even in the face of armageddon.

2251
03:15:12,409 --> 03:15:15,411
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

2252
03:15:26,464 --> 03:15:29,967
I've made myself feel every death...

2253
03:15:31,469 --> 03:15:37,349
...see every innocent face
I've murdered to save humanity.

2254
03:15:42,939 --> 03:15:46,650
-You understand, don't you?
JON: Without condoning...

2255
03:15:48,319 --> 03:15:50,195
...or condemning...

2256
03:15:54,617 --> 03:15:56,535
...I understand.

2257
03:16:03,960 --> 03:16:07,087
Out of my way. People have to be told.

2258
03:16:07,964 --> 03:16:09,882
You know I can't let you do that.

2259
03:16:11,134 --> 03:16:14,136
Suddenly you discover humanity?

2260
03:16:15,555 --> 03:16:17,389
Convenient.

2261
03:16:26,107 --> 03:16:30,694
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

2262
03:16:34,449 --> 03:16:37,409
I can change almost anything...

2263
03:16:41,998 --> 03:16:44,333
...but I can't change human nature.

2264
03:16:45,668 --> 03:16:49,046
Of course
you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

2265
03:16:50,340 --> 03:16:53,675
What's one more body

No!

for one a little less complicated.

LAURIE: I thought you said you cared
about life again.

2272
03:17:46,312 --> 03:17:47,729
JON:
I do.

2273
03:17:49,065 --> 03:17:51,942
I think maybe I'll create some.

There had to be sacrifice.

No! You haven't idealized mankind,
you've deformed it.

03:18:54,631 --> 03:18:56,381
You've mutilated it.
