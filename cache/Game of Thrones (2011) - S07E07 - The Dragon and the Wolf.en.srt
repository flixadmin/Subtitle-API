about our new queen?

Perhaps you've been
reconsidering your allegiances.

97

whatever they're paying
you, I'll pay double.

what now, exactly?

wasn't exactly looking
after yourself, was it?

We are a group of people who
do not like one another,

165
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,506
as this recent demonstration has shown.

166
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:46,296
We have suffered at each other's hands.

167
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:49,672
We have lost people we love
at each other's hands.

168
00:17:49,673 --> 00:17:51,964
If all we wanted was more of the same,

169
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:54,213
there would be no need
for this gathering.

170
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:57,255
We are entirely capable of
waging war against each other

171
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:58,964
without meeting face-to-face.

172
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:00,839
So instead, we should
settle our differences

173
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,505
and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

174
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:04,922
We all know that will never happen.

175
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:06,297
Then why are we here?

176
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:11,673
This isn't about living in harmony.

177
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:14,964
It's just about living.

178
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:17,547
The same thing is coming for all of us.

179
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:19,588
A general you can't negotiate with.

180
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:23,338
An army that doesn't leave corpses
behind on the battlefield.

181
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:26,922
Lord Tyrion tells me a million
people live in this city.

182
00:18:26,923 --> 00:18:30,338
They're about to become a million more
soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

183
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:33,047
I imagine for most of them
it would be an improvement.

184
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:38,631
This is serious.

185
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:41,797
I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

186
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:43,630
I don't think it's serious at all.

187
00:18:43,631 --> 00:18:45,088
I think it's another bad joke.

188
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:47,839
If my brother Jaime has
informed me correctly,

189
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,463
you're asking me for a truce.

190
00:18:49,464 --> 00:18:52,006
Yes. That's all.

191
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,089
That's all?

192
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:58,046
Pull back my armies and stand down

193
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:59,755
while you go on your monster hunt.

194
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:02,338
Or while you solidify and
expand your position.

195
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,714
Hard for me to know which it
is with my armies pulled back

196
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:10,380
until you return and march on my
capital with four times the men.

197
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:14,715
Your capital will be safe until the
northern threat is dealt with.

198
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:17,422
You have my word.

199
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,547
The word of a would-be usurper.

200
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:21,547
There is no conversation

201
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:25,588
that will erase the last 50 years.

202
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:27,798
We have something to show you.

You would never agree to it.

And if you did, I would trust
you even less than I do now.

I ask it only of Ned Stark's son.

will be true to his word.

be across a battlefield.

and you're loyal to Sansa

Oh, fuck loyalty!

Fuck loyalty?

This goes beyond houses
and honor and oaths.

274
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,339
Talk to the queen.

275
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:30,339
And tell her what?

that we could be here.

If it's all for nothing,

280

then he died for nothing.

281
00:26:58,673 --> 00:27:00,171
I know!

282
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:02,839
I'm pleased you bent
the knee to our queen.

283
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,547
I would have advised it, had you asked.

284
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:07,505
But have you ever considered

285
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:09,714
learning how to lie every now and then?

286
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:10,715
Just a bit?

287
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,089
I'm not going to swear
an oath I can't uphold.

288
00:27:16,464 --> 00:27:18,046
Talk about my father if you want,

289
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:21,130
tell me that's the attitude
that got him killed.

290
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:24,213
But when enough people
make false promises,

291
00:27:24,214 --> 00:27:27,380
words stop meaning anything.

292
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:30,547
Then there are no more answers,
only better and better lies.

293
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:33,296
And lies won't help us in this fight.

294
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:35,380
TYRION: That is indeed a problem.

295
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:38,923
The more immediate problem
is that we're fucked.

296
00:27:40,131 --> 00:27:41,547
Any ideas as to how we might

297
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:43,548
change that state of affairs?

298
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:46,380
Only one.

299
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,797
Everyone stays here,

300
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:51,588
and I go and talk to my sister.

301
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:56,005
I didn't come all this way
to have my Hand murdered.

302
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:57,797
I don't want Cersei to murder me either.

303
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:00,797
I could have stayed in my cell and
saved a great deal of trouble.

304
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:02,839
JON: I did this.

305
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,338
- I should go.
- She'll definitely murder you.

306
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:08,715
I go see my sister alone.

307
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:11,714
Or we all go home

308
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:13,464
and we're right back where we started.

309
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:19,672
- You spoke with her?
- At her until she kicked me out.

310
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:22,755
She thinks I was an idiot to trust you.

311
00:29:22,756 --> 00:29:24,880
A lot of people seem to
think that, actually.

312
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:26,505
I'm about to step into a room

313
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:28,296
with the most murderous
woman in the world

314
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:32,213
who's already tried to kill
me twice, that I know of.

315
00:29:32,214 --> 00:29:33,840
Who's an idiot?

316
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:39,714
I suppose we should say goodbye,

317
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:41,297
one idiot to another.

318
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:42,130
I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose.

319
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,922
She's your kind of woman...

320
00:30:43,923 --> 00:30:46,463
a foreign whore who
doesn't know her place.

321
00:30:46,464 --> 00:30:50,255
A foreign whore you can't
abduct, beat, or intimidate.

322
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:51,964
That must be difficult for you.

323
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:54,422
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner,

324
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:56,338
- whom you've convinced to bow down before her.
- I didn't know about that.

325
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:58,422
And now you've got them both
working towards the same goal,

326
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,547
the goal you've worked
towards your entire life...

327
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:03,630
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- the destruction of this family.

328
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:06,964
I am the one preventing
that from happening.

329
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,505
Daenerys didn't want to
debate and negotiate.

330
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:10,964
She didn't want to bring you words.

331
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:12,922
She wanted to bring you fire and blood

332
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:15,046
until I advised her otherwise.

333
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,839
I don't want to destroy our family.

334
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,797
I never have.

335
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:20,255
You killed our father.

336
00:31:20,256 --> 00:31:21,880
After he sentenced me to death

337
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,463
for a crime I didn't
commit, yes, I killed him.

338
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:26,130
Hate me for it if you want.

339
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:28,463
I hate myself for it in
spite of what he was,

340
00:31:28,464 --> 00:31:30,922
in spite of what he did to me.

341
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,672
Oh, poor little man.

342
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:34,380
Your papa was mean to you.

343
00:31:34,381 --> 00:31:38,422
Do you have any idea what you did
when you fired that crossbow?

344
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:40,255
You left us open.

345
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:41,839
You laid us bare for the vultures,

346
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,380
and the vultures came and tore us apart.

347
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:47,046
You may not have killed Joffrey,

348
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:48,964
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

349
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:51,005
No one would've touched
them if Father was here.

350
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:53,588
- No one would have dared...
- I have never been more sorry about anything.

351
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:55,296
I will not hear it, not from you.

352
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:57,047
I will not hear it!

353

All right.

354

You love your family,

355
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:06,880
and I have destroyed it.

356
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:09,630
I will always be a threat.

357
00:32:09,631 --> 00:32:10,965
So put an end to me.

358
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:22,005
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

If it weren't for me,

361
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:28,171
you'd have two beautiful children.

362
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:30,338

363

I only care what it cost us.

375
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,297
It cost us our future.

376
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:16,088
If there's no future,
then why are we here?

377
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:18,088
Why did you allow me to come?

378
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,130
Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

Yes, no, not what you hoped for,

00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:25,423
but you must have hoped for something.

381
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,005
What did you hope for?

382
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:32,672
- To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?
- Mm, not like this.

383
00:34:32,673 --> 00:34:35,046
But eventually, you want everyone
to bend the knee to her.

384
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:36,797
- Yes.
- Why?

385
00:34:36,798 --> 00:34:38,380
Because I think

386
00:34:38,381 --> 00:34:40,213
she will make the world a better place.

387
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:42,131
You said she'd destroy King's Landing.

388
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,255
She knows herself.

389
00:34:46,256 --> 00:34:47,797
She chose an advisor

390
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:51,130
who would check her worst
impulses instead of feeding them.

391

That's the difference between you.

00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:55,338
I don't care about checking
my worst impulses.

I don't care about making

I know what it is, I know what it means.

397
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:07,880
And when it came at me, I
didn't think about the world.

398
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:09,964
Not at all.

As soon as it opened its mouth,

the world disappeared for me,

All I could think about was
keeping those gnashing teeth

away from the ones who matter most,

404

away from my family.

Extraordinary.

They filled people with wonder and awe,

419

and we locked them in here.

420

The witch who murdered my husband.

she might not have been

00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:38,171
What do you think she's after?

487
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:40,755
She's your sister.

488
00:41:40,756 --> 00:41:42,881
You know her far better
than I ever could.

489
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:51,171
Sometimes when I try to
understand a person's motives,

490
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:53,089
I play a little game.

491
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:57,589
I assume the worst.

492
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:03,422
What's the worst reason
they could possibly have

493
00:42:03,423 --> 00:42:08,380
for saying what they say
and doing what they do?

494
00:42:08,381 --> 00:42:10,588
Then I ask myself,

495
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:13,755
"How well does that reason explain

496
00:42:13,756 --> 00:42:16,715
what they say and what they do?"

497
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:20,088
So, tell me...

498
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:22,631
what's the worst thing she could want?

499
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:30,463
She could want me dead

500
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:33,672
because she thinks I wronged my family.

501
00:42:33,673 --> 00:42:35,965
Why did she come to Winterfell?

502
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:41,130
To kill me

503
00:42:41,131 --> 00:42:44,964
for marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

504
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:47,965
Why did she unearth the
letter Cersei made you write?

505
00:42:50,673 --> 00:42:54,755
To provide proof of my betrayals.

506
00:42:54,756 --> 00:42:59,505
To provide justification
after she murders me.

507
00:42:59,506 --> 00:43:03,171
And after she murders you,

508
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:05,840
what does she become?

509
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,047
Lady of Winterfell.

510
00:43:25,214 --> 00:43:28,088
(WAVES CRASHING)

511
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:31,005
If we have the Dothraki
ride hard on the kingsroad,

512
00:43:31,006 --> 00:43:33,672
they'll arrive at Winterfell
within the fortnight.

513
00:43:33,673 --> 00:43:35,171
And the Unsullied?

514
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:36,797
We can sail with them to White Harbor,

515
00:43:36,798 --> 00:43:39,505
meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad,

516
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:42,463
then ride together to Winterfell.

517
00:43:42,464 --> 00:43:45,714
Perhaps you should fly to
Winterfell, Your Grace.

518
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:48,213
You have many enemies in the North.

519
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:50,463
Thousands fell fighting your father.

520
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:54,171
All it takes is one angry
man with a crossbow.

521
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:56,380
He'll see your silver
hair on the kingsroad

522
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:59,422
and know that one well-placed
bolt will make him a hero.

523
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:02,047
The man who killed the conqueror.

524
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:05,380
JON: It's your decision, Your Grace.

525
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:08,588
But if we're going to
be allies in this war,

526
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:12,672
it's important for the
Northerners to see us as allies.

527
00:44:12,673 --> 00:44:15,839
If we sail to White Harbor together,

528
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,089
I think it sends a better message.

529
00:44:24,548 --> 00:44:27,296
I've not come to conquer the North.

530
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,631
I'm coming to save the North.

531
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,589
We sail together.

532
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:52,756
Jon.

533
00:44:54,923 --> 00:44:56,256
Can I speak with you?

534
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:00,715
All right.

535
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:09,171
What you did in King's Landing,

536
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:11,297
what you said...

537
00:45:13,464 --> 00:45:16,880
you could've lied to Cersei

538
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,798
about bending the knee to Daenerys.

539
00:45:23,798 --> 00:45:26,256
You risked everything to
tell an enemy the truth.

540
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:30,630
We went down there to make peace.

541
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:34,130
And it seems to me we need
to be honest with each other

542
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,506
if we're going to fight together.

543
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:39,506
You've always known what was right.

544
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,296
Even when we were all young and stupid,

545
00:45:46,297 --> 00:45:47,797
you always knew.

546
00:45:47,798 --> 00:45:50,047
Every step you take...

547
00:45:51,506 --> 00:45:53,380
it's always the right step.

548
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:54,505
It's not.

549
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:56,755
It may seem that way from the outside,

550
00:45:56,756 --> 00:46:00,172
but I promise you, it's not true.

551
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:05,171
I've done plenty of
things that I regret.

552
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:06,880
Not compared to me, you haven't.

553
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:08,506
No.

554
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:12,131
Not compared to you.

555
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:26,006
I always wanted to do the right thing.

556
00:46:28,673 --> 00:46:30,755
Be the right kind of person.

557
00:46:30,756 --> 00:46:33,339
But I never knew what that meant.

558
00:46:34,756 --> 00:46:37,089
It always seemed like there's...

559
00:46:41,172 --> 00:46:43,589
like there was an impossible
choice I had to make.

560
00:46:46,047 --> 00:46:47,840
Stark or Greyjoy.

561
00:46:51,089 --> 00:46:55,714
Our father was more of a father
to you than yours ever was.

562
00:46:55,715 --> 00:46:58,547
- He was.
- And you betrayed him.

563
00:46:58,548 --> 00:47:00,422
Betrayed his memory.

564
00:47:00,423 --> 00:47:01,423
I did.

565
00:47:04,756 --> 00:47:06,422
(SIGHS)

566
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,172
But you never lost him.

567
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:14,131
He's a part of you.

568
00:47:15,673 --> 00:47:17,422
Just like he's a part of me.

569
00:47:17,423 --> 00:47:19,589
But the things I've done...

570
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:24,047
It's not my place to
forgive you for all of it.

571
00:47:27,423 --> 00:47:30,630
But what I can forgive,

572
00:47:30,631 --> 00:47:32,047
I do.

573
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:40,589
You don't need to choose.

574
00:47:41,923 --> 00:47:43,881
You're a Greyjoy...

575
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:47,423
and you're a Stark.

576
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:04,046
When I was Ramsay's prisoner,

577
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:08,088
Yara tried to save me.

578
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:11,630
She's the only one

579
00:48:11,631 --> 00:48:13,589
who tried to save me.

(SNIFFLES)

581
00:48:20,673 --> 00:48:22,839
She needs me now.

582
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,631
So, why are you still talking to me?

583
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:41,338
HARRAG: Load up.

584
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:42,964
Load up, lads. Go on.

585
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:45,297
- (CHATTER)
- Tide's coming in.

586
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:04,006
All of us chose to follow Yara.

587
00:49:06,464 --> 00:49:10,296
We left the Iron Islands for Yara.

588
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:13,131
She would never leave one of us behind.

589
00:49:16,006 --> 00:49:17,714
We're not leaving her behind.

590
00:49:17,715 --> 00:49:19,171
Your sister's dead.

591
00:49:19,172 --> 00:49:20,880
- She's not dead.
- She's dead.

592
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:23,755
Even if Euron hasn't cut her
throat yet, she's dead.

593
00:49:23,756 --> 00:49:28,880
- She's our queen.
- She's your sister, and you left her to die.

594
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:30,381
I did.

595
00:49:32,756 --> 00:49:35,630
I ran from my uncle.

596
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:37,046
I was a coward.

597
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:40,296
So, why in fuck's name
should we listen to you?

599

We're going to sail east,

600
00:49:45,506 --> 00:49:47,880
find a nice, quiet island,

601
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:50,880
kill all the men, and take
their wives for ourselves.

602
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:53,296
- We're done with all that.
- Who says we are?

603
00:49:53,297 --> 00:49:56,214
Yara did. She made a pledge.

604
00:49:58,131 --> 00:50:01,296
We're going to find her,

605

And what does honor demand?

00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,714
That I defend my family from
those who would harm us.

That I defend the North from

Which charges confuse you?

Let's start with the simplest one...

645
00:55:20,172 --> 00:55:22,755
you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn.

646
00:55:22,756 --> 00:55:25,630
You pushed her through the Moon
Door and watched her fall.

647
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:27,506
Do you deny it?

648
00:55:29,548 --> 00:55:31,046
I did it to protect you.

649
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:33,088
You did it to take power in the Vale.

650
00:55:33,089 --> 00:55:36,380
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

651
00:55:36,381 --> 00:55:38,880
You gave Lysa Tears
of Lys to poison him.

652
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:39,923
Do you deny it?

653
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,422
Whatever your aunt
might have told you...

654
00:55:45,423 --> 00:55:47,756
she was a troubled woman.

655
00:55:49,089 --> 00:55:50,380
She imagined enemies everywhere.

656
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:52,755
You had Aunt Lysa send a
letter to our parents

657
00:55:52,756 --> 00:55:55,255
telling them it was the
Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn

658
00:55:55,256 --> 00:55:56,755
when, really, it was you.

659
00:55:56,756 --> 00:55:58,964
The conflict between the
Starks and the Lannisters,

660
00:55:58,965 --> 00:56:00,463
it was you who started it.

661
00:56:00,464 --> 00:56:01,547
Do you deny it?

662
00:56:01,548 --> 00:56:03,171
I know of no such letter.

663
00:56:03,172 --> 00:56:05,005
You conspired with Cersei Lannister

664
00:56:05,006 --> 00:56:08,714
and Joffrey Baratheon to
betray our father, Ned Stark.

665
00:56:08,715 --> 00:56:11,255
Thanks to your treachery,
he was imprisoned

666
00:56:11,256 --> 00:56:14,714
and later executed on
false charges of treason.

667
00:56:14,715 --> 00:56:17,547
- Do you deny it?
- I deny it!

668
00:56:17,548 --> 00:56:20,922
None of you were there
to see what happened.

669
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:22,880
None of you knows the truth.

670
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:24,798
You held a knife to his throat.

671
00:56:30,006 --> 00:56:32,631
You said, "I did warn
you not to trust me."

672
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:40,631
You told our mother this knife
belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

673
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:43,839
But that was another one of your lies.

674
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,673
It was yours.

675
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:53,714
Lady Sansa, I have known
you since you were a girl.

676
00:56:53,715 --> 00:56:56,380
- I've protected you.
- Protected me?

677
00:56:56,381 --> 00:56:58,506
By selling me to the Boltons?

678
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,171
If we could speak alone,

679
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:03,715
I can explain everything.

680
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:09,046
Sometimes when I'm trying to
understand a person's motives,

681
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:11,630
I play a little game.

682
00:57:11,631 --> 00:57:13,297
I assume the worst.

683
00:57:14,673 --> 00:57:16,588
What's the worst reason you have

684
00:57:16,589 --> 00:57:18,506
for turning me against my sister?

685
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:22,422
That's what you do, isn't it?

686
00:57:22,423 --> 00:57:24,255
That's what you've always done...

687
00:57:24,256 --> 00:57:26,088
turn family against family,

688
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:28,005
turn sister against sister.

689
00:57:28,006 --> 00:57:30,213
That's what you did to our
mother and Aunt Lysa,

690
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:32,422
and that's what you tried to do to us.

691
00:57:32,423 --> 00:57:33,755
Sansa, please.

692
00:57:33,756 --> 00:57:37,588
I'm a slow learner, it's true.

693
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:39,046
But I learn.

694
00:57:39,047 --> 00:57:41,296
Give me a chance to defend myself.

695
00:57:41,297 --> 00:57:42,589
I deserve that.

696
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,005
I am Lord Protector of the Vale

697
00:57:50,006 --> 00:57:52,380
and I command you to escort
me safely back to the Eyrie.

698
00:57:52,381 --> 00:57:53,673
I think not.

699
00:57:56,965 --> 00:57:59,673
Sansa, I beg you!

700
00:58:01,172 --> 00:58:03,213
I loved your mother since
the time I was a boy.

701
00:58:03,214 --> 00:58:05,006
And yet, you betrayed her.

702
00:58:07,047 --> 00:58:10,213
I loved you.

703
00:58:10,214 --> 00:58:11,840
More than anyone.

704
00:58:12,965 --> 00:58:14,756
And yet, you betrayed me.

705
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:19,130
When you brought me back to Winterfell,

706
00:58:19,131 --> 00:58:21,672
you told me there's no
justice in the world,

707
00:58:21,673 --> 00:58:23,881
not unless we make it.

708
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:30,296
Thank you for all your many
lessons, Lord Baelish.

709
00:58:30,297 --> 00:58:32,589
I will never forget them.

710
00:58:36,297 --> 00:58:37,297
Sansa!

711
00:58:39,631 --> 00:58:40,798
(GASPS)

712
00:58:44,297 --> 00:58:45,423
I...

713
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:09,964
JAIME: Our men in King's Landing

714
00:59:09,965 --> 00:59:11,630
will march north in three days' time.

715
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,005
MAN: It'll take us a fortnight

716
00:59:13,006 --> 00:59:14,338
just to gather supplies for the train.

717
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:15,880
JAIME: We don't have a fortnight.

718
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:17,880
If the North falls, we fall. Three days.

719
00:59:17,881 --> 00:59:19,422
The remaining forces in the Westerlands

720
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,130
will take the river road east.

721
00:59:21,131 --> 00:59:22,672
We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town

722
00:59:22,673 --> 00:59:24,672
and march together to Winterfell.

723
00:59:24,673 --> 00:59:25,840
Ser Jaime.

724
00:59:26,965 --> 00:59:28,338
Your Grace.

725
00:59:28,339 --> 00:59:30,798
My lords, I need a
moment with my brother.

726
00:59:32,423 --> 00:59:34,256
MEN: Your Grace.

727
00:59:37,464 --> 00:59:41,296
- What are you doing?
- Preparing the expedition north.

728
00:59:41,297 --> 00:59:43,880
Expedition north?

729
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:47,171
I always knew you were
the stupidest Lannister.

730
00:59:47,172 --> 00:59:49,839
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

731
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,964
and you want to fight alongside them?

732
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:53,922
Are you a traitor or an idiot?

733
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,880
You pledged our forces to
fight our common enemy...

734
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:57,338
I'll say whatever I need to say

735
00:59:57,339 --> 00:59:59,046
to ensure the survival of our house.

736
00:59:59,047 --> 01:00:01,797
You expect me to trust the
man who murdered our father?

737
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:05,380
You expect me to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum,

738
01:00:05,381 --> 01:00:06,880
to fight for the Dragon Queen?

739
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:08,797
You saw it with your own eyes.

740
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:11,171
You saw a dead man trying to kill us.

741
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:13,005
I saw it burn.

742
01:00:13,006 --> 01:00:14,839
If dragons can't stop them,

743
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,880
if Dothraki and Unsullied and
Northmen can't stop them,

744
01:00:17,881 --> 01:00:19,880
how will our armies make a difference?

745
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:21,880
This isn't about noble houses,

746
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:24,005
this is about the living and the dead!

747
01:00:24,006 --> 01:00:26,046
And I intend to stay amongst the living.

748
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:29,255
Let the Stark boy and his
new queen defend the North.

749
01:00:29,256 --> 01:00:31,463
We stay here where we've always been.

750
01:00:31,464 --> 01:00:34,006
I made a promise.

751
01:00:36,172 --> 01:00:39,588
Our child will rule Westeros.

752
01:00:39,589 --> 01:00:44,463
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

753
01:00:44,464 --> 01:00:46,046
The monsters are real.

754
01:00:46,047 --> 01:00:48,171
The white walkers,

755
01:00:48,172 --> 01:00:50,422
the dragons, the Dothraki screamers...

756
01:00:50,423 --> 01:00:54,422
all the frightening stories we heard
when we were young, they're all real.

757
01:00:54,423 --> 01:00:56,130
So be it.

758
01:00:56,131 --> 01:00:58,255
Let the monsters kill each other.

759
01:00:58,256 --> 01:01:00,505
And while they battle in the North,

760
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:02,922
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

761
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:05,714
- And then what?
- And then we rule.

762
01:01:05,715 --> 01:01:08,630
When the fighting in the
North is over, someone wins.

763
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,797
You understand that, don't you?

764
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:14,296
If the dead win, they march
south and kill us all.

765
01:01:14,297 --> 01:01:17,380
If the living win, and
we've betrayed them,

766
01:01:17,381 --> 01:01:19,338
they march south and kill us all!

767
01:01:19,339 --> 01:01:22,338
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

768
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:23,755
Most of them will die in the North.

769
01:01:23,756 --> 01:01:25,338
I faced them in the field.

770
01:01:25,339 --> 01:01:27,880
We can't beat them. We
can't beat their dragons.

771
01:01:27,881 --> 01:01:29,422
How many dragons did you see at the pit?

772
01:01:29,423 --> 01:01:31,422
- Two.
- What happened to the third?

773
01:01:31,423 --> 01:01:33,922
For all we know, it's
guarding her fleet!

774
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:37,255
She came here with her dragons and
her Dothraki and her Unsullied.

775
01:01:37,256 --> 01:01:40,046
She came here to show us all her power.

776
01:01:40,047 --> 01:01:43,088
No, something happened. The
dragons are vulnerable.

777
01:01:43,089 --> 01:01:45,630
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

778
01:01:45,631 --> 01:01:47,463
We don't have the support
of the other houses!

779
01:01:47,464 --> 01:01:50,131
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

780
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:56,088
You should've listened more when Father
spoke about the importance of gold.

781
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:58,255
Oh, I know it's boring for you.

782
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,880
You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight.

783
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:04,463
But I listened, I learned.

784
01:02:04,464 --> 01:02:08,463
Highgarden bought us the most
powerful army in Essos...

785
01:02:08,464 --> 01:02:10,255
the Golden Company.

786
01:02:10,256 --> 01:02:13,964
20,000 men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

787
01:02:13,965 --> 01:02:15,630
The Golden Company is not here.

788
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,005
They're in Essos.

789
01:02:17,006 --> 01:02:20,964
How is a mercenary company
in Essos going to help us?

790
01:02:20,965 --> 01:02:23,463
Do you really think Euron
Greyjoy turned tail

791
01:02:23,464 --> 01:02:25,089
and sailed back to the Iron Islands?

792
01:02:26,214 --> 01:02:27,588
Do you think he abandoned

793
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:30,839
the chance to marry the queen?

794
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,172
No one walks away from me.

795
01:02:35,006 --> 01:02:36,672
He's sailing with his fleet to Essos.

796
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:38,755
He's going to ferry the
Golden Company back here

797
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:40,297
to help us win the war for Westeros.

798
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,005
You plotted with Euron
Greyjoy without telling me,

799
01:02:46,006 --> 01:02:47,839
the commander of your armies?

800
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,463
And you conspired with Tyrion,

801
01:02:50,464 --> 01:02:51,839
the man who murdered our father,

802
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,171
without telling me, your queen.

803
01:02:53,172 --> 01:02:54,630
I didn't conspire with him.

804
01:02:54,631 --> 01:02:56,505
You met with him in secret
without my consent.

805
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,505
You planned to promote
my enemies' interests.

806
01:02:58,506 --> 01:03:00,797
That is the definition of conspiracy.

807
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:03,171
I pledged to ride north.

808
01:03:03,172 --> 01:03:05,005
I intend to honor that pledge.

809
01:03:05,006 --> 01:03:07,213
- And that will be treason.
- Treason?

810
01:03:07,214 --> 01:03:09,463
Disobeying your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

811
01:03:09,464 --> 01:03:10,798
What would you call it?

812
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:14,673
Doesn't matter what I'd call it.

813
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,381
I told you no one walks away from me.

814
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:29,256
Are you going to order him to kill me?

815
01:03:31,381 --> 01:03:33,338
I'm the only one you have left.

816
01:03:33,339 --> 01:03:35,797
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

817
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:37,547
It's just me and you now.

818
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:39,548
There's one more yet to come.

819
01:03:42,548 --> 01:03:44,548
Give the order, then.

820
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,631
I don't believe you.

821

- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- Come in.

823
01:06:00,047 --> 01:06:01,505
Samwell Tarly.

824
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:03,714
I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.

825
01:06:03,715 --> 01:06:05,548
I remember everything.

826
01:06:11,464 --> 01:06:13,714
(DOOR CLOSES)

827
01:06:13,715 --> 01:06:15,880
You helped us get beyond the Wall.

828
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:18,422
- You're a good man.
- Oh, well, thank you,

829
01:06:18,423 --> 01:06:21,047
but, um, I'm not sure that I am.

830
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,381
What happened to you beyond the Wall?

831
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:30,381
I became the Three-Eyed Raven.

832
01:06:32,006 --> 01:06:33,089
Oh!

833
01:06:36,381 --> 01:06:38,755
I don't know what that means.

834
01:06:38,756 --> 01:06:41,505
I can see things that
happened in the past.

835
01:06:41,506 --> 01:06:45,588
I can see things happening now

836
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:47,089
all over the world.

837
01:06:48,506 --> 01:06:50,923
Why did you come to Winterfell?

838
01:06:52,214 --> 01:06:53,589
Um...

839
01:06:55,798 --> 01:06:57,964
Jon's the one to lead the
fight against the dead.

840
01:06:57,965 --> 01:07:00,046
I know he is.

841
01:07:00,047 --> 01:07:02,005
But he can't do it alone,

842
01:07:02,006 --> 01:07:04,880
so I've come here to help him.

843
01:07:04,881 --> 01:07:07,755
He's on his way back to Winterfell

844
01:07:07,756 --> 01:07:09,381
with Daenerys Targaryen.

845
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:13,588
You... you saw this in...

846
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:15,256
in a vision?

847
01:07:18,256 --> 01:07:19,464
Oh.

848
01:07:22,256 --> 01:07:24,464
He needs to know the truth.

849
01:07:25,715 --> 01:07:27,005
The truth about what?

850
01:07:27,006 --> 01:07:28,797
About himself.

851
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:32,338
No one knows. No one but me.

852
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:35,296
Jon isn't really my father's son.

853
01:07:35,297 --> 01:07:39,463
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

854
01:07:39,464 --> 01:07:43,296
He was born in a tower in Dorne.

855
01:07:43,297 --> 01:07:45,755
His last name isn't really Snow,

856
01:07:45,756 --> 01:07:46,756
it's Sand.

857
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,131
It's not.

858
01:07:51,715 --> 01:07:54,130
Dornish bastards are named Sand.

859
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:57,755
At the Citadel, I transcribed
a High Septon's diary.

860
01:07:57,756 --> 01:08:00,506
He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia.

861
01:08:02,297 --> 01:08:05,214
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

862
01:08:06,506 --> 01:08:07,964
Are you certain?

863
01:08:07,965 --> 01:08:10,672
It's what the High Septon
wrote in his private diary.

864
01:08:10,673 --> 01:08:12,506
I don't know why he'd lie.

865
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:16,881
Is this something you can see?

866
01:08:18,339 --> 01:08:22,171
Rhaegar and Lyanna:
Father, Smith, Warrior,

867
01:08:22,172 --> 01:08:27,046
Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger.

868
01:08:27,047 --> 01:08:30,839
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

869
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:35,171

BRAN'S VOICE: Robert's
Rebellion was built on a lie.

871
01:08:40,423 --> 01:08:43,548
Rhaegar didn't kidnap
my aunt or rape her.

872
01:08:53,131 --> 01:08:54,673
He loved her.

873
01:09:02,423 --> 01:09:04,047
And she loved him.

874
01:09:30,464 --> 01:09:33,423

Jon's real name...

876
01:09:39,256 --> 01:09:43,588
His name is Aegon Targaryen.

877
01:09:43,589 --> 01:09:45,798
You have to protect him.

878
01:09:47,297 --> 01:09:49,214
Promise me, Ned.

heir to the Iron Throne.

883
01:10:35,756 --> 01:10:37,464
BRAN'S VOICE: He needs to know.

884
01:10:40,673 --> 01:10:42,464
We need to tell him.

885
01:10:52,798 --> 01:10:55,505
Are you all right?

886
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:57,422
It's just strange.

887
01:10:57,423 --> 01:11:01,381
In his own horrible way,
I believe he loved me.

888
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:06,880
You did the right thing.

889
01:11:06,881 --> 01:11:09,422
You did it.

890
01:11:09,423 --> 01:11:11,255
I'm just the executioner.

891
01:11:11,256 --> 01:11:13,006
You passed the sentence.

892
01:11:15,172 --> 01:11:18,005
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

893
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:19,381
Does that bother you?

894
01:11:21,965 --> 01:11:24,840
I was never going to be
as good a lady as you.

895
01:11:26,297 --> 01:11:27,798
So I had to be something else.

896
01:11:30,006 --> 01:11:32,755
I never could have survived
what you survived.

897
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:35,088
You would have.

898
01:11:35,089 --> 01:11:37,089
You're the strongest person I know.

899
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:43,715
I believe that's the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

900
01:11:45,297 --> 01:11:49,088
Well, don't get used to it.

901
