Ending the war. Killing her.

between you and her?

00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,172
That I've come to destroy your cities,

29
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,217
burn down your homes,
murder you and orphan your children.

I'm not here to murder,

a better place than we found it.

You will not kneel?

41
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,751
I already have a queen.

42
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,295
TYRION: My sister.

43
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,839
She wasn't your queen
until recently, though, was she?

44
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,968
When she murdered your rightful queen,

45
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,929
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

46
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,974
So, it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

47
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,018
There are no easy choices in war.

48
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,856
Say what you will about your sister,
she was born in Westeros.

49
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,110
She's lived here all her life.

50
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,613
You, on the other hand,

51
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,700
murdered your own father,

52
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,954
and chose to support
a foreign invader,

53
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,290
one with no ties to this land,

54
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,627
an army of savages at her back.

55
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,381
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

56
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,718
I respect that.

57
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,637
Perhaps he could take the black,
Your Grace.

58
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,098
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

59
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,350
He'd be invaluable at the Wall.

60
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,185
You cannot send me to the Wall.

61
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:18,897
You are not my queen.

62
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,537
You will have to kill me, too.

63

one great house from the world.

69

Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

70
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,981
I will not.

from a man's head

many will take it.

How many men did we lose?

92
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,369
We haven't done a full accounting.

93
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,624
It's not only armies that win wars.

94
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,252
We have the Tyrell gold,
we have the Iron Bank behind us,

95
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,837
we can buy mercenaries.

96
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,049
Not the same as our men,

97
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,718
but they'll fight if
they're well paid, which they will be.

98
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:37,137
I just saw the Dothraki fight.

99
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,059
They'll beat any mercenary army.
They'll beat any army I've ever seen.

100
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,770

it was sport.

103

they couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

104
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,572
This isn't a war we can win.

105
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,533
So, what do we do?

106
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,910
Sue for peace?

107
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:05,165
I sit on her father's throne,
the father you betrayed and murdered.

108
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,042
And in her mind, she's winning.

109
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,212
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

110
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,759
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf,

111
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,637
by way of apology
for murdering our father and son.

112
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,682
He didn't.

113

you saw his body.

After all this time,

00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,568
- it still amazes me...
- It was Olenna.

118
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,780
She confessed before she died.

119
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,746
And this was before or after she drank
the poison you so kindly provided her?

120
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,373
After.

121
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,000
And you believed her.

122
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,918
If you were Olenna,

123
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,712
would you rather have seen
your granddaughter

124
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,463
married to Joffrey or Tommen?

125
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,260
Which one would Margaery
have been better able to control?

126
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,847
Which one would have made Olenna
the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?

127
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,016
She was telling the truth.

128
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,567
I shouldn't have listened to you.

129
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,738
She should have died screaming.

130
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,616
She's dead, like her son,
her grandchildren, her whole house.

And if we don't find
a way out of this war,

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,453
we'll follow them.

133
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,663
So, we fight and die
or we submit and die.

134
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,748
I know my choice.

135

This man says
he is your friend, Khaleesi.

166
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:04,381
He is my friend.

167
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,094
Your Grace.

168
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,271
Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont,
an old friend.

169
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,274
I served with your father.

170
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,442
He was a great man.

171
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,737
You look strong.

172
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,824
You found a cure?

173
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,784
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

174
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,663
I return to your service, my queen.

175
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,040
If you'll have me.

176
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,334
It would be my honor.

Ravens. We need to send ravens.

182
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,734
I put very little stock in it myself.

183

Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

many a good Maester's wits.

A crippled boy claims
to have seen dead men

on the march Beyond the Wall,

192
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,800
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

193
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,510
EBROSE: Yes, it is a bit much.

194
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,138
- Still, we ought to write back for...
- SAMWELL: Brandon Stark.

195
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,226
The crippled boy.

196
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:04,894
Do you know him?

197
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:10,150
I led him through the Wall years ago.
I saw him go Beyond the Wall.

198
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:12,861
And?

199
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,198
Somehow, a crippled boy survived
for years Beyond the Wall

200
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,533
when no one else could.

201
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,536
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

202
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,415
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

203
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,501
Perhaps you need more scribing work
to discipline your mind.

204
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:32,005
I sense a more detailed proposal
is forthcoming?

(CLEARS THROAT)

206
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,310
Everyone in Westeros trusts
and respects you.

207
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,564
If you tell people the threat is real,
they'll believe it.

208
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,985
If you advise all the lords to send
their men north to hold the Wall,

209
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:55,070
they'll do it.

210
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,365
And if you tell every maester
in the Citadel

211
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,951
to search every word of every
faded scroll about the Long Night,

212
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:06,373
they may find something that lets us
defeat the Army of the Dead for good.

213
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,629
It could be done.

214
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:18,218
And this news could be authentic.
It's possible.

215
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:25,809
It's also possible that this message
is part of a ploy by the Dragon Queen

216
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,185
to lure southern armies away

217
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,937
from the lands
they are currently defending,

218
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,730
to open those lands to easy conquest.

219
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:34,275
That does seem far more likely
than magic birds talking to cripples.

220
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,693
Archmaester, please.

221
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,321
It's real.

222
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,157
I've seen it.

223
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,288
We will write to Maester Wolkan
at Winterfell for clarification.

224
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:50,708
I promise you, we will get
to the truth of it one way or another.

225
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,794
- Archmaester, please...
- That will be all, Tarly.

MAESTER: It brings to mind
the work of Jenny of Oldstones,

227

the charlatan who claimed descent
from the Children of the Forest.

228
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,469
Don't forget the prophet Lodos,
who promised

229
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:05,140
that the Drowned God would rise up
and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

230
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,641
Oh, Lodos. (CHUCKLES)

231
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,982
Is he the one whose father and brother
were just burned alive?

232
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:15,942
I'm afraid so.

233
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,278
A horrible business.

234
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,405
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

235
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,657
He's a good lad.

236
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,868
Right.

237
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,537
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

238
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,253
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

239
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,588
That's why they're rulers.

240
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,551
She gave Tarly a choice.

241
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,471
A man who had taken up
arms against her.

242
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,306
What else could she do?

243
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,434
Not burn him alive alongside his son?

244
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:53,771
I am her Hand, not her head.
I can't make her decisions for her.

245
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,733
That's what I used to tell myself
about her father.

246
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,112
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

247
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,491
I was only a purveyor of information.

248
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:13,333
It's what I told myself
when I watched them beg for mercy.

249
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,502
"I'm not the one doing it."

250
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,713
And the pitch of their screams
rose higher.

251
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,340
"I'm not the one doing it."

252
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,425
When their hair caught fire,

253
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,178
and the smell of their burning flesh
filled the Throne Room,

254
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,971
"I'm not the one doing it."

255
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,649
TYRION: Daenerys is not her father.

256
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,567
And she never will be.

257
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,319
With the right counsel.

258
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,951
You need to find
a way to make her listen.

259
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,120
Who's that for?

260
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,122
Jon Snow.

261
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,208
Did you read it?

262
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,169
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

263
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:05,927
What's it say?

264
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,304
Nothing good.

265
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,771
I thought Arya was dead.

266
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,358
I thought Bran was dead.

267
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,027
I'm happy for you.

268
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,698
You don't look happy.

269
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,577
Bran saw the Night King and his army
marching towards Eastwatch.

270
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,706
If they make it past the Wall...

271
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:37,375
The Wall has kept them out
for thousands of years, presumably.

272
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,835
I need to go home.

273
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,670
You said you don't have enough men.

274
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,547
We'll fight with the men we have.

275
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,841
Unless you'll join us?

276
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,218
And give the country to Cersei?

277
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,554
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

278
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,973
Perhaps not.

279
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,811
Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead
is nothing but a story

280
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,272
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

281
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,733
What if we prove her wrong?

282
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,236
I don't think she'll come see the dead
at my invitation.

283
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,489
So, bring the dead to her.

284
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,826
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

285
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,411
We don't have to bring the whole army.

286
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,580
Only one soldier.

287
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:17,749
Is that possible?

288
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:23,796
The first wight I ever saw

289
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,882
was brought into Castle Black
from Beyond the Wall.

290
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,635
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing,

291
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,136
and show her the truth.

292
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,222
Anything you bring back
will be useless

293
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,016
unless Cersei grants us an audience

294
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,518
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

295
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:40,063
the moment we set foot in the capital.

296
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,357
The only person she listens to
is Jaime.

297
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,735
He might listen to me.

298
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,157
And how would you
get into King's Landing?

299
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,748
I can smuggle you in.

300
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,626
But if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

301
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,252
I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.

302
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:08,216
Well, it'll all be for nothing if
we don't have one of these dead men.

303
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,802
Fair point.
How do you propose to find one?

304
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:17,141
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

305
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,771
You asked me to find a cure
so I could serve you.

306
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,981
Allow me to serve you.

307
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,570
The Free Folk will help us.

308
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,240
They know the real north
better than anyone.

309
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,908
They won't follow Ser Jorah.

310
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,118
They won't have to.

311
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,668
DAVOS: You can't lead
a raid Beyond the Wall.

312
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,045
You're not in
the Night's Watch anymore,

313
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,255
you're King in the North.

314
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:48,673
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

315
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,009
I'm the only one here who knows them.

316
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,471
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

317
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,768
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

318
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:02,895
I am a king.

319
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:07,734
And I came here knowing that
you could have your men behead me

320
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,527
or your dragons burn me alive.

321
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,575
I put my trust in you, a stranger,

322
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,411
because I knew it was
the best chance for my people,

323
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,413
for all our people.

324
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:26,335
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger,

325
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,465
'cause it's our best chance.

to rule us, my lady.

You are very kind, my lords.

334
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:23,434
But Jon is our king.
He is doing what he thinks is best.

SANSA: I warned Jon this would happen.

337
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:37,824
That he couldn't leave the North

338
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:40,451
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

339
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,537
He didn't,
he trusted you to hold it for him.

340
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:45,581
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern Lords are proud.

These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

And? (SIGHS)

343
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:57,635
Nothing.

344
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,179
Don't do that.

345
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:02,557
What?

346
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,100
Say what you mean.

347
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,229
You always liked nice things.

348
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:12,066
Made you feel better than everyone.

349
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:18,322
Are you angry with me?

350
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:22,368
They were insulting Jon,
and you sat there and listened.

351
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,078
I listened to their complaints,

352
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:26,956
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

353
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,958
Their opinions are important to you.

354
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,920
Glover has 500 men
and Royce has 2,000.

355
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:35,381
Offend them and Jon loses his army.

356
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,550
Not if they lose their heads first.

357
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,098
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

358
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,892
We took it back.

359
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,645
And the Mormonts, and the Hornwoods,
and the wildlings, and the Vale.

360
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,063
All of us, working together.

361
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:55,401
Now, I'm sure cutting off heads
is very satisfying,

362
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:59,030
but that's not the way
you get people to work together.

363
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:05,661
And if Jon doesn't come back,
you'll need their support.

364
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:10,041
So you can work together
to give you what you really want.

365
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:13,085
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

366
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,632
You're thinking it right now.

367
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,469
You don't want to be.

368
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,014
But the thought just won't go away.

369
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,605
I have work to do.

370
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,026
My lady.

371
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:53,042
Last time I was here,
I killed my father with a crossbow.

372
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,087
Last time I was here,
you killed my son with wildfire.

373
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,801
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

374
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:05,763
The guards hardly ever patrol it.
Too many steps.

375
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,186
You're not staying here?

376
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,313
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

377
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,483
What if someone takes the boat?

378
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,944
Then we're fucked. Best hurry.

379
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,118
JAIME: We don't have time for this.

380
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,953
We should be preparing the city
for a siege.

381
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,121
The Dothraki are coming.

382
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:31,914
BRONN: All the more reason
for you to train.

383
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:34,208
Unless you plan
on fighting Dothraki 12-year-olds.

384
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,669
JAIME: Well, I seem to recall them
giving you a bit of trouble as well.

385
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,504
And here I am, ready to train.

386
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,880
JAIME: Why down here?

387
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,427
I don't think you want people to see
how you look swinging that thing yet.

388
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,930
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

389
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,766
Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.

390
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,693
I'll leave you to it.

391
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,781
I needed to see you.

392
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:09,076
And I knew you'd never agree to meet.

393
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,832
You made me look like a complete fool.

394
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,585
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock.

395
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,921
But you were three steps ahead of me.

396
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:23,382
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

397
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:24,675
Father would have been proud.

398
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:26,302
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me...

399
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,970
I once told Bronn

400
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,015
that if I ever saw you again,
I'd cut you in half.

401
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,395
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

402
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,448
He was going to execute me.

403
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,159
He knew I was innocent.

404
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,620
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did.

405
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,997
He hated me because of what I am.

406
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,041
A little monster sent to punish him.

407
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,462
Did he...

408
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:04,131
Did he think... Did he think
I wanted to be born this way?

409
00:32:04,215 --> 00:32:05,925
- Did he think I chose it...
- What do you want?

410
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:13,933
Daenerys will win this war.

411
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:17,686
You're a military man.

412
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,480
You must know
there's no way around that.

413
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,110
Daenerys is not her father.

414
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,029
She's even willing
to suspend hostilities

415
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,073
if Cersei agrees to certain terms.

416
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:33,577
You want Cersei to bend the knee,
you can ask her yourself.

417
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:35,830
I... I don't. And Daenerys doesn't.

418
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:38,958
Not right now, anyway.

419
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:43,337
She has a more important request.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

421
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,628
Wasn't sure I'd find you.

422
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,013
Thought you might still be rowing.

423
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,515
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

424
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,561
I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.

425
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:44,023
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

426
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:47,109
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

427
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:48,277
Haven't been here in years.

428
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,404
Why should they recognize me?

429
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,073
Sometimes I hardly do.

430
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,286
Nothing fucks you harder than time.

431
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,834
Anybody give you any trouble?

432
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:07,796
Here I am, arming Lannisters,
and I never get a second look.

433
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:09,840
But you were right.

434
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,301
Safest place for me
was right under the queen's nose.

435
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,011
Don't be so sure.

436
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,097
Safety is never
a permanent state of affairs.

437
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,351
Bad things are coming.

438
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,273
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

439
00:34:26,357 --> 00:34:27,775
Well, I think you'll need
to understand...

440
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,026
I'm ready. Let's go.

441
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,654
You should know
what you're heading into.

442
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,949
What do you think I've been thinking
about with every swing of the hammer?

443
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:40,037
How happy I am making weapons
for the family that killed my father?

444
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,413
The family that tried to kill me?

445

(GENDRY SCOFFS)

446
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,542
I've been getting ready.

447
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:49,421
Never knew what for, but I've always
known I'd know it when it comes.

448
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,676
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

449
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:56,679
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

450
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,473
But this,

451
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,685
this I know.

452
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,153
Keep your father's name to yourself.

453
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,365
Situation's complicated
enough already.

454
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:19,034
Well, who should I say I am?

455
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,873
I told you, Clovis,
if we don't get out of here soon,

456
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,542
- someone's going to...
- SOLDIER 1: You there!

457
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,338
No weapons, friends. I promise.

458
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,924
What can I do for you?

459
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,217
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

460
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:39,221
SOLDIER 2: The docks are that way.
DAVOS: That they are.

461
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:43,058
I try to stay away from them
to avoid good men such as yourselves.

462
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,104
Still five gold dragons?

463
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,106
- Are you joking?
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

464
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,066
You must be even older than you look.

465
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:52,985
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen?

466
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,320
Apiece.

467
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,788
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

468
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:08,667
SOLDIER 1: What's in the boat?

469
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,299
Not more gold.

470
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,135
- Wine? I like wine.
- Mmm.

471
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,678
Or hams.

472
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,139
Come have a look.

473
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:31,940
Fermented crab.

474
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,443
- What?
- DAVOS: Fermented crab.

475
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,488
One bucket of this triples
a brothel's earnings for the week.

476
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:41,867
A man thinks he's done, he's ready
to go back to his loving family.

477
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,702
But before he gets his breeches up,

478
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:47,498
his lady of the hour pops
a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.

before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

He was meant to keep that to himself.

Our fathers trusted each other.
Why shouldn't we?

549

I saw your father once at Winterfell.

550
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,311
I met yours. In my shop.

551

- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

I grew up on stories about them.

553

All I ever knew was that
they fought together, and won.

554
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:27,504
Ser Davos told me where you're going,
Your Grace, and why.

555
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:29,548
Let me come with you.

00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,174
Don't be a fool, you're not a soldier.

557
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:33,135
No, but I'm a fighter.

558
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:36,346
And he won't be needing a smith
with a sword like that.

559
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:40,058
You know how to use one?

560
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:42,477
Well, that's a problem.

561
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:44,104
Prefer a hammer.

562
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,859
He can handle himself.

563
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,654
We could use the help.

564
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:53,947

for a minute,

I owe you my life. Twice over.

about what's up there,

All I've ever done is live to
a ripe old age.

572
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:34,321
You may not believe it,
but I've missed you, Mormont.

573

Not even Grey Worm.

575
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:47,334
This is the coin the slaver gave me

576
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:50,045
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

577
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:53,298
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

578
00:43:58,345 --> 00:43:59,971
Take it with you.

But bring it back.

at saying farewell by now.

at least you won't have to deal

It's when a man sets aside
his lawful wife.

597

Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince Ragger,

598
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:11,811
and remarried him to someone else

that man's window counting

and annulments and bowel movements
for all eternity,

00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:26,329
TORMUND: Hmm.

639
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:27,747
I'll be staying behind.

640
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:30,124
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

641
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:31,918
You are.

642
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,882
You really want
to go out there? Again?

643
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,015
You're not the only ones.

644
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:53,064
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

645
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:55,108
Said they were on their way here.

646
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,282
You're the Hound.

647
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:07,036
I saw you once at Winterfell.

648
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,919
They want to go Beyond the Wall, too.

649
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:17,088
We don't want to go Beyond the Wall,
we have to.

650
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,383
Our lord told us that
a great war is coming...

651
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,009
GENDRY: Don't trust him.

652
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,554
Don't trust any of them.

653
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:31,811
They're the Brotherhood.

654
00:54:32,395 --> 00:54:34,397
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

655
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,691
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

656
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:38,776
JORAH: Thoros?

657
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:45,450
Well, I hardly recognized you.

658
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:47,827
Ser Jorah Mormont.

659
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,705
They won't give me anything to drink
down here.

660
00:54:51,164 --> 00:54:53,749
I haven't been feeling like myself.

661
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:55,877
TORMUND: You're a fucking Mormont?

662
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,588
Like the last Lord Commander?

663
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:03,885
- He was my father.
- He hunted us, like animals.

664
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,888
You returned the favor, as I recall.

665
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:12,602
Here we all are,
at the edge of the world,

666
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,479
at the same moment,

667
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:17,023
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

668
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:21,068
Our reasons aren't your reasons.

669
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:23,696
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

670
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,325
There's a greater purpose at work.

671
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:32,955
And we serve it together,
whether we know it or not.

672
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:35,958
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light clears the...

673
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:39,212
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

674
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:41,047
Are we coming with you or not?

675
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:43,549
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

676
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:48,596
Is it worse than sitting
in a freezing cell, waiting to die?

677
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,097
He's right.

678
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,518
We're all on the same side.

679
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:56,354
How can we be?

680
00:55:58,022 --> 00:56:00,107
We're all breathing.

681
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,751
