1
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,610
These people.

2
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,195
Pathetic.

3
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,366
I already read that one anyway.

4
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,534
Kleinman has better magazines.

5
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,954
You know, you guys
really don't need to hang around.

6
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,582
We won't even get the results
till next week.

7
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,377
Buddy, we're gonna be here.
You kidding me?

8
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,296
<i>It is a full PETICT, correct?</i>

9
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:50,592
<i>You definitely want the PETICT
and not just the PET.</i>

10
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:54,262
<i>Yeah, it's a PETICT.</i>

11
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,932
Good. That's what you want.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,477
Some places skimp
and they only do the PET.

13
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,522
I'm not naming any names.

14
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,776
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

15
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,653
This is where Walt's doctor is.

16
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,655
Well, with us, you wouldn't
have to wait until next week

17
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,491
to get the results.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,661
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

19
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,569
I could take one look at Walt's,

20
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,999
and tell you immediately how he's doing.

21
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,002
- Really.
- Doctors like people to think

22
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,672
that they're so much smarter
than the technicians,

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,010
but you would be surprised
how much they come to us for input.

24
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,517
Well, never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

25
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,769
Excuse me.

26
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,907
You all right in there?

27
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,952
Yeah.

28
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,333
Hey, you okay?

29
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,043
Yes.

30
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,464
I'm fine, thank you.

31
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,824
Sir, you can go back to your
changing room and get dressed.

32
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:43,080
- So how'd we do?
- You did fine.

33
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,418
- See anything?
- I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

34
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,477
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
with you next week.

35
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,090
Sorry.

36
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,923
Actually, the money-laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

37
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,719
But I gotta tell you,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect?

38
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,596
Most people wanna know
why they suddenly got rich.

39
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:45,767
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

40
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,978
How much time they giving you?

41
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,522
Weeks.

42
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,316
Maybe.

43
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,984
Sorry to hear it.

44
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,821
I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

45
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,824
Oh, well.
Look, let's crunch some numbers.

46
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:03,744
How much money are we laundering?

47
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,081
At this time, $16,000.

48
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,533
How long you been doing this?

49
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,005
We've had some extenuating circumstances.

50
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,673
Yeah, apparently.

51
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:22,220
All right, 16,000 laundered
at 75 cents on the dollar

52
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,974
minus my fee, which is 17 percent

53
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,353
comes to $9960.

54
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:33,190
Congratulations, you just left
your family a secondhand Subaru.

55
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,943
Well, we'll just have to cook more.
A lot more.

56
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,529
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.

57
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,991
Make hay while the sun is still shining.

58
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,292
You know, we should do something
this weekend.

59
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,796
You know,
get our minds off the test results.

60
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,509
Actually, I...

61
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,181
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

62
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,355
- Really?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,984
You know, I never did call her.

64
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:24,157
You're expecting the news
from the scan to be bad.

65
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,914
God, Walt.

66
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,002
I need you to stay positive with me here.

67
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,588
I am. Positive is good.

68
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,007
I'm all for positive,

69
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:44,678
but positive doesn't change facts,
all right?

70
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,263
It...

71
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,349
It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

72
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,934
I know.

73
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:54,521
Walt, I'm just trying
to be hopeful, okay?

74
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,815
You know, forgive me.

75
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,153
Look

76
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,281
I need to know Mom's
going to leave you something if...

77
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,074
If

78
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,285
I'm no longer around.

79
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,748
I just need to get that straight,
that's all.

80
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,296
And believe me,
I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.

81
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,426
Complaining about her nurses
the entire time.

82
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:29,389
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

83
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,144
A 30-minute discourse

84
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,814
about how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

85
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,318
And, oh, she's counting
every one of them, you know.

86
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,824
I'll be lucky
if I get a word in edgewise.

87
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:06,635
I actually think the news from the scan
is gonna be good.

88
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,181
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

89
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,476
Yeah.

90
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,531
- We should do something.
- Yeah, we should.

91
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,200
No, something else.

92
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,203
We should go somewhere.

93
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,331
Have you been
to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

94
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,542
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

95
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,297
Georgia O'Keeffe.

96
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,424
She's a painter.

97
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,041
You've never heard of Georgia O'Keeffe?

98
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,095
No, is that bad?

99
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:55,058
- Boy, you need some educating.
- Yes, yes, I do. Come here.

100
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,395
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

101
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,190
You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe
for a museum?

102
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,985
So romantic.

103
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,863
Yup, we're going. Get up.

104
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,909
Why can't we just go to the movies
or putt-putt?

105
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,412
It's the shit.

106
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,706
A little culture won't kill you.

107
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,501
Besides, you might like it.
A lot of her paintings look like vaginae.

108
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,004
Really?

109
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,344
- Is there still cereal?
- Yeah.

110
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,479
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

111
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,440
<i>Where the hell are you?
Pick up the phone.</i>

112
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,860
<i>- Hello? Jesse, pick up...
- Hold on, hold on.</i>

113
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,112
Sorry, one sec.

114
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,870
<i>- What?
- I've been trying to reach you.</i>

115
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,279
Where's your drop phone?

116
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,099
<i>- I've been busy.
- Well, clear your social calendar.</i>

117
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,797
<i>- We have to cook.
- What? Today?</i>

118
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,455
<i>No, you'll need today at least
to gather supplies.</i>

119
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,885
<i>Now, we're going to need
all new glassware</i>

120
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,596
heating mantles,
about a hundred pounds of ice.

121
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:17,807
Do you have a paper and pencil?
You should be writing this down.

122
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,977
You wanna go shopping,
go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.

123
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,814
<i>Smoking marijuana,
eating Cheetos and masturbating</i>

124
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,525
do not constitute plans in my book.

125
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,943
<i>Well, screw you and your book, man,
all right?</i>

126
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,027
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

127
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:36,410
- You're going to a museum, huh?
- Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.

128
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,663
<i>- Georgia O'Keeffe?
- She's a painter, duh.</i>

129
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,421
She does these vagina pictures.

130
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,668
Or paintings, or just painted.
I don't know.

131
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,419
What are you even talking about?

132
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,673
Look, man, why am I even
explaining myself to you, all right?

133
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,091
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing.

134
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,637
All you need to know is I ain't cooking
or shopping or whatever the hell.

135
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,305
Let me explain something to you.

136
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,434
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

137
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:04,855
- Tuesday? Four days straight?
- Like it or not, we have no choice.

138
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,358
<i>Yeah? And why exactly is that?</i>

139
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,529
Our methylamine. It's going bad.

140
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,990
<i>- What?
- It's losing its chemical potency.</i>

141
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,327
Now, unless stealing another barrel
sounds good to you...

142
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,828
<i>Hell, no.</i>

143
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,787
All right, we have to act fast,
before it goes to waste.

144
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,083
<i>You have a paper and pencil?</i>

145
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,380
<i>- Come on.
- All right, all right. Go.</i>

146
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,467
Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?

147
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,975
What do you mean, mantle?
You mean like Mickey?

148
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,144
I really wish you didn't have to do this.

149
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,766
Me too.

150
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,850
But I'll be back before you know it,

151
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,646
and you can always call if you need me.

152
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:50,442
What, and risk talking to your mother?
Have to be some emergency.

153
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,371
Love you.

154
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,209
- Fly safe, okay?
- Okay.

155
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,859
<i>The white zone is for immediate
loading and unloading</i>

156
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,319
<i>of passengers only.</i>

00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,405
<i>No parking.</i>

Please maintain visual contact</i>

159
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,335
<i>with your personal belongings

160
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,963
<i>Any bags left unattended

161
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,132
<i>by airport personnel.</i>

162
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,726
You brought a meth lab to the airport?

163
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,562
What? You said we were in a hurry.
I saved us a trip.

164
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,939
Yeah. Did you get everything?
All six?

165
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,483
- Yeah.
- With reflux condensers?

166
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,277
Yes. Like I said, yes.

167
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:20,157
- Just go. Drive. Go, go.
- Okay.

168
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,411
Good morning to you too, man.

169
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:24,221
- Stupid...
- Three entire bags of Funyuns?

170
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,765
What? Funyuns are awesome.

171
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,017
- God.
- Hey, more for me.

172
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:32,104
How about something
with some protein maybe?

173
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,606
Something green, huh?

174
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:39,236
Man, I'm getting no service.

175
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,864
How are you even alive?

176
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:47,494
Hey, yo, check your phone.
You get any bars?

177
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,413
Yeah, I've got a signal.

178
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:56,169
- Hey, let me use yours, would you?
- Absolutely not.

179
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,671
I have to assume
Skyler checks my phone records.

180
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,924
- You know that.
- It's not business, all right?

181
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,425
- It's personal.
- Oh, personal.

182
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,304
- What, female?
- Maybe.

183
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,347
Absolutely. That's all I need.

184
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,850
Skyler hits redial
and some stripper answers.

185
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:13,770
Look, she's not a stripper, okay?
Dickwad.

186
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,773
Sorry. My wife checks.

187
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,944
- Drinking water?
- Yup.

188
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,821
Is that all we've got?

189
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,950
Ten gallons?
What, you plan on taking a bath in it?

190
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,124
Oh, God.

191
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,967
No, not there.
That is our workstation.

192
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,471
- Oh, our "workstation."
- That's right.

193
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,892
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

194
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,700
Considering it's our only set,

195
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,813
and we are a million miles from nowhere.

196
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:05,989
Why don't you try
sticking them up your ass sideways?

197
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:09,474
Two-point-three-five pounds.

198
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:12,436
Two-point-three-five.

199
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:14,313
That's the last of it.

200
00:17:16,773 --> 00:17:20,319
- How many total?
- Nineteen.

201
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:23,530
So dollar-wise?

202
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,365
How much?

203
00:17:25,574 --> 00:17:28,702
Well, median weight 2.2 pounds

204
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,665
that's 41.8,
call that 42 pounds, at...

205
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:36,376
- What are we selling for these days?
- Forty a pound.

206
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,360
- Forty thousand dollars?
- Hey, you said raise the prices.

207
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:42,341
All right, that's 40 times 42

208
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:45,594
minus distribution charges...

209
00:17:47,846 --> 00:17:49,014
What?

210
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,933
What?

211
00:17:52,684 --> 00:17:55,020
Six hundred seventy-two thousand dollars.

212
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:57,856
- All in?
- No.

213
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:00,692
Each.

214
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:02,319
Each?

215
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:06,198
- Each.
- Six hundred and...?

216
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:08,867
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

217
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:12,537
Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!

218
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:17,459
Hey, come high, baby.
Come on. Yes. Come on.

219
00:18:18,418 --> 00:18:21,505
Yes! Yes!

220
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:28,387
Well, there goes the generator.

221
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,931
I think that's it for the gas.

222
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:32,641
Perfect timing, yo.

223
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:35,727
- How do you figure that?
- What do you mean?

224
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:36,937
We're done cooking.

225
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:40,065
I am not done until this barrel is empty.

226
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:41,441
Look at this.

227
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,903
I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons
of methylamine.

228
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:48,240
- Come on, where's your ambition?
- Jesus. Seriously?

229
00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:50,742
We are way ahead of schedule, man,
all right?

230
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:53,912
Plus the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane,

231
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:57,040
and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

232
00:18:57,249 --> 00:18:59,835
Come on, can we at least
just take the night off?

233
00:19:00,043 --> 00:19:02,712
Look, I don't have to take you back
till Tuesday, right?

234
00:19:02,796 --> 00:19:05,340
So we come back tomorrow,
strap on the sizzle,

235
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:07,050
and glass up the rest.

236
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:08,260
Come on.

237
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:11,346
There's gotta be a Denny's
out there someplace.

238
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:13,223
Grand Slam?

239
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,600
Hot shower?

240
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:16,935
A bed?

241
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:25,652
- Separate rooms.
- Yeah, that's a given.

242
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:30,240
What the hell?

243
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:33,994
What the...? The battery's dead.

244
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:40,751
Jesse, back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place

245
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:42,635
where did you put them?

246
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:47,549
- I left them right here in the ignition.
- Son of a bitch.

247
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:50,051
Whoa, whoa, no,
this is not my fault, all right?

248
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:51,803
- The buzzer didn't buzz.
- The what?

249
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:54,264
The buzzer that buzzes
when you put the keys in

250
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:56,099
to let you know the battery's on.

251
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:57,851
I know that. It didn't buzz.

252
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,478
Look, I didn't turn the key
or anything, all right?

253
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:03,482
I'm not stupid.
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

254
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,942
I did not. It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

255
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:08,776
Is this just a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

256
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:11,614
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

257
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:12,898
The buzzer did not buzz.

258
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:15,241
And you're the one
that made me move the keys.

259
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:16,995
Yes, I see your point.

260
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:19,956
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should've known to say:

261
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,290
"Jesse, don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days."

262
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,088
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch.

263
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:28,674
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.

264
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:30,801
- Jesus.
- Okay, just...

265
00:20:34,721 --> 00:20:38,934
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

266
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:40,769
Okay.

267
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:42,187
How?

268
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:53,573
You gonna be okay?

269
00:20:54,074 --> 00:20:55,951
Oh, damn it.

270
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:59,329
What's it taste like?

271
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:00,998
Bad, huh?

272
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:10,507
This is good.
This is good. Right here.

273
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:13,760
Okay. There.

274
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:17,723
Here. Red to red, black to black.

275
00:21:22,436 --> 00:21:27,357
Positive, negative.
All right. Start it up.

276
00:21:30,986 --> 00:21:33,238
What the hell's wrong with this thing?

277
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:36,366
- You have to really pull.
- I am.

278
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:38,368
No, really pull, not like a girl.

279
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:41,246
You know what? Pull this.
I am pulling.

280
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,916
It just needs to warm up a little.
All right.

281
00:21:47,294 --> 00:21:48,420
Oh, my God.

282
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:51,757
Oh, jeez.

283
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:19,743
Well done, Jesse, as always. Just...

284
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:22,579
Well done.

285
00:22:24,331 --> 00:22:25,707
God.

286
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,691
Come on, you bitches.

287
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:52,901
Hear me now.

288
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:54,903
Damn it.

289
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:03,746
Stupid.

290
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,085
Okay, now we have to use your phone.

291
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:12,594
This is ruined. Do you understand?
Just ruined.

292
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:14,756
You hooked it up wrong and blew it up.

293
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,593
No, no, no.
That is not what happened.

294
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:18,927
How do you know?

295
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:22,639
What I know is that I wasn't the one
who dumped out the last of our water.

296
00:23:22,723 --> 00:23:24,599
- That's what I know.
- There was a fire.

297
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:26,518
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

298
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,877
Is that what you were...?
You were thinking?

299
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:30,981
Now that we have identified the problem...

300
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:33,275
You and thinking, that's the problem.

301
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:38,530
Look, somebody is going to
have to pick us up, all right?

302
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:40,991
Your wife is not gonna notice
one little call.

303
00:23:42,743 --> 00:23:44,870
Mr. White, come on.

304
00:23:45,371 --> 00:23:46,538
God.

305
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:51,835
All right, look, just make it snappy.

306
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:55,130
- Roaming drains the battery.
- All right.

307
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:00,135
Yo, Skinny, hey.

308
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:03,514
Yeah, yeah. Listen, man,
I need you to come pick us up.

309
00:24:03,722 --> 00:24:08,185
Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
You got a pen for directions?

310
00:24:08,394 --> 00:24:10,229
Look, pencil's fine, retard.

311
00:24:10,437 --> 00:24:12,898
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

312
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:14,441
All right, so you ready?

313
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,737
All right, so you're gonna head west
on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?

314
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:23,575
And you're gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

315
00:24:23,784 --> 00:24:25,744
All right... No, big arrows, giant arrows.

316
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:28,038
They light up and blink.
You can't miss them.

317
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:31,625
Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
because there's this dirt road.

318
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:34,586
It's right before the white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

319
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:37,548
Now you're gonna be way, way out
in the boonies, okay?

320
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:42,011
Like crazy far, so just keep heading
down that dirt road for like what?

321
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:44,013
About another 15 miles.

322
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:46,974
- Really? That far?
- Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.

323
00:24:47,182 --> 00:24:50,393
All right, just go down that road
for like 15 more miles, all right?

324
00:24:50,477 --> 00:24:54,189
I mean, we're way the hell out here.
All right?

325
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:57,901
Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.
Bring water.

326
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,737
Leave now.

327
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:01,780
Here.

328
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:03,615
He's coming.

329
00:25:09,997 --> 00:25:12,458
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel

330
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:15,085
who broke his leg mountain biking,

331
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:17,963
and he had to drink urine for...

332
00:25:18,172 --> 00:25:21,050
You know,
just until the forest ranger found him.

333
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:27,389
He said it tasted like really hot,
really old soda.

334
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,312
Look, we should just call, you know?

335
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,316
I'll be quick, just be like,
"Yo, where are you?"

336
00:25:39,693 --> 00:25:41,153
All right.

337
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:53,290
Come on.

338
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,461
Yo. Yo, where are you?

339
00:25:58,379 --> 00:25:59,963
Oh, so you saw the white sign?

340
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:02,716
Yes, he's almost here.

341
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:06,720
Oh, man.
We're getting really freaked out.

342
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:09,390
All right, so you're on the dirt road?

343
00:26:09,598 --> 00:26:11,600
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.

344
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:14,895
You just crossed the river?
Yeah. Have you seen anything?

345
00:26:15,104 --> 00:26:17,189
Wait, wait. What river?

346
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:19,775
Yeah, hey, yo, what river?

347
00:26:19,984 --> 00:26:22,652
What the hell river you talking about?
There's no river.

348
00:26:22,736 --> 00:26:24,947
Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you...?

349
00:26:27,282 --> 00:26:28,867
Phone's dead.

350
00:26:33,664 --> 00:26:35,416
Now what?

351
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:41,463
Mr. White, what now?

352
00:26:42,923 --> 00:26:46,301
Oh, come on. Seriously?

353
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:21,587
What's this?

354
00:27:23,964 --> 00:27:25,883
I'm trying to

355
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:28,844
trickle-charge the battery.

356
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:31,639
Seriously?

357
00:27:32,056 --> 00:27:34,099
Just by turning that thing?

358
00:27:34,308 --> 00:27:36,101
The commutator.

359
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,271
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

360
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:44,443
Usually this little piston engine
turns it,

361
00:27:45,527 --> 00:27:48,739
but considering that it's lying here
completely totalled...

362
00:27:53,327 --> 00:27:55,079
Anyway.

363
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,125
Apply a little elbow grease.

364
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:04,713
It'll take longer, a lot longer,

365
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:07,800
but theoretically

366
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:10,928
it should work.

367
00:28:12,513 --> 00:28:14,431
Theoretically.

368
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,146
It has to work.

369
00:28:22,022 --> 00:28:23,857
You understand?

370
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:35,244
Can I try?

371
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,500
Yeah.

372
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:18,454
How much longer?

373
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:22,291
I don't know.

374
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,391
Now?

375
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,226
Hey.

376
00:29:42,061 --> 00:29:43,854
Mr. White.

377
00:29:57,117 --> 00:29:58,577
Hey.

378
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,455
Yeah?

379
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:07,086
Yo, man, you hanging in?

380
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,797
Yeah, I'm good.

381
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:15,678
It's gotta be ready by now, right?

382
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:21,225
No, give it a little longer

383
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:23,519
just to make sure we're...

384
00:30:37,992 --> 00:30:40,661
Methylamine doesn't spoil

385
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:42,329
does it?

386
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:49,128
No. That's not why we're here.

387
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,683
Yo.

388
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,727
Lie much?

389
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,445
Here, push.

390
00:31:29,043 --> 00:31:31,962
Okay, okay, okay.

391
00:31:33,422 --> 00:31:34,840
Now.

392
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,968
Go on.

393
00:31:42,014 --> 00:31:43,432
Please, please, please.

394
00:32:00,824 --> 00:32:03,327
Yes. Yes.

395
00:32:06,622 --> 00:32:10,125
Come on. Damn. No, please, God.

396
00:32:10,334 --> 00:32:12,836
No. God.

397
00:32:14,838 --> 00:32:17,966
Please. Please.

398
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:38,320
Why couldn't I have just gone
to Santa Fe?

399
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,490
Why? Why?

400
00:32:47,204 --> 00:32:49,206
Mr. White.

401
00:32:49,415 --> 00:32:51,041
Mr. White!

402
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:59,057
What are you doing?

403
00:33:00,683 --> 00:33:02,393
Mr. White?

404
00:33:03,686 --> 00:33:05,605
Oh, God.

405
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:25,208
I have this coming.

406
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:29,254
What?

407
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:34,050
I have it coming.

408
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:38,179
I deserve this.

409
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:40,598
Hey, snap out of it.

410
00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:44,769
All right, first off, everything you did,
you did for your family.

411
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:46,479
Right?

412
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:51,317
All I ever managed to do

413
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:54,863
was worry and disappoint them,

414
00:33:55,655 --> 00:33:57,407
and lie.

415
00:33:58,992 --> 00:34:00,201
Oh, God.

416
00:34:01,202 --> 00:34:03,329
All the lies.

417
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:07,041
I can't even...

418
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,253
I can't even keep them straight
in my head anymore.

419
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:14,132
You know what? Screw this.

420
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,927
I'm walking. You can come or not.

421
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:22,432
Where's my other shoe?

422
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:26,895
Jesse. Jesse.

423
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:31,941
Your body

424
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,987
is running dangerously low
on electrolytes.

425
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:41,284
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

426
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,953
And when they're gone

427
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:47,957
your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

428
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:54,255
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

429
00:34:54,464 --> 00:34:58,468
You go marching out there,

430
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:02,555
and within an hour, you will be dead.

431
00:35:02,764 --> 00:35:06,851
Okay, you need to cut out
all your loser crybaby crap right now,

432
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,978
and think of something scientific.

433
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:12,440
Something... Something scientific, right.

434
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:15,610
What? Come on, man.
You're smart, all right?

435
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:18,488
You made poison out of beans, yo.

436
00:35:19,447 --> 00:35:21,950
All right, look. We got...

437
00:35:22,158 --> 00:35:27,288
We got an entire lab right here,
all right?

438
00:35:27,497 --> 00:35:29,665
How about you take
some of these chemicals,

439
00:35:29,749 --> 00:35:32,335
and mix up some rocket fuel?

440
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:35,463
And we can just send up a signal flare.

441
00:35:35,672 --> 00:35:38,967
Or you make some kind of robot
to get us help,

442
00:35:39,175 --> 00:35:41,886
or a homing device,

443
00:35:42,095 --> 00:35:43,930
or build a new battery or...

444
00:35:44,139 --> 00:35:45,974
Or wait, no.

445
00:35:46,182 --> 00:35:48,532
What if we just take some stuff
off of the RV,

446
00:35:48,643 --> 00:35:52,105
and build it into something
completely different?

447
00:35:52,313 --> 00:35:55,191
You know, like a...
Like a dune buggy.

448
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,862
And that way,
we can just dune-buggy or...

449
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:04,033
What? Hey. What is it?

450
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,578
What?

451
00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:10,373
Do you have any money?

452
00:36:10,582 --> 00:36:11,708
Change, I mean. Coins.

453
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:14,711
- Yeah, I got a bunch from the...
- Okay.

454
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:16,754
- Yes.
- Gather them.

455
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:20,842
And washers and nuts and bolts
and screws,

456
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:24,553
and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

457
00:36:24,637 --> 00:36:28,224
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

458
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:30,643
- Solid zinc, okay.
- And... And bring me...

459
00:36:30,852 --> 00:36:33,229
Bring me brake pads.

460
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:37,025
The front wheels should have discs.
Take them off and bring them to me.

461
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:39,986
- Okay. Brake pads, okay.
- Brake pads.

462
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:45,575
What are we building?

463
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:49,329
- You said it yourself.
- A robot?

464
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:51,664
- A battery.
- Yes.

465
00:36:51,873 --> 00:36:53,750
Move!

466
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:09,182
This doesn't look like any battery
I ever saw.

467
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,559
Well, trust me, it is a battery.

468
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,522
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

469
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,651
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

470
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,528
Remember the electrolytes?

471
00:37:22,904 --> 00:37:24,072
Well, think about it.

472
00:37:24,572 --> 00:37:27,951
A battery is a galvanic cell.

473
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:30,912
It's no more than an anode and a cathode

474
00:37:31,121 --> 00:37:33,248
separated by an electrolyte, right?

475
00:37:34,082 --> 00:37:36,042
- Right.
- Yeah, well, anyway.

476
00:37:36,251 --> 00:37:39,879
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide,

477
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:42,298
and graphite from your brake pads.

478
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:46,678
This is the cathode.
This is the positive terminal.

479
00:37:46,886 --> 00:37:51,141
This is where the supply of current
flows out from, you see?

480
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,977
Then... Here, I'll show you.

481
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:56,729
On the opposite side is our anode.

482
00:37:57,188 --> 00:37:58,773
This.

483
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:01,734
It's zinc.

484
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:07,031
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

485
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,660
- So the sponge is the electrolyte?
- Yeah.

486
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:14,747
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

487
00:38:14,956 --> 00:38:19,043
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
the sponges in.

488
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:21,504
Good.

489
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,302
Good. And now, what shall we use

490
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,180
to conduct this beautiful current with?

491
00:38:30,597 --> 00:38:35,727
What one particular element
comes to mind?

492
00:38:41,524 --> 00:38:43,401
Wire.

493
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,071
Copper.

494
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,324
- Oh, I mean...
- Copper.

495
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:50,950
Right.

496
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:56,039
The only question now is
will this supply enough current?

497
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:59,167
And how many cells will we need?

498
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:02,253
We've only got material enough for six.

499
00:39:07,675 --> 00:39:09,344
Okay.

500
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:15,391
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.

501
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,060
All right.

502
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:21,022
Cathode.

503
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:27,737
Anode.

504
00:39:27,946 --> 00:39:30,949
Damn. That is good.

505
00:39:31,157 --> 00:39:34,452
That is very good.
Okay. Here we go.

506
00:39:54,431 --> 00:39:55,432
Come on.

507
00:40:39,058 --> 00:40:42,103
<i>Attention, passengers.:

508

509
00:40:44,814 --> 00:40:47,317
<i>Any bags left unattended

510
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:49,277
How's the...?

511
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:53,031
It's fine.

512
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:07,337
I know I can trust you to...

513
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,673
Yeah.

514
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:15,303
Hey, whatever happens

515
00:41:15,762 --> 00:41:18,181
your family will get your share.

516
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:22,602
Thank you.

517
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:33,196
So...

518
00:41:36,783 --> 00:41:40,203
I'll be hearing from you, yeah?

519
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,542
Yeah.

520
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:06,229
<i>How's everyone doing?</i>

521
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:12,152
Is that baby ever gonna come out,
you think?

522
00:42:13,403 --> 00:42:17,407
- I know. I know, enough already. It's...
- I'm teasing.

523
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:19,576
Everything in its time.

524
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:24,038
Walt, I have your scan results.

525
00:42:25,415 --> 00:42:28,960
- Yeah.
- You're showing signs of remission.

526
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:35,175
- Oh, my God.
- I wanna clarify.

527
00:42:35,383 --> 00:42:38,133
There are misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

528
00:42:38,303 --> 00:42:40,680
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

529
00:42:41,222 --> 00:42:43,057
To classify someone as in remission

530
00:42:43,141 --> 00:42:45,976
we only need to determine
that the tumour hasn't grown.

531
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,438
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

532
00:42:49,147 --> 00:42:50,297
Technically speaking

533
00:42:50,398 --> 00:42:53,443
a tumour can remain
the exact same size it was before,

534
00:42:53,651 --> 00:42:56,112
and the patient
could still be in remission.

535
00:42:56,321 --> 00:42:59,866
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage lll adenocarcinoma

536
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:02,076
I'd like to see, I hope to see

537
00:43:02,285 --> 00:43:05,914
at least a 25-to 35-percent
reduction in tumour mass

538
00:43:06,122 --> 00:43:11,628
something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

539
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:13,630
Everybody still with me?

540
00:43:15,173 --> 00:43:18,802
And how has my cancer responded?

541
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:22,388
Walt, your tumour has shrunk
by 80 percent.

542
00:43:28,311 --> 00:43:30,271
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

543
00:43:30,355 --> 00:43:32,607
Wait, I'm really... I'm confused.

544
00:43:32,816 --> 00:43:35,235
Is...? Isn't 80 percent a lot?

545
00:43:36,236 --> 00:43:40,490
- Mom, yeah.
- Yes, 80 percent is a lot.

546
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:43,951
- Okay, but, I'm... Wait...
- Sweetheart, you were right.

547
00:43:44,035 --> 00:43:46,788
- It's very good news.
- It's very good news.

548
00:43:46,996 --> 00:43:50,041
- Oh, my God.
- My God, are you kidding me?

549
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,462
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

550
00:44:03,221 --> 00:44:04,889
That's great.

551
00:44:06,558 --> 00:44:09,769
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

552
00:44:09,978 --> 00:44:13,857
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

553
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:17,193
It's okay. This is fairly common.

554
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:19,819
See that scary-looking thing there?

555
00:44:20,572 --> 00:44:23,825
That's tissue inflammation.
It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.

556
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:27,411
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

557
00:44:27,495 --> 00:44:29,581
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

558
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:32,709
Tissue inflammation? I...

559
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:34,878
Are you sure about that? I mean, I...

560
00:44:35,086 --> 00:44:40,884
Because the other day,
I was coughing up some blood.

561
00:44:42,302 --> 00:44:44,102
- What?
- You probably have a tear

562
00:44:44,304 --> 00:44:46,013
in your oesophagus from coughing.

563
00:44:46,097 --> 00:44:48,947
That can be serious.
You could rupture and bleed to death.

564
00:44:49,267 --> 00:44:52,603
This is something we're gonna have to
deal with before you leave today.

565
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:55,637
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

566
00:44:55,774 --> 00:44:58,318
- I'm sorry, I just...
- No more secrets, Walt.

567
00:44:58,526 --> 00:45:02,238
With something like this,
you have to call me immediately.

568
00:45:03,782 --> 00:45:06,742
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

569
00:45:06,826 --> 00:45:08,776
But now at least we have some options

570
00:45:08,953 --> 00:45:11,831
the most important of which is time.

571
00:45:13,082 --> 00:45:15,459
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

572
00:45:15,543 --> 00:45:19,339
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.

573
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:24,677
- Yes.
- Yeah.

574
00:45:24,886 --> 00:45:26,054
Oh, my God.
