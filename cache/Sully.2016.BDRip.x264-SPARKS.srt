1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,856
Cactus 1549.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,598
Runway four. Cleared for takeoff.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,514
Cactus 1549. Cleared for takeoff.

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,270
Mayday, mayday. Cactus 1549.

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,954
We've lost both engines. Both engines.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,959
No relight on one or two.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,456
Cactus 1549,
if we can get it for you,

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,118
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,496
Departure control, we can make it.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,750
We're turning back towards LaGuardia.

11
00:00:48,774 --> 00:01:00,774
<font color="#ffff80"><b>Fixed & Synced by bozxphd. Enjoy The Flick</b></font>

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,995
LaGuardia Tower, Cactus 1549,
trying to make 1-3.

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,673
Sully, we're too low.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,353
Sully, we're too low!

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,714
Come on.

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,640
Just a little farther.

17
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,593
Come on.

18
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Sully!

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,354
Lorrie, I love you.

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,396
What the hell's the matter with you?

21
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,999
The onboard count, 150 passengers,

22
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,355
three flight attendants
and two pilots, one of whom,

23
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,398
the senior pilot, drew on
all of his experience and skill,

24
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,955
which combined with
near-miraculous good luck

25
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,872
and a result that was,
frankly, astounding.

26
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,837
There were some non-critical injuries,

27
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,079
but everyone, everyone, survived.

28
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,357
The first pictures
of US Airways Flight 1549 reveal...

29
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,830
You think that you're gonna die.
That's what you think.

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,560
And then, miraculously, you don't.

31
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,593
Thank you, Captain.

32
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,349
Thank you, thank you.

33
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,637
Okay, thank you,
everybody, thank you.

34
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,960
Thank you, Captain Sullenberger,
for being here today.

35
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,156
We also wanna welcome
First Officer Skiles.

36
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,856
I'm glad you could make it in
this morning.

37
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,791
Not as glad as we are.

38
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,016
For the record,
we had an Aircraft Systems Team

39
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
on this investigation.

40
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,872
Also Aircraft Structures, MRT,

41
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,917
Aircraft Performance, ATC,

42
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,038
Wildlife Factors, Survival Factors
and Emergency Response.

43
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,829
Today, we begin with our operation
and human performance investigation

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,275
on the crash of US Airways Flight 1549.

45
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,670
- Water landing.
- Captain?

46
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,671
This was not a crash
and it wasn't a ditching.

47
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,949
We knew what we were
trying to execute here.

48
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,155
It was not a...

49
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,436
It was not a crash.
It was a forced water landing.

50
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,440
Why didn't you attempt
to return to LaGuardia?

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,391
There simply was not enough altitude.

52
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,240
The Hudson was the only place
that was long enough and smooth enough

53
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,720
and wide enough to even attempt
to land the airplane safely.

54
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,920
Air Traffic testified

55
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,920
that you stated
you were returning to LaGuardia,

56
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,552
but you did not.

57
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,392
As I began the left turn,

58
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,028
I realized I couldn't make it back

59
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,136
and it would have eliminated
all the other options.

60
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
Returning to LaGuardia
would have been a mistake.

61
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,736
Okay, well, let's get into how you
calculated all those parameters.

62
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,120
There was no time for calculating.

63
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,632
I had to rely on my experience
of managing the altitude and speed

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,870
of thousands of flights over four decades.

65
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,616
You're saying you didn't do any...

66
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,119
I eyeballed it.

67
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,431
You eyeballed it?

68
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,473
Yes.

69
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,598
The best chance those passengers had
was on that river.

70
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,634
And I'd bet my life on it.

71
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,074
In fact, I did.

72
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,993
And I would do it again.

73
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,957
Aviation engineers are theorizing

74
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,156
you had enough energy
to make it back to a runway.

75
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,795
Well, engineers are not pilots.

76
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,598
They're wrong.

77
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,519
And they weren't there.

78
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,136
Regardless, we have to follow up
on all implications

79
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,752
as part of our investigation.

80
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,434
Our computers will run
return scenario algorithms.

81
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,160
It'll generate simulations
with your exact parameters.

82
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,197
The dual engine loss, the altitude.

83
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,590
Everything you faced
when you made your decision.

84
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,069
I would like to oversee
those computer simulations.

85
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,920
Not possible during an investigation.

86
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,555
You stated that it was
a dual engine failure

87
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,035
due to multiple bird strikes?

88
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,031
That would be unprecedented.

89
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,473
Well, everything is unprecedented
until it happens for the first time.

90
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,520
How much sleep did you get
the night before?

91
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,039
Eight hours. Enough.

92
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,918
Is it possible your blood sugar was low?

93
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,958
I was rested, alert
and completely aware of my surroundings.

94
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,296
When was your last drink,
Captain Sullenberger?

95
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Nine days ago.

96
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
Drugs?

97
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
No. Never.

98
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,159
First Officer Skiles?

99
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,311
Uh, don't drink. Never have.

100
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,594
Captain, have you had
any troubles at home lately?

101
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,793
No more than anyone else.

102
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,996
And nothing that affected my work.

103
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,757
It's bullshit.

104
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,390
Why are they looking for something
we did wrong when it all turned out right?

105
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,816
It didn't turn out all right
for the airline

106
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,114
and their insurance company.

107
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,998
We should expect some blowback.

108
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,176
Come on, Mike. What are they gonna say?
That he shouldn't have saved everybody?

109
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,839
It's not personal.
NTSB's just doing its job.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,878
Once they have all the facts,
it'll calm down.

111
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,189
Sully,

112
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,477
they should pin on the medal
and send you back to work.

113
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,176
Sorry. This mailbox is full.

114
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,351
I didn't call Lorrie since this morning.
Apparently everyone else did.

115
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,912
Not meaning to bother, but I have to say,

116
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,036
it is an honor driving you today.

117
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,793
Thank you.

118
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,678
What has it been this year so far?

119
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,475
Bernie Madoff, two wars without end.
Many million new people with no work.

120
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,875
And that's just the first
two weeks of January.

121
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,869
Friday's headline? This is beautiful.

122
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,398
Hey, Mike. How about we add
the driver as a character witness?

123
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,475
Finally!

124
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,232
Yeah, finally.

125
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,675
The NTSB had us tied up all day.

126
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,429
I know.

127
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,593
I just needed to hear your voice.

128
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,432
I've been hearing everybody else's.

129
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,875
You'd be amazed how many cousins you have.

130
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,271
It doesn't feel much like family here.

131
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,551
Pretty quiet here, too.

132
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,753
The reporters want me to give an update
inside the mind of Sully.

133
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,274
What should I tell them?

134
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,176
Lorrie, tell them you're not
allowed to talk to anybody.

135
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,792
- Look, I can't hear you.
- Lorrie, I...

136
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,016
- I can't hear you. Call me back.
- I'm trying to tell you

137
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,256
you do not have to talk to anybody.

138
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,918
I can't hear you. Call me back.

139
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,798
Lorrie, I'm trying to tell...

140
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,936
Hey, Captain Sully!

141
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,680
- Captain Sully!
- Sully!

142
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,016
How does it feel to be a miracle maker?

143
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,314
Sully, one question!

144
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,696
- How did you pull off the impossible?
- Sully!

145
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,915
Captain Sully! Sully!

146
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,195
Pardon me.

147
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,840
Captain Sully!

148
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,336
I'm thinking about
running over the press with the car.

149
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,510
Self-defense.
You think a jury would convict?

150
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,080
Just do what you have to do.

151
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,192
You know, I'm taking that as permission.
The cops'll be coming after you.

152
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,998
Sullenberger couldn't be here.

153
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,191
He is not able to speak to the media

154
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,989
while the NTSB
is conducting its investigation.

155
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,511
Sully, are you listening to me?

156
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,796
Maybe we should talk later.

157
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,996
Honey, it is later.
I've been waiting all day.

158
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,309
Are you okay?

159
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,710
Yeah, just tired, that's all.

160
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,393
How are the girls?

161
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Well, they're...

162
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,470
They're a little overwhelmed.
It sounds like you are, too.

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Yeah...

164
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,872
Yeah, well, they'll be all right.

165
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,155
It is a lot.

166
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,588
Yes, it is.

167
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,856
Those missing engines

168
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,760
were definitely not
what investigators wanted...

169
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,311
The whole world is talking about you.

170
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,794
My Sully.

171
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,872
God, I just can't believe this.

172
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,072
Lorrie, I have to stay here longer

173
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,912
for the NTSB investigation.

174
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,868
Did I tell you that already?
I apologize if I didn't tell you.

175
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,559
There is no need for you to apologize.
You are right where you need to be.

176
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,032
I want you to know,
I did the best I could.

177
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,878
Of course you did. You saved everyone.

178
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,558
Uh, maybe we should
just talk in the morning. I'm tired.

179
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,314
I'm overwhelmed by all this attention.

180
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,753
I'm gonna be on TV in the morning.

181
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,800
What are they gonna ask me?
What am I gonna say?

182
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,076
Sully, do you want me to come be with you?

183
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,158
No, Lorrie.

184
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,756
Thanks, but the girls need you.

185
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,233
Tell them I love them.

186
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,549
I love you. Get some sleep.

187
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,309
Yeah.

188
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,914
Hey, maybe when I wake up,
it'll be January 14th.

189
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,229
Wouldn't that be good?

190
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,639
I love you.

191
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,831
Why Captain Sullenberger
made that fateful decision

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,514
to turn the Hudson into a runway?

193
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,318
Well, only he can answer.

194
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,109
But we now know it was the wrong choice.

195
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,354
A choice that endangered the lives
of all of those onboard.

196
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,274
So, while much of the country
hails him as a hero,

197
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,477
this new information will certainly
change everyone's understanding

198
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,035
of the so-called "Miracle on the Hudson."

199
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,115
Sully Sullenberger,
are you a hero or a fraud?

200
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,952
- Hello?
- Jeff?

201
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,673
I'm sorry to call so late.

202
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,195
It's okay.
There's no sleep in this room either.

203
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,193
Can you believe they charge
$5 for a Snickers?

204
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,040
I could bankrupt the airline
in about four bites.

205
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,911
Just thought
maybe you would want to, uh...

206
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Talk?

207
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,593
Absolutely.

208
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,672
Let's get some air.

209
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,395
Great.

210
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,196
All right. Be down there in five minutes.

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,718
You enjoying the shakes?

212
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,158
The nightmares, rapid heartbeat.

213
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
A little bit.

214
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,317
Union's offering us counseling.

215
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,511
Yeah. What are they gonna say?

216
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,717
"You were in a plane crash and lived.

217
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,269
"It may have a minor impact
on your day-to-day."

218
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,678
I don't like not being
in control of the process.

219
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,876
- I want my self back.
- Yeah.

220
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,480
I'm hoping six months from now,
we'll just be laughing

221
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,676
about how we got to meet David Letterman.

222
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,111
We're doing David Letterman?

223
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,350
Yeah. Right after the next NTSB interview.

224
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Letterman.

225
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,269
I'm guessing Dave
is gonna be slightly funnier.

226
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,708
This is so surreal.

227
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,758
I guess I'm having a little trouble

228
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,718
separating reality
from whatever the hell this is.

229
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,029
Yeah.

230
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,395
This is two men freezing their asses off.

231
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,075
Sully.

232
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,556
Don't worry. You did a great thing.

233
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,870
It's gonna be remembered
for a very long time.

234
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,752
Here's the funny thing.

235
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,230
I've delivered a million passengers
over 40 years in the air,

236
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,079
but in the end,
I'm gonna be judged on 208 seconds.

237
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,196
Come on. Tomorrow's gonna be a good day.

238
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,150
Computer sims will prove you were right.
We can all put our wings back on.

239
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,673
You wanna run?

240
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,068
Yeah, let's run.

241
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,638
Fucking cold out here.

242
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,753
It was obvious.

243
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,319
It was a critical situation,

244
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,913
losing thrust in both engines
at a low altitude

245
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,273
over one of the most densely
populated areas of the planet.

246
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,595
But choosing to land on the Hudson,
that was still a big "if."

247
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,351
I was sure I could do it.

248
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,954
You were?

249
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,514
Yes.

250
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,192
How do you feel
when people call you a hero?

251
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,435
I don't feel like a hero.

252
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,950
I'm just a man who was doing his job.

253
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,874
The right man for the job
at the right time.

254
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,790
You've been flying for what,
nearly 40 years?

255
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,000
Forty-two. It's been my life.

256
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,757
My whole life.

257
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,993
Your aircraft.

258
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,513
My aircraft.

259
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,510
I'll be busy crop dusting
in the Super Cub rest of the summer.

260
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,319
So, you can take the plane up, I guess,
when you please.

261
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,640
Still six bucks an hour.
I'll consider it lesson time.

262
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,274
A pilot never stops acquiring knowledge.

263
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,354
You'll make mistakes, everyone does.
Just learn from them.

264
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,839
Yes, sir.

265
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,828
And never forget,
no matter what's happening,

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,513
to fly the airplane.

267
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,795
Absolutely, sir.

268
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,277
Oh, one other thing,
and this is important.

269
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,749
- Sir?
- You can go ahead and smile.

270
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,395
All right.

271
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,360
- I apologize for the perspiration.
- Oh, no.

272
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
After what you did,

273
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,840
I'd think that Katie
couldn't be too intimidating.

274
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,074
Oh, it wasn't Katie.

275
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,198
It was the lights and the camera
that she brought with her.

276
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,153
Okay. All done.

277
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,430
That was from my mom.

278
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,709
Her name is Brenda,

279
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,633
she says to say "thank you"
and that she's single.

280
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,231
Well, you tell Brenda thank you,
but I've got a girl at home.

281
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,437
- Lucky woman.
- Thank you.

282
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,679
Sully.

283
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,910
Sully. Sully!

284
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,632
Sully, where are you?

285
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,191
I'm standing here calling your name.

286
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,873
What's up with you?

287
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,038
You need to get focused.

288
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,279
Because the media request
avalanche continues.

289
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,668
Yeah. Yeah.

290
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,160
Larry Rooney volunteered to jump in

291
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,316
and ride shotgun with you
the rest of the way.

292
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,638
Thought you might need a friend.

293
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,950
He'll take you to today's NTSB meeting.

294
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,319
Airbus completed their
computer simulations as well.

295
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,391
Good. Good, that'll help.

296
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,597
There's something else.
Arnie Gentile called.

297
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,639
He has the ACARS data.

298
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,155
The left engine
was still operating at idle.

299
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,313
Not possible. I felt it go.

300
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,232
It was like we were stopped in midair.

301
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,914
Arnie said there was a chance
it was sub-idle,

302
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,877
that it still could've had thrust.

303
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,837
I'm just letting you know
since the NTSB already does.

304
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Hmm.

305
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,793
Is retirement next?

306
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,759
What's next for you? What's next?

307
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,509
Some room, please.

308
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,199
Sully! Over here!

309
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,915
Hey, Larry. Good to see a friendly face.

310
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,311
Might be the last one you see today.

311
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,616
You've got to be kidding me.
We've been through all this before.

312
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,096
Look,
I'm sorry if you're frustrated,

313
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,157
but our job is to investigate
how a plane ended up in the Hudson River.

314
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,992
On the Hudson River.

315
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,839
Isn't it a little early in the year
to go fishing?

316
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,514
Seeking the facts
is hardly "fishing," Mr. Skiles.

317
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,256
Okay,
then here's the most important fact.

318
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,776
There's only two people who know
what happened in the cockpit that day

319
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
and I'm one of them.

320
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,360
And we appreciate your perspective.

321
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,316
Why do you even think we're here today?

322
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,989
It's because Captain Sullenberger
did not head back to LaGuardia.

323
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,713
Look, I just finished training on the A320
and I can tell you,

324
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,856
the only reason the plane operated
as well as it did,

325
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,438
that the aircraft could land anywhere,

326
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,360
is because Captain Sullenberger
turned on the Auxiliary Power Unit.

327
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,516
He was simply following the QRH.

328
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,159
No. No, he wasn't.

329
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,117
He wasn't following
proper procedure at all.

330
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,475
And I know, because
I had the QRH in my hands.

331
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,554
He switched on the APU immediately
after engine rollback.

332
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,551
According to Airbus,
that's the 15th thing on the list to do.

333
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,039
Fifteenth.

334
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,880
If he had followed the damn rules,
we'd all be dead.

335
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,792
Maybe that's the part you don't like.

336
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,996
You're not used to having
answers to your guesses.

337
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,838
Look, what Jeff is saying

338
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,152
is that I know the A320,
what it does and what it doesn't do.

339
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,074
I have read countless CVR transcripts
of deceased pilots

340
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,800
and I have significant
accident investigation experience.

341
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,231
There is no question

342
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,632
that you are a talented, dedicated,
experienced professional.

343
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,354
But all the flights you piloted
before January 15th

344
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,876
and every crash you investigated
are not the purview of this investigation.

345
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,034
Only US Airways 1549 matters today.

346
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,598
Your union has been advised.

347
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,273
ACARS data relayed that the left engine

348
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,311
continued to turn throughout the flight.

349
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,078
Then the ACARS data is wrong.

350
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,912
The evidence shows that the left engine

351
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,356
was at idle or sub-idle
immediately following the bird strike.

352
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,876
You show me the left engine,
I'll show you dead birds and no power.

353
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,272
The left engine was lost in the crash
due to excessive damage on touchdown.

354
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,635
But we can circle back to that later.

355
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,678
Let's just assume that it was,
as you say,

356
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,348
a dual engine loss due to bird strike.

357
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,478
Your weight was 151,510 pounds,

358
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,674
wind and temperature
north, northwest, 21°.

359
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,071
Speed and altitude
200 knots at 2,818 feet.

360
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,279
- Agree?
- Correct.

361
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,656
We were able to run
all the algorithms concurrently.

362
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,117
And the resulting computer simulations
of US Airways Flight 1549

363
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,078
show that the aviation engineers
were correct.

364
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,439
There was enough altitude and speed
after the bird strike

365
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,955
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

366
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,875
Successful?

367
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,395
The plane landed at LaGuardia.

368
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,875
Intact.

369
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,948
Undamaged.

370
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,156
You got that from one computer simulation?

371
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,355
No.

372
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
From 20.

373
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,190
Including attempts made for
Teterboro runways 1-9

374
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,670
and LaGuardia runways 2-2 and 1-3.

375
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,515
Every computer simulation
with the exact flight parameters

376
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,110
demonstrated that a return
to LaGuardia was possible.

377
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,872
And not just possible, probable.

378
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,028
Does anyone need to hear
further computer evidence?

379
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,358
Captain Sullenberger?

380
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,788
First Officer Skiles?

381
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,752
Not at this time.

382
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,753
I would like to go over
the parameters that were used.

383
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,398
We will make them available to the union.

384
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Thank you.

385
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,517
Once the investigation is complete,

386
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,433
we'll be able to share
the actual computer simulations.

387
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,431
For now, they remain confidential.

388
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,477
We cannot afford a leak to the press.

389
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,394
There's been far too much talk
in the press already.

390
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,598
When the complete cockpit
voice recording is compiled,

391
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,957
along with ATC
and all onboard transcripts combined,

392
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,119
we will call you back.

393
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,477
Thank you, gentlemen. Good day.

394
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,114
Thank you.

395
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,708
They're playing Pacman.

396
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,480
You were flying a plane
full of human beings.

397
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,590
Somehow, that's not how I remember it.

398
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,559
It just doesn't seem right.

399
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,751
It's because it's not right.

400
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,440
Sully, you did everything you could
and it was more than enough.

401
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,719
Ask the passengers.

402
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,155
Ask your wife and kids. Ask mine.

403
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,551
So what was the first thing
you heard from the cockpit?

404
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,676
- "Brace for impact." Yes.
- "Brace for impact."

405
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
Now, uh, ever hear that before
coming out of a cockpit?

406
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,199
No, not ever.

407
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Um...

408
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,319
Ever hear that in any other
aspect of your lives?

409
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,108
I don't know.

410
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,238
I don't know.

411
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,714
They could take this show away from me.

412
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,550
Jeff was relaxed and funny.

413
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,096
He should be getting
all of our interview requests.

414
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,200
Are they paying you

415
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,153
for all this media stuff at least?

416
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,833
It's news, Lorr.

417
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,598
No payment is necessary.

418
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,591
Oh, I wish the bank felt the same way.

419
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,153
Why? What do you mean?

420
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,548
It's just...

421
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,309
We got another notice
about the space in Butte County.

422
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,514
We'll find a tenant.

423
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,829
It just takes time.

424
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,776
Yeah, you've been saying that
for nine months, Sully.

425
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,869
It's still vacant.

426
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,712
The economy has to take a turn.

427
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,955
It feels like if we lose that space,
the next domino to fall is the house.

428
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,989
Lorr, we're not gonna lose the house.

429
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,474
I'm sorry.

430
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,279
I'm sorry.

431
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,072
I'm just anxious

432
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,869
and I'm alone and not enough sleep.

433
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
Yeah, I know.

434
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,590
Not a lot of sleep going on here either.

435
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,591
I'm sorry if I'm adding to your stress.

436
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,149
But just tell me
you'll be back in the air soon.

437
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,632
Not until the NTSB
is finished with their investigation.

438
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,799
We need you flying.

439
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,918
Lorr, if this goes badly,

440
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,074
my career as a safety expert
will end as a website and a business card.

441
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,515
I'm more worried
about your career as a pilot.

442
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,591
What if I did blow this?

443
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,638
What are you saying?

444
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,149
What if I did get this wrong,
so close to the end of my career?

445
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,196
If I endangered the lives
of all those passengers?

446
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,350
Sully, watch the news. You're a hero.

447
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,114
Everyone's gonna have to get used to it,
including the NTSB.

448
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,272
Worst case scenario,

449
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,159
the NTSB lists me as the probable cause.

450
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,959
That's immediate retirement. No pension.

451
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,675
My life's work gone.

452
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,957
Okay, you're scaring me now, Sully.
What is going on?

453
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,996
The left engine might have
still been idling.

454
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,872
And the Airbus simulations say

455
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,998
I could've made it back
to LaGuardia safely.

456
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,198
But that doesn't make sense.

457
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,639
Doesn't jibe with everything
I felt in the cockpit.

458
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,510
Then why did you do it, Sully?

459
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,472
What, land in the water?

460
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,914
Wasn't that the most dangerous thing
you could have done?

461
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,674
Good afternoon, Gursimran.

462
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,910
The, uh, tuna basil
or the ham and cheddar?

463
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,548
Tuna basil, Mr. Sully. Very fresh.

464
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,071
- Thank you.
- Be careful up there.

465
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,196
Too cold today. Too much cold.

466
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,709
When are you gonna come fly with me?

467
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,832
When US Air starts flights to Hyderabad.

468
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,510
I will talk to the chairman,
see what we can work out.

469
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,590
- Oh, for heaven's sakes, Diane!
- No!

470
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,432
- It's his birthday!
- Come on! No, Mom!

471
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,033
Just a little something.

472
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,400
The suitcase is already overstuffed
with gifts for Will.

473
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,520
It's always fun to get
something from the airport.

474
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,512
Feels like you've traveled, too.

475
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,438
Ma, he's turning one.

476
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,353
Don't think he'll be discerning
what gift came from where.

477
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,919
But I will.

478
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,957
Maybe a snow globe.

479
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,634
Something he'll remember.
Something "New York."

480
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,030
Were you this generous when we were kids?

481
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,394
Okay, sweetheart.

482
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,869
I'll get you a snow globe, too.

483
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,038
Fine. Come on.

484
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,600
- Good afternoon, Sheila.
- Captain.

485
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,239
- Hello, Donna.
- Captain.

486
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,356
- Jeff.
- Hey, Sully. How are ya?

487
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,394
Hey, guys! Jeff!

488
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,749
We're not gonna make it!

489
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,216
I've been waiting for a year
for this trip, Dad.

490
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,616
I'm not gonna miss this flight.
Just meet us at the gate, okay?

491
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,280
We'll see you there, Uncle Robbie.

492
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,955
Altimeter is verified. 3-0-2-3.

493
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,270
3-0-2-3.

494
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,437
Start checklist complete.

495
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,876
You really think they'll release us?

496
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
I've checked the latest reports.

497
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,400
We're clear all the way to Charlotte.

498
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,269
Then steaks.

499
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,158
Del Frisco's. On me.

500
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,799
Never been.

501
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,269
And I hear good things.

502
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Oh.

503
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,238
The rib eye'll break your heart.

504
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,953
I'm more of a porterhouse man.

505
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,915
The porterhouse will stop your heart.

506
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,840
We are now closed
for US Airways flight 1549,

507
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
service to Charlotte...

508
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Wait, wait!

509
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,680
- You got it.
- Wait, wait, wait!

510
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,109
Hi. I'm sorry.

511
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,959
Um, Spirit sent us.

512
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,096
We got canceled and they said
that we were re-routed.

513
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,439
That you guys had some seats?

514
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,635
Flight is closed.

515
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,314
Wait, see that old guy
limping up right there?

516
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,776
That's my dad. It's an emergency.
He's gotta be on this flight.

517
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,472
What kind of emergency?

518
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,279
- Golf emergency.
- This flight canceled?

519
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,793
Oughta be.

520
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,318
- ID's please.
- Oh, my God!

521
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,616
How many people are traveling?

522
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,789
Three. Thank you.

523
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,473
Nothing together.

524
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,400
That's all right.
Hell, I'll fly on the wing.

525
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,836
Here we go.

526
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,274
22A,

527
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,475
6A

528
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,108
And 6C.

529
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,816
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

530
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Thank you.

531
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,116
- Yes! What!
- Happy ending.

532
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,988
- She gave me the eye.
- You charming bastard!

533
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,354
- Ahoy.
- Welcome aboard.

534
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,656
- How's it going?
- Lucky you made it.

535
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,954
- Yeah, no kidding.
- All right.

536
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,360
- Thank you. Sorry.
- Thank you!

537
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,675
- We're in six, Jeff.
- Oh, no. That's all Jimmy.

538
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,520
I was up till 3:00.
I gotta get some sleep.

539
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,908
You can sleep here.

540
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,016
Not with you verbally running
the course the whole time.

541
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,896
"I think I'll play
the seven iron on the 9th."

542
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,273
No. Good night.

543
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,718
Sorry. Excuse me.

544
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,712
Here. There you go.

545
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,518
- Thanks.
- Yeah, of course.

546
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,513
Hey, guys, I'm in here.

547
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,789
I'm so sorry.

548
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,188
He likes to throw everything.

549
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,351
That's perfect.
I like to catch everything.

550
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,633
Hey, little man.

551
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,559
I googled you last night.

552
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,317
Read all about your company
on your website.

553
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,709
It's impressive.

554
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,440
Thanks.

555
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,357
I thought I was
a good bullshitter, but you?

556
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,909
You could go pro.

557
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
Hey.

558
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,878
Oh, I'm only teasing.

559
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,160
The site does make it sound

560
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,040
like your air safety consulting business
has got about 100 employees

561
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,117
and headquarters in three states.

562
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,633
Then when I dug a little deeper,

563
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,229
I realized it's only you.

564
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,439
Go easy.

565
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,596
I'm just getting it going.

566
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,080
I'm not usually accused
of being a bullshitter.

567
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,751
Don't get me wrong.
Actually, it's a compliment.

568
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,753
Off that website? I'd hire you.

569
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,911
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

570
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,310
Welcome onboard US Airways Flight 1549

571
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,833
with service to Charlotte.

572
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Please review the safety instruction card
in the seatback pocket in front of you.

573
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,589
It explains the safety features
of this aircraft

574
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,036
as well as the location and operation
of the exit and flotation devices.

575
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,760
Your seat cushion serves
as a flotation device.

576
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,191
LaGuardia ramp, Cactus 1549.
Ready for pushback at gate 21.

577
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,496
Cactus 1549, gate 21 cleared to push.

578
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,873
Spot 28, ground for taxi.

579
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,112
Be sure you turn that off.

580
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,793
Tray table up.

581
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,150
Just once I'd like to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

582
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,148
Well, you know the only way to
get out of LaGuardia on time.

583
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,514
Yeah, what's that?

584
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,830
Fly out of JFK.

585
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Funny.

586
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,476
Takeoff minimum fuel quantity verify.

587
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,680
19, 000 pounds required.

588
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,159
We got 21.8 onboard.

589
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,039
19,000 pounds required. 21.8 onboard.

590
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,237
Cactus 1549.
Runway 4. Cleared for takeoff.

591
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,990
Cactus 1549. Cleared for takeoff.

592
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,833
TO/GA.

593
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,353
TO/GA set.

594
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,155
Positive rate.

595
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,988
Gear up, please.

596
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Gear up.

597
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,878
Nice view of the Hudson.

598
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,433
I'll never get over
how beautiful it is up here.

599
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,157
Life's easier in the air.

600
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,992
I guess it is.

601
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,440
Birds!

602
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
Whoa.

603
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,912
Oh, shit.

604
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,475
Oh, yeah.

605
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,512
It's just turbulence, probably.

606
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,954
I'll check the cabin.

607
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,240
What do you think's going on?

608
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
It's okay.

609
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,590
Everyone, might be a good idea
just to keep your seat belts on.

610
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,838
We got one rolling back.

611
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,430
We have both of them rolling back.

612
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,029
Ignition start.

613
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,679
Oh, my God.

614
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,473
I'm starting the APU.

615
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,320
Just double-check your seat belts, please.

616
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,480
Seat belt. Relax.

617
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,096
Can I make sure
your seatbelts are fastened?

618
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,920
Make sure
your seat belts are fastened.

619
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,399
Seat belts.

620
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,073
- What do you think that was?
- I think it was a bird strike.

621
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,796
- Then we're going back to LaGuardia.
- Yeah.

622
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,016
Get out the QRH.

623
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,076
Loss of thrust on both engines.

624
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,636
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is Cactus 1549.

625
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
We hit birds.

626
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,831
Maintain 1-5000, Delta 3-3-1.

627
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,390
We've lost thrust on both engines.
We are turning back towards LaGuardia.

628
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,352
Okay, you need to return to LaGuardia?

629
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,876
- Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- 2-2-0.

630
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,519
Which engine did you lose?

631
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,829
Both. Both engines.

632
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,136
- Supe?
- Yeah?

633
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,639
I have an emergency.

634
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
What's the report?

635
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,115
Both engines.

636
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,510
- What?
- Both engines gone. No thrust.

637
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,880
All right.

638
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,508
LaGuardia says go to runway 1-3.

639
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,308
Tower, stop your departure.
Got an emergency returning.

640
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,118
1549, bird strike.

641
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,077
He lost both engines.
Returning immediately.

642
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,400
Which engine?

643
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,749
He lost thrust in both engines, he said.

644
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,795
Cactus 1549, if we can get it for you,
do you wanna try to land runway 1 -3?

645
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,630
We are unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

646
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,755
I got an A320 diving for the river.

647
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,592
Al, stack all the inbounds to LaGuardia.

648
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,398
Let's put a hold on the tower, please.

649
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,754
Come on, guys, stay on point.

650
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,096
What about over to our right?

651
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,395
Anything in New Jersey? Maybe Teterboro?

652
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,696
T eterboro tower, I need a runway.

653
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,496
Cactus 1549 needs to go
to the airport right now.

654
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,873
Newark tower, what have you got?

655
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,816
You have runway 2-9 cleared and ready.

656
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,240
- You need emergency landing?
- Yes.

657
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Okay, yeah.

658
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,551
Off your right side is Teterboro airport.

659
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,874
Shit.

660
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,398
This is the Captain.

661
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,118
Brace for impact.

662
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,395
Oh, my God.

663
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,709
What?

664
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,433
Brace, brace, brace!

665
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,268
Heads down, stay down!

666
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,870
Brace, brace, brace!

667
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,508
Heads down, stay down!

668
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,636
Cactus 1549, turn right 2-8-0.

669
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,472
You can land runway one Teterboro.

670
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,755
We can't make it.

671
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,478
We're gonna end up in the Hudson.

672
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,596
I'm sorry. Say again, Cactus?

673
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,949
Cactus 1549, radar contact lost.

674
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,040
KC, come on over here.

675
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,117
You also got Newark off your two o'clock
in about seven miles.

676
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,358
Don't go in the river.

677
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,112
- Sir?
- Plug in.

678
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,199
Cactus 1549, if you can,

679
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,794
you got runway 2-9 available at Newark.

680
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,791
It'll be two o'clock in seven miles.

681
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,475
Come on.

682
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,639
Please, God.

683
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,874
I'm sorry, Patrick.

684
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,496
He's inbound to Newark, I know it.
He just went off the box to focus.

685
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Patty.

686
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,039
He'll come back up.

687
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,912
He's heading to Teterboro.

688
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,991
We need other eyes and ears.

689
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,074
Attention, all aircraft
in the vicinity of the GW.

690
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,000
When we come up
around this bend up here,

691
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,838
we'll see the USS Intrepid.

692
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,951
We got an A320 on emergency descent.

693
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,715
Cactus 1549 is low level above the Hudson.

694
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,515
This is helicopter 1-6-7, Mike Tango.
I've got eyes on him.

695
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,199
Okay. I got a chopper with visuals.

696
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,271
I'm staying on this.

697
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,953
He's out there.

698
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,753
He's headed to Newark, seven miles.
It's only seven miles.

699
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,033
Cactus 1549, this is departure control.
On guard, do you read?

700
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,472
He's going down.

701
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,271
Cactus 1549, do you read me?

702
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,319
Shit! He's going down!
He's gonna hit the water.

703
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,069
- KC, take his seat.
- Sure.

704
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,909
Tester's gonna come down.

705
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,237
Breathalyzer, urine samples,
it's standard.

706
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,716
His voice was so calm.

707
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,194
When he said the Hudson,
I didn't believe it.

708
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,431
This isn't happening.

709
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,914
People don't survive
water landings, Henry.

710
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,799
Pull up. Pull up.

711
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,234
We're gonna brace.

712
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Pull up! Pull up!

713
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,275
Thirty.

714
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,114
Twenty.

715
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Ten.

716
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,719
I'd better go.

717
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,033
I am so sorry. I love you.

718
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,318
Yeah. I gotta go.

719
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,816
It had just taken off
from New York's LaGuardia Airport,

720
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,910
bound for Charlotte, North Carolina,

721
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,911
and then a mid-air disaster

722
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,277
struck US Airways Flight 1549.

723
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,228
It's possible that birds flew into
both of the aircraft engines.

724
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,109
The pilot quickly realized he could not
return to the airport and land.

725
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,111
His options severely limited,

726
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,238
the only place he could go down
was the Hudson River.

727
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,113
Choosing to land
on the Hudson, that was a big "if."

728
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,240
Have you had
any troubles at home lately?

729
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,914
Why'd you do it, Sully?
Land in the water?

730
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,496
Sully, you did everything
you could. It was more than enough.

731
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,069
Every computer simulation
demonstrated that a return was possible.

732
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,320
The left engine
was still operating at idle.

733
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,915
There was enough altitude and speed
for a successful return to LaGuardia.

734
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,760
Wasn't that the most
dangerous thing you could have done?

735
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,516
This is Tasty 1-1.
Abort test bombing run.

736
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,456
I have an emergency
flight control malfunction.

737
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,799
Two, join on me.

738
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,996
Roger that.
Two joining on you.

739
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,518
- Feels like hydraulics.
- Sir, do we need to punch out?

740
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,240
No, I can still fly.
I'm running a control test.

741
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,159
Get the checklist.

742
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,656
We have the checklist, sir.

743
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,400
Increasing thrust.
We need altitude.

744
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,714
Hold on, we 're gonna climb.

745
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,080
Nellis Tower, this is Tasty 1-1

746
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,696
with an emergency
flight control malfunction.

747
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,960
We need a straight-in approach.

748
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,096
Roger, Tasty 1-1.

749
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,475
Turn left 2-0-0 to runway 3.

750
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,880
Unable.
I repeat, I need a straight-in approach.

751
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Okay.

752
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,840
Proceed straight ahead to runway 2-1.

753
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,558
2-1, Tasty 1-1.

754
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,112
Two, I'm decreasing speed.

755
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,111
Clear the board for a damage check.

756
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,176
One, you look clean and dry,
but you're still trailing smoke.

757
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,395
Roger that, Two.
Approach runway 2-1.

758
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,229
One, I'll maintain chase
and follow you in.

759
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,896
I have visual on the runway.

760
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,069
What's our heading?

761
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,549
Heading 0-2-0.
Five miles out, sir.

762
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,832
All right. Gear in three.

763
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,280
Tasty 1-1, check air speed.

764
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,191
Looks like you're coming in hot.

765
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,296
Nellis Tower,
I need speed to maintain control.

766
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,231
Avoiding a stall.

767
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,016
One, check your heading.
You're not gonna make the runway.

768
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,075
I got it.

769
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,273
I'm bringing her back.

770
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,235
That was a hell of a landing, sir.

771
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,516
I didn't think we were gonna make it.

772
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,576
I'm gonna start charging you
for this stuff, all right?

773
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,440
- Oh, get out of here.
- You hear me?

774
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,828
- Thanks, Pete.
- Thanks, Pete.

775
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You got any nuts?

776
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,039
- Hey.
- Hey.

777
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,156
Let me know if you need anything.

778
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,595
But what still seems so hard to believe

779
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,354
is that everyone
aboard the plane survived,

780
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,552
including two shivering babies
who were found in a life raft...

781
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
Hey...

782
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,878
Is that you?

783
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,349
- Are you the pilot? Sully?
- Yeah.

784
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,272
- That is you, right?
- Yeah.

785
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,517
Hey, it's a pleasure to meet you.

786
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,871
That was unreal,
what you did the other day.

787
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,355
- That was really something.
- Yeah, he's a hero.

788
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,556
A real pleasure to meet you.

789
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,280
You know, we invented a drink after you

790
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,136
as soon as that happened.
Ain't that right, Johnny?

791
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,957
Yeah, you did. In fact, I'll take one.

792
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,232
The Sully!

793
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,112
It's a shot of Grey Goose

794
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,273
with a, uh, splash of water.

795
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,192
Splash of water.

796
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,795
Hey, listen.

797
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,152
To January 15th.

798
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,955
Best day of the year.

799
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,520
- To Sully.
- Sully.

800
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,720
Hey, Pete.

801
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,155
Sully's here, and he's there!

802
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,595
Damn, Pete. He's everywhere!

803
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,480
Yeah!

804
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,749
Sully!

805
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,075
You're like a real hero, man.
You know that?

806
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,230
Keep it coming, Paulie.
I'll see you on One.

807
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,400
Agreed.

808
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,760
Twenty-one people onboard, Cap.

809
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,558
Last report says
there's ice out by the GW.

810
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,756
- All right, thanks. Roger that.
- All right.

811
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,354
Twenty-one on the TJ,
departing Midtown, slip Seven.

812
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
Unbelievable.

813
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,136
I cannot believe
you have the sack to say that.

814
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,176
That's literally like giving
the entire city the finger.

815
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,200
I'll say it again.

816
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,576
Dennis Eckersley is without question

817
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,760
the greatest relief pitcher
in the history of baseball.

818
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,273
Are you blinded by the leg kick?

819
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,476
Is that what it is? Or is it the mustache?

820
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,360
You're just jealous he was never a Yankee.

821
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
Jealous?

822
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,115
Yeah.

823
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,520
Now, let's turn to page seven...

824
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,391
Brace, brace, brace!

825
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,595
Heads down, stay down!

826
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,239
Let me hold him.

827
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,816
- Brace, brace, brace!
- It's okay. Let me hold him.

828
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,989
Okay.

829
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,037
Heads down, stay down!

830
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,191
Brace, brace, brace!

831
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,435
Heads down, stay down!

832
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,680
- We're not gonna make it, Uncle Robbie.
- It's okay.

833
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,976
Brace, brace, brace!

834
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,353
I love you, Mom.

835
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,875
- Heads down, stay down!
- To the moon and the stars

836
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,880
- and all the way back.
- And all the way back.

837
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,673
Heads down, stay down!

838
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,479
What do we do, darling?

839
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,309
Oh, my God.

840
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,834
Evacuate.

841
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,189
Evacuate.

842
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,799
Grab your life vests, please.

843
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,552
Opening forward door.

844
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,833
It's flooding back here!

845
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,479
Rob Kolodjay!

846
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,596
- Dad!
- Go, go, go!

847
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,478
Everyone! The aft exits are unusable.

848
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,995
Move forward to the overwing exits!

849
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,430
And don life vests now!

850
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,510
Go! Exit! Go, go!

851
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,160
Move forward.

852
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,496
Move forward to the right
or left exit door.

853
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,520
Jeff!

854
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,000
He's back there, can you see him?

855
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,599
Dad!

856
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,480
- Everyone, come forward.
- Jump!

857
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,473
Sir, evacuate the plane right now! Go!

858
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,040
Sheila, the raft didn't deploy.

859
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,479
Sir! Come back, sir!

860
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,994
Calm down. You'll be fine.

861
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,479
The rafts are waiting.

862
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,639
Come on, come on, come on.

863
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,068
Hurry up!

864
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,976
It's gonna be bitter out there.
Here you go.

865
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,753
Here. Gonna be bitter out there.

866
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,960
Slowly.

867
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,576
You need to get off this plane now.

868
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,280
Feet first.
Slide slowly and gently.

869
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,080
- Plenty of room.
- Come on, people.

870
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,717
Okay. It's good now. Jump! Jump!

871
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,238
Oh, my God. Is that gas?

872
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,515
We have to jump.

873
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,188
No, no, no, wait!

874
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,029
You seeing this?

875
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,430
Yeah. Holy Christ, that's a plane.

876
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,909
Deploy that
man overboard ladder right away.

877
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,274
All right, I'm on it.

878
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,549
Shit.

879
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,628
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

880
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,394
Coast Guard sector New York,
channel 1 -6, Thomas Jefferson.

881
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,632
We have a passenger airliner
in the north river.

882
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,109
We're en route. We will advise.

883
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,994
Let's go, let's go!

884
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,833
Jimmy, Jeff's still on that plane!

885
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,680
We can't leave him there!

886
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,432
Robbie, Robbie. Robbie!

887
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,795
Robbie! The crew will grab him, okay?

888
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,416
- The crew will get him, okay?
- He's in there!

889
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,000
He'll be okay. He'll be okay.

890
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,079
I'm okay, Mom. I'm okay.

891
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,759
- Ma!
- Just leave me.

892
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,751
Keep moving forward!

893
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,592
Follow your instructions.

894
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,736
- It's all right.
- There's water in the back.

895
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,296
- We're doing fine.
- Come on. Let's get out!

896
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,680
One after another. Keep moving forward.
Keep moving forward.

897
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,279
This way. I'll help you out.

898
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,776
You go ahead, sweetheart.

899
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,800
Come on. She can't move.

900
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,216
- Sir! Can you come help us?
- Yes, ma'am?

901
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,240
Right there.

902
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,789
Here's a floatation device.
Take that.

903
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,796
Everyone, keep moving forward.

904
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,757
Over the wings.

905
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,435
If you have a life vest, put it on!

906
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,070
All series near the Intrepid,
plane down.

907
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,357
We got passengers on the wings.
Approach with caution.

908
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,920
Stay calm and you'll all get out.

909
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,440
Thank you.

910
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,199
Move forward, move forward.

911
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,035
Come on!

912
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,949
Come on!

913
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,912
Put a blanket on her leg.

914
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,673
She needs a tourniquet.

915
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,796
You're gonna be fine, honey. Go slow.

916
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,559
Go slowly. Blanket.

917
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,789
Wrap this around her leg. Make it tight.

918
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,551
It's so cold out here.

919
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,351
Get those first-aid kits
up to the bow

920
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,272
and get some extra life jackets out there.

921
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,437
We're here! We're here!

922
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,277
It's all right. We're here.

923
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,154
Give me a countdown, Victor.

924
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,719
All right.

925
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,160
Three,

926
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,034
two...

927
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,032
We're good. We're good.

928
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,119
Come on, buddy.

929
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,515
Hold it right there, baby. Come on.

930
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,040
Easy. Go easy.

931
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,596
Come on. One at a time.

932
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,397
We're gonna get everybody, guys.

933
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,911
This is Yogi Berra.
We're 30 seconds out.

934
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,709
With a water temperature of 36 degrees
and a wind chill of minus 5,

935
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,758
the surviving passengers of Flight 1549

936
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,275
literally have minutes to live.

937
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,113
We're five out.
We have visual on aircraft.

938
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,456
All right, give me your hand.

939
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,835
If anybody's got any problems,
just wait down there.

940
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,560
We got some really good people
coming on their way, all right?

941
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,833
Stand by.

942
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,190
Fifty yards, go!

943
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,829
You okay?

944
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,911
I got you. You're gonna be okay.
All right?

945
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,080
Got you.

946
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,358
Is anyone still here? Come forward.

947
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,073
Captain! Come back!

948
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,719
Come forward!

949
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,351
We need to get off the plane now.

950
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,349
Captain!

951
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,114
Captain! We have to go!

952
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,271
It's time to get off the plane, right now!

953
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,151
All right, you guys go. Go.
I'll be right behind you.

954
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,677
Sully, we gotta go.

955
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,840
Thank you.

956
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,833
Everybody's okay.
Help is on the way.

957
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,314
Twenty-six passengers
going to Port Imperial.

958
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,516
Nineteen headed to Pier 81.

959
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,116
We got 24 passengers onboard
headed to Port Imperial.

960
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,236
Whoever has miraculously survived

961
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,556
this plummet from the skies
into the icy Hudson

962
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,757
has about 300 of New York's finest
ready to help them.

963
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,196
The only question remaining
is will it be too late?

964
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,635
In Manhattan, Bobby Cuza, New York One.

965
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,080
Come on, sir. Give me your hand.

966
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,120
Grab on.

967
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,920
Give me your hand, sir. It's okay.

968
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,519
We got you.

969
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,912
- My hands.
- Gotta warm them up.

970
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,952
Get him a blanket, fast.

971
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,358
I was sure I was gonna die.

972
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,155
Hey, no one dies today.

973
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,714
Give me your hand.

974
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,629
Here you go, Captain. This way.

975
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,154
Give us your hand, sir.

976
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,639
Sully, wrap it around your arms.

977
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,639
- Climb out now.
- Give me your hand.

978
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,256
Can we get
a couple more blankets over here?

979
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,280
Thank you.

980
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,755
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

981
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,275
Give him some room.

982
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,714
You're welcome.

983
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,355
Hello?

984
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,317
I wanted to call to say I'm okay.

985
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,357
Oh, good. Are you still on the 5:50 home?

986
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,635
There's been an incident.

987
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,829
I'm okay, not a scratch somehow.

988
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,594
Turn on the television.

989
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,030
What do you mean "Turn on the television"?

990
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,679
Lorrie, I can't talk right now.

991
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,030
I will call you from the pier
when things quiet down.

992
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,159
I had to land in the Hudson.

993
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,555
Sully, I don't understand.

994
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,555
I love you, and I'm okay.
Tell the girls I am okay.

995
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,992
But I have to go.

996
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,712
Girls, turn on the TV.

997
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,640
An extensive rescue effort is underway

998
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,877
after a US Airways Flight
crashes into the Hudson River,

999
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,594
- sending passengers scrambling for safety.
- Oh, my God.

1000
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,696
If you have any wet clothing on,
take it off

1001
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,915
and wrap up in a blanket
from the Red Cross.

1002
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,431
You're gonna be okay. Okay, Lucille?

1003
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,068
I'm gonna take you right
to the ambulance, all right?

1004
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,275
Maybe he's here.
Maybe he beat us somehow.

1005
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,673
There's lots of boats! Jeff!

1006
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,240
Sully!

1007
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,515
Dan!

1008
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,875
Dan, I need to know who's hurt
and how badly, and I need a count.

1009
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,679
155, that's my number.
That's passengers and crew.

1010
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,319
Okay. How are you?

1011
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,034
I'll answer that question
when we've counted 155.

1012
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,269
All right.

1013
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,232
Honey, it's me.

1014
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,510
Sort of. I won't be home tonight.

1015
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,999
Sherri, I cannot believe
I am talking to you.

1016
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,193
Captain. I'm here to escort you
to meet with Mayor Bloomberg

1017
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,918
and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.

1018
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,096
If the Mayor wants to say hello,
he'll have to come down here.

1019
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,120
We're still working.

1020
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,396
Sully, I can keep assembling the count.

1021
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,040
Jeff.

1022
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,191
Jeff, I need a count.
We've gotta have a count.

1023
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,216
There's no way to get
a real count out here, Sully.

1024
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,240
Sully, Jeff's right.

1025
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,376
Let's get you in some dry clothes
before you freeze to death.

1026
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,256
Captain, what if the Mayor and Chief Kelly
come down here to meet with you?

1027
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,157
Dan, because it was a domestic flight...

1028
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,673
Yeah, we got no manifest.

1029
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,559
We're gonna have to track
the passenger information down one by one.

1030
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,994
- Can you help?
- Yeah.

1031
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,256
I'm gonna call John Carey.
We're gonna get you a count.

1032
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,840
But, Sully, listen. You've done enough.
Let me take it from here.

1033
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,550
- Jeff?
- Pop!

1034
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,835
- Oh!
- I'm okay.

1035
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I was on the other wing.
They brought us to Jersey.

1036
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,392
I couldn't see you. I couldn't find you.

1037
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,480
I could hear you shouting
my name the whole time.

1038
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,358
I shouted back. I guess the river...

1039
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,880
Are you okay?

1040
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,314
I love you, son.

1041
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,917
I love you, too.

1042
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,552
Can you believe we made it?

1043
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,718
I mean, the plane crashed

1044
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,677
on the river!

1045
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,439
Are you kidding me?

1046
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,640
Ah, so unbelievable.

1047
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,517
I've never been so happy
to be in New York in my life.

1048
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Hey, Patty.

1049
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,594
Supe sent me looking for you.

1050
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,239
Everyone's going nuts up top.

1051
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,595
- Aren't you coming?
- I guess you didn't hear.

1052
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,228
I lost Cactus 1549 in the Hudson.

1053
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,151
Huh. I guess you haven't heard.
He landed the son of a bitch!

1054
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,668
What?

1055
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,269
Everyone's been pulled off.
It's a miracle!

1056
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,317
I thought I lost them all.

1057
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,596
- They've got to get a TV in here.
- Yeah. Seriously.

1058
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,230
What is my pulse rate?

1059
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,432
It's 110.

1060
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,037
My normal resting is 55.

1061
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,428
110...

1062
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,559
That's not good.

1063
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:00,234
You are right. 110 is not good.

1064
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,716
After what you just went through,
110 is extraordinary.

1065
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,677
How is Doreen?

1066
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,273
Fairly severe laceration.

1067
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,216
But we'll keep her a day or two
to stem the infection.

1068
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,355
But she'll be okay?

1069
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,875
She'll have a scar
and a hell of a story to tell.

1070
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,216
Although no one'll believe her.

1071
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,656
Hell, I'm standing here with you right now
and I don't believe it.

1072
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,496
You landed a plane on the Hudson.
Not a scratch on you.

1073
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,555
Arnie.

1074
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,758
The union is pulling out
all the big guns today, huh?

1075
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,559
Talked to Dan Britt, Sully.

1076
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,954
Got a count.

1077
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,234
155.

1078
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,148
155.

1079
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,514
It's official.

1080
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,751
- 155.
- 155.

1081
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,319
155.

1082
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,558
Thank you, Arnie.

1083
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,271
- Hey, Carl.
- Jeff.

1084
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,793
- Sully.
- Carl.

1085
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,800
Hell of a thing you pulled off
out there today.

1086
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:25,915
Well, we're here.

1087
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,957
It's about all I know at the moment.

1088
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,032
Oh, this is Ms. May, with the hotel.

1089
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,720
Wanted to have a quick word with you.

1090
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,160
I won't take your time, gentlemen.

1091
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,456
This is only to say that my staff and I

1092
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,856
are committed to protecting your privacy.

1093
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,394
So, if there's anything I can do at all...

1094
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,711
If it's possible, I'd love to have
my uniform dry-cleaned overnight.

1095
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,320
It's the only clothing that I have.

1096
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,480
Dry-cleaning?

1097
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,232
If it's too much... If it's too late...

1098
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,549
Are you kidding?

1099
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,593
Captain Sullenberger,
I'd give you this whole hotel if I could.

1100
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,389
Oh, okay.

1101
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,590
Well, thank you, Evelyn.
Thank you very much.

1102
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,591
- Anything for Sully.
- Okay.

1103
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,159
Have a blessed day.

1104
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,953
What just happened?

1105
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,350
You just got hugged by a total stranger.

1106
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,273
Ah, come on, Sully.

1107
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,431
When's the last time you heard of someone

1108
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,591
landing a jet plane on the water

1109
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,439
and everybody lived?

1110
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,955
Exactly.

1111
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:24,115
I got shaving cream,
razor blades, toothpaste.

1112
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,277
And new clothes.

1113
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,836
What, did you think we were ninjas?

1114
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,672
Kmart was the only store open.

1115
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,136
It's Queens. It's 10:00 in the evening.

1116
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,628
- You find a Brooks Brothers.
- Yeah.

1117
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,120
Sully.

1118
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,552
What are you even still doing in uniform?

1119
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,552
Ah. You know, I don't know.

1120
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,315
Look, guys. It's been a long day.
Why don't you get some rest?

1121
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,314
Mike Cleary will be over in the a.m.
and make sure you're both doing okay.

1122
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,270
- Thank you, Carl.
- Yeah, thank you, Captain.

1123
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,474
It's been a while since
New York had news this good.

1124
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,640
Especially with an airplane in it.

1125
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,839
I'll see you later, Sully.

1126
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,590
The word city officials
keep repeating is "timing."

1127
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,877
The perfect timing of the NYPD scuba units

1128
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:43,071
and of the ferry boat captains,

1129
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:47,392
and of course, the inexplicably
precise timing of the pilot.

1130
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:50,950
Captain "Sully" Sullenberger,
who, with almost no time,

1131
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,350
became a man for all time.

1132
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,680
This is Kristine Johnson...

1133
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,840
The ti mi ng.

1134
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,680
Reporting live from the Hudson River.

1135
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,976
New York One Minute.

1136
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,136
The coast guard released this new video
of Flight 1549

1137
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,116
making its emergency landing
on the Hudson.

1138
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,192
Meanwhile, the search is launched
for the engine of the aircraft.

1139
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,552
Hey, Sully. Let me...

1140
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,119
Come on. Answer.

1141
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,915
Answer!

1142
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,435
Larry, the CVR is in two days.
How fast can you arrange a favor?

1143
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,715
Sully?

1144
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,555
I know that Airbus has simulations
scheduled for the S22 sim at the factory.

1145
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,315
But that's next week in Toulouse.
Can you get them to reschedule?

1146
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,754
It's 1:30 in the morning.

1147
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,040
I need you to make it happen

1148
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,639
before we listen to the CVR.

1149
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,756
Before our testimony is complete.

1150
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,069
Why?

1151
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,638
I have a right to see the simulations
and I have a feeling that

1152
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,156
with human pilots and not a computer,
the results are going to be different.

1153
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:51,754
What if they show the exact same result?

1154
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,275
If they do,
then I'll hand you my wings myself.

1155
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,793
It's all about the timing, Larry.

1156
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,056
You can accomplish anything
if you're never in a hurry.

1157
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,832
I sure as hell agree with that.

1158
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,309
The CVR is on Wednesday. That's 36 hours.

1159
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,799
Can you make it happen?

1160
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,599
I'll try.
It's a lot of phone calls to make.

1161
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,416
It's already 7:30
in the morning in France,

1162
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,555
so you better get started.

1163
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,597
Thank you, Larry. Thank you.

1164
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,400
Hey, Lorrie.

1165
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,672
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
before the hearing.

1166
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,274
Sweetheart, what happened?

1167
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:45,271
I realized just now,
for the first time, that there were...

1168
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,193
There were 155 people
on that plane and you were one of them.

1169
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,437
We almost lost you.

1170
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:57,072
Yeah, but you didn't. I'm right here.

1171
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,472
How are you holding up?

1172
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,193
Oh, I'm holding up.

1173
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,237
Please tell me this is almost over.

1174
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,318
It's almost over.

1175
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,515
Okay.

1176
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,795
I love you.

1177
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,359
I love you, too.

1178
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,710
I'll call you when they're done with me.

1179
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,316
- Sully.
- Let's go, Larry.

1180
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,355
- Good morning, Sully.
- Jeff.

1181
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,536
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome.

1182
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,709
My name is Charles Porter.

1183
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,559
I've been assigned by the
National Transportation Safety Board

1184
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:05,069
to conduct this public hearing here today.

1185
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,152
We have a lot of material to cover.

1186
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,393
But before we listen to
the cockpit voice recording...

1187
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,480
And we will be listening to it
for the first time

1188
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,079
along with you, gentlemen.

1189
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:17,596
Per the request of
Captain Sullenberger and the union,

1190
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,990
Airbus has agreed to link us via satellite

1191
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,230
to today's piloted simulations.

1192
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,072
Upload link, please.

1193
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,600
They're just simulations, Sully.

1194
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,990
Won't change my mind
about what happened up there.

1195
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,398
Might change theirs.

1196
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,035
Birds.

1197
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,640
Number one's rolling back. And number two.

1198
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,120
Auto pilot's off.

1199
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,476
- Pilot off.
- Flight Director's off.

1200
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,789
Flight Director is off.

1201
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,758
All right. LaGuardia, Cactus 1549,
dual engine failure.

1202
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,279
We have to return to the field.

1203
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,113
Okay. I'm gonna left turn
back to LaGuardia 1 -3.

1204
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,320
I'll activate the approach for you.

1205
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,353
It's activated.

1206
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,953
Runway 1-3.

1207
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,997
Glide slopes coming in nicely.

1208
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,716
- Flaps two.
- Flaps two.

1209
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,712
Sink Rate 900.

1210
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,558
Too low, flaps.

1211
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,473
Flight slow.

1212
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,119
Too low, flaps.

1213
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:25,517
Forty, 30, 20...

1214
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,191
Successful landing
at LaGuardia, runway 1-3.

1215
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:38,640
For the record,

1216
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,872
the pilots and the computer
sims bear the same result.

1217
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,355
Let's try for T eterboro now, please.

1218
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,152
Upload the second run.

1219
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,834
Birds.

1220
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,176
Give me a heading 3-1-0.

1221
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,758
Heading 3-1-0.

1222
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,320
I'm gonna give you direct to Teterboro.

1223
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:06,800
Direct Teterboro.

1224
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,400
One thousand.

1225
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,108
Flaps two.

1226
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,474
Flaps two.

1227
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,720
Too low, terrain.

1228
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,319
Too low, terrain.

1229
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,919
Too low, terrain.

1230
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:34,279
Fifty, 40, 30, 20...

1231
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,468
Successful landing
at Teterboro, runway 1-9.

1232
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,388
Multiple airports, runways,
two successful landings.

1233
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,992
We are simply mimicking
what the computer already told us.

1234
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,150
A lot of toes were stepped on
in order to set this up for today.

1235
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,120
And frankly, I really don't know
what you gentlemen plan to gain by it.

1236
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,596
Can we get serious now?

1237
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,435
Captain?

1238
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,336
We've all heard about
the computer simulations

1239
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,920
and now we are watching actual sims.

1240
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,230
But I can't quite believe

1241
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:20,352
you still have not taken
into account the human factor.

1242
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,039
Human piloted simulations

1243
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,160
showed that you could
make it back to the airport.

1244
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,794
No, they don't.

1245
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:29,119
These pilots were not behaving
like human beings,

1246
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,788
like people who are experiencing this
for the first time.

1247
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,680
Well, they may not be reacting
like you did.

1248
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,352
Immediately after the bird strike

1249
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,078
they are turning back for the airport.

1250
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,196
Just as in the computer sims, correct?

1251
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,360
That is correct.

1252
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,796
They obviously knew the turn
and exactly what heading to fly.

1253
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,319
They did not run a check.

1254
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,833
They did not switch on the APU.

1255
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,275
They had all the same
parameters that you faced.

1256
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,078
No one warned us.

1257
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,033
No one said,
"You are going to lose both engines

1258
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,839
"at a lower altitude
than any jet in history.

1259
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,629
"But be cool.

1260
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,155
"Just make a left turn for LaGuardia

1261
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,595
"like you're going back
to pick up the milk."

1262
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,118
This was dual engine loss at 2,800 feet

1263
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,470
followed by an immediate water landing

1264
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,234
with 155 souls onboard.

1265
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,188
No one has ever trained
for an incident like that.

1266
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:18,360
No one.

1267
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:22,676
The Teterboro landing,
with its unrealistic bank angle

1268
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,235
we were not the Thunderbirds up there.

1269
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,216
I'd like to know how many times
the pilot practiced that maneuver

1270
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,310
before he actually pulled it off.

1271
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,192
I'm not questioning the pilots.

1272
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,793
They're good pilots.

1273
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,872
But they've clearly been instructed
to head for the airport

1274
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,837
immediately after the bird strike.

1275
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,158
You've allowed no time for analysis
or decision-making.

1276
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:48,513
In these simulations, you've taken
all of the humanity out of the cockpit.

1277
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,553
How much time did the pilots
spend planning for this event?

1278
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,278
For these simulations?

1279
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,115
You are looking for human error.

1280
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,238
Then make it human.

1281
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,270
This wasn't a video game.

1282
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,192
It was life and death.

1283
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,910
Sully's right. That's worth a few seconds.

1284
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,514
Please ask how many
practice runs they had.

1285
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,919
Seventeen.

1286
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,798
Seventeen?

1287
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:35,558
The pilot who landed at Teterboro
had 17 practice attempts

1288
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,393
before the simulation we just witnessed.

1289
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,799
Your reaction decision time
will be set at 35 seconds.

1290
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,710
Thirty-five seconds.
That's not enough time.

1291
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,953
We only had 208 seconds total,

1292
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,239
so I'll take it.

1293
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:56,914
Upload the link.

1294
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,433
Return to LaGuardia.

1295
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,160
Now with an added
35-second delay in response time.

1296
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,416
- Birds.
- Okay, I saw them.

1297
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,800
- Give me 35 seconds.
- Thirty-five seconds.

1298
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,989
Time's up.

1299
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,349
Here we go.

1300
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,988
Flight path vector.

1301
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,669
Going for 1 -3.

1302
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,875
Okay.

1303
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,560
Activate confirm.

1304
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,830
All right. You are confirmed.

1305
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,960
We're heading right for the airport.

1306
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,880
Caution, obstacle.

1307
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:51,119
Caution, obstacle.

1308
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,835
We're about
seven miles from the runway.

1309
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,518
Caution, obstacle.

1310
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,552
Terrain, terrain.

1311
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,039
Pull up.

1312
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,280
Pull up.

1313
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,600
Pull up.

1314
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,280
Pull up.

1315
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,671
Too low, terrain.

1316
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,776
We got a little extra speed.

1317
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,835
You want some flaps?

1318
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,993
Too low, terrain.

1319
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,640
No, leave the flaps up.

1320
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,758
Too low, terrain.

1321
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,314
Too low, terrain.

1322
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,034
Too low, terrain.

1323
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:30,193
Fifty, 40, 30, 20...

1324
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,432
Let's try T eterboro.

1325
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,748
Upload the link, please.

1326
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,715
Birds.

1327
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,696
Auto pilot off.
Flight Director off.

1328
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:56,720
Hack the time.

1329
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,281
- Thirty-five seconds.
- Thirty-five seconds.

1330
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,032
Engine one and two fail.

1331
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,360
Turn.

1332
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,760
Okay.

1333
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,711
Let's see if we can make it.

1334
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,400
Heading sub 2-9-8.

1335
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,913
You seeing Teterboro out there?

1336
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,274
I do.

1337
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,039
Way too low.

1338
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,717
Obstacle, obstacle.

1339
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,879
Pull up.

1340
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,955
Pull up.

1341
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,920
Pull up.

1342
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,080
Pull up.

1343
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,440
Pull up.

1344
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,956
Not gonna work, not gonna work.

1345
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,120
Pull up.

1346
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,400
Pull up.

1347
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,751
Pull up.

1348
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,273
Does anyone need to see more simulations?

1349
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,839
Now that we've seen
what could have happened,

1350
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,429
can we, uh, listen to what actually did?

1351
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,838
We will look at all
the results at a later date.

1352
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,314
Elizabeth.

1353
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,994
For the record,

1354
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,675
this is the CVR of US Airways Flight 1549,

1355
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,115
January 15th, 2009.

1356
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,714
Gentlemen, headsets.

1357
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Birds!

1358
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,518
Shit.

1359
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,108
Oh, yeah.

1360
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,318
We got one rolling back.

1361
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,795
We have both of them rolling back.

1362
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,240
Ignition start.

1363
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,874
I'm starting the APU.

1364
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,152
- My aircraft.
- Your aircraft.

1365
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,868
Get out the QRH.

1366
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,519
Priority left.

1367
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,033
Loss of thrust on both engines.

1368
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,390
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
This is Cactus 1549.

1369
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,516
Hit birds.
We've lost thrust on both engines.

1370
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,358
We are turning back towards LaGuardia.

1371
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,176
Okay, you need to return to LaGuardia?

1372
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,872
- Turn left heading 2-2-0.
- 2-2-0.

1373
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,474
- Which engine did you lose?
- Both. Both engines.

1374
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,216
"If fuel remaining, engine mode,
select your ignition."

1375
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,559
- Ignition.
- Ignition.

1376
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,109
- Thrust levers, confirm idle.
- Idle.

1377
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,669
Airspeed. Optimum relight, 300 knots.

1378
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,669
- We don't have that.
- No, we don't.

1379
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,120
Cactus 1549,
if we can get it for you,

1380
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:26,600
do you wanna try to land runway 1-3?

1381
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:31,035
We are unable.
We may end up in the Hudson.

1382
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,198
Emergency electrical power,
emergency generator not online.

1383
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,918
Online.

1384
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,878
ATC notified. Squawk 7700.

1385
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,712
Distress message transmit. We did that.

1386
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,758
Cactus 1549,
it's gonna be left traffic, runway 3-1.

1387
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,240
Unable.

1388
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,873
Okay. What do you need to land?

1389
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,160
Wind shear.

1390
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,271
FAC 1 off, then on.

1391
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,750
Been 10 seconds, Captain. Come on.

1392
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,154
Talk to me.

1393
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,514
Cactus 1549,

1394
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,558
runway 4's available if you wanna make
left traffic to runway 4.

1395
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,240
I don't think we can make any runway.

1396
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,276
Uh, what about over to our right?

1397
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,976
Anything in New Jersey? Maybe T eterboro?

1398
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,080
Okay, yeah.
Off your right side is Teterboro airport.

1399
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,274
LaGuardia Departure,
got an emergency inbound.

1400
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,136
This is Teterboro tower. Go ahead.

1401
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,116
Cactus 1549 over the GW Bridge.

1402
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,736
Needs to go to the airport right now.

1403
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,000
Check. Does he need assistance?

1404
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,310
Yes. Bird strike.
Can I get him in for runway 1?

1405
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,549
Cactus 1549, you wanna

1406
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,440
try and go to Teterboro?

1407
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,440
Obstacle. Obstacle.

1408
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,673
Obstacle. Obstacle.

1409
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,160
Pull up.

1410
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,639
Clear of conflict.

1411
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,601
"No relight after 30 seconds,
engine master one and two, confirm off."

1412
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:57,680
Off.

1413
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,993
"Wait 30 seconds."

1414
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,639
Too low, terrain.

1415
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,349
Too low, terrain.

1416
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,280
Too low, terrain.

1417
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,029
Too low, terrain.

1418
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,679
This is the captain.

1419
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,673
Brace for impact.

1420
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,240
Five hundred.

1421
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,352
Cactus 1549, turn right 2-8-0.

1422
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,078
You can land runway one Teterboro.

1423
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,514
We can't make it.

1424
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,496
Okay. Which runway
would you like at Teterboro?

1425
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,839
Go ahead. Try number one.

1426
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,479
Number one.

1427
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,153
No relight.

1428
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,520
We're gonna end up in the Hudson.

1429
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:45,816
Too low, terrain.

1430
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,360
I'm sorry. Say again, Cactus?

1431
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,760
Too low, terrain.

1432
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,075
All right, let's put the flaps out.
Put the flaps out.

1433
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,240
Flaps out.

1434
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,080
Cactus 1549, radar contact lost.

1435
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:08,919
You also got Newark off your two o'clock
in about seven miles.

1436
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,336
Got flaps out.

1437
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,032
Two hundred fifty feet in the air.

1438
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,961
170 knots. Got no power on either one.
Try the other one.

1439
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:21,040
Try the other one.

1440
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:22,878
1549? Still up?

1441
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,520
One hundred and fifty knots.

1442
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,235
- Got flaps two. You want more?
- No. Let's stay at two.

1443
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,896
You got runway 2-9 available at Newark.

1444
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,256
It'll be two o'clock in seven miles.

1445
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,077
You got any ideas?

1446
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,600
Actually not.

1447
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,193
Terrain, terrain.

1448
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,753
Pull up. Pull up.

1449
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,960
Pull up.

1450
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,560
Pull up.

1451
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:42,480
Pull up.

1452
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,440
Pull up.

1453
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,920
Pull up.

1454
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,308
We're gonna brace.

1455
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,640
Pull up.

1456
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:53,920
Thirty...

1457
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,120
Twenty...

1458
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:00,480
Pull up.

1459
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:41,677
I need to take a quick break.

1460
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,518
What did you think?

1461
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,359
Hearing the CVR just now?

1462
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,671
Let me tell you what I think.

1463
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,312
I'm just so damn proud.

1464
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,838
And you, you were right there,
through all that distraction.

1465
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,871
With so much at stake.

1466
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,868
We did this together. We were a team.

1467
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,074
Thanks, Sully.

1468
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,596
- We did our job.
- We did our job.

1469
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,671
Hey, you did good.

1470
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,240
All right, folks.

1471
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:50,896
I'd like to call this hearing
back to order.

1472
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,592
If we could settle, please.

1473
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,073
Take your seats.

1474
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,916
That is honestly the first time

1475
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,911
that I have listened to a crash recording

1476
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,592
while actually sitting

1477
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,398
with the captain and the first officer.

1478
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,673
It's extraordinary.

1479
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,714
That was no simulation.

1480
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,113
No, it wasn't.

1481
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:24,988
Gentlemen,

1482
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:29,269
I want to inform you that
the left engine has been recovered.

1483
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,595
We just received a comprehensive report.

1484
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,952
There was extensive damage

1485
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,588
to both the guide vanes
and fan blades of the engine.

1486
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,558
Five compressor blades were fractured

1487
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,793
and eight variable guide vanes missing.

1488
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,197
So, no thrust?

1489
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:50,429
As you testified,

1490
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,270
it was completely destroyed.

1491
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,635
The ACARS data was wrong.

1492
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,278
I'd like to add something
on a personal note.

1493
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,757
I can say with absolute confidence

1494
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,912
that after speaking
with the rest of the flight crew,

1495
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:12,274
with bird experts, aviation engineers,

1496
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:15,279
after running through every scenario,

1497
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,670
after interviewing each player,

1498
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,594
there is still an "X" in this result

1499
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:24,153
and it's you, Captain Sullenberger.

1500
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:29,314
Remove you from the equation,
and the math just fails.

1501
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,752
I disagree.

1502
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,153
It wasn't just me. It was all of us.

1503
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,118
It was Jeff and Donna
and Sheila and Doreen

1504
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,509
and all of the passengers,
the rescue workers,

1505
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,955
air traffic control,

1506
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,509
ferry boat crews and the scuba cops.

1507
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,471
We all did it.

1508
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,510
We survived.

1509
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:04,033
First Officer Skiles, is there
anything you'd like to add?

1510
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,636
Anything you would have done differently

1511
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,478
if you had to do it again?

1512
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,714
Yes.

1513
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,958
I would have done it in July.

1514
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,312
7F. 11F.

1515
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,480
9D.

1516
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:54,680
1 C.

1517
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,796
- 25B.
- 26B.

1518
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,156
- 10B.
- 9A.

1519
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:02,232
- 13C.
- 21A and B.

1520
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,472
155 is a number,

1521
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:08,550
but when you can put faces to it

1522
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:13,077
and not just 155 faces,
but the other faces,

1523
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:17,153
the wives, the daughters, the sons,
the fathers, the mothers, the brothers,

1524
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,636
it gets to be a pretty big
number pretty quickly.

1525
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,757
Th is is you r captai n speaki ng.

1526
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:31,359
I think today was as much and as good
for me and my crew as it was for you.

1527
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:35,958
And because of the events
of January 15, 2009,

1528
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:41,592
I'm convinced that we will be joined
in our hearts and in our minds forever.

1529
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:39,310
I am the keeper of the mail.

1530
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:43,550
So I read when people
from across the country write to us.

1531
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,315
And I open the letters
that come to our house from your families.

1532
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,078
And I open the Christmas cards.

1533
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,753
So, thank you so much

1534
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:54,071
for the gratitude that you've
expressed to our families

1535
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,595
and the letters and the cards

1536
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:00,389
because they really do make
a difference to us as well.

1537
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,879
So, thank you.
