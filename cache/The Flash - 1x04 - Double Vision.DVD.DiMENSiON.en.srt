1
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,681
Some graffiti showed up
all over Spanish Hill last week.

2
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,947
Someone's trying to contact the Flash.

3
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,489
Maybe you need an 800 number.

4
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,929
Well, I guess I was done.

5
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,157
You sure? You don't wanna lick the plate?

6
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,358
No. Thank you.

7
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,062
You really are becoming a human
garbage disposal on legs these days.

8
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,469
- I get hungry.
- Save room, everybody.

9
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,869
We have to celebrate.

10
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,772
Barry, I don't think you need the sugar.

11
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,640
You better serve this one last, Uncle Felix,
or there won't be any left.

12
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,453
Congratulations, Mr. Tomarquin.

13
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,452
- Has it really been a year?
- Can you believe it, Barry?

14
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,492
It's a year now since we're citizens.

15
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:13,723
And a lot of thanks go to you
and the rest of the precinct.

16
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,336
It's a policeman's lot.
We know a good meal when we eat one.

17
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,701
You're so skinny,
I'm going to save you a second piece.

18
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,171
Well, see that?

19
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,410
We've got half an hour.

20
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,882
You go ahead. I have my ticket.
I wanna check that graffiti for myself.

21
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,020
Admiral Theater, please.

22
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,116
I'll be there before curtain time.

23
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,417
Tonight was meant to be a night
away from work.

24
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:44,291
Somebody is looking for the Flash, all right?
Now, I've got to find out who and why.

25
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,659
- Barry.
- Half an hour. Be there.

26
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,596
Driver.

27
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,008
<i>"Please come to the church</i>
<i>on Ascension Street tonight...</i>

28
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,612
<i>... when three bells ring at 8:00. "</i>

29
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,918
Gentlemen.

30
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,762
This is a bad part of town
for you to be getting lost in, man.

31
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,424
Good thing I'm not lost, huh?

32
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,659
I'm...

33
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,395
...meeting someone.

34
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,675
Who you meeting?
I know everyone on the block.

35
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,208
I'll help you find him.

36
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,472
Thank you very much,
but I really don't need a tour guide.

37
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,350
Javier! Leave him alone.

38
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,818
He's a policeman. I know him.
He's okay.

39
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,291
Sometimes my friends forget
I'm not a kid anymore.

40
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,188
Listen...

41
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,592
...do you know anything
about this Flash graffiti?

42
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,494
- The "help" message.
- No.

43
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,829
This is our neighborhood, man.

44
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,268
We don't go around marking it up.

45
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,401
Why are the bells ringing now?

46
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,705
A little early for midnight Mass.

47
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,826
You see, Calderon?
It does pay to advertise.

48
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,517
Let's get him out of here.

49
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,357
We're gonna make this phantom
do all of our work.

50
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,089
And he won't even know it.

51
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,297
Step one.

52
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,605
Hello?

53
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,678
Oh, my God.

54
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,625
Oh, it's come to this?

55
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,734
All right!

56
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,131
I'll be right back, sweetheart.

57
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:53,378
Barry, where the hell have you been?
I've been calling you all night.

58
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,036
All night?

59
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,776
Where have I been?

60
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,111
We went out last night, right?

61
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,051
Dinner and a play. Am I right?

62
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,850
And how did you like the play, Barry?

63
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,687
The play.

64
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,487
Well, I...

65
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,290
- How did you like it?
- I wouldn't know.

66
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:16,265
I spent the entire evening
in the lobby waiting for you.

67
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,928
Now, you wouldn't have stood me up
without a very good reason.

68
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,971
So, what happened?

69
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,579
I went into the mailroom yesterday...

70
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,013
...and the guys were laughing
about that Flash letter.

71
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,583
I grabbed it.

72
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,554
- I didn't tell you about it because...
- I'd insist on coming with you.

73
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,624
Right.

74
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,590
So...

75
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:47,927
...I ran into Paloma,
and there was a church.

76
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,163
That's all I remember.

77
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,905
- But I feel fine now.
- Barry, don't be so nonchalant.

78
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,306
A memory blackout is a serious...

79
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,171
Doesn't that give you indigestion?

80
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,867
Only way to get them
before they get soggy.

81
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,839
Hey, do you want some?
I got boxes of them.

82
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,949
You know, sometimes you're a real jerk.

83
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,813
As your doctor,
I'm ordering you to take it easy.

84
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,978
All right. All right.

85
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:46,522
I mean, who wants to lose a doctor
who makes house calls?

86
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:51,595
- Hello.
- <i>Barry.</i>

87
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,028
Yeah, Julio, where are you?

88
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,794
All right. All right.
I'll be there in a second.

89
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,836
I mean, give me 10 minutes, all right?

90
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,532
- Rough night, huh?
- I wish I remembered.

91
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,795
That's my kind of rough night.

92
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:37,637
Anyway, witnesses say that they saw
the statues walk out by themselves.

93
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,478
Walk out? Okay.

94
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:44,776
Anyway, milk-truck driver says the wind
kicks in at about 3 in the morning.

95
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,078
Next thing, the saints
are stopping traffic.

96
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,619
Allen! Mendez!

97
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,690
When you two are ready...

98
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,925
I don't know, Julio.

99
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,791
I've had a problem with miracles
ever since I found Dad's Santa suit.

100
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,296
Yeah, I'm hip, man.

101
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,867
But I gotta tell you, man,
after last night with Sabrina...

102
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,199
...I could be a true believer
all over again, you know.

103
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,840
Who's that guy giving us the evil eye?

104
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,274
That's the local santero.

105
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,611
A medicine man for people
who believe in magic.

106
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,413
Father, with all due respect,
I just can't buy it.

107
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,783
I mean, statues taking
an evening stroll.

108
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,358
It's worse inside, Barry. Who'd wanna
do this to a church? I don't get it.

109
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,554
Maybe the statues just wanted
a breath of fresh air.

110
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,096
- Maybe not.
- Escort the saints back into the church.

111
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,758
Yes, sir.

112
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,737
Father Becerra, this is Barry Allen,
Julio Mendez from the crime lab.

113
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,569
Tell them what you told me.

114
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,408
As I explained to Lieutenant Garfield...

115
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,174
...someone rang the church bells
at 3 in the morning.

116
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:55,048
- I left the rectory, reached for the door...
- This is where it gets nuts. Listen to this.

117
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:59,248
- And then suddenly the doors flew open,
and I was surrounded by the saints.

118
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,155
- You saw no one.
- Only the blessed saints.

119
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,161
And then a burst of wind
lifted me off my feet...

120
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,492
...and deposited me right over there.

121
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,693
And the words above the door
appeared from nowhere.

122
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,896
This is not God's work.
This is a sacrilege.

123
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,870
Any notion who "him" is?

124
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,509
Not a clue.

125
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,043
If you'd excuse me,
I have work to do.

126
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:23,113
- No problem, Father.
- But we might wanna talk to you again.

127
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,748
Like I said, nuts.

128
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,444
You got any ideas...

129
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,558
...so my report won't sound
totally like <i>The Twilight Zone</i>?

130
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,660
This is heavy.

131
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,131
<i>When them saints go marching in</i>

132
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,769
Come on, Murph, this is serious.

133
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,770
<i>Oh, when them saints go marching in</i>

134
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,432
This is a weird one, man.
I mean, someone...

135
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,536
...set those pews up like dominoes, right,
and then just knocked them over.

136
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,206
- Yet nobody heard anything?
- I don't have a clue.

137
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,285
- You folks know anything?
- Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

138
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,116
Just kids pranking for
the Day of the Dead festival.

139
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,850
- Gangs maybe?
- It's the voice of Chango.

140
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,484
A reminder of his power
and his anger.

141
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,824
How can you listen
to this bogeyman crap?

142
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,398
- Paloma, please.
- No, you, please!

143
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,627
This is a lot of superstitious junk.

144
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,738
Chango has nothing to do with
what's going down on the street.

145
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,397
- What do you mean?
- She doesn't mean anything, Barry.

146
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,840
- She's a child.
- Beware...

147
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:31,916
...of the scarlet lightning with the voice
of fear and the voice of thunder.

148
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,075
Just beware.

149
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:40,792
All this mumbo jumbo makes people
into scared, stupid peasants.

150
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,062
If you do hear anything,
call me at the precinct, all right?

151
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,063
Aren't you gonna ask me
for my phone number, officer?

152
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,894
I quit babysitting
when I left the academy.

153
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,198
You heartbreaker, you.

154
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,742
Hey, what did he mean
by "the scarlet lightning"?

155
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,777
Beats me.

156
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,976
<i>This is Joe Kline, the voice of the city.</i>

157
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:10,316
<i>The testimony of DEA Bureau Chief</i>
<i>Peter Paul Aguilar...</i>

158
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:14,926
<i>... is expected to break one of Central City's</i>
<i>major conduits for hard narcotics.</i>

159
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,530
<i>Aguilar infiltrated a ruthless</i>
<i>East Coast drug cartel...</i>

160
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,860
This Kline guy is much too intense.
Much too.

161
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,629
He doesn't learn to relax, he'll be
major coronary material. Major.

162
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,033
Major. I guarantee it.

163
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:31,607
Aguilar testifies,
and years of my work is destroyed.

164
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,135
He won't testify.

165
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,079
And, no, you won't lose your nice
little narcotics empire.

166
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,218
That's what you're paying me for.
Come on.

167
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,219
That's right. Half a million dollars,
and for what?

168
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,721
To put statues out in the middle
of the street?

169
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:49,349
Now you've got this...
This red devil, this Flash, on a leash.

170
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,587
You make him find
Aguilar's daughter now.

171
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,789
What do you think I'm doing?

172
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:58,630
Come on! These people, they're ignorant.
They're superstitious.

173
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,671
Once we scare them to death...

174
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,968
...they'll hand us the girl.

175
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,167
Three days.

176
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:11,572
Three days until Aguilar testifies,
and we know nothing about this girl!

177
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,877
We don't even know
what she looks like!

178
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:18,786
We know she's here. We know she's here in
this refugee neighborhood. We know that.

179
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,987
And...

180
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,555
...l've also got more than these two eyes
to search with.

181
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,778
I got the Flash's hands.

182
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,390
And...

183
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,129
...I got his eyes too.

184
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,099
How can we lose?

185
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,204
I got his eyes.

186
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,340
I got his hands.

187
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,939
Hey, hey.

188
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,045
Julio, do we really have to go in there?

189
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:17,148
All this satanic stuff makes me
a little bit nervous.

190
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,284
Look, we've got to.
It's Garfield's orders.

191
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,181
Besides, this has nothing to do
with the devil.

192
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,448
See, Santería is a worship
of the spirit saints.

193
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,592
Oh, swell. Like voodoo.

194
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,695
- Yeah, but with a Spanish accent.
- I beg your pardon.

195
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:34,560
Excuse me. We'd like to ask you
some questions about last night.

196
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:38,066
Torso Van Nuraso
and the Muchacho Buscaro!

197
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,829
I didn't know you were a fan.

198
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,803
Oh, yeah, Jay used to take me
to the fights all the time.

199
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,840
He told Mom we were
going to the library.

200
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,171
Hey, the Muchacho was
my first real hero, man.

201
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,782
He used a double sleeper hold.
He should be barred.

202
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,351
Yeah. When he went bad,
I didn't sleep for days.

203
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,489
Listen, do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

204
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,521
It's a waste of time.

205
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,593
You have no respect for my faith...

206
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:03,989
...my knowledge.

207
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:08,156
Respect is a two-way street. It would help
if you had a little respect for us.

208
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,700
Listen, man...

209
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:18,202
...what happened last night
is the work of Palo Monte...

210
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,577
...the black arts.

211
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,273
Now, these magics
have no place in my shop.

212
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,851
- Are you saying black magic is behind this?
- Listen.

213
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,215
And know this:

214
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,880
A dark spirit has been called to earth.

215
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,026
In Santería, there is no black or white...

216
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,165
...good or evil.

217
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,996
There is good and evil
in all gods and all men.

218
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,065
Chango's dark spirit...

219
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,268
...has been awakened.

220
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:56,005
And you can only put him down
is through a sacrifice.

221
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,306
What kind of sacrifice?

222
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,085
Well, that's the problem with gods.

223
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,916
They never tell you
what would satisfy them.

224
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,925
We're not finished here.

225
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,660
I think he is. Come on.

226
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,303
Do you believe any of that stuff?

227
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,673
Hey, it's not what I believe
that matters, man.

228
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:31,111
It matters if you believe
any of that old fool's mumbo jumbo.

229
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,841
Real life is scary enough.

230
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,009
You mean, you never hexed an enemy...

231
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,179
...or bought a love potion for your friend
with the knife?

232
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:42,293
- I don't need love potions.
- Paloma, I told you to stay indoors.

233
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,658
- <i>Tía</i>, I can take care of myself.
- Everything's okay, Mrs. Tomarquin.

234
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,493
You're in no position to judge.

235
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,361
I thought you were one
of her favorite customers.

236
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,734
Yeah, so did I.

237
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,080
Sorry, pal.

238
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,646
Get out of my chair, man.
I got work to do.

239
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,687
The rent-paying species
gets the best seats, you know.

240
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:23,496
Which was it that you didn't like?
Was that Swiss or cheddar?

241
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,226
Here you go.

242
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,575
Oh, Chango!

243
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,408
Oh, Chango!

244
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,509
Chango!

245
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,162
What the hell is that?

246
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,533
- Yes. Hello.
- Barry?

247
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,678
Oh, thank God.
Where have you been?

248
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,278
Tina...

249
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,847
...l've lost eight hours.

250
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,641
Eight hours.

251
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,395
Very good, Barry.
Now let's try it with your left eye.

252
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,642
I can't. I can't.
My fingers won't respond.

253
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,510
Because the hemispheres of your brain
aren't communicating.

254
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:49,011
So, what my left eye sees...

255
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:53,785
...isn't reaching my right hand, is that it?
The two sides of my brain aren't connected?

256
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,426
Apparently.

257
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,427
If both halves don't learn something,
you can't remember it.

258
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:01,395
Oh, great. Swell.
So now not only do I eat like a pig...

259
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,559
...but my jacked-up metabolism
is screwing with my memory.

260
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,499
- What are you scratching?
- What?

261
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,441
It looks like a bad bite.

262
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,941
I wonder if insect toxin
is the problem.

263
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,638
- I've gotta go.
- Barry.

264
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:19,250
You may be my best friend,
but you've become my worst patient.

265
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,648
It was the angry wind.

266
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,260
Chango came in the night
and tore me from my sleep.

267
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,694
That sounds like the same spirit
that the priest saw in the church.

268
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:37,528
- Chango's the god of the storm?
- Chango is the wind rider.

269
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,671
The bearer of lightning.

270
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,739
Oh, great. First the Flash, now this.

271
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,103
What do we got here,
a convention of ghosts?

272
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,938
You believe in nothing.

273
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,172
And yet you have contempt for my belief.
Just leave my <i>botanica.</i>

274
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,443
And leave me alone.
I have to purify my store.

275
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,019
We got another message for "him."

276
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,490
Out! Everybody out!

277
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,888
Wait. Don't you wanna
press charges here?

278
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,221
You don't press charges
against the gods.

279
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,956
- What do you mean?
- He means, you don't press charges...

280
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,963
...against the gods.

281
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,491
Wait a minute...

282
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,865
Paloma...

283
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:21,035
...you have to tell me.
What's happening here?

284
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:25,240
- Nothing you can't see, Anglo.
- Why is he so interested in you for?

285
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,612
He's just another guy
madly in love with me.

286
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,879
Look, first the church and now this.

287
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,250
And nobody knows anything?

288
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,552
Look, if there's trouble down here,
please tell us so we can help you!

289
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,464
Take it. Take it!

290
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,367
Please, Paloma!

291
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,669
You are the one. You brought this problem
among all of us!

292
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,314
- Cool it with the camera.
- This curse among all of us.

293
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,950
The gods must have their sacrifice!

294
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,882
- Get an ambulance!
- Move behind the line. Let's go!

295
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,093
You have to pace yourself
if you wanna sprint like that.

296
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,323
- How did you do that?
- I didn't mean to scare you.

297
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,000
- I'm not afraid.
- Of me maybe.

298
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,230
Paloma...

299
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,204
...I need some help.

300
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,139
And I'm hungry.

301
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,302
What do you say?

302
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:34,418
I knew we could scare the santero
into pointing us towards the girl.

303
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,315
There she is.

304
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,350
The only thing that Aguilar loves.

305
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,220
Once we have her, he'll never testify.

306
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,622
Trachmann...

307
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:47,060
...I must admit, your toys did the trick.

308
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,396
You see, a brain and nerves
is just like a machine and its wires.

309
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,666
Once you map out the circuits, you can
punch a button and get anything you want.

310
00:22:55,841 --> 00:23:01,177
You can get hate. You can get fear.
You can get pain.

311
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,013
It makes no difference to you
between a man and a machine?

312
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,787
It makes one difference:

313
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,686
You can't scare a machine.

314
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:21,355
Are you sure you don't want
those <i>plainteros</i> over there?

315
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,865
You're a cute guy,
but if you don't watch it...

316
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,435
...you're gonna end up
with a butt like a Buick.

317
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,833
Well, thank you.

318
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,271
But I work out. A lot.

319
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,309
I hope so, for that girlfriend of yours.

320
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:36,809
Girlfriend?

321
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,814
Tina. No, no.
No, you got that wrong.

322
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,545
Oh, then you're available.

323
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,346
Yeah.

324
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,789
Listen, Paloma...

325
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,589
...what was that thing
the santero gave you?

326
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,165
It's a black-magic talisman...

327
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,562
...for a human sacrifice.

328
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,203
But I thought you said
that was a lot of mumbo jumbo.

329
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,201
I must come forward...

330
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,004
...or a loved one will suffer in my place.
- A loved one?

331
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,678
Peter Aguilar.

332
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,311
My father.

333
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:22,252
He sent me here in secret
to hide with my aunt and uncle after...

334
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,526
The drug lord, Calderon...

335
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,689
...he butchered my mother
and my brothers.

336
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,233
And if Calderon finds me...

337
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,395
...he'll use me to stop my father
from testifying.

338
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,206
Why didn't your father go to the police?

339
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,902
You don't understand.
Calderon has bought policemen before.

340
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,276
My father knew I would be safe
here on Spanish soil with our people.

341
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:48,146
But with this devil, with the spirit scaring
everyone, I don't know anymore.

342
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,047
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

343
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,720
Someplace safe. Until we can figure
a way out of this mess.

344
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,954
I'll have the CAT scan in an hour.

345
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,197
How's Paloma doing?

346
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,033
I tell you to be careful, and you
play the knight in shining red armor.

347
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,868
The girl's in danger, all right?

348
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,840
Damn it, Barry, so are you.
You keep blacking out.

349
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,243
Nobody's after me.
She needs a safe place to hide.

350
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,407
And here I thought you two
were just good friends.

351
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,145
If my being here is a problem,
I'll take care of myself.

352
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,289
Don't be silly.
It's him I'm worried about.

353
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,654
- He can never take care of himself.
- They're all alike.

354
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,658
In spite of all the fun
we're having...

355
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,229
...I do have to show up
at the lab from time to time.

356
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:36,492
We do have four other cases
that we're working on at the moment.

357
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,101
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

358
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,932
Keep the fun level down
to a minimum while I'm gone.

359
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:44,303
And keep this place locked up tight.

360
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,504
Tina, I've had another blackout.

361
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,809
The last thing I remember
was leaving the lab.

362
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,948
Oh, my God.
What happened to your face?

363
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,213
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

364
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,880
- Where's Paloma?
- She's gone, Barry.

365
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,118
- Somebody got her?
- I don't know, but you have to look at this.

366
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,025
- No, I've gotta go find Paloma.
- Shut up and listen!

367
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,697
Okay, all right.

368
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,757
Oh, my God. It's me.

369
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,368
Paloma!

370
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,656
<i>Barry.</i>

371
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,163
- Barry.
- Don't! No!

372
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,999
Barry. It's okay. It's okay!
You're back here with me now.

373
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,731
It's okay. It's okay.

374
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,172
Come on. Come on.

375
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,910
Now, can you tell me what you saw?

376
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,575
I...

377
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,244
...was...

378
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,152
...in the Botanica Chango.

379
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,320
The santero was there.

380
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,157
And Paloma.

381
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,398
And someone else, but I can't...

382
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:33,196
...quite picture who it was.

383
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:40,634
- Tina, I think I'm losing it.
- I won't let that happen, Barry. I promise.

384
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,575
But I saw him!

385
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:45,545
I saw the guy who's behind all this.

386
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,880
It's buried in the side of your brain
you can't communicate with.

387
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:52,045
You couldn't even reach it
through hypnosis.

388
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,691
Let me show you what the problem is.

389
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,529
A tiny microwave receiver.

390
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:04,634
It's rerouting the impulses here and emitting
neural signals of its own to program you.

391
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,327
Where did it come from?

392
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:10,838
- Brain surgery when my back was turned?
- Injection, most likely.

393
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,035
That's what happened.

394
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,443
In the church.

395
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:19,310
They lured me with the graffiti
and stuck this in my brain.

396
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,009
I led them to Paloma
and hand-delivered her.

397
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,917
I can't wait till you get this out
and I get that guy.

398
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,114
- You can't take this chance, Barry.
- Why not?

399
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,290
A similar device was tested on animals
at Stanford University.

400
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,487
The diode in your brain
is like a generator.

401
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,099
The more you use it,
the more it builds up a charge.

402
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,225
You have maybe 24 hours
before it overloads.

403
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,167
And fries my brain?

404
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,207
We can fight this thing. I'm on to
the networks to find out how to turn it off.

405
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:49,039
You must stay here with me so I can
sedate you and slow down your metabolism.

406
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,681
Oh, no, you don't.

407
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,477
I've gotta find Paloma
before they get to her father.

408
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,142
- But, Barry, you...
- Just keep working on it.

409
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,982
Turn it off, jam it.

410
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,954
You'll think of something.
I know you will.

411
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:15,067
Only one Stanford researcher left
who worked on brain implants.

412
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,900
And his name's Trachmann.

413
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,244
- Yes, sir...
- Julio, damn it!

414
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,143
- Don't do that when I'm working, all right?
- All right.

415
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,251
Just cool out with
this nuclear assault, man.

416
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:32,650
- What are you working on?
- Nothing. Damn it, I went off-line.

417
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:36,316
Are you okay, Barry? I mean, look,
you've really been on edge lately.

418
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,121
Yeah, I'm fine.

419
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:42,562
I just haven't gotten a lot of sleep lately.
I've got a lot of things on my mind.

420
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,329
How about this? You and me, tonight,
hit the Day of the Dead festival.

421
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:49,029
One of my friends is playing
in the Nortano band.

422
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,765
I gotta find Paloma.

423
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,241
Garfield's got half the division on her trail,
on top of the feds...

424
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,744
...who don't wanna lose
her father's testimony.

425
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,177
I owe her.

426
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,949
The call is bouncing off satellites,
don't bother trying to trace it.

427
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,614
Here, say hi to your dad.

428
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:11,694
- Forget about me. Put these pigs away.
- <i>Paloma! Are you all right?</i>

429
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,262
- <i>Paloma!</i>
- It's you for the girl, Aguilar.

430
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:18,425
Unless you want this Day of the Dead
to be something special this year.

431
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:21,128
- <i>lf you hurt her, I will kill you!</i>
- Bye.

432
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,867
Somebody ought to plug you
in a wall socket, wire head.

433
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,337
Wire head?

434
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:34,575
Won't your daddy be surprised at
the sharp tongue that you've developed.

435
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,193
Excuse me, buddy. Hey, pal.

436
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:47,092
Can you get out of the way, please?
I gotta do a shot here. Thanks a lot.

437
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,789
Joe Kline, voice of the city.

438
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:53,199
The case against drug lord Falco Calderon
has been delayed yet again.

439
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,431
With me is federal prosecutor
Marguerite Giarelo.

440
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,438
What is the reason for today's delay?

441
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,373
Well, certain legal motions have been put
before the court...

442
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:07,246
Is it true that Peter Paul Aguilar will not
testify, and thereby the case falls apart?

443
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:12,788
Mr. Aguilar will withhold his testimony until
he has a chance to review his evidence.

444
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:17,656
But that does not mean, as you succinctly
put it, that the case will fall apart.

445
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:23,028
Calderon has a relative of Aguilar's. That's
the reason he won't testify. True or false?

446
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,998
I'm sorry, I cannot comment...

447
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,635
Cut! Cut! What the hell was that?

448
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:32,298
Did we get anything we could use? God.

449
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,864
- Lord Chango.
- Why did you betray the girl?

450
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,734
But it was your wish, my lord.

451
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:05,239
You were the angry wind
demanding penance.

452
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,341
But, lord...

453
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,673
...please tell me.

454
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,110
Why have I sinned?

455
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,219
You have done nothing wrong.

456
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:20,891
And I'm not a god. I'm a man.

457
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,917
A man with a certain gift.

458
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,395
Someone forced me
to do his bidding.

459
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,858
- Black magic.
- Black science.

460
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,293
I'm sorry.

461
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,842
I must find Calderon.

462
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,912
Calderon? He's in the shadows.

463
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,174
But his minions...

464
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,141
...the face of white death
in the streets.

465
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,256
Calderon! Now!

466
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,380
Aguilar wants to make
the switch at midnight.

467
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:28,044
On the Day of the Dead
festival at Spanish Hill.

468
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,478
I don't like it.

469
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,715
Too many people around.

470
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:37,753
Why worry about people
when we got these puppets?

471
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,237
- Get away from me!
- I'm here to help you.

472
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,430
Don't touch me!

473
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,639
I'm not going to hurt you.

474
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,216
- Leave me alone!
- You heard the young lady.

475
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,433
Whatever you did, it worked.

476
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,098
I was an inch away from being
scraped off a semi's grille.

477
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,873
I found the frequency broadcasting to the
diode and blocked it with another signal.

478
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,811
Thanks.

479
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:11,080
- You saved my life.
- Not yet. The diode is still there.

480
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:14,884
An ultrasound pulse could destroy it,
but I've got to jury-rig that instrument.

481
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,085
Well, Trachmann won't let Paloma
or Aguilar live past morning.

482
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,060
And if he's not controlling me,
I'll have a chance.

483
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,894
I got a reading
of the transmission signal.

484
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,003
Your metabolism has accelerated
the power buildup.

485
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,799
The time tomb in your brain could go
at any second.

486
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:34,040
Well, he's exchanging Paloma
for Aguilar at midnight.

487
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,975
That gives me a few minutes
to find them.

488
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:41,080
- That's all the time I need.
- Get back as soon as possible.

489
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,049
I will.

490
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,766
That's the signal.

491
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,771
Thank you for all of your help, Javier.

492
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,930
Take care of Paloma.

493
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,276
These men are ruthless.
They cannot be trusted.

494
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:16,743
I know, Senor Aguilar.

495
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,162
Paloma!

496
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,598
Day of the Dead, Daddy.

497
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,696
Paloma. Paloma!

498
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:52,135
What? What, what, what?

499
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,038
Why aren't you part of the highway?

500
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,510
Paloma.

501
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,114
All right, Pinocchio.

502
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:03,583
Time to reattach your strings.

503
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:06,846
Paloma! Paloma!

504
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,323
Paloma.

505
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,258
Aguilar, how should I kill you?

506
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,461
What am I, chopped liver?
Let Pinocchio do it.

507
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:26,076
He can drag him down the street
at 600 miles an hour, huh?

508
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:30,579
Or he can whirl him like a dervish
until he flies apart.

509
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,776
- What are you looking at?
- Sorry, pal.

510
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,020
Your broadcast days are over.

511
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,325
It's no use, Geppetto.

512
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:45,257
Pinocchio's a real boy now.

513
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,971
Are you fond of lightning?
I got your lightning.

514
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,283
Paloma? Paloma, what did they
do to you?

515
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,888
I can help her.

516
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,119
Do it. Please.

517
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,856
You'll find Trachmann and Calderon
at the end of the street. Hold them there.

518
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,499
Okay.

519
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,728
Hey, the red suit!

520
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,098
That's one cool drape, man.

521
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,703
- Barry.
- Trachmann put a diode in her head.

522
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,968
I barely stopped her
from killing her father.

523
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,612
- Where is Trachmann?
- He blew a fuse.

524
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,476
Which left Paloma
like an open circuit.

525
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:17,319
I've modified the ultrasound scanner.
I think I can fry the diode.

526
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,922
Better test it on me first.

527
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,895
<i>Following incriminating testimony</i>
<i>from DEA Agent Peter Aguilar...</i>

528
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,861
<i>... East Coast drug lord Reuben Calderon</i>
<i>stunned the court...</i>

529
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:33,299
<i>... with a three-hour-long confession</i>
<i>of criminal activity dating to the early '80s.</i>

530
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,903
- All right!
- All right!

531
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,709
There was someone I was unable
to thank for all his help...

532
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,540
...and I'd like to salute him now.

533
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:47,343
Wherever and whoever he may be,
to the Flash.

534
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,076
To the Flash.

535
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,820
What happened to Trachmann?

536
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,947
He is in the hospital.

537
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:58,891
They're not sure how much brain damage
he suffered from the circuitry in his head.

538
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,964
Yes. It's a pity his genius
was used for evil...

539
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,259
...and not for the benefit of mankind.

540
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:07,836
- Watching the late-night Fright Fest again?
- Oh, shut up!

541
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,033
A small gift...

542
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,609
...for the fan of the greatest wrestler...

543
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,008
...el Muchacho Buscaro.

544
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,443
Thanks.

545
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,112
Don't ask.

546
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:25,888
Let me see...

547
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,953
It's in Spanish. I can't read it.

548
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,194
- It's a love potion.
- Love potion.

549
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,923
And what exactly do you intend
to do with that?

550
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,298
I don't know. But I think it would be
an unforgivable insult to give it back.

551
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,368
