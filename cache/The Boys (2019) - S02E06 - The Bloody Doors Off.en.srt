I will tell you everything.

795
00:58:59,371 --> 00:59:01,331
Starting with this.

796
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:26,313
Your grandmother?

797
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:29,818
My daughter.

798
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,199
Chloe. She died of Alzheimer's
a few years ago.

799
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:40,495
How old are you?

800
00:59:41,204 --> 00:59:43,373
I was born in 1919.

801
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:45,291
In Berlin.

802
00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:00,932
- Is that you with...?
- Heinrich Himmler.

803
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,435
He was a lovely dancer.

804
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:05,812
And that's Goebbels.

805
01:00:06,438 --> 01:00:09,858
And the most important man in the room...

806
01:00:23,163 --> 01:00:24,664
Frederick Vought.

807
01:00:27,334 --> 01:00:30,545
He gave me the first successful
V injection.

808
01:00:32,756 --> 01:00:34,216
He taught me everything.

809
01:00:35,884 --> 01:00:38,929
And then we fell in love,
and he gave me a daughter.

810
01:00:39,012 --> 01:00:43,475
He made me, and his genius made you.

811
01:00:54,236 --> 01:00:57,781
Frederick didn't care about
all the fans or stardom

812
01:00:57,864 --> 01:00:59,616
or any of that shallow bullshit.

813
01:01:00,617 --> 01:01:03,954
We are in a war for the culture.

814
01:01:05,163 --> 01:01:09,334
The other races are grinding us down
and taking what is rightfully ours,

815
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:11,044
but we can fight back.

816
01:01:12,212 --> 01:01:15,549
With an army of supermen, millions strong.

817
01:01:17,092 --> 01:01:20,011
Because that is Vought's true destiny.

818
01:01:20,095 --> 01:01:24,516
And you will be the man who will lead us.

819
01:01:29,896 --> 01:01:34,401
You are everything that we dreamed of.

820
01:01:37,279 --> 01:01:40,407
So I love you with all of my heart.

821
01:01:42,534 --> 01:01:44,035
How could I not?

822
01:01:50,667 --> 01:01:53,086
Everyone I have ever loved
is in the ground.

823
01:01:54,421 --> 01:01:55,922
And then I found you.

824
01:01:58,383 --> 01:01:59,968
We found each other...

825
01:02:02,053 --> 01:02:05,765
and now neither of us
has to be alone ever again.

826
01:02:07,726 --> 01:02:10,979
And that is the truth.

827
