1
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,418
Sing it, girl.

2
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,712
Mom, now I can't.

3
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,423
Her spontaneity
has been stripped from her.

4
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,551
I'm sorry.
You have such a beautiful voice.

5
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,845
I can't wait to hear it when you're older.

6
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,098
Will this place have scuba diving?

7
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,934
How old does a child have to be
to do scuba diving?

8
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,102
I don't know, Trent.

9
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,270
I think you're a bit too young.

10
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,480
You're a baby.

11
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,690
You said five minutes.

12
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,317
Technically, it's been way,
way more than five minutes.

13
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,777
Are we close?

14
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,821
Stop wishing away this moment.

15
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,949
Look out the window.
Look how pretty it is.

16
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:58,993
Prisca.

17
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,913
Work stuff?

18
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,038
Yeah.

19
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,001
Lead by actions, Mom.

20
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,054
Wow.

21
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,265
This is much better than Cancun.

22
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,608
Mr. and Mrs. Capa,

23
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,944
welcome to our version of paradise.

24
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,446
Wow.

25
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,780
Hello.

26
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,495
So, this is Madrid.
She'll take care of you.

27
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,290
From your food and beverage
preferences you selected,

28
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,417
we've made you cocktails to welcome you.

29
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,918
Wow.

30
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,296
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

31
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,423
Look how big you guys are.

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,009
We have a drink fountain for you two.

33
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,260
Can we go?

34
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,803
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,180
Let's go. Let's go.

36
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,309
Can you believe I found this online?

37
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,281
My favorite thing,

38
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,035
open 24 hours, the candy station.

39
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,079
Oh, my God. Come on, Trent.

40
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,753
Mix the vanilla and strawberry in it.

41
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,839
Say hi, Trent.

42
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,008
Hi.

43
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,510
I'm Idlib.

44
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,720
My uncle's the resort manager here.

45
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,764
He's Trent. I'm Maddox.

46
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,768
I can do a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle,
which is a considerable thing to do.

47
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,896
My dad and I put clear glue on them
and hang them on my wall.

48
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,315
I collect conch shells.

49
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,693
I have 42 conch shells.

50
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,028
Amazing.

51
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,157
- Okay.
- I might need a little help with this.

52
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,284
Right, so you do
strawberry and vanilla?

53
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,588
Hi.

54
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,923
Thank you.

55
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,218
Yes. Ah, okay. Okay, I got it.

56
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,887
Okay. Come on. Thank you.

57
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,265
Great job helping.

58
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,433
Yes.

59
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,273
You!

60
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,025
I touched your jacket. That counts.

61
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,192
Hey.

62
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,613
There's 250,000 furniture-related injuries
in the United States per year.

63
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,743
25% of those coffee table injuries.

64
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,244
Hey. Hey!

65
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,621
- Fine.
- Okay.

66
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,717
Warren and Warren must be
affiliated with this resort.

67
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,678
They must have conventions here.

68
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,683
We love this pharmaceutical company
at work.

69
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,354
We're considering asking our clients
to use Warren and Warren drugs

70
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,105
as a way to lower their insurance rates.

71
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,984
Ah, hmm. Yeah.

72
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,988
"No kids allowed on the beach"?

73
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,406
What? Hold on.

74
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,992
"No Kids Week"?

75
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,660
- That's not true!
- It says no ki…

76
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,263
- Let me see that!
- You should've checked.

77
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,456
It's your mom's fault. No, no, no, really.

78
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,708
- It says this. No.
- Oh, my God, let me see.

79
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,502
- Let me see!
- Yes, of course.

80
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,504
I know this is very painful news

81
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,090
for you all to bear, but now…

82
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,008
- Now I've gotten power.
- No!

83
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,178
Yes. And you have to do it.
Yes, you have to understand.

84
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,138
It's like this. Life is like this.

85
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,016
It's tough, and sometimes things
don't go the way you want.

86
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,897
Oh, my gosh.

87
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,241
Come on. Blue team's winning.

88
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,492
Ah, good hit.

89
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,246
What's your name, and what
do you do for a living?

90
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,832
Hey, guys. I'm Annette.
And what's your name?

91
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,166
I'm Trent. This is Idlib.

92
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,793
Hey, nice to meet you.

93
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,753
- Bye.
- Bye.

94
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,921
Bye.

95
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,260
Hi. I'm Trent. This is Idlib.

96
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,512
What are your names, and what
do you do for a living?

97
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,348
Oh, well, I'm Sophia Watson. I'm a chef.

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,350
I'm Greg Mitchell. I'm a cop.

99
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:33,435
Cool.

100
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,812
And I'm Malin Mitchell. I'm a dancer.

101
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,480
Wow. That's cool.

102
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,482
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

103
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,734
- Bye.
- Bye.

104
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,457
Let's go over there.

105
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,917
Truth-telling game. Go.

106
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,046
I can't do a push-up. Go.

107
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,467
I don't have friends.

108
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,053
I'm your friend.

109
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,471
You'll leave.

110
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,266
My mom might let me FaceTime you.
Then we can be friends.

111
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,935
You can come over to my house
and make up stories.

112
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,105
Then we can go
to the same college together

113
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,066
and become neighbors with mortgages.

114
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,651
Cool.

115
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,031
It's weird.

116
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,785
I know.

117
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,872
It's hanging over me. I can barely eat.

118
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,415
And I don't feel anything?

119
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,339
We agreed. We'd give them
one last vacation before telling them.

120
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,759
I can't understand why
we don't take into consideration…

121
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,511
That shouldn't affect anything.

122
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,390
The doctor said it's a nonfactor.

123
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,142
It's probably been there
for years, he said.

124
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,106
We were on a course to separate.

125
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,234
That's confusing enough for us.

126
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,279
Let's not bring an irrelevant
medical condition into this.

127
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,950
Let's get through this, Guy.

128
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,327
Compartmentalize.

129
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,496
It's only for three days.

130
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,872
You found a place?

131
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:18,998
Yes.

132
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,418
Oh, Prisca, come on.

133
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,842
You're always thinking about the future!

134
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,261
It makes me feel not seen!

135
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,055
You're always thinking
about the past.

136
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,890
You work in a goddamn museum!

137
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,772
I think they stopped.

138
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,484
Why don't you play?

139
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,192
Good morning.
What would you like for breakfast?

140
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,796
I'll have
the Calcium Bomb juice drink.

141
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,530
I have a calcium deficiency.

142
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,533
So, is it really calcium-rich
or just a catchy name?

143
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,619
It has all
calcium-rich vegetables, ma'am.

144
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,122
Sit up, Kara, honey.

145
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,623
- Okay.
- All right?

146
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,351
You don't want to be hunched
when you grow up.

147
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,710
It's very unattractive.

148
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,837
Boys will get turned off.

149
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,215
Give me the Calcium Bomb juice.

150
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,886
And maybe you could
recommend one of these.

151
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,642
This one.

152
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:45,353
I recommend the granola parfait.

153
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,023
Um, it's a good choice.

154
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,274
Okay.

155
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,610
So, how is the Capa family?
Any plans today?

156
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,489
Well, one of our kids wants to do Jet Ski,

157
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,825
- and the other one…
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,452
…wants to do anything but that.

159
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,373
Well, there's, um, there's a private beach

160
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,542
on the nature preserve side of the island.

161
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,793
It's impossible to find.

162
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,004
It's surrounded by stunning rocks,

163
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,922
- very unusual minerals.
- Oh.

164
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,467
Oh, it's a once-in-a-lifetime
experience, so…

165
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,218
A natural anomaly.

166
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,306
I only recommend it to certain guests.

167
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,143
But I liked you guys immediately.
All right? You're a nice family.

168
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,687
So I-I could arrange
a van to take you, if…

169
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,564
Hmm. Yeah.

170
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,650
Sounds like a great memory for us.

171
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,862
It's our little secret.
I'll make all the arrangements.

172
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,367
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

173
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,497
Okay, so I think we should get
the Calloway Kale-away for Trent.

174
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,084
Idlib, what did I tell you
about being in here when you shouldn't?

175
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,754
You can't… You know,
I told you so many times.

176
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,255
You know, we have certain…

177
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,101
I'm a doctor.

178
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,896
My wife has epilepsy.
I'm a nurse. My name is Jarin.

179
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,567
Right, she's having a grand mal seizure.
Keep things away from her, please.

180
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,197
Patricia?

181
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,366
Doll?

182
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,094
All right, Jack,
I think if you just leave her

183
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,929
lying here for a while,
put something under her head,

184
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,788
- I think she'll be fine.
- Thank you, Doctor.

185
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,331
It's Jarin, by the way.

186
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,629
For my next act,
I'll spin my head around 360.

187
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,551
I'm sorry I ruined everyone's breakfast.

188
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,594
You always want to be
the center of attention.

189
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,725
My goodness.
Let's get you something to drink?

190
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,435
Yeah.

191
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,236
Idlib?

192
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,293
Oh, can't be
that secret of a beach.

193
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,878
We were told to keep it quiet.

194
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,588
- So were we.
- Sit down, Gustav.

195
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,048
Good boy.

196
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,134
Come. Stay.

197
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,974
Okay, guest checklist.
Books, sunscreen.

198
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,269
Did everybody leave
their passports in their safes?

199
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,896
I don't want anybody to lose anything.

200
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,230
Yeah.

201
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,191
What are your names and occupations?

202
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,767
Okay, my friends.

203
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,812
You can just call us,
and we'll pick you up

204
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,605
whenever you're ready to come back.

205
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,524
Or I'll pick you up at 5:00 p.m.

206
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,484
Just follow the path down to the beach.

207
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,820
- Is that also food?
- Yeah.

208
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,115
Wow. That's a lot of food.

209
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,283
Well, kids eat a lot of food.

210
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,285
And you got three of them with you.

211
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,204
Okay.

212
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,164
Seems like a waste, but thank you.

213
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,462
Could you help us carry
some of these bags, please?

214
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,715
We've got an elderly person
here and a child.

215
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,260
I'm sorry. I got to get back.
But it's not far. Just walk down.

216
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,970
You'll see a beautiful slot canyon.

217
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,990
Walk through that, and in
a few minutes, you'll be there.

218
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,181
Enjoy, everybody.

219
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,100
- Do you think there's…
- Come on.

220
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,310
Do you think there's snakes?

221
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,855
- Of course.
- Cool. I want to see one.

222
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,318
- Gorgeous.
- Wow.

223
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,197
Okay.

224
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,951
You okay?

225
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,203
Yeah?

226
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,392
Could, uh, someone please tell me
what just happened?

227
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,643
Look out.

228
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,229
- Oh, this is so exciting.
- Careful, Maddox.

229
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,742
- Let's go!
- I'm gonna win.

230
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,356
Wow. I just got chills.

231
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:24,776
Come on, darling.

232
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,486
Let's show Gustav the sea.

233
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,074
Hey. Maddox, Maddox, look.

234
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,034
Listen, I… Let's move somewhere else.

235
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,118
I think it's much nicer
closer to the water, right?

236
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,663
- No, but I…
- No, it's…

237
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,206
Look, it's beautiful.

238
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,097
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

239
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,562
They were right to send us.

240
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,189
Lie down.

241
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,110
Good boy.

242
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,613
Kids, look at the beautiful coral.

243
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:13,491
Aah! Stop!

244
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,828
- What are you going to do?
- Now I'm gonna splash you.

245
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,496
Just keep on reading, I guess.

246
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,666
You just splashed me. Stop!

247
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,044
I didn't mean to splash you.

248
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,962
- Guy?
- Yeah.

249
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,965
What book am I reading?

250
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,096
I don't know.

251
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,266
Why?

252
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,852
No reason.

253
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,568
Prisca, I wanted
to tell you something.

254
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:54,949
No, never mind.

255
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,202
I'll tell you later.

256
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,042
Oh, my God.

257
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,003
That's Mid-Sized Sedan.

258
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,588
What? Mid what?

259
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:09,923
He's a rapper.

260
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,549
"More Dough for the Cookin'"?

261
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,612
- Mid-Sized Sedan?
- Begin an activity.

262
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,030
- Dad, I have to!
- Yes. Okay.

263
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,334
You and Mom on one side.

264
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,492
- No, leave him.
- Sounds like fun. Come on.

265
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:21,410
- Because it's a private…
- Stop! I need to say hi.

266
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,354
He's on vacation. He's on vacation.
What's his surname? Sedan?

267
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,735
Oh! Oh.

268
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,278
Whoa.

269
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,365
Whoa. All right. Here's a big one. Aah!

270
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,117
Help me with this.

271
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,162
We should have a housewarming party.

272
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,791
Isn't our house so beautiful?

273
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,265
- Boo!
- Aah! You!

274
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,142
- Come. Come back here!
- No!

275
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,353
Not gonna get me!

276
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,439
Kara,
I'm gonna get you right now.

277
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:08,815
Come on.

278
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:11,067
- Not gonna get me!
- No, I am.

279
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,111
Come on, Kara.

280
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,698
Whoa! Oh, my God.

281
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,074
Caught you.

282
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,329
Ha. Never gonna catch me.

283
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,500
Honey, I'm home.

284
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,337
I told you,
I don't want to live like this.

285
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,422
I'm gonna live in a condominium.

286
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,507
I'm going for a drive to calm down.

287
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,053
I'm really, really hungry.

288
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,680
Me, too. My stomach's growling.

289
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,265
Me, too.

290
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,823
Wow.

291
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,576
Who would leave this?

292
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,412
Hey, Mom!

293
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,456
From the hotel!

294
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,583
They're so rusted.

295
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,251
Put that down!

296
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,796
You can get infected
or you'll cut yourself.

297
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,964
Come away.

298
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,926
- Next activity. Hide-and-seek.
- What's happening?

299
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,762
I don't know. They found
stuff from the hotel in the sand.

300
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,975
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

301
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,395
- No fish.
- Ready or not, here we come!

302
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,080
Mom!

303
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,541
Mom! Mom!

304
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,795
Mom! Mom! Mom!

305
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,299
What is it? What is it?

306
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,176
- Trent?
- Someone over there.

307
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,428
Over where?

308
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:14,566
Come on,
give me a hand. Get the legs.

309
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,285
Make your list.

310
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,786
- Make your list.
- Okay.

311
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,580
- Red and orange.
- Red, orange.

312
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,165
Come away from here, babies.

313
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,917
Let the doctor try
and help this lady, yeah?

314
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,586
- Green.
- Green.

315
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,881
- Tan.
- Tan.

316
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,382
- Purple.
- Purple.

317
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,884
- What happened?
- It's okay.

318
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,719
- Blue.
- Blue is good.

319
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:43,844
- In there.
- Green.

320
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,472
- Green, yes.
- Yellow.

321
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:46,837
Yellow. I love yellow.

322
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,091
Call the police, right?

323
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,143
I'll get my mobile.

324
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,479
Oh, damn.

325
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,918
What happened to her, Mom?

326
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,294
I don't know.

327
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,589
- I'm still hungry.
- Me, too.

328
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,134
Was she with you?

329
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:27,263
I was waiting for her.
She swam out by herself.

330
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:30,308
Yo, I don't know what the hell happened.

331
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,435
I ain't saying nothing else.

332
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,763
Did you strike him?

333
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,523
I don't need to know the context of…

334
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,191
What? No. Of course not.

335
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,818
So why's your nose bleeding?

336
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,530
I told y'all, I ain't got
nothing to say to you.

337
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,452
My chest feels funny.

338
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,539
Well, you know…

339
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:55,500
…we should've gotten a yacht,
like I suggested, Agnes.

340
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,377
You shouldn't have fought me on that.

341
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,506
You see? Now we're mixed up
in some island issue.

342
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,008
I mean, I…

343
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,974
Mom, my swimsuit is hurting.

344
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,392
I have to take it off.

345
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,394
Well, just loosen your…

346
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,526
We're from Philadelphia.

347
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,362
I'm on a break here with
my wife and kids. That's them.

348
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,740
That… Well, yeah, over there.

349
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,287
And for the record, I know
most people who die on vacation

350
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:36,207
die from sun exposure, overexertion,

351
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,626
overindulgence of food or alcohol

352
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,838
or-or a mixture of all
of the above 99.4% of the time.

353
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,840
- How you know all this?
- I'm an actuary.

354
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:47,260
I calculate people's insurance rates
based on their risk profile.

355
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,181
I ain't do nothing, man.

356
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,643
She was into me.

357
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,273
Somebody will figure this out.

358
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,568
We'll just have to wait
for them to get here.

359
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,196
No reception at all.

360
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,491
I guess our beach day's over.

361
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,910
You got to keep an eye
on him and the body.

362
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,415
Oh, my goodness.

363
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,607
Did you just get
dropped off by the resort?

364
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:28,134
Yeah. We were supposed to come earlier,
but we rested in the room first.

365
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:31,096
Great. We have to get the resort people
before they leave.

366
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,865
I think we will all
have to leave this beach.

367
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,893
Wait. Why? They left already.
What happened?

368
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,615
We really don't know what happened.

369
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,076
Well, I think this man had
something to do with it.

370
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,371
Man, if I was involved,
why would I be standing around, bro?

371
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:57,706
- Damn.
- His nose is bleeding.

372
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,433
Got that when she
was trying to defend herself.

373
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:01,459
I don't like this dynamic at all.

374
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,229
Yo, my nose has been bleeding
for hours, man.

375
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,397
I don't know why it's doing that.

376
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:06,756
Charles, something's wrong
with your mother.

377
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,258
She's asking for you, honey.

378
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,970
Well, we're all in this now.

379
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,514
We are responsible for that woman.

380
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,683
And I've got nothing against this man.

381
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,643
I'm just doing what needs to be done.

382
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,479
No cell phone reception
on this beach.

383
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,189
You stay here.

384
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,918
I'll go to the clearing in the jungle
where they dropped us and try to call.

385
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,111
They obviously have a signal out here.

386
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,530
- How else do people call to go back?
- Right.

387
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,549
Oh, my God.

388
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,635
You stumbled back out.
You were holding your head.

389
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,637
You looked like you were in pain, babe.

390
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,057
You blacked out.

391
00:25:58,141 --> 00:25:59,809
I felt this pressure in my head.

392
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:08,568
I'm fine, Charles.
I-I think it's the shock.

393
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,113
Try to help Gustav, or he'll be sick.

394
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:13,437
Yeah, of course it's the shock.

395
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,509
Listen, I'm gonna get a van
to take us back to the resort,

396
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,613
but first, I've got to deal
with all this, all right?

397
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:19,537
Are you okay?

398
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:20,705
Yeah.

399
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,874
I know you've been stressed.

400
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,460
Don't let this upset you.

401
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,463
Help these people through this, Charles.

402
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:31,633
So, what did you hear?

403
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:36,012
Help these people through
this, Charles.

404
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,389
Excuse me.

405
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,686
Excuse me. I saw you were
talking to my husband.

406
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,480
I know you're dealing with a
lot with that woman right now,

407
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,482
but something is wrong with my son.

408
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,401
- Some kind of reaction.
- Is… is it severe?

409
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,652
I don't have time for this.

410
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,946
What kind of doctor are you?

411
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,407
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon
and chief medical officer.

412
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:57,117
You don't know me.

413
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,578
I curate exhibits for museums.

414
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,914
I'm telling you this
because I want you to trust me

415
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,916
and not think I'm being
hysterical when I say

416
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,544
there's something very wrong
with my child.

417
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,921
He seems fine to me.
He's playing with my daughter.

418
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,882
You look different, too.

419
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:14,259
How?

420
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:18,221
Uh, I don't know.
You just look different.

421
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,433
Hold my hand.

422
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,726
Okay.

423
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,980
Willow.

424
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,108
Japanese maple. Evergreen.

425
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,152
If you get scared,
just tell me, okay?

426
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,196
What do you keep looking at?

427
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,741
- There.
- Where?

428
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,911
Way, way up there
on the side of the hillside.

429
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,455
What do you see?

430
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:45,415
I thought I saw something shiny.

431
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,168
Here comes Mom.

432
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:54,466
Charles, she stopped breathing!

433
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,384
She stopped breathing!

434
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,014
I didn't do anything, Charles.

435
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,099
You guys just… you just walked away,

436
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:05,518
and she just stopped breathing
all of a sudden.

437
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,145
She… I mean, she was peaceful.

438
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,022
Can you step back, please?

439
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,399
We'll take the kids
away from here.

440
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,485
Is this happening?

441
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:28,667
She couldn't take the shock.

442
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:32,045
She-she saw a murdered woman,
and her heart couldn't take it.

443
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:35,131
What are your names
and occupations?

444
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,759
I'm Jarin. I'm a nurse.

445
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,220
I'm Patricia. I'm a psychologist.

446
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,848
He remembers everyone's names
and things about them.

447
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,351
Everything's gonna be okay.

448
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,353
What's your name?

449
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,898
I'm Trent. This is my sister Maddox.

450
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:53,566
How old are you guys?

451
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,236
I'll guess. I'm good at this.

452
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:58,154
You're 11, right, Trent?

453
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,573
I'm six.

454
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,158
No.

455
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,577
Really, are you ten, 11?

456
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,830
He's not lying. He's six.

457
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:10,125
I'm specifically
six and a quarter.

458
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:11,918
She's 11.

459
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:16,214
They're feeling unsafe.
There is a lot going on here.

460
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:19,426
They're playing with us. Let's leave it.

461
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:22,137
Okay, what's your best friend's name?

462
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,014
Maddox.

463
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,391
How sweet.

464
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,476
Have you seen my children?

465
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:32,564
Is-is everyone trying
to play a joke on us?

466
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,983
- What?
- Aren't these your children?

467
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,526
I'm right here, Mom.

468
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,447
Mom?

469
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:43,408
Mom.

470
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,793
Why are you looking at me like that?

471
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:05,638
Prisca.

472
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:07,891
I think we should leave.

473
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,810
Get the kids back to the resort.

474
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:11,935
Guy.

475
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,915
- Maddox?
- Yeah. Dad, it's me.

476
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,087
What's going on?

477
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,892
You see? You see?

478
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,237
Damn.

479
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,657
- How'd we get here?
- Take it easy.

480
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:52,328
Intense cranial pressure.
It's like being deep underwater.

481
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:57,042
Can you get up?
Whoa, whoa, take it easy.

482
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:02,464
- Charles? You okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm all right.

483
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:03,673
I'm fine. I'm all good.

484
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,884
We're leaving right now,
and we're taking our kids.

485
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:09,012
For some reason, people are
blacking out going this way.

486
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,597
Three people have blacked out now.

487
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,557
- That's ridiculous. Come, move.
- No, no, no.

488
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,201
I saw it, Prisca. I saw Jarin black out.

489
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:17,812
What I know is that we have to
get these kids to a hospital.

490
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:18,937
Now.

491
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,816
Look, let's stop talking about it.

492
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:23,401
The kids are scared.

493
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:27,155
I can stay here with them,
but everyone else should try

494
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,866
and find a different pathway
off this beach.

495
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:33,953
Break off into groups of two
in case people black out.

496
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,874
Chrystal, go with me.

497
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:56,226
Whoa.

498
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:57,894
Whatever you do, just stay close.

499
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,230
I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.

500
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:01,940
Don't get up too quickly.

501
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:04,317
Kids, let Mom and Dad talk for a second.

502
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:06,528
No. Mom, we're scared.

503
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,656
Please, stay right here.

504
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:11,658
Okay?

505
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,619
If I cry, please don't let them see.

506
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:15,954
I won't.

507
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:17,122
Your hands are shaking.

508
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:18,081
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

509
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,291
- Yeah, they are.
- Yeah. You okay?

510
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,295
We're on a beach
with two unrelated dead bodies.

511
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:26,214
That is just statistically impossible.

512
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:29,759
All three kids are reacting to something.
Only the kids.

513
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,636
I mean, look at the doctor's daughter.

514
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:36,182
The kids are reacting
to something they ate.

515
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,351
Or they caught something.

516
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:41,187
We're on a remote, undeveloped island,

517
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:44,065
but we have a doctor here, so…

518
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,526
let's get the doc to look at the kids.

519
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:56,828
I still can't get any reception.

520
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:59,789
Doctor, before we do anything else,

521
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,000
can you take a look
at our children, please?

522
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:06,087
He's got a knife!

523
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,674
There's a damn hole in my cheek.

524
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:11,676
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

525
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,347
- Put that down right now, Doctor.
- Watch out, Jarin.

526
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:20,310
Listen, I don't know why I did that.
I thought he was gonna hurt me. Sorry.

527
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,687
Sorry.

528
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,332
- What's he talking about, "sorry"?
- Okay.

529
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,858
- Let me see that laceration.
- Man, that's assault, man!

530
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,401
Calm down.

531
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:30,820
What's your name?

532
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,239
Mid-Sized Sedan.

533
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,912
I must be in shock. I'm numb.
I'm not feeling the pain no more.

534
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:41,373
Please, let me see.

535
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,424
No, this is not making any sense, Prisca.

536
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:53,789
I need to get
my ass to a hospital now.

537
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,638
What's with all y'all faces?

538
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:00,558
It's hard to explain.

539
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,399
This is messed-up, man. Where'd it go?

540
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:09,609
This is some kind of parlor trick.

541
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,778
Yo, I know I tried to dip,

542
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,072
but I am freaked, man.

543
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,492
I just want to go back to my hotel room.

544
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,787
This was supposed to be a Zen trip, man.

545
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,165
She and I only started talking
because she was sick and so am I.

546
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,042
She had just been diagnosed with MS,

547
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:29,879
so we started rapping about that.
I didn't do nothing to that girl, man.

548
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,425
She was like Michael Phelps
swimming out there,

549
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:34,884
backstroking and whatnot.

550
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,511
She swam way the hell out.

551
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:37,804
What did you say?

552
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:40,390
No, I-I-I don't know, man.
Maybe it was butterfly stroke.

553
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:41,742
I don't watch the Summer Olympics.

554
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:43,411
You came vacationing here
because you were sick,

555
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:44,477
- and so did she?
- Yes.

556
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:46,122
I thought that was a cool coincidence.

557
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:48,898
Maybe this is some kind
of group psychosis.

558
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:49,982
I've studied this.

559
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:52,652
We're all emotionally shaky
from our lives.

560
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:55,780
We don't believe we can leave this beach.

561
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:04,330
Mom, is there any more food?
I'm still hungry.

562
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:05,850
Well, she's definitely aged.

563
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:07,643
Honey, how can you
still be hungry? We just…

564
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,545
I'd put her biological age
somewhere between 12 and 13,

565
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:13,006
and she turned six two weeks ago Tuesday.

566
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:14,591
What?

567
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:17,093
We're older?

568
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:19,721
Am I okay?

569
00:36:21,139 --> 00:36:23,725
I don't know what's happening
to the three of you, sweetheart.

570
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,311
For now, I have
another swimsuit in my bag,

571
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:28,688
and maybe you should change into that.

572
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:31,566
Uh, it might be a virus, maybe.

573
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:33,318
Could be mosquitoes where…

574
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:35,362
The way they behave
on this part of the island.

575
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:38,114
Something's happening to her
that's triggering her hormones.

576
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,119
- The dog has died!
- Oh, my God.

577
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:42,285
Oh, my God.

578
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,661
He was only just alive.

579
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:46,831
- Kara, hold on to me, baby.
- What's happening?

580
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,626
Who thinks they can swim

581
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:53,213
a hundred lengths of a pool
against currents

582
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:56,383
and then turn and swim an unknown amount

583
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,677
along the coast
till we find another shore?

584
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:03,556
That's what I'm guessing the distance is
to swim out and get around this cove.

585
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:18,905
It's too far. It's not safe.

586
00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:21,491
My name is Brendon.

587
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,577
I went to private school,
my mom is an attorney,

588
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,079
and my dad is a dentist.

589
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,874
- Yo, I just wanted somebody to know that.
- Okay.

590
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,920
I have a problem with my blood.

591
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:33,420
A rare issue with its clotting.

592
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:36,214
I came to this island to see the ocean

593
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:39,551
and remember I'm connected
to something bigger.

594
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,137
That's beautiful, Brendon.

595
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:46,766
I don't feel the same way
I felt yesterday or this morning,

596
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:49,352
and I don't think
my parents would understand.

597
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,439
My thoughts have more colors in them now.

598
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,943
Yesterday, I had a few colors
and they were really strong,

599
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:59,487
and now I have more and they're quieter.

600
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,407
Okay!

601
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,617
Everyone, gather!

602
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,411
Come on, come on, come on.

603
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:09,122
Everyone needs to have a voice here.

604
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,791
Are you sure we have time for this?

605
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:14,961
We will make destructive decisions
if we don't feel safe with each other.

606
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:16,588
I know we don't have time, but…

607
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:18,214
why don't we start with you two?

608
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,425
Why are you here?

609
00:38:23,553 --> 00:38:25,305
We've been having a tough time…

610
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,598
Chrystal.

611
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:28,516
W-We've been going through something.

612
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,352
He's under a lot of stress as a doctor.

613
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,197
- He needed some time away.
- Everyone does.

614
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,150
- I'm not unusual in that.
- Charles, it's okay.

615
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:35,690
I'm not gonna say anything else.

616
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:36,816
Good!

617
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:38,985
It's nice to hear from you both.

618
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:40,737
How about you guys?

619
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:46,451
Prisca?

620
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:47,911
It's nothing.

621
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:50,580
We just have to make a decision.

622
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:53,041
The kids are reacting to something.

623
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,627
It's a virus. It's-it's probably a virus.

624
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,713
I just need to catch my breath.

625
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:01,174
I just started feeling weird a minute ago.

626
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:02,592
Are you okay, Mom?

627
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:04,177
- Mom?
- What's wrong?

628
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:05,942
- Um…
- Are you okay, Mom?

629
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:07,472
I don't think it's the…

630
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:09,391
- She has a tumor.
- What?

631
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:11,243
But it's benign.
They said it's benign.

632
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,269
- Oh, my God.
- Mom…

633
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:17,399
- Wow. Um…
- Is it… Where?

634
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:18,566
Mom?

635
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:19,692
It's okay.

636
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:20,819
Can I…

637
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:23,196
It's the size of a golf ball.

638
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,865
No, it's supposed
to be three centimeters.

639
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,742
All right. Let-let me see.

640
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,285
- Whoa, whoa.
- Mom!

641
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:30,971
- Prisca.
- She's gonna faint.

642
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:32,247
Mom. Mom!

643
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:34,582
Wake up, Pris. Don't do this.

644
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:38,420
It's there.

645
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:42,257
It's been there for a while.
It's the size of a softball.

646
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:43,425
Jesus.

647
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,593
- It's grown.
- What?

648
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:49,264
- What's happening to Mom? Dad.
- Trent, it's okay. It's okay.

649
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,367
- What's happening to Mom?
- Trent, why don't you two guys

650
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,851
go play somewhere else on the beach?

651
00:39:52,934 --> 00:39:56,104
Okay? Mom's just a little bit tired.
Would you do that for me, tiger?

652
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:57,790
The first adult's
being affected.

653
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,232
Okay, what if we cut it out?

654
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:00,835
- Dad!
- Not possible.

655
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:02,235
Actually, it is.

656
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,737
- But it's Guy's call.
- No!

657
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:04,988
No, no, no. No.

658
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:07,949
I don't want to make this decision.
No. No, I…

659
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,493
I don't know what to do.

660
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,792
- Do we have alcohol?
- Yes.

661
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,461
Some bottles from the minibar.

662
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:21,689
I cannot be held responsible.
You understand that, right?

663
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,048
Yes.

664
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:25,925
Okay. Well, I mean, does anyone
have a needle and thread?

665
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:27,427
We're gonna have to sew this up.

666
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,012
Yeah. Uh…

667
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:32,349
Here. Here. Is this the right decision?
Maybe we should all talk about this.

668
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:35,643
I can't think.
This tumor is going to kill her.

669
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:44,527
Did you know that Jack Nicholson
did a film with Marlon Brando?

670
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:45,612
Oh, no.

671
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:47,906
What is he saying?

672
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:49,216
Wh-What was the name of that film?

673
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,117
- Charles, breathe.
- Are you okay?

674
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:52,243
Yes.

675
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,496
Will you just let me do my job, please?

676
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:55,622
Is he okay?

677
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:19,020
Cut her again.

678
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:21,207
We'll keep our hands in there
to keep the incision open.

679
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:23,024
Guy, I can help, brother.

680
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:24,734
No. No, I'll take care of her.

681
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,569
Does anyone know the name of that film?

682
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:30,615
It was with Jack Nicholson…
and Marlon Brando.

683
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:32,492
Both!

684
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:33,868
Try again, Doctor.

685
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,246
Oblique incision on the side of the belly.

686
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,164
Four to six inches. You can do this.

687
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:43,128
Put your fingers inside the incision.

688
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,754
Okay.

689
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:46,840
Can you open it
a little wider, please?

690
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,509
It's closing around my fingers.

691
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:51,177
Keep pulling it apart.

692
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,303
That's it.

693
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,556
I'm lifting the tumor out.

694
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:56,766
Wow!

695
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,494
It's the size of a cantaloupe.

696
00:41:58,518 --> 00:41:59,769
W-Wait.

697
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:01,980
It's attached to something.

698
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:04,065
Muscle tissue.

699
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,400
Okay. You, um,

700
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,695
hold the incision open
a little wider, if you would.

701
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,239
I'm so sorry, Pris.

702
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:13,575
Just cutting
underneath the tumor.

703
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,078
Okay. Got it.

704
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:31,801
Mom.

705
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:34,387
Prisca?

706
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:36,806
Mom?

707
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:54,949
It's okay.

708
00:42:55,742 --> 00:42:57,243
I just fainted.

709
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:00,789
We took the tumor out.

710
00:43:01,414 --> 00:43:02,957
It was going to kill you.

711
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:07,462
Your husband made a fast decision.

712
00:43:19,307 --> 00:43:21,518
Guy, I feel better.

713
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:43,123
Damn.

714
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,835
Come on, y'all, look at this!

715
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:50,338
Hurry!

716
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:54,384
Damn.

717
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,095
Come on, y'all.

718
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:07,981
Can we all agree I didn't do that?

719
00:44:08,606 --> 00:44:10,108
What happened to her?

720
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:12,444
The body has decomposed.

721
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:14,779
- How quickly can that happen?
- A long time.

722
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:16,281
Mom knows this stuff.

723
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:18,450
I'm not a forensic pathologist,

724
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:20,827
but from excavations for the museum,

725
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:24,372
I know that it varies
based on soil and temperature.

726
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:27,542
My best guess, an exposed body,

727
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:30,795
the flesh will be gone
in approximately seven years.

728
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,757
And this happened in what, three hours?

729
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:35,175
I know.

730
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,470
And bones we found will disintegrate
in 30 years more.

731
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,805
The hell, man?

732
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:42,891
On this beach, less than
20 hours after you die,

733
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:44,309
you just return to dust.

734
00:44:45,685 --> 00:44:47,145
What exactly are we saying?

735
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,070
Something is going on
with time on this beach.

736
00:44:49,731 --> 00:44:50,732
Time?

737
00:44:56,821 --> 00:44:58,156
You have wrinkles.

738
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:13,463
I'm scared.

739
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:21,554
It's best to focus
on specifics in the present

740
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,390
in unsettling situations.

741
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:24,641
Mm-hmm.

742
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:27,102
Like breathing.

743
00:45:27,185 --> 00:45:28,853
What's happening to us?

744
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:31,481
Are we sick, too?

745
00:45:31,606 --> 00:45:35,235
No, I don't think so.
I think we're just growing.

746
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:39,698
Going by Trent and Maddox's ages
and the time we spent on this beach,

747
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:44,536
half an hour is equivalent
to something like one year of our lives.

748
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:48,707
This must be true for all of us.
We just don't see it on everyone.

749
00:45:48,873 --> 00:45:50,375
You know, it's the first time

750
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,060
- they wished they were Black.
- Mm-hmm.

751
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:54,587
The kids are eating so much
because their mass is growing.

752
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:58,383
They need to grow an enormous
amount of mass quickly.

753
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:02,595
We're staying roughly the same mass.
Our cells are just aging.

754
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:07,517
I don't feel the same.
It's like my mind is changing, too.

755
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:10,895
I'm getting many thoughts
at the same time.

756
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:13,398
It's weird.

757
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:20,613
I'm not as scared about
what's happening to us.

758
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,867
What about our hair and nails?

759
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,327
Shouldn't they be growing
at an abnormal rate?

760
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,747
Maybe it has to do
with the fact that the cells

761
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,707
in hair and nails are dead

762
00:46:30,832 --> 00:46:32,834
and they aren't reacting in the same way.

763
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:36,212
On this beach,
60 minutes is two years.

764
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:40,050
We'll age almost 50 years in one day here.

765
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,218
Almost a lifetime.

766
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:49,100
I think it could be the rock
that surrounds this beach.

767
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:52,812
If our cells are being affected,

768
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:55,857
speeding up in their processes,

769
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,902
then us trying to leave is like

770
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:03,031
swimming to the surface too fast
after being deep in the ocean.

771
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:05,575
Our bodies can't reacclimate.

772
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:08,536
That's why we go unconscious
when we try to leave.

773
00:47:10,663 --> 00:47:11,915
Maybe…

774
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:16,378
we could slowly walk through the canyon.

775
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,672
Take a step, stand still.

776
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:22,467
Do it over eight to ten hours.

777
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:25,136
Let our bodies acclimate.

778
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:29,766
But according to Prisca's timeline,

779
00:47:29,891 --> 00:47:32,331
who would be willing to give up
20 years of their life trying?

780
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:33,603
I'm sorry, this is nonsense.

781
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,939
Let's not shut down everyone's experience.

782
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:39,401
Wait. Where are the kids?

783
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:43,947
Trent!

784
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:45,824
Kara!

785
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,452
Answer us now! We need you here!

786
00:47:49,577 --> 00:47:50,912
There they are.

787
00:48:05,218 --> 00:48:07,637
- Want some?
- No, I'm not hungry.

788
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:25,947
Hey.

789
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:27,824
Mom! Dad!

790
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:46,676
Kara?

791
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,636
What did you do?

792
00:48:49,387 --> 00:48:51,097
We were just playing. It's okay.

793
00:48:51,222 --> 00:48:52,474
I just got a little fat.

794
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:53,767
Mom, you're better.

795
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,687
Maddox?

796
00:48:57,812 --> 00:48:58,897
Maddox.

797
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:00,315
It's okay, Trent.

798
00:49:01,232 --> 00:49:03,902
Just let Mom and Dad figure this out.

799
00:49:06,654 --> 00:49:08,156
My God, Guy.

800
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:11,326
It's okay, right, Mom?

801
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:17,123
Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando
were in a movie together.

802
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:20,418
If she walked into the emergency room,

803
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:23,004
I'd say she's about five months pregnant.

804
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:24,798
- What?
- What?

805
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:26,549
Just stay calm, Trent.

806
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:29,094
She'll only be pregnant
for about 20 minutes

807
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,762
from the time of conception.

808
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:33,367
Why do you keep looking at me
like you want to steal my wallet?

809
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,240
Do you want me to punch you in the face?

810
00:49:35,308 --> 00:49:38,144
Calm down.
I have no idea what you're talking about.

811
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:42,440
All right. Let's just
concentrate on the issue at hand.

812
00:49:43,108 --> 00:49:44,567
Do you know about movies?

813
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,778
Dad, Mom tells you to sit down
when you get like this.

814
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:48,780
Okay, we need to get her help.

815
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:50,865
Okay? This cannot happen here.

816
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:52,325
- It's gotten bigger.
- Kara.

817
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:54,411
- It's Kara, right?
- Yeah.

818
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:56,654
- Lay down on a blanket.
- It's gonna be okay.

819
00:49:56,746 --> 00:49:58,516
There's a lot of people here
that can help you.

820
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,000
We're all like your family now.

821
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,544
Oh, God.

822
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:04,838
Our cells are aging very fast here.

823
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:07,191
Something to do with the rocks
around the beach, we think.

824
00:50:07,215 --> 00:50:08,717
Just lay down on the sand.

825
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,682
Whatever would have happened to us
is happening to us really fast.

826
00:50:11,761 --> 00:50:12,846
Okay.

827
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:14,889
What you did is how babies are made.

828
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:16,784
I know, but I thought
you had to do that

829
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:18,226
ten times or something.

830
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:19,769
Did I get that wrong?

831
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:22,439
Look, it can happen after only once.

832
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,918
We didn't get a chance
to talk about all this.

833
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:28,611
Are Trent and I having a baby?

834
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:29,988
Did I get it wrong?

835
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:32,282
Only a couple
of minutes left if we're right.

836
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:34,242
- Is that the baby?
- You got it. Okay.

837
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,785
- Mom.
- Charles!

838
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:38,705
Kara? Hon…
I need to think about what to do.

839
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,832
- Mom, I think I…
- No. I need to help her.

840
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:43,376
- Mom! I'm scared!
- It's okay.

841
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:45,045
- Kara.
- Mom, it's coming.

842
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,756
Stay with me. Come on, baby.

843
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:49,924
- Can you hold her hand? Kara?
- I've decided…

844
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:52,510
I'm gonna marry her, and we are
never gonna yell at each other,

845
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:54,012
and we are never getting divorced!

846
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:56,473
Trent, listen to me.
She's going to feel pain.

847
00:50:56,598 --> 00:51:00,143
Intense pain. Okay?
Like she never felt before.

848
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:01,853
But then it's going to pass.

849
00:51:01,936 --> 00:51:04,522
Okay? It's going to pass.

850
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:08,860
Chrystal.

851
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,528
Chrystal!

852
00:51:11,905 --> 00:51:13,698
Hey, you blacked out.

853
00:51:14,115 --> 00:51:15,450
You can't go that way.

854
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:19,454
Come on. You're okay now. Come on.

855
00:51:20,205 --> 00:51:21,498
Get up.

856
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:24,542
Come here. Look.

857
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:32,467
You're okay. Come on. Come on.

858
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:34,612
- Babies crying helps them breathe.
- It's here.

859
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:36,429
We looked that up, remember, Mom?

860
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:50,235
We put him
on the towel to clean him up.

861
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:52,987
He looked around and closed his eyes.

862
00:51:54,155 --> 00:51:56,533
We had him on the towel for one minute.

863
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,077
He died from lack of attention.

864
00:51:59,202 --> 00:52:02,622
Things are moving
too fast here for a baby to survive.

865
00:52:03,164 --> 00:52:05,250
No. No, you're lying.

866
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:07,085
You're lying! You're all lying!

867
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,920
- Shut up, Trent!
- You're lying!

868
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:11,339
- You're lying!
- Hey, hey, hey.

869
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:16,344
Maybe we should all talk
about what just happened.

870
00:52:19,556 --> 00:52:21,016
Charles.

871
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:23,101
- Get us out of here!
- It's my baby.

872
00:52:23,184 --> 00:52:26,855
Get us out of here now!
You were supposed to protect us!

873
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,065
You didn't protect us!

874
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:30,650
Kara's hurt!

875
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:35,447
I will make these decisions.
Just give me a second.

876
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:43,413
I used to see you in our neighborhood.
Who… who are you?

877
00:52:45,582 --> 00:52:47,083
I'm Jarin!

878
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:51,046
I-I don't know where you live.

879
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,508
Don't condescend to me.

880
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:00,722
Put some makeup on your face.

881
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:22,327
I'm sorry about the baby.

882
00:53:24,537 --> 00:53:27,332
When I was your age,
I was in love with a man.

883
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:31,211
His name was Giuseppe.

884
00:53:33,004 --> 00:53:35,423
He wasn't very handsome, and I left him.

885
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,260
We looked silly together, he and I.

886
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:50,897
He had nothing to offer.

887
00:53:54,526 --> 00:53:56,945
For some reason,
I think about him a lot here.

888
00:54:07,997 --> 00:54:09,416
Leave me alone.

889
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,304
Charles, stop!

890
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:26,516
Stop! Stop!

891
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:39,070
He's gone.

892
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:40,822
Oh, God.

893
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:54,294
Bring your bag. Okay, come here.

894
00:55:04,846 --> 00:55:07,140
I'm just going to take it…

895
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,356
- …now.
- It's okay.

896
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:16,858
Everything will be okay.

897
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:38,364
I'll find another beach,
and I'll try to find help.

898
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:41,091
She needs her medicine.

899
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,718
We're lucky she hasn't had a seizure yet.

900
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:46,471
It must be the beach,
whatever it's doing to my body.

901
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,891
Guy, I was on the swim team. I'll make it.

902
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:53,353
I'll make it.

903
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,403
Watch him.

904
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:20,922
Maybe I could climb that rock.

905
00:56:22,298 --> 00:56:25,927
Maybe the effect, the blacking out,
doesn't happen if you go up.

906
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,054
You can't do it.

907
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:30,932
- I'll do it.
- Yeah, he's strong.

908
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:32,225
- He can do it.
- Yeah.

909
00:56:32,308 --> 00:56:35,103
No. I won't allow
my son to do that.

910
00:56:35,186 --> 00:56:36,563
It's too dangerous.

911
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:38,273
It's a last resort.

912
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,316
Mom…

913
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,738
I do feel overwhelmed.

914
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:49,409
I'm managing, but no one must know.

915
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:54,289
They'll try to stop me from working.

916
00:56:55,498 --> 00:56:56,833
What should I do?

917
00:56:58,209 --> 00:57:00,086
Mom, tell me what to do.

918
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,550
Prisca, something's bothering me.

919
00:57:06,384 --> 00:57:09,387
Charles' family knew he had
some kind of mental disorder.

920
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:11,431
Someone in each group was sick.

921
00:57:12,265 --> 00:57:14,267
How did you first hear about this place?

922
00:57:14,392 --> 00:57:16,770
I don't know. I-I fell upon it.

923
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:20,148
A random sweepstakes.
It came with a receipt at the pharmacy.

924
00:57:20,523 --> 00:57:23,401
I just followed it up online,
started getting emails.

925
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:26,571
They know our medical condition.
They chose us.

926
00:57:27,155 --> 00:57:30,700
They have our passports.
We could just disappear.

927
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:33,328
They sent us a special car to the airport.

928
00:57:33,411 --> 00:57:34,746
A plane.

929
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:37,916
They can make it look like
we never left our house.

930
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:55,475
You were thinking
about leaving Dad,

931
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:58,895
weren't you?

932
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,528
Yes.

933
00:58:08,279 --> 00:58:10,407
I didn't want you two to suffer.

934
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:16,121
Was there someone else?

935
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,175
Did Dad know?

936
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:41,980
Maddox.

937
00:58:43,231 --> 00:58:44,607
Please.

938
00:58:45,608 --> 00:58:49,821
I found out about this tumor,
and I got scared.

939
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:54,409
I stare at the remains of
nameless people in glass cases,

940
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:57,537
and I kept thinking I'm going
to be one of those people.

941
00:58:57,662 --> 00:58:59,372
Does that make any sense?

942
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:04,336
I feel different than I felt yesterday.

943
00:59:06,504 --> 00:59:10,425
What I did feels like an illusion.
I swear.

944
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:14,471
Do you hate me now?

945
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:19,559
I just need some time, Mom.

946
00:59:25,398 --> 00:59:27,108
We don't have that, baby.

947
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,196
Look at you.

948
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:35,909
You're an adult.

949
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:41,247
Be strong for everyone.

950
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:48,004
Connect to something bigger.

951
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:49,190
Here, here. Dad.

952
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,484
Lay him down. Lay him down.

953
01:01:14,632 --> 01:01:16,676
He must have gone unconscious swimming.

954
01:01:19,346 --> 01:01:21,639
Brendon didn't do anything to that woman.

955
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,434
We can't swim out, Prisca.

956
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:35,904
We're not getting off this beach.

957
01:01:38,156 --> 01:01:40,992
We never had a prom.

958
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,787
Or a graduation.

959
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:46,414
There are so many memories we didn't have.

960
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,501
It's not fair.

961
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:55,799
He needs to rest now.

962
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:33,128
Kara.

963
01:02:35,588 --> 01:02:36,965
Kara.

964
01:02:38,466 --> 01:02:40,301
Wait. What if you get dizzy up there?

965
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:42,679
- You might black out.
- Trent, we are in charge now.

966
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:46,641
My dad could hurt more people.
I have to get him off this beach.

967
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:51,312
Kara! Don't climb that. Come down!
We'll find another way.

968
01:02:51,896 --> 01:02:54,357
- No, don't! Trent.
- Mom.

969
01:02:54,482 --> 01:02:55,692
I have to go with her!

970
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:58,987
Kara, wait! Don't climb!
Let me get your mother!

971
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,613
- Kara!
- It's not the way.

972
01:03:01,031 --> 01:03:03,700
She's panicked and desperate.
Talk to each other.

973
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:06,911
Kara, you and I
should just stay together.

974
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:08,872
What if we spend this whole time trying

975
01:03:08,955 --> 01:03:10,957
to get out of here
and we still don't make it?

976
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:14,627
It'll be too short if we don't try.

977
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:16,129
No, Kara, please!

978
01:03:16,212 --> 01:03:18,131
Please just stay with me, please.

979
01:03:33,521 --> 01:03:36,274
If she makes it to the ledge,
she might have a chance.

980
01:03:38,026 --> 01:03:39,903
Go to the ledge and rest!

981
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:46,368
There has to be a way out.

982
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:50,080
It's a mathematical certainty
there must be a way out.

983
01:04:01,257 --> 01:04:02,717
No. Why is she stopping?

984
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:04,094
No.

985
01:04:06,012 --> 01:04:08,014
No. Kara! Kara, wake up!

986
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:11,059
Kara, wake up! Wake up!

987
01:04:55,562 --> 01:04:56,730
Kara.

988
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:04,779
Daddy.

989
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,758
Let's all stay together.

990
01:05:25,675 --> 01:05:27,927
Nobody in this family goes alone anywhere.

991
01:05:30,805 --> 01:05:34,851
I think I figured it out.
I'm using these to swim out.

992
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:40,482
I have a sister.

993
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:43,943
She's a therapist, too.
I need to get to my sister.

994
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:46,988
We never talk.
We had a fight a long time ago.

995
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:50,033
She's older, but now I am.

996
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:53,870
The fighting seems ridiculous now.

997
01:05:59,376 --> 01:06:00,752
Patricia.

998
01:06:00,877 --> 01:06:02,545
Patricia.

999
01:06:04,547 --> 01:06:07,258
No. Wh-What's happening to her?

1000
01:06:07,342 --> 01:06:08,677
What's going on?

1001
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,428
She was fine. What-what's happening?

1002
01:06:10,512 --> 01:06:12,639
She keeps stopping and starting.

1003
01:06:15,684 --> 01:06:18,103
No. Dad, do something.

1004
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:09,446
Oh, no.

1005
01:07:11,364 --> 01:07:12,782
Kara?

1006
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:17,203
Kara, where are you?

1007
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:24,044
Somebody's done this to us, Kara.

1008
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:29,507
I can't protect you anymore.

1009
01:07:30,508 --> 01:07:31,968
Kara!

1010
01:07:42,562 --> 01:07:45,273
No, you don't know.
Jarin went in a different way.

1011
01:07:45,357 --> 01:07:47,692
He went on, and I'm
a better swimmer than he is.

1012
01:07:47,817 --> 01:07:50,028
He's older than me. I-I can probably swim…

1013
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:52,197
Trent, stop it. No. No.

1014
01:07:52,697 --> 01:07:54,866
No, you're not a better swimmer than him.

1015
01:07:54,991 --> 01:07:56,451
Yeah, but let me try.

1016
01:07:56,534 --> 01:07:58,161
Listen. Listen.

1017
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:14,719
We're not gonna let you.

1018
01:08:14,803 --> 01:08:16,888
Stop. It won't work.

1019
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:19,491
I don't want to give up.
I really don't want to give up.

1020
01:08:19,557 --> 01:08:20,717
We're not giving up.

1021
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:22,018
If you let me try…

1022
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:42,997
My back.
I need my calcium.

1023
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:44,290
Chrystal?

1024
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:46,835
Chrystal, stay with us.

1025
01:08:47,335 --> 01:08:48,753
Don't look at me.

1026
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:09,733
Prisca, I have to tell you something.

1027
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:17,532
I saw your text messages one day.

1028
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:24,456
He says romantic things.

1029
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:32,756
I'm sorry.

1030
01:09:37,218 --> 01:09:39,721
I don't know who I would have
been okay with, but…

1031
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:41,556
with that guy?

1032
01:09:44,851 --> 01:09:46,311
He's-he's a joke.

1033
01:09:46,394 --> 01:09:48,271
He's a pretend person.

1034
01:09:49,105 --> 01:09:51,524
You deserve someone
so much better than that.

1035
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:56,738
I should have said something
when I saw it.

1036
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:59,074
I hide from everything.
I'm a fucking coward.

1037
01:09:59,157 --> 01:10:02,160
This was no one's responsibility but me.

1038
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:05,830
Your anger should be aimed at me, just me.

1039
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:17,801
There's no place
I want to be but with you.

1040
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:21,596
Do you believe me?

1041
01:10:24,432 --> 01:10:25,850
I want to be here…

1042
01:10:30,188 --> 01:10:31,439
…right now.

1043
01:10:52,502 --> 01:10:54,379
It's notebooks.

1044
01:10:58,299 --> 01:11:01,177
Well, maybe we can use
some of the empty pages

1045
01:11:01,302 --> 01:11:03,304
for the fire, keep Mom and Dad warm.

1046
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:10,645
Whoever it was wanted
to be a science fiction writer.

1047
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:12,188
It's full of story ideas.

1048
01:11:13,606 --> 01:11:16,985
"Birds that can make you
black out when they scream

1049
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:20,405
fly too close to an Emirates
commercial plane one day."

1050
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:24,659
He realized he was never
getting off this beach.

1051
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:29,247
He's trying to figure out what's going on.

1052
01:11:32,834 --> 01:11:36,087
"Magnetism of this exact spot on the Earth

1053
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:39,716
with the rocks on this beach
submerged beneath the ocean

1054
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:43,303
for millions of years
deposited with special minerals

1055
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:46,890
are causing our cells
to age at a rapid rate.

1056
01:11:47,265 --> 01:11:49,601
Are there other places like this?

1057
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:51,936
Who found this place?"

1058
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,233
Well, maybe we can make
a metal tube that we can get in

1059
01:11:57,359 --> 01:11:59,152
that stops the effects on our cells.

1060
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:01,321
Like at a dentist's office, you know,

1061
01:12:01,446 --> 01:12:03,907
when they put a metal vest
on us before an X-ray.

1062
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:06,618
I mean, then we could just
walk out with it on us and…

1063
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:09,871
I mean, we'll get dizzy at first,
but then, slowly, we'll get used to it

1064
01:12:09,996 --> 01:12:11,247
and we can leave, right?

1065
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:15,210
Where are we gonna make a metal tube?

1066
01:12:17,253 --> 01:12:19,547
He wrote down a list of all
the names and the addresses

1067
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:21,549
of the people with him on the beach.

1068
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:32,227
Maddox, that's a camera.

1069
01:12:34,896 --> 01:12:36,439
They're recording us.

1070
01:12:39,484 --> 01:12:40,777
Why would they do this?

1071
01:13:19,983 --> 01:13:21,234
Who is that?

1072
01:13:21,985 --> 01:13:23,403
Prisca, who is that?

1073
01:13:31,578 --> 01:13:33,538
You're gonna tell them what I did.

1074
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:37,334
The man with the tattoos,

1075
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:42,297
he was gonna steal things from my home.

1076
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:48,928
Guy!

1077
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:50,055
No!

1078
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:51,931
I can't let you tell them.

1079
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,602
I'm a good doctor. He was gonna follow us.

1080
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:57,204
He was gonna steal things from our home.

1081
01:13:57,228 --> 01:13:58,521
Why don't you believe me?

1082
01:13:59,856 --> 01:14:00,940
I stopped him.

1083
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,195
Tell me where the knife is, Prisca!

1084
01:14:09,324 --> 01:14:11,326
I keep having these thoughts.

1085
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:13,495
Listen, they keep coming to me.

1086
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:16,373
Don't tell anyone.

1087
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:21,503
Prisca!

1088
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:23,588
Hide the kids! I'll protect you!

1089
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:29,636
Yes.

1090
01:14:30,178 --> 01:14:31,930
Maddox! Trent!

1091
01:14:32,472 --> 01:14:36,101
I need you two to go
and find somewhere to hide now!

1092
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:38,019
Somewhere where someone can't find you.

1093
01:14:38,144 --> 01:14:39,854
- I need you to go right now.
- Mom, what…

1094
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:41,189
And don't ask any questions.

1095
01:14:41,272 --> 01:14:42,982
Now, go! Hide!

1096
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:45,860
Go!

1097
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:00,333
Shh.

1098
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:02,794
There's someone in here with us.

1099
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:10,135
My body hurts to move.

1100
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:12,887
I miss Giuseppe.

1101
01:15:14,764 --> 01:15:16,057
Don't look at me!

1102
01:15:16,224 --> 01:15:18,560
Turn off the light!

1103
01:15:22,105 --> 01:15:24,441
I don't want to be seen!

1104
01:15:27,777 --> 01:15:29,654
Kara's dead, isn't she?

1105
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:33,825
Whoever did this killed her, didn't they?

1106
01:15:35,326 --> 01:15:36,326
Kara died.

1107
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,248
It was an accident.

1108
01:16:07,942 --> 01:16:09,277
Don't look.

1109
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:11,780
God, it's already healed
in the wrong position.

1110
01:16:11,905 --> 01:16:13,573
Turn off the light!

1111
01:16:13,865 --> 01:16:15,033
Go.

1112
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:18,411
Turn the light off.

1113
01:16:18,536 --> 01:16:22,415
I'm chief medical officer of my hospital!

1114
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:25,126
I am not gonna let…

1115
01:16:25,251 --> 01:16:26,503
…take it away from me!

1116
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:27,480
It's rust.

1117
01:17:29,065 --> 01:17:31,901
It acts like poison when it
gets into your bloodstream.

1118
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,552
I'm sorry you were on this beach.

1119
01:17:59,929 --> 01:18:01,723
But this is my family.

1120
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:12,627
Dad, Mom, you guys got to stay hydrated.

1121
01:19:14,879 --> 01:19:15,880
Mom.

1122
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,133
Mom.

1123
01:19:18,925 --> 01:19:20,677
Are you warm enough?

1124
01:20:23,365 --> 01:20:25,116
Were we fighting about something?

1125
01:20:29,162 --> 01:20:30,413
We were.

1126
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:37,170
Well, whatever it was, uh,
I'm not mad anymore.

1127
01:20:45,303 --> 01:20:46,930
I can't remember.

1128
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:54,729
Why did we want to leave this beach?

1129
01:21:00,735 --> 01:21:01,861
So beautiful.

1130
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,034
It doesn't matter.

1131
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,710
It's funny.

1132
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:19,963
I…

1133
01:21:20,964 --> 01:21:22,215
Forget…

1134
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:25,010
the word.

1135
01:21:28,304 --> 01:21:30,515
It's about my feelings for you.

1136
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:35,603
I know.

1137
01:21:57,542 --> 01:21:58,960
- Dad.
- Dad?

1138
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:54,808
Mom?

1139
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:00,397
Oh, Mom.

1140
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:34,824
We have about…

1141
01:24:35,492 --> 01:24:37,535
13 hours left, do you think?

1142
01:24:50,006 --> 01:24:52,926
We just got three days older
while you held my face.

1143
01:24:59,516 --> 01:25:01,434
Should we keep trying to get out?

1144
01:25:05,063 --> 01:25:06,314
I guess so.

1145
01:25:11,444 --> 01:25:13,488
Want to make a sandcastle first?

1146
01:25:39,097 --> 01:25:41,224
I wonder if everybody

1147
01:25:41,307 --> 01:25:44,644
continues to feel like a kid
when they're our age, or…

1148
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:48,189
is it because we were kids yesterday?

1149
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:53,028
Idlib sent me
a message I never decoded.

1150
01:25:53,653 --> 01:25:56,322
Yeah, we thought we were so smart.

1151
01:25:58,908 --> 01:26:00,201
Decode it.

1152
01:26:22,015 --> 01:26:23,725
Each symbol means a letter.

1153
01:26:25,852 --> 01:26:27,395
We thought we were like spies.

1154
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:38,531
What was the big message?

1155
01:26:50,418 --> 01:26:51,670
What's it say?

1156
01:27:09,688 --> 01:27:13,024
The coral might protect us
from the effects of the rocks.

1157
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:16,236
Maybe that's like our metal tube.

1158
01:27:16,861 --> 01:27:19,280
Maybe we're just making up
what we want to hear.

1159
01:27:19,364 --> 01:27:21,991
Well, maybe he heard
they took people to this beach.

1160
01:27:22,117 --> 01:27:24,119
Idlib heard something he shouldn't have.

1161
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:27,414
He has no idea what it means,
but he knows it's bad.

1162
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:31,960
He's trying to help us.

1163
01:27:33,878 --> 01:27:35,296
Wait.

1164
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,048
I need to get something.

1165
01:29:54,644 --> 01:29:55,854
Both of them drowned.

1166
01:29:57,397 --> 01:30:00,525
For a second, I thought they were
gonna get through the coral.

1167
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:02,878
I don't know how they suddenly
thought about going there.

1168
01:30:02,902 --> 01:30:04,863
<i>Theo, are you sure
they didn't make it?</i>

1169
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:06,448
<i>We can't have another incident.</i>

1170
01:30:06,573 --> 01:30:09,117
Sidney, relax. I watched
for a minute and a half.

1171
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,036
And the one person
who got through last year

1172
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:12,579
ended up drowning anyway.

1173
01:30:12,662 --> 01:30:13,830
We're fine.

1174
01:30:14,706 --> 01:30:17,125
Final members of trial 73 are deceased.

1175
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:19,002
Observation's complete.

1176
01:30:20,003 --> 01:30:22,172
Bringing drives back, returning to base.

1177
01:31:41,167 --> 01:31:43,753
All rooms for
this trial have been cleared.

1178
01:31:43,878 --> 01:31:46,381
Uh, home computer devices have been wiped.

1179
01:31:46,506 --> 01:31:48,967
Three home computers
still waiting to be scrubbed.

1180
01:31:56,808 --> 01:31:58,351
Hello.

1181
01:31:58,476 --> 01:32:03,106
Uh, a moment of silence
for the members of trial 73.

1182
01:32:11,781 --> 01:32:12,824
Thank you.

1183
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,244
Mm.

1184
01:32:16,619 --> 01:32:18,913
I'll try not to be dramatic. Uh…

1185
01:32:21,249 --> 01:32:22,917
Because of this beach,

1186
01:32:24,169 --> 01:32:27,380
we have been able to save
hundreds of thousands of lives

1187
01:32:27,505 --> 01:32:28,840
with new medicines.

1188
01:32:29,632 --> 01:32:32,302
Before we're done, it will be millions.

1189
01:32:34,721 --> 01:32:35,889
As you know,

1190
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:39,309
we do trials and fail constantly.

1191
01:32:41,978 --> 01:32:43,480
But not today.

1192
01:32:44,773 --> 01:32:46,024
Tell them, Sidney.

1193
01:32:49,944 --> 01:32:51,905
One of this cohort, uh,

1194
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:54,783
was a woman with the epileptic seizures.

1195
01:32:55,575 --> 01:32:57,369
Her name was Patricia Carmichael.

1196
01:32:57,452 --> 01:32:59,954
She suffered debilitating
seizures her whole life.

1197
01:33:00,038 --> 01:33:01,247
Nothing could help her.

1198
01:33:02,332 --> 01:33:06,336
The medicine we gave her when she arrived
turned out to be the exact mixture.

1199
01:33:07,295 --> 01:33:10,757
She didn't have a seizure
for eight hours and 17 minutes.

1200
01:33:12,467 --> 01:33:13,843
Sixteen and a half years.

1201
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:17,430
We cured her of her epilepsy.

1202
01:33:18,431 --> 01:33:21,601
We'll now fast-track trials,
make that medicine

1203
01:33:22,143 --> 01:33:23,937
and share it with the whole world.

1204
01:33:24,604 --> 01:33:26,398
Every single person that needs it.

1205
01:33:31,277 --> 01:33:34,447
Nature made that beach exist for a reason.

1206
01:33:34,572 --> 01:33:37,909
Warren and Warren was meant to find it
on their research expedition.

1207
01:33:38,034 --> 01:33:42,122
We were meant to test medicines in one day
instead of a lifetime.

1208
01:33:43,415 --> 01:33:45,917
Lots more work to be done, everyone.

1209
01:33:46,835 --> 01:33:50,588
Let's do what nature wanted us to do.

1210
01:33:58,221 --> 01:34:00,098
Mr. and Mrs. Brody will arrive

1211
01:34:00,223 --> 01:34:02,517
at 11:00 a.m. with six nontargeted guests.

1212
01:34:03,059 --> 01:34:05,520
Joseph Brody has early-onset Parkinson's.

1213
01:34:06,771 --> 01:34:08,523
Florence Brody will be accompanying him.

1214
01:34:08,606 --> 01:34:10,900
I'm gonna be a broken record
about this, Nills.

1215
01:34:10,984 --> 01:34:13,361
We should separate
the pure medical subjects

1216
01:34:13,445 --> 01:34:15,071
from the mental illness subjects.

1217
01:34:15,196 --> 01:34:16,573
Our violent schizophrenic patient

1218
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:18,408
cost us the data
on our blood clot patient.

1219
01:34:18,533 --> 01:34:21,161
Sidney, I doubt we'll alter
protocol at this point,

1220
01:34:21,244 --> 01:34:23,538
but, uh, put it in a form

1221
01:34:23,663 --> 01:34:25,915
and submit it to Warren and Warren again.

1222
01:34:49,981 --> 01:34:51,358
How are you?

1223
01:34:53,693 --> 01:34:56,488
Those kids went home. They don't matter.

1224
01:34:56,613 --> 01:34:58,740
I tell you which kids you can play with.

1225
01:34:58,865 --> 01:35:00,325
You have to trust me.

1226
01:35:00,408 --> 01:35:01,993
And don't ask questions.

1227
01:35:02,118 --> 01:35:03,620
Okay?

1228
01:35:04,412 --> 01:35:05,955
- Okay.
- Good.

1229
01:35:07,123 --> 01:35:08,792
Now, those kids are fine.

1230
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:10,543
See, you can play with them.

1231
01:35:11,628 --> 01:35:12,754
Okay.

1232
01:35:12,879 --> 01:35:14,130
Good.

1233
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:32,440
You're a police officer.

1234
01:35:35,276 --> 01:35:36,486
Yeah.

1235
01:35:55,672 --> 01:35:57,799
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1236
01:35:57,924 --> 01:36:00,719
Welcome to our version of paradise.

1237
01:36:02,095 --> 01:36:03,388
Thank you.

1238
01:36:04,597 --> 01:36:06,641
- Oh, it's lovely.
- Thank you.

1239
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:08,309
This is Madrid.

1240
01:36:09,185 --> 01:36:11,813
From your food and beverage
preferences that you selected,

1241
01:36:12,522 --> 01:36:14,774
we've made you cocktails to welcome you.

1242
01:36:16,609 --> 01:36:17,736
Sorry.

1243
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:19,463
Oh, no worries,
Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1244
01:36:19,487 --> 01:36:20,905
We'll just make a new set.

1245
01:36:20,989 --> 01:36:22,532
It'll only take a few moments.

1246
01:36:22,615 --> 01:36:24,455
I wouldn't take
anything they give you.

1247
01:36:24,534 --> 01:36:26,202
They left us all to die.

1248
01:36:28,997 --> 01:36:31,207
My name is Trent Capa.

1249
01:36:31,541 --> 01:36:33,543
I'm Maddox Capa.

1250
01:36:39,299 --> 01:36:41,634
All three are missing persons?

1251
01:36:42,969 --> 01:36:44,888
Sending you the rest of the names now.

1252
01:36:50,894 --> 01:36:53,355
<i>Our parents are
Guy and Prisca Capa.</i>

1253
01:36:54,522 --> 01:36:57,817
<i>We live at 707 Pine Street,
Philadelphia, USA.</i>

1254
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:02,447
<i>Also with us was
Jarin Carmichael, who was a nurse,</i>

1255
01:37:02,530 --> 01:37:05,033
<i>Patricia Carmichael,
who was a psychologist…</i>

1256
01:37:12,957 --> 01:37:16,628
Listen, we have to get security.
What's happening? Are you listening to me?

1257
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:56,501
May I help you?

1258
01:37:58,169 --> 01:38:00,255
Gentlemen. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1259
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:03,091
Gentlemen, we have a problem.
I need your assistance immediately.

1260
01:38:03,216 --> 01:38:05,176
Two of our guests need your attention.

1261
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,554
Solve this problem. Now.

1262
01:40:18,852 --> 01:40:20,812
We've arrested everybody here.

1263
01:40:20,937 --> 01:40:22,689
Subpoenas are being served

1264
01:40:22,772 --> 01:40:25,150
at Warren and Warren's
headquarters this week.

1265
01:40:30,613 --> 01:40:32,323
Let's get them to the airport.

1266
01:40:32,449 --> 01:40:34,951
Your aunt will be waiting
for you when you land.

1267
01:40:35,493 --> 01:40:36,911
How's she handling things?

1268
01:40:37,954 --> 01:40:40,290
How would you feel
if a 50-year-old man called

1269
01:40:40,415 --> 01:40:42,792
and told you he was
your six-year-old nephew?

1270
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:49,341
We'll be okay.
