1
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,056
Wireless crackling
with instructions.

2
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,466
Patil, don't move from there.
Be alert.

3
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,168
Yes, Sir. Okay. Out.

4
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,065
It's always crowded here.

5
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,373
Its okay, Morey.
We have to go straight.

6
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,373
Look at that... you scum!

7
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,281
You get awesome chicken
on the left here.

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,651
Don't just pay lip service, Morey.
Get it tomorrow.

9
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,732
Morey, stop here. Ma'am...

10
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,171
Jai Hind, Ma'am.

11
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,714
Yes, Sir.

12
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,608
Yes, Sir. Jai Hind, Sir.

13
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,524
Boss is in a bad mood today.

14
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,391
He's pissed with everyone.

15
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,354
His wife must've screamt at him

16
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,320
Ma'am, his PA was telling me,

17
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,161
he forgot to take his wife
shopping for their anniversary.

18
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,025
She got so upset she cancelled
their dinner reservations.

19
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,371
We can handle the
toughest of criminals easily...

20
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,475
...but when it comes to handling
family, we goof up.

21
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:13,638
So true, Ma'am.

22
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,214
That's why Morey is
taking the day off tomorrow.

23
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,013
Oh yes. It's your sister-in-law's
wedding on Sunday, right?

24
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:19,674
Yes, Ma'am.

25
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,543
How is your younger
one studying?

26
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,187
Wonder when she studies!

27
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,684
She's always glued
to the TV or the computer.

28
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,820
That reminds me...

29
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:32,823
Hello.

30
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,091
- Hello, Meera.
- Yes, Aunty.

31
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,324
- Done with your revision?
- Of course.

32
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,499
I can hear the TV.

33
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,338
- When are you coming?
- Soon.

34
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,201
- Have you got it?
- What?

35
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:42,830
Yes, Ma'am.

36
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,035
I was speaking to Jafar.

37
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:45,903
<i>O</i> kaY-

38
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,602
Better get done with
your revision till I am back.

39
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:49,110
O Kay; bye'

40
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,076
Have you fed them?

41
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,113
They are getting a royal treatment.

42
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,681
Morey, is feeding them
cheese since the afternoon.

43
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:59,114
Who told you mice eat cheese, Morey?

44
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,290
I saw it on Tom & Jerry.

45
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:02,991
These guys love cheese.

46
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,421
Our surveillance team
is already there, right?

47
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,996
I'll confirm, Ma'am.

48
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,258
Shinde...

49
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,510
The baby's crying...

50
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:49,965
oh my God!

51
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,735
You son of a...

52
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:54,862
Get up!

53
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,063
Bloody rascal!

54
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,339
Only a mouse can get
another mouse out of his hole.

55
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,347
Ma'am, please don't shoot me.
Please, Ma'am.

56
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,314
We are not going to shoot you.

57
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,248
Please, Ma'am...

58
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,122
I don't have orders to shoot you,
you scum.

59
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,285
I have to take you in alive.

60
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,621
- Jafar...
- Yes, Ma'am.

61
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,989
- Send the rest of the unit inside.
- Yes, Ma'am.

62
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:23,501
God knows who else is hiding
inside for a threesome.

63
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,363
Get him!

64
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,538
You son of a...

65
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,842
You have dodged us
four times before.

66
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,447
You think we'll let
you escape so easily?

67
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,576
Ma'am, I am warning you.
Ali Bhai will ruin you.

68
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,577
Take him away!

69
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,525
Giving refuge to
rats spreads plague.

70
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,343
Rehman, you should be
thankful to me.

71
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:12,173
You could at least
make love one last time.

72
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,649
Jafar was all set
to spoil it for you.

73
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,315
You are ragging me,
aren't you, Ma'am?

74
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,615
Sir's call.

75
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,184
- Yes, Sir.
- You got Rehman?

76
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,725
Yes, we are taking
him to the station.

77
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,053
I had ordered you to
get him out and nab him...

78
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,789
...not barge right inside the chawl.

79
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,297
You know how sly Rehman is, Sir.

80
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,462
If we had let him come out
he would definitely have escaped.

81
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,434
We would have arrested
him again if he escaped.

82
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,200
But who would be responsible...

83
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,673
...if a civilian was
killed in a shootout?

84
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,302
We had taken precautions, Sir.

85
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,179
Taking rats along
was your precaution?

86
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,575
Oh, for God's sake, Shivani!

87
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,682
It was a calculated risk, Sir.

88
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:50,518
Your job is to take orders,
not risks. You understand?

89
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,154
Someone please take
Sir's wife for shopping.

90
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,798
Go home, Ma'am.

91
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,509
Meera has asked you
to come early, right?

92
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,705
If we don't get this
rascal's paperwork right...

93
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,914
...he'll find a loophole
to escape from the law.

94
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,174
No chance, Ma'am.

95
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,975
We'll keep the papers
ready by morning.

96
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,018
You have a look at it.

97
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:24,781
<i>O</i> kaY-

98
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,018
Sorry, I am late again.

99
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,988
It's okay.

100
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,485
Meera, wake up.
Your Aunty is home.

101
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,320
sorry...

102
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,827
Happy birthday, sweetheart!

103
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,759
Aunty! You are so late.
Happy birthday, Aunty!

104
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,327
For me?

105
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,235
No, Aunty. I stood first
in the orange belt category.

106
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,441
Wow! Did you show it to mom and dad?

107
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:18,265
Yes.

108
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,417
Happy birthday to you...

109
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:33,514
Happy birthday dear Shivani...

110
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,191
Happy birthday m you.

111
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,034
This is for Meera.

112
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,006
And for me? Come on...

113
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,534
Fast, fast, fast.

114
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,470
And this is for you.

115
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,460
Wow! It looks great on you, Ma'am.

116
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:22,607
Just like John Abraham
(Indian film star).

117
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,709
Wear these goggles
and ride a bike in style...

118
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,344
Hey, hey!

119
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,673
If I look like John Abraham,
then girls will chase me.

120
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,106
Show me something else.

121
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,411
Of course, Ma'am.
I'll show you something else.

122
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,045
I have a lot of variety.

123
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,187
Try this one.

124
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,685
Chulbul style.
Dabang (Indian film).

125
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,059
He was a cop just like you.

126
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,525
Roam around in style with these.

127
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:52,367
That one Chulbul Pandey is enough.
We don't need another.

128
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,007
Ma'am, I also have
a Sunny Leone style goggle.

129
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,341
But that one doesn't have a glass.

130
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,072
It's a see through.
That's why I am not offering it.

131
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,171
But don't worry Ma'am.

132
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,648
I know exactly
what you are looking for.

133
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,446
Hang on a second.
I have a lot of variety...

134
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,021
What the hell is going on there?

135
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,020
Go check Morey.

136
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,162
Ignore it, Ma'am.
We are from the crime branch.

137
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,820
Why do we need to get into it?

138
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,195
Morey, we are from
the crime branch later.

139
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,958
We are cops first. Let's go.

140
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,060
Let's go.

141
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,764
Ma'am, goggles...

142
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,181
How dare they celebrate
Valentine's Day!

143
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,485
Enough! Enough of this destruction!

144
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:56,128
Ma'am, please don't come in our way.
Let us do ourjob.

145
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,501
Get lost!

146
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:02,169
Only one of us can
do ourjob right now.

147
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,475
And right now, I am on duty.

148
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,137
So, you stop working
and let me work.

149
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,441
Don't act smart.
Shut up and get lost.

150
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,671
You guys keep going!

151
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,045
Last warning.

152
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,750
You and your bloody last warning!

153
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:17,577
You...!
I will screw your happiness!

154
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,747
Stan counting, Morey.

155
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,022
Section 143 - unlawful assembly.

156
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,849
Section 147 - rioting.

157
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,086
Section 132 - abetment of mutiny.

158
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,558
Section 504 - intentional
insult with intent...

159
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,826
...to provoke breach of peace.

160
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,535
Section 506 - criminal intimidation.

161
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,232
Get up!

162
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,500
Two more sections left. Get up!

163
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:41,578
Section 188 - disobedience
to order given by public servant.

164
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,677
And Section 353 - assault
or criminal force...

165
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,343
...to deter public servant
from discharge of duty.

166
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,918
Anybody else wants a lesson in law?

167
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,127
Jafar, did you get
record the video?

168
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,192
Yes, Ma'am.

169
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,998
Make sure your boss
gets my name right.

170
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,471
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

171
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,702
Senior Inspector, Crime Branch,

172
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,431
Unit 3.

173
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,501
Do whatever the hell you want!

174
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,368
Get lost!

175
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:26,646
Aunty, it's only for fifty bucks.

176
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,958
- How much?
- Aunty, fifty bucks.

177
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,060
No, no. Give it for thirty.

178
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,488
No, Aunty. Take it for fifty.

179
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,824
Okay, let's settle
at thirty-five. Okay?

180
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,160
<i>O</i> kaY-

181
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:35,590
Pyaari!

182
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,763
Pyaari! Come here!

183
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,029
Hang on. Aunty, please hurry.

184
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,032
Here's a twenty... thirty...

185
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,032
Pyaari, come quickly!

186
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,041
Coming!

187
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:46,469
Keep the change.

188
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,312
Pyaari, get in.

189
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:53,407
How are you?

190
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,515
There it is.

191
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,657
Read later, Pyaari. Eat first.

192
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,356
lam going to treat
both of you this Friday.

193
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,990
Really? Why?

194
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,062
It's my birthday.

195
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,830
- Really?
- No.

196
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,365
I thought I'll celebrate my birthday
along with Ganpati's (Hindu God).

197
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,528
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

198
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:16,806
Very smart.

199
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,641
If the whole of India
will celebrate...

200
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,575
...then even we must too, right?

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,674
Right. I'll get the cake.
Which flavour do you like?

202
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:24,738
Kaalakhatta.

203
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,011
Aunty, kaalakhatta...

204
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,215
No problem.
If that's what Miss Pyaari wants.

205
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,013
Done. Kaalakhatta cake.
How old will you be?

206
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,485
- How old are you?
- Twelve.

207
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:35,391
Me too.

208
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,022
You too? Same pinch.

209
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,362
What a stroke of luck
it was that I found you!

210
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,393
Remember how you were standing
at the railway station?

211
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:49,507
If it wouldn't have been for me,
your uncle would have sold you off.

212
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,573
Aunty, but you met me, right?

213
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,068
My Ganpati selected you for me.

214
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,304
And me?

215
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,037
You, I have selected myself!

216
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,980
Shivani, please put
these eye drops for me.

217
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,186
Just a second. I am on my last set.

218
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:08,518
Again?

219
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,530
Hurry up please.
I have to go to the clinic.

220
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,428
What happened?

221
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,996
Your Kaku never lets
me work out in peace.

222
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:25,999
Really.

223
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,013
Why are there so many
boxes of cake in the fridge?

224
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,443
There will be one more today.

225
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,141
Why?

226
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,143
These are Pyaari's birthday cakes.

227
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,823
Its been three days,
I just can't find her.

228
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:41,890
So a new cake every day?

229
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,195
We can't feed her a stale
cake on her birthday, can we?

230
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,594
Just you wait! I'll pull her ears
and get her home today.

231
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:48,389
Very good.

232
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,032
Yes, Jafar.

233
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,532
I'll handle that.

234
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,336
You keep the charge sheet ready.

235
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:03,510
I'll come in some time.

236
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,814
Yes, Jafar.

237
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,676
Ma'am, I want to meet Pyaari.

238
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:09,544
Who are you?

239
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,614
Tell Pyaari, Shivani Aunty is here.

240
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,182
Who is Shivani Aunty?

241
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,124
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
Crime Branch, Senior Inspector.

242
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:25,165
Did you find her?

243
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,471
- Who?
- Her.

244
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,063
Who's her?

245
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,932
You just asked for her.
Pyaari. Did you find her?

246
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,572
Find Pyaari? Where is she?

247
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,343
I thought since you are
a cop you might have found Pyaari.

248
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,313
Who let these kids inside?

249
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:46,854
What's wrong with her?

250
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,059
She's missing since
the last four days.

251
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,490
Usually we wait for two days
before we file a missing complaint.

252
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,056
These kids wander off sometimes.

253
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,467
But they come back
in a couple of days.

254
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,168
Pyaari didn't come
back till last evening...

255
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,027
...so we filed a missing complaint.

256
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,963
Where? At the D. N.
Nagar Police Station?

257
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,233
This is D. N. Nagar...

258
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,532
...so we'll obviously go to
D. N. Nagar Police Station, right?

259
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,967
When did you see her last?

260
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,008
Four days back.

261
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:10,670
I want to meet these kids.

262
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,278
Ma'am, please wait. Tambe!

263
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,246
She was with us
three days ago. And...

264
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,449
You fool! We even ate wadapaav.

265
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,247
Kids get lost but
they also come back.

266
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,725
You come after a few days.
You'll find her.

267
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,023
We played together at bed time.
Hide and seek.

268
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,027
I haven't seen her after that.

269
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,468
I saw her when I came
in the morning.

270
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,792
Don't know where she
disappeared later.

271
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,569
She was carrying her bag of books.

272
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,503
I even asked her
where she was going.

273
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,539
But she didn't say anything.
She just left.

274
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,845
Six months ago even Yashoda
Didi disappeared in the same way.

275
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,021
One cup of tea

276
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,554
Since when do you
have your stall here?

277
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,593
What's the matter Ma'am?
ls anything wrong?

278
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,030
Just answer my question.

279
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,163
I regularly bribe Mr. Pawar, Ma'am.

280
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,238
You won't have to pay,
if you work for me.

281
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,003
What's the job?

282
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,001
You have to keep an
eye on this shelter home.

283
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,975
Who comes in, who goes out.

284
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,242
You want me to be
an informer, right?

285
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:19,908
You are very smart, huh?

286
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:26,450
A girl called Pyaari
is missing from here.

287
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,453
Give me all the
information you can get.

288
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,319
Clear?

289
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,550
Write my number down.

290
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,325
9-8-2...

291
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,465
Meera, are you ready?

292
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,268
I have made your
favourite breakfast today.

293
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,564
Sharda Bai, one more
cup of tea please.

294
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:40,295
Yes, Sir.

295
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,270
Let me comb your hair today.

296
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,004
- Sir, tea.
- Clear this.

297
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,077
You need a good hair-cut.

298
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,284
We'll go to a posh salon
in Bandra this Sunday...

299
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,951
...and get you a nice haircut. Okay?

300
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,750
How can you be so normal, Aunty?

301
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,956
Pyaari is missing since five days.

302
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,252
And we are behaving
as if it never happened.

303
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:07,830
She has been kidnapped.

304
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,700
Wonder where Pyaari is now...

305
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,161
- Hello, Ma'am.
- Hello.

306
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,837
There's no network inside.

307
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:26,466
So he comes out to take his calls.

308
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,770
Something about dealings...

309
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:30,236
He bought a new cell
phone a few days ago.

310
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,683
He is obsessed with
clicking snaps on his phone.

311
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:33,973
He has clicked mine too.

312
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,244
Where would he be right now?

313
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,353
Ogling at girls outside
Chaaya restaurant.

314
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:02,271
Kapil!

315
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,575
What are you up to?

316
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,813
Nothing much.
I was just heading home.

317
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,949
Heading home? I'll drop you.

318
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,381
No, Ma'am, don't bother.

319
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,022
It's no bother. Come, sit.

320
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,026
Come.

321
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,390
Come sit.

322
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:32,031
Half our life is spent
waiting in this Mumbai traffic.

323
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:40,382
Whose call is it? Answer it.

324
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,581
It's from home.
lam going home anyway.

325
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,584
Your family is missing you, huh?

326
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,561
Well... my wife gets worried
if I don't reach home on time.

327
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,364
Anyway...

328
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,560
May I take a snap with you, Sir?

329
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,362
Yes, of course.

330
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,701
Take a good one.

331
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,708
Done? Show me.

332
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,303
What a phone you have there!

333
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:11,337
Ma'am, take a look.

334
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,015
Latest mobile.

335
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,007
WOW!

336
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,453
Jafar, what did you earn in
so many years with the police force?

337
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:20,156
Peanuts!

338
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:25,654
We should also quit
our jobs and join an NGO.

339
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,229
Pick little girls
from the shelter home...

340
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,962
...sell them and buy
expensive cell phones.

341
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,095
Get home on time and enjoy life.
Right, Kapil?

342
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,204
Don't play dumb. We know.

343
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,841
Jafar, let's start his
interrogation here itself.

344
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,616
If we wait for the traffic to
move Kapil won't get home on time.

345
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:54,785
Good idea, Ma'am.

346
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,251
Speak up. Who do you work for?

347
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:02,362
I don't understand what
you are talking about, Sir.

348
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:04,834
Why are you stretching it?

349
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:06,499
We are in an 'instant' era.

350
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,529
The quicker you answer,
the quicker you get home.

351
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,274
Come on speak up.

352
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,567
On whose instructions
did you kidnap Pyaari?

353
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:14,568
Where is she?

354
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:17,307
Speak up, you scum!

355
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,884
He's just pretending.

356
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,556
You are messing with my head now!

357
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:30,350
Are you done?

358
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,297
- He's been shot, Ma'am!
- What?!

359
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,694
There they are!

360
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,197
Morey, call the control
room and get reinforcement.

361
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,203
- Quick!
- Okay, Ma'am.

362
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:43,772
Morey keep his mobile.

363
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:53,112
Move aside!

364
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:03,619
Move!

365
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,016
The other shooter.

366
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,352
Jafar, this matter
is getting complicated.

367
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,321
Damn!

368
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,328
Pyaari, where are you my child!

369
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,229
Come here.

370
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:52,566
Move.

371
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,037
Stop fooling around, guys!

372
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:00,810
Come on.

373
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:03,514
- Go there. Who's next?
- She.

374
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,656
What's the matter, baby?
Having fun, aren't you?

375
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:08,620
Will you rip it or should I?

376
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,257
- Come on.
- No, please no!

377
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,461
Come here.

378
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:13,525
No!

379
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,431
Get her.

380
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,001
Come on. Stand straight, you!

381
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,468
lam telling you for the last time.

382
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,978
Don't do this to me.

383
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,413
Please!

384
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,545
Easy, Matt u!

385
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:11,251
Take it off!

386
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,161
Take a good look. She's a virgin!

387
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,561
In spite of you around?

388
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:29,037
Don't you find anyone
else to pick on!

389
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,474
Put her in No. 2.

390
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,532
Baby Doll!

391
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,537
Come here to Papa. Come.

392
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:38,538
Hey!

393
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:45,155
Don't come near me rascals.
Don't come.

394
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,046
Are you insane?!

395
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,882
Who will you kill
with that splinter?

396
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,091
Myself. I will slash myself.

397
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,189
Don't slash your wrists.

398
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,527
It'll hurt more
and will take more time.

399
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,529
Loretta School, Kolkata, huh?

400
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,894
Her school is very famous.

401
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,499
I was in Hindu College.

402
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,909
Dropped out in the second year.

403
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,609
But that I can help you with.

404
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:13,173
No really.

405
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:18,050
If you really want to die
then cut this vein of your neck.

406
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,114
It'll be quick and
it'll be painless.

407
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:25,060
And if you still want to run
I really suggest you drop that idea.

408
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,988
Because you have seen me.

409
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,254
What's her name?

410
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:30,827
Mrunal.

411
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:36,298
Mrunal, now it leaves
us with two options.

412
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:38,637
You either work for me...

413
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,034
Don't come, don't come.

414
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,270
Chill. It's okay.

415
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,346
Or I will have to kill you.

416
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,509
What were you about to do?

417
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:52,285
Yeah. I would have
also done the same.

418
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,680
Slash your wrist slightly from here.

419
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,084
It would have taken
5-7 days for you to die.

420
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,529
In front of all the girls.

421
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,323
ls that what you want?

422
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:04,832
But what to do?

423
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,801
A bit of drama is required
to control so many of you.

424
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,029
And that leaves us
with our last option.

425
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,799
If you want to stay alive...

426
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,504
...and lead a good life
I can help you with that too.

427
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,816
You are quite hot, you know.

428
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,150
I can get you the best clients.

429
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:27,917
5 star hotels, fine dining,
beaches, clubs, foreign trips.

430
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,426
Think about it.

431
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:36,662
But the way I look at it, you don't
really have a choice. Do you?

432
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,023
Mattu, keep her for Hong Kong.

433
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,825
Come on, Charlie's Angel.

434
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:32,617
Put her in No. 1

435
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,860
The shooter has been identified.
He's Hanif Hatela's man.

436
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,696
- Hanif, the hired assassin?
- Yes, Ma'am.

437
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:43,490
You are quite hot, you know.

438
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,561
We found a treasure in Kapil's phone.

439
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,933
All the notorious ones together?

440
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,001
Ma'am most of them are
members of the Ali Gang.

441
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,171
This one is Balu Kotian...

442
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:57,939
...and this one is Dhapna Khalid.

443
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:00,313
Go back.

444
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,417
Just a moment.

445
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:06,516
This...

446
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,625
Who's this?

447
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,619
I have never seen him before.

448
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,961
Kapil loved to flaunt
his connections.

449
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,663
He's surely a member of some gang.

450
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,901
This is definitely a huge syndicate.

451
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:29,809
To pick up a girl so smoothly,
and then shoot him...

452
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:33,645
Only an organized gang
can operate with such finesse.

453
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,818
There is one man,
who keeps track of such things.

454
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,260
ls this a new style
of interrogation?

455
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,623
Feed meat and extract information?

456
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:55,667
Tell me, Rehman,
is anything free in life?

457
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,999
If everything was without a price...

458
00:29:58,263 --> 00:29:59,435
...then would you
have become a gangster?

459
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:01,437
You are right.

460
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:11,012
Do you know him?

461
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,313
Are you kidding me?

462
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,284
You want me to be an
informer at my stature?

463
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,326
You idiot!

464
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:21,587
When I had come to arrest you...

465
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,024
...you were begging
me not to shoot you.

466
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,367
And now you talk about stature?

467
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:30,707
Don't waste my time.
I have loads of other work.

468
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:33,068
Katyal.

469
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,038
He is Sunny Katyal.

470
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,112
He's not from Mumbai.

471
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,382
He started operating here
around three years ago.

472
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,485
He has fifteen car showrooms now.

473
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,253
But the real dough comes from
drugs and trafficking.

474
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,494
Whenever a girl between
8 to 18 years disappears...

475
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,700
more often than
not he is involved.

476
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:05,065
You can call him
the wholesaler of trafficking.

477
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,743
No matter where a girl disappears
from, she ends up in his net.

478
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:11,712
Why is he not on our radar yet?

479
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,011
Your radar? He is not
even on our radar yet.

480
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,651
It's impossible to crack
how he smuggles drugs and girls.

481
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,816
How do the other
gangs let him operate?

482
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,186
He is a very smart man.

483
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:24,889
Keeps everyone happy.

484
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,656
Has no enemies.

485
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,459
But I have a strong doubt that
he is not the brain behind all this.

486
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,029
There is someone
bigger supporting him.

487
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,901
You gave me a lot of information
in return for a Mutton Kolhapuri.

488
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,710
I did it for the girl.
Not for the food.

489
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:48,912
Thanks for the meat.

490
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:57,686
Katyal.

491
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,188
Sunny Katyal.

492
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,291
I want to know about
every message...

493
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,687
...every call that's
made from his cell phone.

494
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,058
What time he wakes up in the morning
to who he bangs in the night!

495
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,436
I want to know everything.

496
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,160
Got it?

497
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:09,028
Yes, Ma'am.

498
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,028
- Check the angle of the video.
- Yes, Sir.

499
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,458
I want it clear.

500
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,535
Hello, Vakil Sir.
It's a mess here.

501
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:18,073
The crime branch people
have made my life hell.

502
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,999
I think they'll very soon
monitor me in the loo!

503
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,503
How did they get to know about you?

504
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,339
How do I know that Vakil Sir?

505
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:28,307
I just know that they are
behind my life with a vengeance.

506
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,382
What will you do now?

507
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,017
lam thinking of talking
to the commissioner.

508
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,284
Moron!

509
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:35,889
Why inform the commissioner about
things that he doesn't know yet!

510
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,286
Then please tell
me what I should do.

511
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,288
Find out the price of the inspector
who's leading this operation.

512
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:41,895
Throw some money at him.

513
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,857
That's the problem, Vakil Sir.

514
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:44,660
It's some woman.

515
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,464
She has a track record
of not accepting bribes.

516
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,464
Woman? Tell me her name.

517
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,774
Shivani Shivaji Roy.
From the crime branch.

518
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,775
Do one thing.

519
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,671
Get me her number.
I'll call her tomorrow.

520
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:03,845
Get me the number!
Like it's a piece of cake.

521
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:06,918
Where the hell am I sitting!

522
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,120
Just when some money
was on its way...

523
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:12,522
...this moron has made plans
to ruin it.

524
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:18,700
I have a feeling this inspector
is going to ask for a huge price.

525
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,165
Has Mr. Singh's payment come?

526
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,197
Yes.

527
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,668
The batch of girls
this time is superb.

528
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,274
Really?

529
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:32,512
What did he say?

530
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:34,818
He signed a 200,000 deal.

531
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:39,181
The foreigners loved the
service that our girls gave.

532
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,388
What is the status of the girls
from Bangladesh?

533
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,048
It's getting delayed.

534
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,024
The security at the border
has become very stringent.

535
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,192
It will take a week more.

536
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:52,026
You are very lenient with them,
Vakil Sir.

537
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,903
They are very prompt
at collecting their payments.

538
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,469
But when it comes to delivery,
a week's delay?

539
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:02,638
Not done.

540
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:06,175
What was her name?

541
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:07,676
Shivani Roy.

542
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,980
Wow! She's hot.

543
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:14,788
Let it be, Vakil sir.

544
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:18,317
You are too old to
deal with women like her.

545
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,998
I'll talk to her.

546
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,197
Tell Katyal to get
all information on her.

547
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,129
A week has passed
and no leads yet.

548
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,303
Either he is smart
or our information is wrong.

549
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,333
Yeah, Mr. Sinha (Boss) too
is getting impatient.

550
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:36,710
Let's wait for a few more days.

551
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,012
lam sure he will
commit some mistake.

552
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,086
Come on. I have got dinner.

553
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,064
Hello?

554
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:00,763
You reached home, Ma'am?

555
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:01,767
Who's this?

556
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,768
Doesn't matter.

557
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,475
How come you picked dinner
from Aaswaad tonight?

558
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,238
Sharda bai didn't
come to work today?

559
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:10,507
Yes. Aaswaad has lovely food.

560
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,476
- Want to join us for dinner?
- I had heard right about you.

561
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,481
Aunty, what have you got?

562
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,108
Someone else would
have been rattled.

563
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,776
Set the plates.
lam very hungry. Call Kaku.

564
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,317
Go, quick, quick.

565
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,122
Tell me.

566
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,720
Why are you watching me?

567
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,994
If you keep a watch on my men then
I will have to watch you, right?

568
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,364
Oh! So you are Katyal's daddy!

569
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,003
You sound like his son though.

570
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,431
How does it matter?

571
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:37,832
It's the same family.

572
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,672
The whole family seems twisted.

573
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,004
You are calling me from VOIP
so I can't trace your call?

574
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,479
To deal with a sharp
officer like you...

575
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,576
...one needs to be prepared, right?

576
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,717
No point tracing the IP address...

577
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:53,716
You won't find anything.

578
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:55,351
Enough bragging-

579
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,190
Get to the point.
My food is getting cold.

580
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:01,497
Stop watching my people
and quote your price.

581
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:03,295
I want my daughter back.

582
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:05,661
Daughter?

583
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,103
You have a daughter?

584
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,831
The girl you picked up
from the Andheri shelter home...

585
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,098
...is like my daughter.

586
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,543
Oh! That's why you
are behind my life.

587
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,949
It might have been possible
if you had asked earlier.

588
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,050
It's difficult now.

589
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:27,552
Fine. Then the surveillance
will continue.

590
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:32,124
You are stretching this
a bit too much.

591
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:36,428
She was like your daughter,
but not your real daughter, right?

592
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:38,865
Let's do one thing.

593
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:42,936
There's a 35 story skyscraper
coming up in Wadala.

594
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,804
The top floor is yours.

595
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:51,574
No thanks. If the elevator
breaks down, who'll climb 35 floors!

596
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:55,011
Then tell me what you want.

597
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,081
I told you I want Pyaari back.

598
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:01,250
Shivani ji, you
aren't listening to me.

599
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,117
That girl has seen too much.

600
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,156
I don't take such
a risk in my business.

601
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:10,658
It's too late now.

602
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,630
Aunty, hurry UP!

603
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,403
Listen, kid.

604
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,032
I'll come hunting to
your house to rescue Pyaari.

605
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:20,970
But rescue I will.

606
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,775
That's a lot of anger Ma'am.

607
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,039
Chill. Don't get worked up.

608
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,482
It doesn't suit you.

609
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:28,343
Anything else?

610
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:34,418
Don't do this.
Think about it please.

611
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,283
You need to think about it Junior.

612
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,853
I won't take too
long to reach Pyaari...

613
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,999
...but the day I reach her you
won't be capable of even thinking.

614
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,530
Okay, Ma'am.
You do your job and I'll do mine.

615
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,068
Let's just both do
what's best for business.

616
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,269
But I have to admit
it was fun talking to you.

617
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,305
Bye Ma'am.

618
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:04,453
Hello. Mattu, put that
girl Pyaari in tonight's lot.

619
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,623
Jafar, pick Katyal from his house.

620
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,989
I'll finish dinner and come.
Yes, right now.

621
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:12,987
How dare you touch me?

622
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,995
You can't harass a responsible
and innocent citizen this way.

623
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:20,663
Please, please, Sir, speak in Hindi.
I do not understand.

624
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,406
I will speak to the Human Rights
Organisations...

625
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,440
...and feed you to the dogs.

626
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:26,765
Sure.

627
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:28,470
<i>- Jaiar’?
- Pam?</i>

628
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,985
You feed us to the dogs
and we will feed you jalebis.

629
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:38,646
Jalebi?

630
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:44,627
You will eat the jalebis, feel Very
sleepy but we won't let you sleep.

631
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:46,825
I don't eat jalebis.

632
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,290
Shut up and eat! Or I'll...

633
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:53,002
Eat it. He hits very hard. Eat it.

634
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,565
I will eat it. Hang on a second.

635
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:56,363
Eat.

636
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:09,144
Gentlemen, please key in your
bids on your iPad screens now.

637
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:16,553
For the sweet and spicy No. 104.

638
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,018
She looks grown
but is just a child.

639
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:26,401
100% virgin. 100% pure. Guaranteed.

640
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:38,774
No!

641
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,481
I thought I'll celebrate
my birthday with Ganpati.

642
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:47,884
The whole of India
will celebrate it then.

643
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:50,788
How are you?

644
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,051
- How old will you be?
- How old are you?

645
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:54,229
- Twelve.
- Me too.

646
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:55,087
You too?

647
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,796
Pyaari, come quickly.

648
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:08,169
You met me, right, Aunty?
My Ganpati selected you for me.

649
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:09,436
What will you become
when you grow up?

650
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:10,737
An airplane driver.

651
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:11,670
What?

652
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:15,651
It's called a pilot,
not a driver, you fool!

653
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,016
Same thing.

654
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:21,180
I'll fly the plane very high,
right in the middle of clouds.

655
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:36,038
Ma'am, have your ginger
tea and fix your mood.

656
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,397
Thank you, Jafar.

657
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,208
He's a seasoned player.

658
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:47,611
We stuffed him with
a kilo ofjalebis...

659
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,542
...didn't give him
even a drop of water...

660
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:51,854
...but he still
didn't open his mouth.

661
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,382
Ma'am I'll continue for the
next four hours. You go on home.

662
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,228
Ask Morey and Pawaskar
to continue later.

663
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,158
Don't let him sleep
even for a second.

664
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:02,263
Yes, Ma'am.

665
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,655
Thank you.

666
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,468
lam coming. Two minutes.

667
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,472
Aunty, you are so late!

668
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,849
Sorry. But I think
we'll soon find Pyaari.

669
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:26,185
Really, Aunty? You are the best,
Aunty. You are the best.

670
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,885
It won't hurt after
a couple of times.

671
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,055
Here...

672
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,121
...cupcake.

673
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,929
For both of you.

674
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:12,559
Every girl gets it
after her first night.

675
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,300
Have it.

676
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:21,170
I too blew my past away
after my first night.

677
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,537
That's the only way to survive here.

678
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:26,881
Otherwise your life will be hell.

679
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:31,714
Come on, now blow the candle
and move on.

680
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:34,583
Come on.

681
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:44,533
It's a great idea to teach
that nosy cop a lesson.

682
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,496
But we'll have to
pay a fat price for it.

683
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,233
This guy will do our job for free.

684
00:43:52,597 --> 00:43:53,507
Here.

685
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:55,773
Call Riyaz.

686
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:58,543
Tell him that this job must be done.

687
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:02,479
Performance bonus guaranteed.

688
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:10,954
Shivani ji, you will
stop nosing around after this.

689
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,863
Sometimes... I feel scared of you.

690
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:20,996
It's good that way.

691
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:24,065
Fear gets work done faster.

692
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:36,313
Morey... 21 missed calls!

693
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:47,489
Ma'am, come quickly.

694
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:48,456
Why?

695
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,031
Ma'am, come quickly please.

696
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,501
Get the pervert doctor!

697
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:26,155
In a shocking incident in Mumbai...

698
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,294
...a female patient
accused a doctor...

699
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,059
...of inappropriate behaviour.

700
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,293
Runa, that's my Kaku!

701
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:34,867
What's going on?

702
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,732
A few hours after the allegations...

703
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:42,011
...the members of
Maharashtra Seva Mandal...

704
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:47,076
mattacked the dispensary
and defamed the doctor.

705
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,747
We had no intentions of
taking the law in our hands.

706
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:54,188
But the people are
fuming with anger...

707
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,324
...because of the growing
exploitation of women.

708
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,951
The anger found its vent this way.

709
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,093
That doctor must be punished.

710
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:05,532
Please eat.

711
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:47,372
Hello?

712
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,702
It's the 'kid' speaking, Ma'am.

713
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:55,845
lam genuinely sorry
for what's happened.

714
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:59,484
In fact I even had tears
when I heard the news.

715
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,518
But I hope this doesn't
change things between us.

716
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:06,021
Because I am just
starting to like you.

717
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,424
There was nothing personal
about this, Ma'am.

718
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,428
It's just business.

719
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:15,960
Please don't harbour
any misunderstanding.

720
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:17,230
Please.

721
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:22,604
You know what, Junior,
I grew up in a village.

722
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,473
There was a dense
forest near my house.

723
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:31,649
That's why from early on
in life I knew animals very well.

724
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:36,189
Maybe that's the reason why Kamat
Sir took me in the crime branch.

725
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:39,427
To trap a mouse you
have to act like one.

726
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,692
To catch a dog you
have to think like one.

727
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:44,258
To hunt a tiger you
have to become one.

728
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:46,460
You know what you are?

729
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,804
You are that poisonous
snake near the river...

730
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:58,014
...who can't be seen but bites
oblivious kids swimming in the river.

731
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,316
You should have been with
the Discovery Channel, Ma'am.

732
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,579
What are you doing
in the police force?

733
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:10,316
You are the one who's
about to be discovered, kid.

734
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:13,160
I don't know what your name is.

735
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:15,829
I don't know
where you are speaking from.

736
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:19,423
Who your boss is
or where you have kept Pyaari.

737
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,760
But I've figured your type

738
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:28,337
No matter how far you
try to stay away...

739
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,044
...your nature will compel you
to come closer to me.

740
00:49:32,103 --> 00:49:32,979
30 days.

741
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:35,707
I will hunt you down in 30 days.

742
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,814
And then with a lot of love and
patience I'll squish you to pulp.

743
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:43,918
Mark my words. 30 days.

744
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:02,545
Tandon Sir, I have heard there's
a high command meeting next week.

745
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,544
You hear everything, Mattu.
But you do nothing.

746
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,644
Sir, first you don't give
me an opportunity to work...

747
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:10,015
...and then you call me useless.
This is unfair, Sir.

748
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:13,549
Big announcements are to be made
in the party meeting this time.

749
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:16,390
Now you are making me drool.

750
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,854
Mr. Taneja is coming this time.

751
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,256
Really? That means
it's going to be huge.

752
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,396
That's awesome, Sir.

753
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:26,224
The contract for Taneja's
personal party must come to us.

754
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:27,994
Why should I get you the contract?

755
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:32,271
Name the drug and you'll get it,
Sir. Indian, South American.

756
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:37,175
And as far as girls go,
look at the choice, Sir.

757
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:39,408
Film star or porn star.

758
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,241
You are still not getting me, Mattu.

759
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,710
Why should I get you the contract?

760
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:49,783
Oh! I have been
blabbering like a fool.

761
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:52,591
The list will obviously
begin with you, Sir.

762
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:56,458
And shame on me if you
have to tell me your list.

763
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:02,999
Hey, Jennifer! Come here, baby.
Come here. Take Sir...

764
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,974
Oh! Good choice, Sir.
Hey, Julia Roberts!

765
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:10,844
Darling, baby, come here.

766
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:12,908
Don't be shy. Come here.

767
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:16,644
Good girl.

768
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:19,720
Keep the tray here and
take Sir to the washroom.

769
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:23,523
Call me on Monday.

770
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:25,752
Maybe this time you'll get lucky.

771
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:30,531
Don't forget, Sir!

772
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,159
Come, baby...

773
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:41,472
Hey, Mattu.

774
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:45,074
You really do appear out of nowhere!

775
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:46,540
I have been watching you.

776
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,274
How long does it
take to crack a deal?

777
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:49,815
lam not selling water purifiers.

778
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:52,217
lam trying to crack a deal
worth crores. It takes time.

779
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,114
If he doesn't call on Monday...

780
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:56,384
I swear I'll go to Katra
and sell religious CDs.

781
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:57,886
If this deal doesn't come through...

782
00:51:57,982 --> 00:52:00,656
I won't even leave you capable
of selling porn CDs at Palika.

783
00:52:00,818 --> 00:52:02,263
I am at it.

784
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:04,624
Please don't threaten unnecessarily.

785
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:06,495
Okay. You crack this deal.

786
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:08,696
I'll send you to Mumbai
to look after our set up there.

787
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:09,835
Mumbai?

788
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:12,238
But Katyal is looking
after Mumbai, right?

789
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,865
Left... left... Very good.

790
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17,073
Good Job.

791
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,344
You fool! Be careful.

792
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:21,145
The packet will break.

793
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:22,683
Be careful.

794
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:27,020
Guggu, will the car
be fixed by evening?

795
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:28,686
Yes, Sir. It'll be ready.

796
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,293
Hello, Vakil Sir.

797
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:35,753
This time the consignment is superb!

798
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,761
Forget the consignment.
Listen to me.

799
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,261
That cop chick has lost it.
She will pick you up again.

800
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:44,433
Vakil Sir, she is after my life!

801
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:45,863
Should I fix her?

802
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,575
Don't be stupid, Katyal.

803
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:51,877
You want the entire Mumbai
Police force to come behind you?

804
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:52,942
What should I do then?

805
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:54,747
Go underground for a few days.

806
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:56,614
One of my men will
come in the evening.

807
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:58,148
Go with him to the safe house.

808
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,685
He will make arrangements
for you there.

809
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:02,651
What nonsense is this, Vakil Sir?

810
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,223
Don't crib so much!

811
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:06,490
Pack your bag and
be ready in the evening.

812
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:08,228
Go with my man.

813
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:10,358
Bye.

814
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:13,965
Pour it in my mouth!

815
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:15,636
Get lost!

816
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:17,702
lam surrounded by duck heads!

817
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,699
What's going on?

818
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:29,680
Vakil Sir has sent
such an atrocious car!

819
00:53:31,976 --> 00:53:32,784
Good bye, Sir!

820
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,057
Hello? Hello?

821
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:46,467
The network conks off
at the slightest disturbance.

822
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,596
Nobody cheats the people more
than these cell phone companies.

823
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:57,404
Hello? Hello? Can you hear me, Sir?

824
00:53:58,235 --> 00:53:59,236
Hello?

825
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:02,680
What's wrong?
Why did you stop the car?

826
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:05,712
Everything is bloody jinxed!

827
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,153
Get out of the car.

828
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:10,516
Get out.

829
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:12,756
Vakil Sir!

830
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:14,824
Get out of the car
or I'll shoot you.

831
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,895
lam getting out!

832
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:19,692
Listen to me.

833
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,726
Why are you doing this? For money?

834
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:23,170
I'll give you double.

835
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,265
Move!

836
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:26,974
Listen to me once.

837
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:29,905
I'll give you all the money
you want right away.

838
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,910
Your life will be made.

839
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,344
What's happening with me!

840
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:35,911
Isn't there a chance?

841
00:54:38,976 --> 00:54:41,786
Vakil, what a way
to repay my loyalty!

842
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:45,086
Let me tell you one
thing before I die.

843
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:48,520
Don't ever be overtly
loyal to anybody in life.

844
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,263
It screws you.

845
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:53,167
Look at me.

846
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:54,430
Fifteen years...

847
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,342
The Hanif you hired to kill Kapil...

848
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:14,547
...eventually took the contract
to kill you.

849
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,152
What a business you guys run!

850
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,121
May I ask you something?

851
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,394
How did you know about this?

852
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,496
lam beginning to know
your boss a little bit.

853
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:35,374
He knew that if he didn't
pick you up I would have.

854
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:40,046
You would always remain a risk
to him even if he saved you.

855
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:41,877
When you sat in the car,

856
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:44,748
Morey recognized that
your driver was Hanif's man.

857
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:48,019
Hanif has a brick factory
here in Kharegaon.

858
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:50,517
It makes it easier
to dispose bodies.

859
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:52,223
True.

860
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:55,419
I won't leave that rascal.

861
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:57,026
Nor will I.

862
00:55:57,955 --> 00:55:59,957
So tell me. Where does the kid stay?

863
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,536
Kid? Which kid?

864
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:04,931
Your boss.

865
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:06,937
He sounds like a kid on the phone.

866
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,303
What are you saying, Ma'am.

867
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:10,308
Vakil is at least
50 - 55 years old.

868
00:56:10,935 --> 00:56:12,039
He is not a kid.

869
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:13,372
You scum!

870
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,648
If you waste our time again...

871
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:18,480
...I'll make you a eunuch
and sell you off.

872
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,348
I swear by God I am not lying.

873
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:21,745
If I am lying...

874
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:23,989
...then do whatever
you want to do with me.

875
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,161
Vakil got me to
Mumbai four years ago.

876
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,429
lam working with him since then.

877
00:56:30,654 --> 00:56:31,189
Keep talking.

878
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:32,660
I know Vakil very well.

879
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,032
He stays in Delhi.

880
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:34,734
Hello?

881
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,370
Damn! Katyal escaped.

882
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:38,399
H ow?

883
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:40,399
Hanif's man was found dead.

884
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:42,370
How did he die?

885
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,678
He was shot.

886
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:44,574
Where?

887
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:48,381
Tell me, where was Hanif shot?

888
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,446
On the body.

889
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:53,587
Where on the body?
Front? Behind? Where?

890
00:56:56,547 --> 00:56:57,719
He was shot in the head from behind.

891
00:56:58,482 --> 00:56:59,290
Where did they find the dead body?

892
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:00,689
Near Kharegaon in a brick factory.

893
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:05,929
Hang up the other phone.

894
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:08,796
Hung UP-

895
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:12,872
Someone saved Katyal exactly
where he was supposed to be killed.

896
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:14,405
But who saved him?

897
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:15,674
Who else?

898
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:17,942
Shivani Shivaji Roy.

899
00:57:19,236 --> 00:57:21,409
It's time to send her another gift.

900
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:07,160
Congrats Ma'am.

901
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,454
Someone has dared to point
a finger at me for the first time.

902
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:12,692
Every time you point
a finger at me...

903
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,867
...you will get this gift from me.

904
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,536
Your Kid.

905
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:43,058
Hunt this guy down.
No matter what.

906
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:05,245
Hello!

907
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:07,986
I have left from the hotel.
lam going to office now.

908
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,919
Be calm. You are the most
dangerous when you are calm.

909
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:21,993
Me and Sinha go back a long way.

910
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:23,737
He was my senior in the institute.

911
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:25,701
We used to have
fun times those days.

912
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,875
He praises you very highly.

913
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:32,305
He is my teacher and guide
otherwise I behave like awild bull.

914
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:35,047
You know what.
Good officers like you...

915
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:36,874
- May I?
-Yes, come in.

916
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,550
- Sir...
- Take a seat.

917
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,191
Meet Sub-Inspector
Balvinder Singh Sodhi.

918
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:45,482
A very efficient officer.

919
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:46,756
Shivani Roy.

920
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:49,224
- Ma'am... - Senior Inspector,
Mumbai Crime Branch.

921
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:52,189
She has come with information
on a huge child...

922
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,496
...and drug trafficking
syndicate in Delhi.

923
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:58,537
You guys have my full support
to go the whole yard on this, okay?

924
00:59:58,895 --> 00:59:59,430
Thank you, Sir.

925
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,009
- Where are we going?
- To meet my source.

926
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,838
Your source? Here?

927
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:06,774
I have got him here
with Sinha Sir's help.

928
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:08,512
- Mind if we take my motorcycle?
- Sure.

929
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,019
Ditto! This is exactly how he looks.

930
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:14,178
The same curls, light eyes.
He is the one.

931
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,019
The whole world knows him as Vakil.

932
01:00:17,548 --> 01:00:19,050
But nobody knows his real name.

933
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:21,424
He sometimes deals
as Devinder Pasricha.

934
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,653
Or opens an office
in the name of Aakash Pandey.

935
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:27,064
But he keeps no name
or office for more than six months.

936
01:00:27,524 --> 01:00:30,994
We haven't heard of him ever.

937
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,066
He takes pride in that.

938
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:35,237
He always boasts that
he will never get arrested.

939
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:37,202
Isn't there a way of reaching him?

940
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,778
Of course there is.

941
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,406
One is drugs and the other is girls.

942
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:43,910
And that too because
he is getting senile with age.

943
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:47,718
We can't go posing
as customers for girls.

944
01:00:48,078 --> 01:00:50,319
He will be expecting me
to do something like this.

945
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:52,616
We'll have to play him
in such away...

946
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,296
...that lures him to us
instead of us approaching him.

947
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:00,363
Usually drug suppliers
deal only in one kind of drug...

948
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:02,729
...but he deals
in all kinds of drugs.

949
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,131
If he has his way he'll sell
cough syrup as drugs.

950
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:06,366
He is that greedy.

951
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,275
As far as I know, Sodhi...

952
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:10,972
...South American drug
is hard to get, right?

953
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:13,180
Right. And even if you get it,
its very expensive.

954
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:17,414
That means a higher profit margin.

955
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,148
He will do anything for business.

956
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:25,857
If we can get this news to Vakil
that we are not buyers...

957
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:29,721
...but suppliers of such high-end
cocaine, he's bound to approach us.

958
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,758
Bob. There's a guy called Bob.

959
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:36,261
If he comes to know
then it is sure to reach Vakil.

960
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:41,003
But our drug supplier
should look genuine.

961
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:49,809
Why should we do it?

962
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,016
Because it's a question
of somebody's life Mbangwa.

963
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,119
But it's a matter of our life too.

964
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:56,550
And what if we get killed?

965
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,054
Who will kill you?

966
01:01:58,315 --> 01:02:00,124
We are here to protect you. Relax.

967
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:02,055
Stupid policeman.

968
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:04,724
No.

969
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:08,067
Listen to me Mboso.

970
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,901
Don't forget
you don't have any passport.

971
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,907
So either I will make
papers to deport you back...

972
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:16,907
...or I will arrange
for your stay in Tihar Jail.

973
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,842
You decide.

974
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:34,990
- Where's Bob?
- What?

975
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,892
- Where Bob? Bob?
- Bob? Down there.

976

<i>O</i> kaY-

977
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,461
Hail Almighty!

978
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,575
Mindblowing stuff!

979
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:49,735
Very good, very good.

980
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:51,675
' Hey. Bob!
- Baby!

981
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:54,677
- Having fun?
- Yeah!

982
01:02:54,738 --> 01:02:55,716
Go enjoy!

983
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:00,621
So, big guy, how much do you have?

984
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:01,879
Five.

985
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:03,417
Five what?

986
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:04,817
Five kilos.

987
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,650
Are you crazy?

988
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:10,530
I want 100 grams only.

989
01:03:12,189 --> 01:03:15,363
Hey listen.
It's either full or nothing.

990
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:16,432
Let's go.

991
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:21,373
Listen, come here.

992
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:26,840
I will tell you one thing. I have
one customer who will take it all.

993
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,013
The whole material. Okay?

994
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,915
How much longer? Please hurry.

995
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:36,286
What should I tell Bob?

996
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:38,556
Who's Bob?

997
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:41,522
Our Bob. Bobby Kukreja.

998
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:45,926
He met those Nigerians.

999
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:48,560
- How much is he demanding?
- 50 lakhs.

1000
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,805
Give me some onions.

1001
01:03:52,696 --> 01:03:54,733
The material will be
good if Bob has checked it.

1002
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:57,609
Besides the cricket season
is beginning from next month.

1003
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,978
How much longer?

1004
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:02,611
It's been a long time now.

1005
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:11,892
Tell all our people that
if someone demands girls...

1006
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:16,425
...especially young girls,
then don't entertain.

1007
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,130
Our cop chick will surely
send someone as a customer.

1008
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,394
Not to take any new customers?

1009
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:24,569
I said no.

1010
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:26,832
This is the limit now!
How much longer?

1011
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,708
Taste from my plate
if you are in such a rush.

1012
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:33,040
What else to say!

1013
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:37,209
Call the Nigerian.
But in our manner.

1014
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,711
Yeah, Bob.

1015
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,192
The call has come. I am leaving.

1016

<i>O</i> kaY-

1017

01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:55,036
Tell me the position
of Mboso's car later.

1019
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:56,366
Let's go.

1020
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:13,813
- Auto!
- Lajpat Nagar, please.

1021
01:05:13,877 --> 01:05:16,983
Ma'am, what are you doing?
We called for it first.

1022
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:18,887
Shut up! Or I'll call the police.

1023
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,892
Ma'am we are the police.

1024
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,723
We are going to raid a place.
Want to come along?

1025
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,157
Ma'am, let's go.

1026
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:25,529
Sit. Quick.

1027
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:27,568
I am leaving. Have patience.
Let me take my bag.

1028
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:29,897
The cops are riding autos
these days.

1029
01:05:30,627 --> 01:05:31,264
- Please hurry.
- Auto!

1030
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:33,733
- Tell Sodhi Mboso's location.
- Right away Ma'am.

1031
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,358
We have got a biker
who's asking us to follow.

1032
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:53,387
Follow him.

1033
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:58,032
Sodhi, a biker is guiding Mboso.
Be alert.

1034
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:46,544
Sod h I, stop.

1035
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,243
Stop following Mboso.
They are watching.

1036
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:57,982
Come, Sodhi. They have left.

1037
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,096
- Mathur...
- Yes, Ma'am.

1038
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,397
Track the car on
GPS and let me know.

1039
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:06,927
- Okay?
- Right, Ma'am.

1040
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:12,598
Go.

1041
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:20,312
Yes, Math u r.

1042
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,376
Sodhi, take a left.

1043
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,743
Vakil sir, is everything fine?
Should I come up?

1044
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:29,490
All okay. You can come up.

1045

<i>O</i> kaY-

Sodhi, Stop. That's Mboso's car.

1047
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:12,796
The cops are here.

1048
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:15,335
Get out from the back door.

1049
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,031
Sodhi, there'll be a back door.

1050
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:20,238
Cover from there.

1051
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:22,999
Bloody swine! You got the cops!

1052
01:08:23,133 --> 01:08:25,113
Ratan, they'll come
up if they hear a gun shot.

1053
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:26,609
You leave from the back door.

1054
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:00,242
Vakil Sir, leave!
The cops have surrounded us.

1055
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:01,846
You've deceived Vakil!

1056
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:04,648
Leave, Vakil Sir.
Hurry! The police is here.

1057
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:07,520
Leave from the back door. Hurry!

1058
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:17,591
Ratan, you escape from the roof.

1059
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:19,098
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

Yes, Vakil Sir?
Are you out of there?

1063

Come, you...

1064
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:42,589
You conned us!

1065
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:53,630
In the Nehru Place office...

1066
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:57,899
...there's a black diary
beneath my chair.

1067
01:09:58,161 --> 01:09:59,902
It has the numbers and
addresses of our clients.

1068
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,134
Keep that carefully.

1069
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:06,973
I don't have time.

1070
01:10:09,272 --> 01:10:13,084
If they arrest me they'll reach you.

1071
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:15,846
And I won't ever let that happen.

1072
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,184
What are you talking about,
Vakil Sir?

1073
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:21,024
We'll get you out somehow.
You just leave now.

1074
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:25,063
Okay, Tiger. I got to go. Bye.

1075
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:27,059
Hello? Vakil Sir?

1076
01:10:30,193 --> 01:10:31,001
Vakil Sir?

1077
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:51,948
Move, move. Sod h i.

1078
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:19,344
Damn!

1079
01:11:51,574 --> 01:11:53,747
You piece of trash!

1080
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,350
- Hello?
- Good morning, Ma'am.

1081
01:12:32,582 --> 01:12:33,458
Did you sleep well?

1082
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:37,197
You are up so early?
Do you work in a call centre?

1083
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,721
What to do Ma'am!

1084
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:42,028
I couldn't sleep wondering
how to kill you.

1085
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:45,472
So have you decided
how you'll kill me?

1086
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:50,110
I won't kill you.
You will kill yourself.

1087
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:54,006
lam just going to
lie back and watch you.

1088
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:58,344
Wow! That's some style you got kid!

1089
01:12:59,342 --> 01:13:00,480
Are you done wishing good morning...

1090
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:01,951
...or is there anything
else you want to say?

1091
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:04,683
What is there to say?

1092
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:08,526
Now, I will show you what I can do.

1093
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:12,730
You are sharp I must admit.

1094
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:15,703
You killed Vakil Sir...

1095
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:19,328
...hid your family safely.

1096
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:23,037
But now you can't harm me anymore.

1097
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:25,409
Because I am still alive.

1098
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:27,515
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1099
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:31,015
But you are in my territory.

1100
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:34,086
Beware.

1101
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,596
Don't chew. Swallow!

1102
01:13:49,392 --> 01:13:51,770
Hey, Bengalan!
Don't you want to go to London?

1103
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:53,666
You just have to eat this pellet.

1104
01:13:54,063 --> 01:13:55,565
Even the grapes are here.

1105
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:57,540
Will you practice with grapes?

1106
01:13:57,967 --> 01:13:59,810
- I won't.
- What do you mean, I won't?

1107
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:01,675
You better!

1108
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:02,705
Open your mouth.

1109
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,375
Give me some other work.

1110
01:14:04,874 --> 01:14:07,548
Enough of your nonsense.
Eat or I'll slap you!

1111
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:10,950
Mattu is here.
Open your mouth and swallow it.

1112
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,683
- Stop your drama.
- Why don't you ask her to swallow?

1113
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:15,957
She got Ratan and Sunny arrested.

1114
01:14:16,152 --> 01:14:17,631
Rest of our men are hiding, right?

1115
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:18,893
Yes, they are.

1116
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:20,228
You worry too much.

1117
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:21,729
By the way when are you
sending me to Mumbai?

1118
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:23,269
I'll take care of our set up there.

1119
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:26,004
Forget Mumbai.
What's the report here?

1120
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:29,336
6 girls are leaving for London
and 3 for Texas.

1121
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:32,209
Their domestic help visas
and documents are ready.

1122
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:34,405
Last time on the way
to the airport...

1123
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:36,415
...a pellet burst
in one girl's stomach.

1124
01:14:36,706 --> 01:14:37,514
Remember?

1125
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:39,453
ls anyone else
going to die this time?

1126
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:41,647
No. This time Alka
has taken all precautions.

1127
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,349
- Right, Alka?
- Yes, Sir.

1128
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:45,354
This time I have used
the safest coatings.

1129
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:47,091
The pellets won't burst.

1130
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:48,591
Chill. Everything is under control.

1131
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:49,420
Yes.

1132
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:53,190
Keep the No. 1 and 2 categories.
Get rid of the rest.

1133
01:14:53,556 --> 01:14:54,728
We must have only
the best in the party.

1134
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:55,995
- Alka.
- Yes.

1135
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:57,863
Have you sent our man
to the police headquarters?

1136
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:00,530
Yes. He's been waiting
since the morning.

1137
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,175
She will definitely go there.

1138
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:04,541
You don't worry.
Dinesh will handle her.

1139
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:07,814
That girl with dengue...
do something about her.

1140
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,046
Angelina, baby...

1141
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,685
...what's wrong with you?

1142
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:16,417
- Nothing...
- Nothing!

1143
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:18,683
She hasn't slept well last night.

1144
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:21,226
ls your name Julia or Angelina?

1145
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:23,358
Julia...

1146
01:15:23,553 --> 01:15:25,829
Then let me talk to Angelina.

1147
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:31,004
Look at your condition.
Why don't you do something about it?

1148
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,171
I am just tired...

1149
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:36,234
Tired, huh?

1150
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:39,906
That's why you have this
strip of cloth on your forehead.

1151
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:42,372
I understand.

1152
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:45,015
Come on.
I'll take you to the doctor.

1153
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,018
Dr. Brad Pitter for Angelina.

1154
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,053
No, no, no...

1155
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:51,418
Let it be, Mattu.
I'll take care of her. Let her go.

1156
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:54,927
No, Alka.
The doctor is waiting. Hurry.

1157
01:15:56,585 --> 01:16:00,032
Please let her stay. Please.

1158
01:16:01,324 --> 01:16:03,167
- Come on.
- I am alright.

1159
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:06,473
- Alka!
- Coming. Come...

1160
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:15,240
No! Please let her stay. Please.

1161
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,183
<i>- Hurry.
-Yes.</i>

1162
01:16:22,845 --> 01:16:23,687
Runa...

1163
01:16:25,515 --> 01:16:26,323
Runa...

1164
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:29,888
Get her quickly!

1165
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:33,333
Runa... No! Runa!

1166
01:16:33,389 --> 01:16:34,527
Take her away. Come on!

1167
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:35,699
Runa!

1168
01:16:36,626 --> 01:16:38,902
Please don't take her. Please stop!

1169
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:52,648
Shivani, don't stretch
this case too much.

1170
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,578
We have got the man
we were looking for.

1171
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,019
But we didn't, Sir!

1172
01:16:57,213 --> 01:16:59,454
The mastermind of this
syndicate is still roaming free!

1173
01:16:59,849 --> 01:17:02,625
This is what you think, Shivani.
We don't know that for sure.

1174
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:05,957
I know that for sure, Sir.
I have spoken to him myself.

1175
01:17:06,522 --> 01:17:07,626
And not just drugs...

1176
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:09,328
...but he also is the kingpin
of sex trafficking.

1177
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:13,235
Shivani, trafficking is
altogether a different matter.

1178
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:16,666
We have a trafficking
department to investigate that.

1179
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,111
Department?

1180
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:23,339
There's a department to lodge
an FIR in every police station, Sir.

1181
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,515
In spite of that why is just one out
of every twenty complaint registered?

1182
01:17:27,477 --> 01:17:29,252
Sir, you don't need
the law to do something.

1183
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:30,516
You need intent.

1184
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:33,750
And you are determined to find
that girl all by yourself, right?

1185
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:36,394
She has a name too. Pyaari.

1186
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:43,133
All these girls who need our
help just end up being 'that girl'.

1187
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:46,200
No name, no ties.

1188
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,277
It's very easy to give up on them.

1189
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,510
You know what, Shivani. You
are being unnecessarily emotional.

1190
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:56,411
So one should get emotional
only after girls are raped?

1191
01:17:56,773 --> 01:18:00,653
What's the point of holding a candle
march after every-thing's over?

1192
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:04,619
After all these days, I don't know
what state I'll find Pyaari in.

1193
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:08,193
I don't even know if I'll ever
find her. Or if she'll be alive.

1194
01:18:08,484 --> 01:18:09,929
But that doesn't mean that...

1195
01:18:10,086 --> 01:18:13,693
...l forget about all these
girls like the rest of us.

1196
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:15,864
And that too after
being a police officer.

1197
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:18,237
You know what, Sir...

1198
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:22,403
The day our police force gets
emotional and works for these girls,

1199
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:25,106
...nobody will dare
to harm them.

1200
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:26,010
Enough, Shivani!

1201
01:18:26,636 --> 01:18:29,480
I agree that we have
arrested a drug dealer...

1202
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:31,977
...and drugs worth lakhs
because of you.

1203
01:18:32,608 --> 01:18:34,952
But now allow us
to take over from here.

1204
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:36,212
ls that clear?

1205
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:37,556
Sir, why us all the time?

1206
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,058
Shivani, please don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

1207
01:18:40,683 --> 01:18:41,991
I will see you soon in Mumbai.

1208
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:42,891
Thank you, Sir.

1209
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,739
- Since when do you drive an auto?
- What, Ma'am?

1210
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:29,306
I asked since when do you
drive an auto.

1211
01:19:29,398 --> 01:19:31,173
Past four or five years.

1212
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:33,943
- Can you see that guy there?
- Where?

1213
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:36,310
- There, the white building.
- Where Ma'am?

1214
01:19:57,627 --> 01:19:58,970
She escaped!

1215
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:33,865
Hello?

1216
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:36,200
Hello, I wanted to discuss an idea.

1217
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:38,002
About what, Miss Shivani?
The case is shut.

1218
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:40,380
- Hear me out.
- Okay.

1219
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:44,010
We share the smallest
details of our life...

1220
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:47,287
...with our girlfriend
boyfriend or spouse, right?

1221
01:20:47,777 --> 01:20:49,552
Yes, it's a natural human tendency.

1222
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:50,280
Correct!

1223
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:51,787
So Vakil will also
have someone like this.

1224
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:53,784
Nobody came to claim his body.

1225
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,494
Because of fear of interrogation.

1226
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:57,558
Tell me what's your point.

1227
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:00,391
Vakil must surely have someone.

1228
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:01,895
Maybe not a wife. But someone.

1229
01:21:02,658 --> 01:21:05,264
She will surely know
whom Vakil worked for.

1230
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,842
It seems possible.
But how will we find her?

1231
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:11,671
Whatever you found
on Vakil's body...

1232
01:21:11,834 --> 01:21:14,212
...gun, pant, shin,
wallet, anything.

1233
01:21:14,437 --> 01:21:15,177
Get everything.

1234
01:21:16,839 --> 01:21:18,147
We'll definitely find a clue.

1235
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,043
But Miss Shivani this is evidence.

1236
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:21,650
How can get it out of office?

1237
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,350
Sodhi, you said you would help.

1238
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:26,792
You will get me
in trouble Miss Shivani.

1239
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:30,654
I was so worried getting
these things out of office.

1240
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:34,291
Honestly whatever
we are doing is illegal.

1241
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:36,463
Always by the book.

1242
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:40,931
How will you arrest criminals
if you keep working by the law?

1243
01:21:41,764 --> 01:21:44,938
On a serious note, Ma'am, I can't
get involved in this any further.

1244
01:21:45,768 --> 01:21:48,681
I understand.
But what if we find something?

1245
01:21:48,871 --> 01:21:49,815
Please, Ma'am.

1246
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:53,219
Okay, okay. We'll cross
the bridge when we get there.

1247
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:56,049
What bridge? There's nothing here!

1248
01:22:03,886 --> 01:22:05,695
Modern Tailors, Chandani Chowk.

1249
01:22:07,723 --> 01:22:08,565
That's surprising.

1250
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:11,568
In an era of readymade,
this guy wore stitched clothes!

1251
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,068
Classic old school.

1252
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:16,635
Someone who stitches his trousers
and shirt form the same tailor...

1253
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:19,003
...is most likely to get
all his clothes stitched from him.

1254
01:22:19,068 --> 01:22:20,843
Where is Modern Tailors?

1255
01:22:20,903 --> 01:22:22,405
- Modern Tailors... Liyaqat Ali?
- Yes.

1256
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:25,075
Go straight and take a right.
First floor.

1257
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:26,776
- From here?
- Yes.

1258
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:28,582
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

1259
01:22:30,546 --> 01:22:34,289
I am a social worker.
I am attached with AIIMS.

1260
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:38,529
I wanted to enquire about Mr. Vakil.

1261
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,768
I know him for the past 23 years.

1262
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:45,434
Was this an accident
or some police case?

1263
01:22:45,928 --> 01:22:47,464
I don't know that.

1264
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:50,870
My job is to find out
if he has any relatives.

1265
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:55,312
I don't know of any relatives.

1266
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:58,608
But there is a lady with
whom he was acquainted with...

1267
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:00,176
...for the past many years.

1268
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:06,422
Minu Rastogi.
She was a prostitute in Paharganj.

1269
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:10,890
Mr. Vakil's acquaintance
with her was still strong.

1270
01:23:11,854 --> 01:23:14,357
Then she should
know about his death.

1271
01:23:14,623 --> 01:23:15,499
Where does she stay?

1272
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:19,337
- Where is D-40?
- The second house.

1273
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:22,904
Yes?

1274
01:23:23,232 --> 01:23:24,210
ls Minu Rastogi here?

1275
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:25,337
Who are you?

1276
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:28,079
Mumbai Police.
I want to speak with her.

1277
01:23:28,637 --> 01:23:29,274
Please come in.

1278
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:31,740
- Hello!
- Hello! Please have a seat.

1279
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:33,748
Harish...

1280
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:35,720
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Come here.

1281
01:23:42,151 --> 01:23:43,357
Get this medicine.

1282
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:45,794
Yes, Ma'am.

1283
01:23:46,155 --> 01:23:47,463
Please sit.

1284
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:51,001
- Sugar?
- One spoon.

1285
01:23:53,062 --> 01:23:54,063
I have diabetes.

1286
01:23:55,064 --> 01:23:57,408
My doctor has completely
banned sugar for me.

1287
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,510
You are young.

1288
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:03,342
- Here...
- Thank you.

1289
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:09,419
How did Mr. Vakil's
fame reach the Mumbai police?

1290
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:12,054
It's a long story.

1291
01:24:12,681 --> 01:24:15,321
I have a lot of time.

1292
01:24:17,253 --> 01:24:19,130
- Got the medicine?
- No, Ma'am.

1293
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:21,425
- Did you look properly?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1294
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:24,436
If I find it later,
you know I'll shoot you, right?

1295
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:25,195
Yes.

1296
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,907
I keep my servants on a tight leash.

1297
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:31,534
Go do your work.

1298
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:37,848
Actually...

1299
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:41,451
I hadn't sent Harish
to get medicine.

1300
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,857
I had sent him to see
if there are cops outside.

1301
01:24:46,682 --> 01:24:48,252
No, no, I have come alone.

1302
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:56,525
O God, strange are your ways!

1303
01:24:58,027 --> 01:25:01,201
The person my son is looking
for in the whole city...

1304
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:04,471
...is sitting right here in his
own house. And that too all alone!

1305
01:25:09,205 --> 01:25:13,676
That boy who calls you,
is my son. Karan.

1306
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:17,819
What do you call him?

1307
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:21,884
The kid.

1308
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:25,130
This is his house.

1309
01:25:27,323 --> 01:25:28,734
What's happening to you?

1310
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:30,367
Feeling dizzy?

1311
01:25:31,026 --> 01:25:35,065
Oh yeah... I put
sedatives in your tea.

1312
01:25:39,768 --> 01:25:42,339
Now you won't be capable
of doing anything.

1313
01:25:43,405 --> 01:25:47,012
And my Karan will
be back in some time.

1314
01:25:49,845 --> 01:25:51,791
You killed Vakil, right!

1315
01:25:54,183 --> 01:25:56,925
My Karan will torture you to death.

1316
01:26:00,222 --> 01:26:01,326
What fun it'll be!

1317
01:26:14,403 --> 01:26:16,508
Hello, Ma'am! How are you?

1318
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:22,879
Hey...

1319
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:27,683
I am Walt.

1320
01:26:30,219 --> 01:26:31,823
Actually my name is Karan.

1321
01:26:32,821 --> 01:26:34,960
But I have changed it to Walt.

1322
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:40,265
It's the name of the
hero in an English show.

1323
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,644
So you did keep your promise.

1324
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:46,709
You found me on the 27th day.

1325
01:26:47,403 --> 01:26:49,508
That's amazing.

1326
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:53,376
Congratulations!

1327
01:26:54,276 --> 01:26:57,052
I will keep my promise too.
I won't kill you.

1328
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:00,618
I'll just bring you to a state...

1329
01:27:00,682 --> 01:27:03,026
...where you'll beg me
to kill you.

1330
01:27:05,654 --> 01:27:06,655
You!

1331
01:27:26,808 --> 01:27:28,719
Mom, what's for lunch?

1332
01:27:33,315 --> 01:27:34,692
Are all the girls ready?

1333
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:37,826
Alka, you are on what's app again!

1334
01:27:38,187 --> 01:27:39,495
- Sorry, Ma'am.
- They will be here soon.

1335
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:41,329
I'll get them ready
in just five minutes.

1336
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:46,372
How many times have I told you
that don't doll them up like kids?

1337
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:50,707
Those rascals should see
their lovers in them not daughters.

1338
01:27:51,133 --> 01:27:52,908
Honey, please. Thank you.

1339
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:53,842
Open your mouth...

1340
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:56,048
Properly...

1341
01:27:57,706 --> 01:27:58,616
Good girl!

1342
01:28:03,846 --> 01:28:04,847
That's good.

1343
01:28:05,681 --> 01:28:07,957
And don't behave like a fool there.

1344
01:28:08,517 --> 01:28:09,689
Be sexy!

1345
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,127
Good girl!

1346
01:28:11,186 --> 01:28:12,961
Did you get what Ma'am is saying?

1347
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,926
No, no, don't tie her hair.

1348
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:18,631
Remove the pins. Quick. Quick.

1349
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:19,861
Thank you.

1350
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:21,936
Look at that.

1351
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,405
Aren't you looking ravishing now!

1352
01:28:27,703 --> 01:28:28,943
- Go put on your shoes.
- Be careful.

1353
01:28:29,004 --> 01:28:31,382
- And put on a smile.
- Keep it down.

1354
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:32,884
- Did you get that woman!
- Yes.

1355
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:34,112
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Very good.

1356
01:28:34,176 --> 01:28:35,416
She's very strong.

1357
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:37,987
- Look how she's still fighting.
- Wait!

1358
01:28:39,381 --> 01:28:40,689
Who is she?

1359
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:42,359
I don't know.

1360
01:28:43,118 --> 01:28:45,689
- Wait!
- Get back to work everybody!

1361
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:49,196
ls everyone ready?
Alka, anyone left?

1362
01:28:49,525 --> 01:28:50,833
No, Ma'am, all are ready.

1363
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:52,565
Should I take them downstairs?

1364
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:54,663
No, no! I am going
to perform here now.

1365
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:55,901
Everybody please wait and watch.

1366
01:28:56,365 --> 01:28:58,709
Come on. Get out and be ready.

1367
01:28:58,901 --> 01:29:00,574
- Off you go! Come on!
- Yes, go on.

1368
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,148
Come on. You foreigner, come on.

1369
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:03,278
Get out.

1370
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:07,176
- Look at her desperate attempts!
- Let her try!

1371
01:29:07,242 --> 01:29:08,550
She's not asking you.

1372
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:12,082
Julia, there's no movie
being shown here.

1373
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:13,921
Go.

1374
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:15,722
Go, or else I'll slap you! Go!

1375
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:16,422
Go!

1376
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:22,068
We still have to deck her up.
Get her out of the sack.

1377
01:29:22,157 --> 01:29:23,192
- Open it.
- Yes, Ma'am.

1378
01:29:24,893 --> 01:29:28,864
Ma'am, please co-operate.
Why are you fighting so much?

1379
01:29:29,398 --> 01:29:32,208
Hang on, hang on. There, it's open.

1380
01:29:32,768 --> 01:29:35,681
Hold it Madam. Cool down.

1381
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:36,743
Get lost!

1382
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:38,282
Listen girl!

1383
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:42,316
I have been doing this since
before you were even born!

1384
01:29:42,678 --> 01:29:45,022
I know exactly how to
tame the likes of you!

1385
01:29:45,614 --> 01:29:46,752
Just untie my hands and see...

1386
01:29:47,216 --> 01:29:51,062
...you won't have a tongue
left to speak or eyes to see!

1387
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:53,693
Hit her!
There's no use talking to her!

1388
01:29:54,089 --> 01:29:55,033
Don't hit the face.

- Aunty! Please!

Please, please! Let her go!
Let me meet her.

01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:06,510
Once, just once.

1394
01:30:06,968 --> 01:30:09,505
I'll do whatever you say.
Do my make-up.

Saw Mattu!
That's how you fix such dames!

1396
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:15,585
Get your make-up done.

Enough! Stop it!

Stop this emotional

Please come, Sir!

1413
01:31:29,217 --> 01:31:30,992
The whole arrangement
is especially for you.

1414
01:31:31,286 --> 01:31:31,991
Thank you.

1415
01:31:32,187 --> 01:31:33,222
Everything is ready, Sir.

Sir...

1417
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:35,991
Hi, good evening.

1418
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:38,293
Sir, when will Mr. Taneja come?

1419
01:31:38,727 --> 01:31:41,936
- He will come at his own time.
- Oh yes. Of course!

1420
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:43,301
You first show me your arrangements.

1421
01:31:43,398 --> 01:31:44,775
- Please come, Sir.
- Sir, your phone...

1422
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:48,075
Angie, baby, wait. Right
now he's just checking things out.

1423
01:31:48,437 --> 01:31:49,438
He'll come later.

1424
01:31:50,172 --> 01:31:50,707
Come, Sir.

1425
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:52,116
Security is very tight.

1426
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:54,250
It's for your benefit, Sir.

1427
01:31:54,576 --> 01:31:57,022
Only when there's no fear
of being photographed...

1428
01:31:57,579 --> 01:31:59,616
...can a person enjoy freely.

1429
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,488
Julia, come, baby.

1430
01:32:04,119 --> 01:32:06,725
Come, come, for Sir.

1431
01:32:07,322 --> 01:32:08,767
Don't be shy. Sir...

1432
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,410
Girls get abducted
in our cities for free...

1433
01:32:20,135 --> 01:32:21,045
In broad day light.

1434
01:32:23,438 --> 01:32:27,409
But when one guy sets up
a small organized business...

1435
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:29,081
...and everyone gets upset!

1436
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,188
Why did you do all of this?

1437
01:32:34,216 --> 01:32:35,251
What did you get?

1438
01:32:39,187 --> 01:32:41,793
You women get personal too soon.

1439
01:32:44,092 --> 01:32:47,403
I agree that you are a cop,
from the crime branch.

1440
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,940
But to obsessively chase
just one criminal?

1441
01:32:50,032 --> 01:32:52,012
What kind of professionalism
is this?

1442
01:32:53,168 --> 01:32:54,374
Where did you learn this?

1443
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,412
Nonsense.

1444
01:32:58,206 --> 01:33:04,816
That's why we men climb on top and
you women just stare at the ceiling.

1445
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:07,886
You know what I am saying,
Miss Shivani?

1446
01:33:11,353 --> 01:33:12,661
The night is young.

1447
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:15,667
Stare at the ceiling
and scream your lungs out.

1448
01:33:16,491 --> 01:33:17,526
Scream?

1449
01:33:23,231 --> 01:33:23,902
Scream.

1450
01:33:34,743 --> 01:33:35,721
That's right.

1451
01:33:37,579 --> 01:33:38,580
There's no point.

1452
01:33:43,418 --> 01:33:44,863
Crime branch!

1453
01:33:56,698 --> 01:33:57,574
Sir has come.

1454
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:05,109
Good evening, Sir. This is Mattu!

1455
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,478
- Welcome, Sir!
- God bless you.

1456
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:07,713
- How are you?
- All good.

1457
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:09,550
Everything's ready for you.

1458
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:13,158
Welcome, Sir!

1459
01:34:13,749 --> 01:34:15,558
- All well?
- With your blessings.

1460
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:17,057
- Please come, Sir.
- Tandon...

1461
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:18,324
Wait here.

1462
01:34:23,558 --> 01:34:24,263
Come, Sir.

1463
01:34:25,727 --> 01:34:26,637
Come, Sir.

1464
01:34:26,895 --> 01:34:29,068
Tandon, have you checked
everything personally?

1465
01:34:29,197 --> 01:34:30,039
Yes, Sir.

1466
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:32,407
You are bound to be happy
with the arrangements.

1467
01:34:34,969 --> 01:34:35,970
Come, Sir.

1468
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:38,708
- Everything's ready.
- This way, Sir.

1469
01:34:39,908 --> 01:34:41,012
Sir, to your left.

1470
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,155
The arrangements look great.

1471
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:54,590
Yes. You are the one who gave
us the opportunity to serve you.

1472
01:34:54,923 --> 01:34:57,301
There's a special gift
for you in the suite upstairs.

1473
01:34:57,559 --> 01:34:59,163
You should check it
out if you are in the mood.

1474
01:34:59,661 --> 01:35:00,696
Everybody knows.

1475
01:35:01,129 --> 01:35:03,200
Be it the opposition or women...

1476
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:05,938
...l am always in a mood to crush!

1477
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:10,539
Spoken like a true leader!
Brilliant, brilliant, I say!

1478
01:35:20,415 --> 01:35:21,120
Hello!

1479
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:24,761
I have heard a lot about you.

1480
01:35:27,422 --> 01:35:28,025
You?

1481
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:31,261
Yes, I am who you think I am.

1482
01:35:32,827 --> 01:35:35,034
Everybody has their own hobbies.

1483
01:35:35,697 --> 01:35:37,142
lam sure even you do.

1484
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:39,044
My hobby is this.

1485
01:35:40,435 --> 01:35:42,278
Have you really come to rape me?

1486
01:35:42,704 --> 01:35:45,241
I don't know how
one pretends to rape.

1487
01:35:45,707 --> 01:35:48,984
You fight with all your strength.
Only then it'll be fun.

1488
01:36:07,662 --> 01:36:08,732
You want to rape me!

1489
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:13,039
Get up! Come on!

1490
01:36:17,205 --> 01:36:18,377
Stop this party!

1491
01:36:18,673 --> 01:36:19,981
Get out!

1492
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:21,209
What is happening?

1493
01:36:21,543 --> 01:36:23,250
Walt, where the hell are you?

1494
01:36:23,478 --> 01:36:24,616
- Get out!
- What is going on, Mattu!

1495
01:36:24,746 --> 01:36:26,225
Where did she come from!

1496
01:36:26,681 --> 01:36:27,682
She has lost it!

1497
01:36:30,318 --> 01:36:33,891
Karan Rastogi, do you want
this minister alive or not?

1498
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:36,158
Tandon! Do something, Tandon!

1499
01:36:36,224 --> 01:36:36,964
Mattu, wait!

1500
01:36:37,559 --> 01:36:39,505
Karan, if anything happens to Sir...

1501
01:36:39,694 --> 01:36:42,197
...you and your mom
will die a miserable death.

1502
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:44,371
One second, Ma'am. What do you want?

1503
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:47,345
I want all the girls out.

1504
01:36:47,902 --> 01:36:49,779
What are you staring at, Alka?
Send all the girls out.

1505
01:36:50,038 --> 01:36:50,846
- Girls, go out.
- Come on!

1506
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:51,915
Mattu, are you dead!

1507
01:36:52,841 --> 01:36:54,718
Come on, Julia.
Angie, baby, hurry up. Scarlett, go.

1508
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:55,546
Hurry up!

1509
01:36:55,677 --> 01:36:56,587
Fast.

1510
01:36:57,212 --> 01:36:58,122
Fast, girls! Fast!

1511
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,356
Hurry up, Alka.

1512
01:37:00,348 --> 01:37:01,383
- Pyaari, wait.
- Au nty.

1513
01:37:02,217 --> 01:37:03,127
- Mattu!
- Yes?

1514
01:37:03,285 --> 01:37:05,231
Give the key of the
mobile locker to Pyaari.

1515
01:37:05,453 --> 01:37:06,625
Give her the damn key.

1516
01:37:10,725 --> 01:37:11,931
You got the girls.

1517
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:13,100
What else do you want?

1518
01:37:13,595 --> 01:37:14,198
You.

1519
01:37:14,796 --> 01:37:15,706
You will come with me.

1520
01:37:19,734 --> 01:37:21,236
Chill, Ma'am.
Chill. Chill, it's okay.

1521
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:23,111
- Step back. Step back.
- Help!

1522
01:37:23,471 --> 01:37:25,951
- Help!
- Raise your hands.

1523
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:30,949
Tell them that no one moves
from here till you get back.

1524
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:33,159
Nobody moves from here.
Tandon, keep him in check.

1525
01:37:33,415 --> 01:37:33,893
You wait.

1526
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:36,386
Everybody, we have got
a bit of a situation.

1527
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:37,826
lam going to son
it out and be right back.

1528
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:39,698
Raise your hands! Move!

1529
01:37:40,655 --> 01:37:41,429
Move!

1530
01:37:42,824 --> 01:37:43,427
Come on.

1531
01:37:45,894 --> 01:37:47,771
Move quickly! Look ahead.

1532
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,641
Damn! She has locked the door!

1533
01:37:54,569 --> 01:37:55,274
Come on quickly.

1534
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,213
Aunty, but the exit
is this side.

1535
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:58,381
We are not going out.

1536
01:37:59,107 --> 01:37:59,642
Open it!

1537
01:38:03,912 --> 01:38:05,983
Open! Get in.

1538
01:38:06,915 --> 01:38:08,986
Come on, girls. Get in.

1539
01:38:11,452 --> 01:38:12,089
Be there.

1540
01:38:14,589 --> 01:38:15,533
Pyaari, close the door.

1541
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:19,229
Lock the door. Lock it!

1542
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:31,713
- Okay, okay.
- Get in!

1543
01:38:32,173 --> 01:38:32,947
Get in!

1544
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:38,220
Not bad, Ma'am. Not bad at all.

1545
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:41,684
You guys think we cops
are morons, right?

1546
01:38:44,519 --> 01:38:45,725
But how did you manage to do this?

1547
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:48,664
When I got the address
to your place...

1548
01:38:49,157 --> 01:38:51,194
...l had no clue
that it is your house.

1549
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:55,207
- Where is D-40?
- Second from the front.

1550
01:38:55,496 --> 01:38:57,908
In crime branch we are trained to...

1551
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:02,271
...carefully scan a place
before entering.

1552
01:39:02,704 --> 01:39:06,083
- Does Minu Rastogi stay here?
- Yes, she does.

1553
01:39:08,076 --> 01:39:09,248
Who else stays with her?

1554
01:39:09,444 --> 01:39:11,446
Her son and a servant.

1555
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,058
How old is the son?

1556
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:14,692
Around 25-26.

1557
01:39:14,849 --> 01:39:18,729
I was wondering what to do next
when I heard a sound.

1558
01:39:21,222 --> 01:39:23,725
Maybe God was trying
to tell me something.

1559
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:27,363
I had heard this Azaan before.

1560
01:39:27,762 --> 01:39:28,706
But where?

1561
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:30,740
Then I remembered.

1562
01:39:31,266 --> 01:39:33,177
But you can't do any harm to me.

1563
01:39:33,868 --> 01:39:34,744
Because I am still alive.

1564
01:39:34,803 --> 01:39:36,544
And I am comfortably
sitting in my own house.

1565
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:43,256
That is the first time I wondered
if you are Minu Rastogi's son.

1566
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:46,621
But then who will take
a risk with you?

1567
01:39:46,948 --> 01:39:49,827
I began watching your house.

1568
01:39:50,251 --> 01:39:51,753
I spotted you the next day.

1569
01:39:52,386 --> 01:39:53,626
Although, I hadn't seen you before.

1570
01:39:55,724 --> 01:39:57,829
But one look at your sly face...

1571
01:39:58,326 --> 01:39:59,270
...and I knew it had to be you.

1572
01:39:59,961 --> 01:40:02,965
The first thing I did was
put a GPS tracker in your car.

1573
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:07,679
48 hours went by...

1574
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:14,743
...you didn't go to any
of your hostels or warehouses.

1575
01:40:15,543 --> 01:40:16,783
I wanted to reach Pyaari...

1576
01:40:17,078 --> 01:40:18,682
...and also the other girls.

1577
01:40:19,714 --> 01:40:22,752
Even if we did arrest you,
what could we charge you with?

1578
01:40:23,751 --> 01:40:26,357
That's when I decided that
there's no point wasting time.

1579
01:40:26,654 --> 01:40:28,361
Now you yourself
will take me to Pyaari.

1580
01:40:29,257 --> 01:40:32,568
I entered your house
but I was fully prepared.

1581
01:40:32,894 --> 01:40:35,101
I just had to make the move
at the right time.

1582
01:40:41,803 --> 01:40:43,680
Now I just need to inform Sodhi.

1583
01:40:44,005 --> 01:40:47,179
He'll track us on the GPS
and come here with the police unit.

1584
01:40:48,443 --> 01:40:50,423
Pyaari, get the phone.

1585
01:40:51,579 --> 01:40:53,456
And what if I would have
killed you right then?

1586
01:40:55,283 --> 01:40:57,092
I had to take that risk.

1587
01:40:58,753 --> 01:41:01,427
Like I said,
I knew your type.

1588
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:04,067
You wouldn't kill
me that easily.

1589
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:07,233
You would want to exploit me
like other women.

1590
01:41:09,230 --> 01:41:11,437
I must give it to you. But what now?

1591
01:41:11,633 --> 01:41:13,544
Sodhi, come.

1592
01:41:15,336 --> 01:41:18,783
The police will take at
least 25 minutes to get here.

1593
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:22,084
Your freedom lies behind that door.

1594
01:41:22,844 --> 01:41:26,382
And I am standing in
between you and your freedom.

1595
01:41:28,015 --> 01:41:29,688
Kill me and claim your freedom.

1596
01:41:32,453 --> 01:41:34,433
Women... women...

1597
01:41:36,157 --> 01:41:38,296
Take everything personally, right?

1598
01:41:39,227 --> 01:41:40,001
Come on.

1599
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:45,604
Let me see how far
on top a man can climb.

1600
01:41:46,701 --> 01:41:47,406
As you wish.

1601
01:42:09,657 --> 01:42:10,135
<i>Aunty!</i>

1602
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:21,642
Get up! Get up!

1603
01:42:58,673 --> 01:43:01,677
Hit me, Ma'am.
How much will you hit me?

1604
01:43:05,613 --> 01:43:09,891
You will me hit me a little
and then arrest me, right?

1605
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:14,723
You are forgetting one thing, Ma'am.

1606
01:43:16,824 --> 01:43:17,962
This is India.

1607
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:23,405
Over here,
if you have the right contacts...

1608
01:43:23,665 --> 01:43:26,908
...the biggest of scandals
can be buried.

1609
01:43:28,403 --> 01:43:30,405
This is trivial in comparison.

1610
01:43:31,639 --> 01:43:34,347
So till then you
hit me and have fun.

1611
01:43:35,376 --> 01:43:36,548
Hit me, Ma'am.

1612
01:43:37,578 --> 01:43:39,080
There is nothing else you can do.

1613
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:40,859
This is India.

1614
01:43:47,088 --> 01:43:49,227
This one thing you are right about.

1615
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:51,102
This is India.

1616
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:53,034
'This' is what goes on here.

1617
01:43:57,865 --> 01:44:01,711
These people sitting outside
will bury your crime?

1618
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:06,241
They can do it only if you
reach the police station.

1619
01:44:07,208 --> 01:44:11,054
But you won't reach the police
station because this is India.

1620
01:44:11,312 --> 01:44:14,521
Here, if you don't want
to bother the court too much...

1621
01:44:14,682 --> 01:44:16,753
...issues can be settled this way.

1622
01:44:20,321 --> 01:44:21,061
Get up!

1623
01:44:25,059 --> 01:44:27,266
Some people call it an 'Encounter'.

1624
01:44:28,763 --> 01:44:30,743
Some call it 'Teaching a lesson'.

1625
01:44:33,501 --> 01:44:34,343
Get up!

1626
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:46,019
Some also call it the 'Lokpal Bill'.

1627
01:44:49,183 --> 01:44:50,253
What's your plan?

1628
01:44:53,187 --> 01:44:54,359
Are you going to murder me?

1629
01:44:56,357 --> 01:44:57,927
In front of everyone?

1630
01:45:00,962 --> 01:45:02,134
This is India.

1631
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:05,366
In India, if 50 people
take the law in their hands...

1632
01:45:05,466 --> 01:45:08,310
...and kill someone, then
it's not called a murder.

1633
01:45:08,736 --> 01:45:10,477
It's called 'Public outrage'.

1634
01:45:24,018 --> 01:45:28,660
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1635
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:33,995
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1636
01:45:44,205 --> 01:45:48,847
From right now, never again
will I let you crush my pride

1637
01:45:49,210 --> 01:45:54,091
You can have my body slain
but you can't have my soul tied

1638
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:58,797
Touch my heart and I promise
you will mean the world to me

1639
01:45:58,986 --> 01:46:01,466
But if you ever mess with me

1640
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:04,093
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1641
01:46:06,594 --> 01:46:09,370
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1642
01:46:24,612 --> 01:46:29,493
If you think being a man gives you
the right to sell me like cattle

1643
01:46:29,683 --> 01:46:34,359
I will in that same place
destroy your entire race

1644
01:46:34,688 --> 01:46:39,034
Hold my hand and walk with me
and I will never leave your side

1645
01:46:39,493 --> 01:46:41,871
But if you ever mess with me

1646
01:46:41,962 --> 01:46:44,568
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1647
01:46:47,035 --> 01:46:49,777
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1648
01:47:04,785 --> 01:47:09,859
In a skin or a saree, at day
or at night I will not walk afraid

1649
01:47:10,091 --> 01:47:15,040
I won't lead a life
full of fear and regret

1650
01:47:20,201 --> 01:47:25,048
In a world where mothers and sisters
are not a blessing but a curse

1651
01:47:25,206 --> 01:47:30,053
I will break all shackles of rules
belonging to this world

1652
01:47:30,311 --> 01:47:34,885
Change the way you look at me and
I will shield you from the evil eye

1653
01:47:35,049 --> 01:47:37,427
But if you ever mess with me

1654
01:47:37,551 --> 01:47:40,361
I'll teach you a lesson
you won't forget

1655
01:47:46,828 --> 01:47:49,741
Walt died on his way
to the hospital.

1656
01:47:50,231 --> 01:47:53,701
Mattu became a prosecution witness.

1657
01:47:54,168 --> 01:47:57,445
He revealed everything about Walt,

1658
01:47:57,538 --> 01:47:59,916
Minu and Vakil along with
Tandon's involvement to the court.

1659
01:48:01,642 --> 01:48:04,213
First, the girls made up
Minu's face.

1660
01:48:04,645 --> 01:48:05,919
And then God did.

1661
01:48:06,180 --> 01:48:08,217
Minu later suffered
a paralysis attack.

1662
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:15,530
Taneja survived
and is now in Tiharjail.

1663
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:19,460
His scarred face is an
amusement to most in the jail.

1664
01:48:24,732 --> 01:48:28,680
Today, we could bring back
the smile on Pyaari's face.

1665
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:32,416
But there are many like Pyaari that
have to be rescued from this muck.

1666
01:48:32,807 --> 01:48:35,811
Many others like Karan Rastogi
who are still scat-free...

1667
01:48:36,110 --> 01:48:37,316
must be stopped.

1668
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:39,658
The Mardaani (Fighter)
that's hidden within...

1669
01:48:39,813 --> 01:48:42,555
has to be discovered by
every woman, every girl herself.

1670
01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:44,963
The war is still on.
