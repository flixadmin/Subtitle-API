1
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:13,265
- Hello to you.
- Hello to you.

2
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:14,967
I hope you're fine.

3
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:21,273
<i>Who knows
the electron wave functions</i>

4
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:24,143
for Kryptonian covalent bonding?

5
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:27,980
- Sorry.
- Leah.

6
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:31,250
<i>The cube root
of the wavelength...</i>

7
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:33,452
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

8
00:03:34,618 --> 00:03:36,255
- Hello, Kara.
- Hello to you.

9
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:48,400
'Oh, it is beautiful!'

10
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:50,202
What's that gonna be, Zaltar?

11
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:53,272
I think, a tree.

12
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:57,409
A tree. What is a tree?

13
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:59,945
A lovely thing
which grows on Earth.

14
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:02,314
Earth?
You mean, where my cousin went?

15
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:04,783
Hm, and to where,
one day soon perhaps

16
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,352
I might venture as well.

17
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:09,721
I don't believe you. How?

18
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,892
- In that. Through there.
- The binary chute?

19
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,694
But you could never survive
the pressure. It'd destroy--

20
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:18,330
In that I can.
Zip-zap and I'm gone.

21
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:20,099
But you'd never leave us, Zaltar.

22
00:04:20,197 --> 00:04:23,302
- <i>You'd never leave Argo City.</i>
- Indeed, I might, Kara.

23
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:25,337
Too much of a good thing here.

24
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:28,173
<i>Perhaps, I'll try Saturn instead.</i>

25
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:29,774
Yes, I think I might.

26
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:33,178
Saturn is...
Is that further away than Earth?

27
00:04:33,277 --> 00:04:34,213
Silly question.

28
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:35,314
Did you not study

29
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:36,715
six-dimensional geometry
at school?

30
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:38,550
Do they not teach you
anything anymore?

31
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:40,552
Well, of course they do, I...

32
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,722
I know the equations. Well...

33
00:04:46,156 --> 00:04:47,927
I just can't see 'em
in my head.

34
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:52,364
Most great artists find
mathematics troublesome, Kara.

35
00:04:52,462 --> 00:04:55,434
- Only use your imagination.
- Mm-hmm.

36
00:04:55,532 --> 00:04:57,970
Saturn and Earth
are in outer space

37
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:01,506
but we, we are in inner space.

38
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:04,376
Our city
has two great power sources.

39
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:06,411
This is one of them. Look.

40
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:14,719
An Omegahedron.

41
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,388
The Guardians let you have it?

42
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:18,257
Not exactly.

43
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:21,526
- I borrowed it.
- You stole it.

44
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,295
- Oh, Zaltar, they're gonna--
- No.

45
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:26,631
Borrowed it for the afternoon.

46
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,137
- For inspiration.
- Inspiration.

47
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:56,595
But I think that I shall
never see the branches

48
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:58,063
of a living tree.

49
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:01,633
Why? An Omegahedron
can create life, can't it?

50
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:03,635
It can't, child, it can't.

51
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:05,870
Just the illusion of life.

52
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:07,973
That's a fancy shadow
of the real thing

53
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:11,143
which is the most we can hope
for on this lonely old rock.

54
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,545
'Kara?'

55
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:15,614
Kara, I've been looking for you
for ages.

56
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:16,815
Well, I'm sorry, mother.

57
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:19,284
- Zaltar.
- Alura, join us.

58
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:22,154
We're just inventing miracles.

59
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,959
Put your fingers here, Kara,
and press hard.

60
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,062
Good. Now try it.

61
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:32,392
Let your imagination explode

62
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:34,394
and give it a try. Go on.

63
00:06:34,498 --> 00:06:37,136
Zaltar, m-my husband tells me

64
00:06:37,235 --> 00:06:41,206
you talk of leaving Argo City.
For where?

65
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:43,775
Parts unknown.
It is, alas, a fact.

66
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:45,177
'You and Zor-El
have a life here.'

67
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:47,012
'You have each other
and you have Kara.'

68
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:49,409
'But, Zaltar, you founded'

69
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:50,950
'this city. It's yours.'

70
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:54,786
As far as the eye can see,
right to the veil, smack.

71
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:57,056
And then what? What is beyond?

72
00:06:57,154 --> 00:07:00,259
'Alura, I cannot contain myself
to Argo City only.'

73
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:02,127
'My head is boiling with ideas.'

74
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:05,497
'My imagination is too vast,
it's uncontrollable.'

75
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:06,831
If you want my opinion, Zaltar

76
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,733
you're starting
to repeat yourself here

77
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:12,271
with all this airy,
glittery stuff.

78
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:15,740
Exactly.
That's why I'm going to Venus.

79
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:19,411
Venus? When?

80
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:22,747
Tomorrow or the next day,
at the latest.

81
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:25,150
'Zaltar,
have you thought about this?'

82
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,086
'It doesn't make sense to me.'

83
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:31,023
'I have thought intensely.
My mind is made up.'

84
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:22,307
Kara, the power source!

85
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:26,245
Oh, Zaltar!

86
00:08:26,343 --> 00:08:29,548
Save me! Please! Help!

87
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:32,451
- No!
- Kara!

88
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,955
Zaltar! Help!

89
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:37,589
No!

90
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:41,626
Are you okay, Kara?

91
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:52,704
- You took the Omegahedron.
- That's not correct.

92
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:54,473
I lost the Omegahedron.

93
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:56,208
- Oh, no, father, I did. I was--
- Shh, Kara.

94
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:57,676
No matter who.

95
00:08:57,774 --> 00:08:59,211
Without it,
this city can't survive

96
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,379
more than a few days.

97
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:01,513
Our lights will grow dim

98
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:03,648
and the very air we breathe
so thin.

99
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,717
I know. So I shall find it.

100
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:07,452
I shall go
right to the end of inner space

101
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:08,548
and I shall return it.

102
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:10,222
'Impossible. How?'

103
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,925
No one can leave Argo City
and you know it.

104
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:15,327
This is our universe and
you've destroyed it with a game.

105
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:19,831
- A childish game.
- I think it can be done.

106
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,103
Through there, the binary chute,
in the traveler...

107
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:56,401
Kara!

108
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:57,702
Kara, no!

109
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:16,288
- You lunatic!
- She'll be killed.

110
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:18,090
Oh, no, she won't.

111
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:21,126
She will be safe,
through the binary

112
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:23,428
through the warp,
into another register.

113
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:26,798
- Another what?
- Gravitational radiation.

114
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:30,669
A pathway
from inner space to outer space.

115
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:33,438
Then she'll never
be the same, ever.

116
00:10:33,537 --> 00:10:35,908
At least she'll be alive.

117
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:38,843
And my fate is sealed.

118
00:10:38,943 --> 00:10:41,641
I've lost the Omegahedron.

119
00:10:41,745 --> 00:10:44,349
I must be sent
to the Phantom Zone.

120
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:46,585
<i>Your suffering will be short.</i>

121
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:49,754
Mine...forever.

122
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:56,716
Some more champagne,
my dear Selena?

123
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:00,425
What are you thinking about?

124
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:06,231
It's such a pretty world.

125
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:11,270
I can't wait
until it's all mine.

126
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:13,072
The only way
you can rule the world

127
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:15,440
is to become invisible,
my pumpkin.

128
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:17,943
Invisible?

129
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,214
You'd almost know
how to make me invisible.

130
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:23,482
Oh, I do know.

131
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:25,050
'Take five black beans'

132
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,019
and the head of a dead man.

133
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:30,655
Place one bean in his mouth,
two beans in his eyes, then--

134
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:33,993
- Nigel, enough.
- But it works.

135
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:36,628
Then you can get anywhere,
do anything.

136
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:39,999
Nigel,
how long have we been together?

137
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:43,068
Ooh. Months, darling.

138
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,737
Then why does it seem
like<i> years?</i>

139
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:47,606
Because you're so impatient.

140
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:50,409
You want everything yesterday.

141
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:53,946
It takes a lifetime to discover
the secrets of black magic

142
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:56,281
from the ancient grimoires.

143
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:01,220
Holy cow!

144
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,347
I wonder...

145
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,192
Immortality be upon this one.

146
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:43,028
She is a sharer

147
00:13:43,127 --> 00:13:46,065
of the sun's everlasting life.

148
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:49,902
There will now be
no danger of death.

149
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,573
This world
will keep her forever.

150
00:13:56,474 --> 00:13:57,977
What is it?

151
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:00,045
What's going on?
Hey, what's going on?

152
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:03,048
I've just outgrown you, Nigel.

153
00:14:03,147 --> 00:14:04,950
These things happen.

154
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:07,319
You can't treat me like this,
Selena.

155
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:09,922
Without me, you'd still
be reading tea leaves

156
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:11,623
at Lake Tahoe.

157
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:18,730
'Amsterdam and more.
That's TWA.'

158
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:20,933
'Never has flying been easier.'

159
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:25,604
You can't run out on me, Selena.

160
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:28,373
I've got the keys, sweetheart.

161
00:14:28,472 --> 00:14:30,275
<i>...that Superman
has indeed embarked</i>

162
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:33,045
<i>on a special peace-seeking
mission to a galaxy</i>

163
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,613
<i>scientists estimate may be</i>

164
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:37,349
<i>several hundred trillion
light-years from our own...</i>

165
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:33,105
Oh.

166
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:24,957
Whoo-hoo!

167
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:36,601
Ah...

168
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:17,329
<i>Now here's the weather
from the general Chicago area.</i>

169
00:19:17,428 --> 00:19:20,232
<i>Increasing cloudiness
with a possibility of showers.</i>

170
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,834
<i>Breezy, but warm
with a high of 62.</i>

171
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:35,175
Bianca!

172
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:37,249
I'm home.

173
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:42,687
Bianca!

174
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:44,389
<i>What?</i>

175
00:19:45,422 --> 00:19:46,858
Show your face.

176
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,497
I have a surprise for you.

177
00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:00,805
<i>They've turned off
the hot water again.</i>

178
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:04,977
I'm really gonna have to kill
somebody down at the DWP.

179
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:07,412
I figure the only way that we're
gonna pay our bills next month

180
00:20:07,511 --> 00:20:09,982
in this dump is to just go ahead
and do what I said

181
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,483
which is to start our own coven.

182
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,214
No longer necessary.

183
00:20:14,318 --> 00:20:15,587
I was reading in this book,
you know

184
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:17,522
"The Witch's Guide
To Heaven And Hell"

185
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:19,891
and if you start your own coven,
all you have to do

186
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,861
is charge five bucks a head
minimal admission. That's great.

187
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,963
- Chicken feed.
- Ah!

188
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:25,264
That's better than goose egg.

189
00:20:25,362 --> 00:20:27,099
What's
in the Coffer of Shadow there?

190
00:20:27,197 --> 00:20:29,834
- Where's little Nigel?
- Nigel, my dear Bianca...

191
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:31,870
- Is history.
- Oh, yeah? How so?

192
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:35,640
The water department is history,
the car payments are history.

193
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:37,376
The mortgage payments
are history.

194
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:40,145
- How are the property taxes?
- History.

195
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:43,482
The world is at last my oyster.

196
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:51,443
Now, this I like.

197
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:54,579
- Hello.
- "Hello," she says.

198
00:22:54,678 --> 00:22:57,616
- Well, hello to you, honeybun.
- Hello.

199
00:22:57,715 --> 00:23:00,185
I was wondering
if you could tell me where I am.

200
00:23:00,284 --> 00:23:03,588
What do they call this place,
Eddie? Lovers' Lane, isn't it?

201
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:07,426
You got it in one, Billy boy.
Lovers' Lane.

202
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:09,861
Oh, no, you see,
what I meant was, is...

203
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,331
Well, those lights over there,
what are they called?

204
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,800
Check out the view
from back here, Eduardo.

205
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,768
Ah...

206
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:19,038
- Stop that!
- Hey.

207
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:22,942
You're, uh,
Superman's best friend, huh?

208
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,405
No. His cousin.

209
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,812
I've come here
to search for the Omegahedron.

210
00:23:27,912 --> 00:23:30,315
It's a power source
vital to Argo City.

211
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:31,450
'You see, that's where I live.'

212
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,185
No kidding.

213
00:23:34,218 --> 00:23:35,787
Eddie and me here

214
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:38,690
we're on a secret mission also.

215
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,393
We're out
looking for a good time.

216
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,997
And you just won
the brass ring, baby.

217
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:03,582
Ooh, she works out, huh?

218
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:05,317
Why are you doing this?

219
00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:08,220
It's just the way we are.

220
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:14,059
Oh, no. Billy...

221
00:24:15,692 --> 00:24:18,130
You shouldn't have
done that, baby.

222
00:24:21,065 --> 00:24:22,134
Come on.

223
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:31,576
Oh, I see.

224
00:24:31,675 --> 00:24:35,180
You really wanna play games,
eh, sweetheart?

225
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,516
Come on. Come...

226
00:24:44,388 --> 00:24:45,524
Huh?

227
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:48,693
Eddie...

228
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:51,330
I think maybe we should

229
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:53,732
kinda keep this to ourselves.

230
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:55,935
'What do you think?'

231
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:03,442
Freddie, you little devil,
how are you?

232
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:06,678
Fresh ammunition, everybody.

233
00:25:14,618 --> 00:25:17,189
Try telling your wife.

234
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:18,518
I need another one. Come on...

235
00:25:18,622 --> 00:25:20,659
Where is it?
Where's the little mystery ball?

236
00:25:20,757 --> 00:25:23,062
Just let me have a peek.
Maybe I can shed some light.

237
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,364
- I hate light.
- I mean, is it electrical?

238
00:25:25,463 --> 00:25:26,631
Is it hot to the touch?

239
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:29,334
- Where is it?
- Safe and sound.

240
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:31,870
Go mix. Leave me to my thoughts.

241
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:34,534
"Go mix?" With these people?
You must be mad.

242
00:25:34,638 --> 00:25:36,741
Who are they?
Wrinkly little wretches.

243
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,778
These are my foot soldiers,
Nigel.

244
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:42,542
My army of the night.

245
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:44,449
I'm considering nothing less

246
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:47,419
than world domination.

247
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:48,853
After you left me in the lurch,

248
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:51,123
I saw something
that should worry you greatly

249
00:25:51,222 --> 00:25:54,326
if you're serious
about taking over this planet.

250
00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:56,795
My secret was blue and red

251
00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:59,264
and it knew how to fly.

252
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:01,433
I have a secret, too, Nigel.

253
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:04,736
I have the power.

254
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:06,671
Now, get that through your head.

255
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,042
Oh, I bet
they're in for it now, eh?

256
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:11,676
Count on it.

257
00:26:16,112 --> 00:26:19,451
I have in my time
seen a great number of things

258
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:21,153
even more impressive

259
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:24,584
than a human cigarette lighter,
dear lady.

260
00:26:24,689 --> 00:26:26,458
To wit.

261
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:33,065
What is that?

262
00:26:34,365 --> 00:26:36,596
Overreaching ambition.

263
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:38,303
Take heed.

264
00:26:39,603 --> 00:26:42,274
Touched a little nerve,
didn't I?

265
00:26:44,241 --> 00:26:46,745
- Hello.
- Hello.

266
00:26:46,843 --> 00:26:49,814
The red toad that lurks
in the briars and brambles

267
00:26:49,914 --> 00:26:51,483
is full of sorceries.

268
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,118
There's a little bone
on the left side.

269
00:26:53,217 --> 00:26:54,920
- A little bone?
- A little bone.

270
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,355
'Which if bound to a man'

271
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:59,058
stirs up the greatest lust.

272
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:02,995
- I wanna be rich and famous.
- Then stick with me.

273
00:27:03,094 --> 00:27:06,331
I was put on this Earth
to thrill millions.

274
00:27:07,732 --> 00:27:09,629
Mm, this is scrumptious.

275
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:13,372
'Why don't we go somewhere else
and dance cheek to cheek?'

276
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:25,384
Stop it, Selena!
That's not fair!

277
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:26,919
'Pick on me.'

278
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:35,060
Oh.

279
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,062
- Thanks.
- Hey, no sweat.

280
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:40,332
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing much.

281
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:43,402
Get out of my house, Nigel

282
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,338
and don't come slithering back.

283
00:27:46,437 --> 00:27:48,873
I'm warning you, Selena

284
00:27:48,973 --> 00:27:51,076
don't be so shortsighted.

285
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:09,995
Good morning.

286
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,103
<i>Have you got it, Lucy?</i>

287
00:28:18,202 --> 00:28:19,804
<i>It must be near that oak tree.</i>

288
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:21,941
- <i>Hurry up!</i>
- Found it, guys.

289
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,242
<i>What are you doing in there?</i>

290
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:25,577
<i>You're supposed to find the ball.</i>

291
00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:32,117
<i>Come on, don't take all day.
You're holding up the game.</i>

292
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:36,221
- Hey, it's your turn to bat.
- Let's go! Let's go!

293
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,719
- Okay, okay. Let's play ball.
- Alright, batter!

294
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,503
I couldn't make it.
I have to finish my English...

295
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:13,858
<i>Hey, toss the ball back, will ya?</i>

296
00:29:13,957 --> 00:29:16,195
<i>Look at that. Whoo-whee!</i>

297
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,673
<i>Come on, make it two in a row!</i>

298
00:29:29,974 --> 00:29:31,276
Play ball.

299
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:53,398
- <i>Where have you been?</i>
- With the principal.

300
00:29:53,497 --> 00:29:55,234
Danvers is doing his usual number.

301
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:57,136
Geez, another barfy new student.

302
00:29:57,235 --> 00:30:00,039
They're really scraping the
bottom of the barrel these days.

303
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,642
Hang in there, Danvers.

304
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:05,544
Don't let 'em get to you.

305
00:30:05,643 --> 00:30:07,379
Thirty days.

306
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,808
Semester just started.

307
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:11,516
- And you'll be...
- Hello. I--

308
00:30:11,616 --> 00:30:13,318
Didn't knock.

309
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,220
Don't we teach you manners
around here?

310
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:17,156
'Don't we try to impress
on all our young ladies'

311
00:30:17,254 --> 00:30:19,024
that animals in the jungle
never knock

312
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:20,759
but Midvale girls always do?

313
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:22,361
Where are you going?
Come back here!

314
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:24,596
Come in.

315
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:27,699
I forgot.
I'm just not used to the--

316
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,534
Wait a minute.

317
00:30:29,634 --> 00:30:33,038
Wait just one second.

318
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:36,241
I have never before in my life
laid eyes on you.

319
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,777
- Have I, young lady?
- No, sir. I'm new here.

320
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:40,112
New here, well,
obviously, you're new here

321
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:42,247
if I've never laid eyes on you
before.

322
00:30:42,346 --> 00:30:45,284
The question remains,
just who on Earth are you?

323
00:30:46,618 --> 00:30:47,920
Um...

324
00:30:50,221 --> 00:30:53,125
On Earth, I'm Lee. Linda Lee.

325
00:30:53,224 --> 00:30:55,894
Where's your letter
of recommendation?

326
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:57,162
Letter?

327
00:30:57,261 --> 00:30:59,798
I must talk to you, principal.

328
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:02,134
- I am busy now.
- So are they.

329
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:04,904
Them, all the little monsters
you admit to the place.

330
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:07,639
'They have nailed
my desk drawers shut.'

331
00:31:07,737 --> 00:31:10,976
Never in all my years
as a school teacher...

332
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:13,478
- Come, Danvers.
- I will not be provoked.

333
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:15,847
I will not let him get to me
this semester.

334
00:31:15,947 --> 00:31:17,950
I'll be strong. Be strong.

335
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:19,651
Be like a rock.

336
00:31:33,297 --> 00:31:34,499
Now, what did you say
your name was?

337
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,800
O-oh, yes, yes, yes.

338
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,802
Linda Lee, huh?

339
00:31:37,902 --> 00:31:39,471
Yes, my cousin
probably wrote you.

340
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,507
Um, maybe you got his letter
under K for Kent

341
00:31:42,607 --> 00:31:43,875
in your files.

342
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:46,078
Kent? Kent?

343
00:31:48,045 --> 00:31:49,982
It doesn't ring any bells.

344
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,684
Doesn't even ring a...

345
00:31:54,886 --> 00:31:57,222
Well, here it is, big as life.

346
00:31:57,321 --> 00:31:58,991
'"My dear Mr. Danvers,
I'm writing on behalf'

347
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,393
of a very special young lady..."

348
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:03,295
An orphan?

349
00:32:03,394 --> 00:32:04,729
Well, don't expect
to be treated any differently

350
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:05,797
on that account, Ms. Lee.

351
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:07,466
Oh, no, sir, I won't.

352
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:09,368
One way or another,
we're all alone

353
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:13,005
on this miserable little planet.

354
00:32:13,104 --> 00:32:14,506
Yes, sir, I know.

355
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:16,208
Since your school records

356
00:32:16,306 --> 00:32:17,776
were obviously lost in the mail

357
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,311
you'll have to start
at the bottom.

358
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,113
It's only fair
to the other girls.

359
00:32:21,211 --> 00:32:23,515
You'll have English, Latin, math

360
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:25,317
biology, computing...

361
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:27,619
- All at once?
- And chemistry.

362
00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:30,422
Idle hands
are the devil's playground.

363
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:31,623
This way.

364
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:40,699
- Man on the floor!
- Man on the floor!

365
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,483
Open up, Lane.
Hm, I know you're in there.

366
00:33:00,018 --> 00:33:01,520
I'm not decent,
Mr. Danvers, sir.

367
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:04,556
And you never will be either,
you little liar.

368
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:10,029
Well, come on in. Come on in.
I haven't got all year.

369
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:13,132
Uh, no. I'm supposed to have
a single this term.

370
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,267
We don't always get
what we want, Ms. Lane.

371
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:17,802
Disappointments
thicken our skins.

372
00:33:17,902 --> 00:33:20,000
Who wants thick skin?

373
00:33:22,073 --> 00:33:23,508
I'm Linda Lee.

374
00:33:25,777 --> 00:33:29,348
- Hi.
- Oh. Hi.

375
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:32,918
- I'm Lucy Lane.
- Lucy Lee, this is Linda Lane.

376
00:33:33,017 --> 00:33:34,353
- No, it isn't.
- 'What?'

377
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:37,322
- She's Linda Lee and I'm--
- Lucy Lane.

378
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:39,091
You two know each other?

379
00:33:39,189 --> 00:33:41,021
Oh, no. We just met.

380
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,827
- When?
- Just now.

381
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:45,430
But we've known each other
for years. Haven't we, Linda?

382
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:46,531
Oh, well, gee, I don't think--

383
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,168
Oh, of course.
"The Daily Planet."

384
00:33:49,266 --> 00:33:51,436
Of course,
Linda's cousin works there.

385
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:53,705
A-and your sister,
what's her name

386
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:56,375
the one that's always calling me
and bothering me?

387
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:58,843
- Lois.
- Ah, yes. That's the one.

388
00:33:58,942 --> 00:34:02,747
Anyway, uh, show our new Ms. Lee
around, Ms. Lane.

389
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:06,485
Oh, by the way,
she's an orphan.

390
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:09,388
But don't let her play
on your sympathies, hm?

391
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,539
So who's your cousin?

392
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,807
Clark Kent.

393
00:34:30,274 --> 00:34:31,911
You're kidding me.

394
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:34,446
Clark Kent's your cousin?
You're putting me on.

395
00:34:34,545 --> 00:34:37,116
- Do you know him?
- Do I know him?

396
00:34:37,214 --> 00:34:38,517
Does my sister know him?

397
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:42,187
- Now, that's the big question.
- Oh, I see.

398
00:34:42,286 --> 00:34:44,056
I guess if they work
at the same newspaper

399
00:34:44,154 --> 00:34:45,490
they must know each other.

400
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:48,427
- Well...
- Is this where I'll sleep?

401
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:51,230
Well, this is your bed,
but we don't sleep around here.

402
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:53,765
Non-stop excitement
in this dorm.

403
00:34:55,565 --> 00:34:57,836
All the real dementals
are sent here.

404
00:34:59,237 --> 00:35:02,574
So when's the rest of your stuff
arriving?

405
00:35:02,673 --> 00:35:04,576
I don't have any other stuff.

406
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:06,778
What,
it's all in that little bag?

407
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:11,583
Oh, well, you see,
I have the means to buy more.

408
00:35:11,682 --> 00:35:14,719
It's just... Well, I just
haven't had the chance since...

409
00:35:31,002 --> 00:35:32,171
Do you know him?

410
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,240
Superman? Sure.

411
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:37,542
'My sister's got something going
with the big guy.'

412
00:35:37,641 --> 00:35:39,478
Hey, listen,
you can borrow any of my clothes

413
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:42,982
anytime you want.
Just dig in and help yourself.

414
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,517
Thank you. You're very kind.

415
00:35:47,385 --> 00:35:49,754
He's a real character.

416
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:52,091
A real hunk.

417
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,392
'I'll introduce you to him
someday'

418
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:55,760
'if we wind up getting along.'

419
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:03,068
Now, then, focus your tiny minds

420
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:06,906
on the kind of problems that
used to take w-weeks of thought

421
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:08,573
before the computer.

422
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:10,875
Even now it can take a long time

423
00:36:10,975 --> 00:36:13,145
without certain algorithms

424
00:36:13,244 --> 00:36:16,982
which,
if you behave for two seconds

425
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:19,084
I might reveal to you.

426
00:36:26,557 --> 00:36:30,162
Love. Hate. Love. Hate.

427
00:36:30,261 --> 00:36:33,732
Love. The cards have decided.

428
00:36:33,831 --> 00:36:37,802
People will do anything
for love.

429
00:36:37,902 --> 00:36:40,172
They'll jump off cliffs
for love.

430
00:36:40,271 --> 00:36:42,807
They'll drown themselves
like lemmings.

431
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:44,609
So...

432
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:48,713
...I'll make everybody love me.

433
00:36:48,813 --> 00:36:50,015
Oh, no chance.

434
00:36:50,113 --> 00:36:52,212
You're an awful person, honey,
remember? Forget it.

435
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:56,188
Use your imagination, pinhead.
That's what magic is all about.

436
00:36:59,924 --> 00:37:01,221
Why are we not moving?

437
00:37:01,325 --> 00:37:05,330
Because I'm in love.

438
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:08,700
<i>Come here, you beautiful thing.</i>

439
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:12,404
He's cute.

440
00:37:16,374 --> 00:37:18,110
Hey, what's going on?

441
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:22,614
<i>Here's an exercise in big
numbers I want you to try...</i>

442
00:37:22,712 --> 00:37:25,550
It's trying
to tell me something.

443
00:37:25,649 --> 00:37:27,852
Well, what?
That we're near danger?

444
00:37:27,947 --> 00:37:29,854
I don't know. How do I know?

445
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:38,463
- I know.
- Well, tell me.

446
00:37:38,563 --> 00:37:40,933
My prince has come.

447
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:43,302
'Oh, no.'

448
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,470
I saw him first, Selena.
That's not fair.

449
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:46,972
I copied his number first.

450
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:49,741
Well done.
Now, let's get out of here.

451
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:54,646
'You'll be given the average
size of a Chinese family.'

452
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:57,149
'Average age of death,
average age of marriage'

453
00:37:57,247 --> 00:37:58,750
'average age of pregnancy.'

454
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:01,820
'Use this equation to compute
the population of China'

455
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,588
in the year 2040.

456
00:38:03,688 --> 00:38:06,591
Linda, are you with us?

457
00:38:10,028 --> 00:38:10,963
Um...

458
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:14,566
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Oh, are you?

459
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:16,835
Where, might I ask?

460
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:19,905
W-well, here, sir.
On Earth, sir.

461
00:38:20,004 --> 00:38:22,607
How fortunate
for the rest of us.

462
00:38:22,706 --> 00:38:25,377
May I presume that whilst
you were staring at the wall

463
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:29,548
and not at your terminal, like
your other little friends here

464
00:38:29,647 --> 00:38:32,051
you were in fact hard at work

465
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,487
solving this little equation?

466
00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:37,923
Oh, yes, sir, I was.
I mean, I was--

467
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:41,321
Excellent. The answer, please.
Pay attention, class.

468
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:44,896
Ms. Lee
is about to enlighten us.

469
00:38:44,994 --> 00:38:47,299
Five-billion two-hundred-
and-seventy-one million

470
00:38:47,397 --> 00:38:48,433
nine thousand and ten.

471
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:57,309
Come on. Let's get out of here
before he makes you stay.

472
00:38:57,408 --> 00:38:58,710
'Come on. Hurry.'

473
00:39:04,782 --> 00:39:06,218
'Ms. Lee?'

474
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:08,387
- Oh, shit.
- Yes, sir?

475
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:11,090
Have you been going through
my papers?

476
00:39:11,188 --> 00:39:12,624
Of course not, sir.

477
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:14,593
Then how do you know
the correct answer?

478
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:16,962
- 'How?'
- I guess I just--

479
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,631
It's all this crazy weather
we've been having, sir.

480
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,201
'All the storms, shock waves,
electromagnetism.'

481
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,970
It makes people smarter
than they are for a second.

482
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:26,505
We gotta go, sir.

483
00:39:29,406 --> 00:39:31,176
Oh, boy. Thanks.
You know, I gotta learn--

484
00:39:31,275 --> 00:39:33,512
How'd you know the answer?

485
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,948
I don't know.
Six-dimensional geometry.

486
00:39:36,046 --> 00:39:38,083
- I never could do it before.
- Yeah.

487
00:39:38,182 --> 00:39:40,252
Well,
you want some friendly advice?

488
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,422
Don't go showing it off,
'cause nobody's gonna like you.

489
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,124
I'll see you later.

490
00:39:53,498 --> 00:39:54,499
Ah.

491
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:58,670
- Nice going.
- <i>Well, she can...</i>

492
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,239
Do you know
she tripped you on purpose?

493
00:40:00,338 --> 00:40:01,806
Absolutely.

494
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:04,009
She's retarded.

495
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,146
'Come on,
we don't have much time left.'

496
00:40:07,244 --> 00:40:09,848
'Come on, let's go.'

497
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:13,752
You take it, My.

498
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,821
Hey, Myra, see if you can
put Lane out for good.

499
00:40:20,558 --> 00:40:22,422
'Come on, team!'

500
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:33,672
'Are you guys alright?'

501
00:40:33,771 --> 00:40:35,274
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Are you alright?

502
00:40:35,372 --> 00:40:38,743
Hey, Myra, how did she do that?
It just hit her shoulder.

503
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:41,113
Hey, you guys,
did you see that cute guy

504
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:42,147
in the softball field?

505
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:43,882
'Oh, yes.'

506
00:40:43,981 --> 00:40:46,185
With the black hair
and the big muscles.

507
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:48,853
- He was something else.
- 'Did you talk to him?'

508
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:51,924
'No, but I'm gonna.'

509
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:54,994
'He's working on the trees.
He could be around for a while.'

510
00:40:57,962 --> 00:40:59,264
- Are they in?
- Yes.

511
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:06,138
'Myra, are you sure you wanna go
through with this?'

512
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,410
'Oh, boy,
I'm really gonna enjoy this.'

513
00:41:11,503 --> 00:41:13,745
'I can't wait
to hear them scream.'

514
00:41:13,844 --> 00:41:15,547
But, Myra,
why don't you shut off the hot

515
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,116
and give them an ice bath?

516
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:19,351
'Are you kidding?
That's nowheresville.'

517
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,620
If you shut off the cold,
you might scald them.

518
00:41:21,718 --> 00:41:25,224
So they lose a little skin.
Serves 'em right.

519
00:41:25,322 --> 00:41:27,226
'I want to see them suffer.'

520
00:41:29,294 --> 00:41:30,295
Ah!

521
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,870
- I'm wet!
- Oh!

522
00:41:40,137 --> 00:41:43,308
Myra, don't leave me.
Don't leave me.

523
00:41:45,776 --> 00:41:48,613
- I hate you!
- You never looked better!

524
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:50,215
We'll get you all!

525
00:41:57,454 --> 00:41:58,723
What do you think?

526
00:41:58,822 --> 00:42:01,626
It looks the same to me.
It's kind of dull.

527
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:06,365
All you need is a couple of
streaks and your ears pierced.

528
00:42:06,464 --> 00:42:08,633
I can do it for you
free of charge.

529
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:10,169
- My ears, what?
- Pierced.

530
00:42:10,268 --> 00:42:12,972
Like, you know, I take a needle,
and then I heat it up

531
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,374
and then I dab it
with some alcohol and zap

532
00:42:15,472 --> 00:42:17,537
all the guys go crazy.

533
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:19,811
Because I have holes
in my ears?

534
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,880
What, are you putting me on?

535
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:24,249
Sometimes I can't
figure you out, Linda.

536
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:28,988
So where are you going
this weekend?

537
00:42:29,087 --> 00:42:31,456
- 'Nowhere.'
- Nowhere?

538
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,524
Well,
you can't stay around here.

539
00:42:32,623 --> 00:42:34,226
This place is depressing.

540
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:36,061
'I mean, like the tombs.'

541
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,862
- Why?
- 'Why?'

542
00:42:37,962 --> 00:42:39,932
What, were you born yesterday?

543
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,401
This is a three-day weekend.

544
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:44,636
A three-day weekend.

545
00:42:44,735 --> 00:42:47,772
So, listen,
why don't you come home with me?

546
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:49,241
'I only live
about five miles from here'

547
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:52,511
and I got this guy
coming up from Metropolis.

548
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,679
I think he knows
your cousin Clark.

549
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:56,982
'His name's Jimmy Olsen.'

550
00:42:57,081 --> 00:42:59,184
'I think he's real stuck on me.'

551
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:03,822
Anyways, I could ask him
to bring a friend along.

552
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,226
- 'What are you doing?'
- Oh, nothing. Heh.

553
00:43:07,324 --> 00:43:09,028
'Nothing.'

554
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:11,630
No, I think I'm gonna
stay here and study.

555
00:43:11,729 --> 00:43:13,698
Get things organized.

556
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:17,369
Don't forget
to call me Saturday.

557
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,904
Just a sec.

558
00:43:20,404 --> 00:43:23,642
Hey, Linda, I'll see you later
at Popeye's then, okay?

559
00:43:23,741 --> 00:43:25,477
Alright, I'll try. I promise.

560
00:43:25,576 --> 00:43:26,912
You better.
It's gonna be fun.

561
00:43:27,011 --> 00:43:28,147
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

562
00:43:28,246 --> 00:43:30,015
Have a good time.

563
00:43:30,114 --> 00:43:32,351
'Come along now, Lucy.'

564
00:43:39,357 --> 00:43:42,127
'Get the dog in the car.'

565
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:47,126
"Take a spider off his web...

566
00:44:49,126 --> 00:44:53,032
"...and shut him up inside

567
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:56,936
"two shells of a nut.

568
00:44:58,635 --> 00:45:02,007
"Now, boil the nut in oil

569
00:45:02,106 --> 00:45:06,078
"into which has been added,
some of the web.

570
00:45:07,377 --> 00:45:09,614
"With a silver spoon

571
00:45:09,714 --> 00:45:14,653
"put two drops of the oil

572
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:18,523
into some water."

573
00:45:18,623 --> 00:45:19,925
Right.

574
00:45:20,024 --> 00:45:22,461
"He who drinks the water

575
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,066
"shall be in love
with the first person he sees.

576
00:45:27,164 --> 00:45:30,869
"So long as the spider
is shut up in the nutshell

577
00:45:30,968 --> 00:45:34,339
"or one day goes by

578
00:45:34,438 --> 00:45:36,608
whichever comes first."

579
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:38,710
Big deal. One day.

580
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:40,812
Why don't you just use,
you know...

581
00:45:40,911 --> 00:45:42,714
I'm saving it for bigger things.

582
00:45:42,813 --> 00:45:45,517
<i>Hiya, folks.
You're listening to big Sam</i>

583
00:45:45,616 --> 00:45:48,653
<i>the country-and-western voice
of the Chicago area.</i>

584
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:53,058
<i>Now to start off the hour,
something mellow and sweet...</i>

585
00:46:07,572 --> 00:46:10,009
Bianca, get the door!

586
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,079
Bianca!

587
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:22,021
You rang? Hey, you!

588
00:46:24,621 --> 00:46:27,759
I said, you rang?

589
00:46:27,859 --> 00:46:29,962
Oh, yeah. How you doin'?

590
00:46:31,595 --> 00:46:36,135
Uh... I'm lookin' for some person
called Mrs. Selena.

591
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:40,605
-<i> Madame</i> Selena.
- Ah.

592
00:46:40,705 --> 00:46:44,343
And you found her, lucky boy.

593
00:46:44,442 --> 00:46:45,377
<i>Entrer.</i>

594
00:46:49,446 --> 00:46:51,683
You must be very popular
in the neighborhood.

595
00:46:51,782 --> 00:46:54,186
I always see your truck
parked around.

596
00:46:54,285 --> 00:46:56,816
Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, I get
a lot of repeat business.

597
00:46:56,921 --> 00:46:58,958
Uh, people like my work.

598
00:46:59,057 --> 00:47:02,494
Yes, I'm sure they do.

599
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,732
- Wet your whistle?
- Huh?

600
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:11,136
Oh, yeah, yeah. As a matter
of fact, uh, don't mind if I do.

601
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:43,635
So, uh,
where's the lawn...at?

602
00:47:43,734 --> 00:47:46,605
- It dropped dead.
- Where at exactly? Out back?

603
00:47:46,703 --> 00:47:48,407
You know, I thought
we might get to know each other

604
00:47:48,505 --> 00:47:50,609
a little more before we, uh,
dig in

605
00:47:50,709 --> 00:47:54,346
and talk real turkey.

606
00:47:55,912 --> 00:47:58,878
Well, um, see, I'm kind
of a private person, you know?

607
00:47:58,983 --> 00:48:01,987
I mean,
I do my work, I go home.

608
00:48:02,086 --> 00:48:03,322
- To your wife?
- No.

609
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:04,924
At the present moment in time

610
00:48:05,022 --> 00:48:06,625
I'm currently enjoying
a single status

611
00:48:06,724 --> 00:48:07,759
in my personal life.

612
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:11,496
- Cheers.
- Bottoms up, huh?

613
00:48:11,596 --> 00:48:13,032
Bottoms up.

614
00:48:17,168 --> 00:48:18,703
I, uh, I noticed you got

615
00:48:18,802 --> 00:48:21,740
a pretty alkaline-lookin'
soil out there.

616
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,043
What I want are some

617
00:48:24,141 --> 00:48:27,908
house plants inside here.

618
00:48:28,012 --> 00:48:30,983
Something that goes well
with the house.

619
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:33,785
This is a house?

620
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:35,854
Of course it's a house.

621
00:48:35,953 --> 00:48:38,023
There's the bedroom
over there.

622
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:44,129
I think it's
getting dark in here.

623
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,767
You know,
what kind of plants

624
00:48:48,866 --> 00:48:52,137
are gonna wanna
grow in this dump?

625
00:48:53,738 --> 00:48:55,640
I don't know.

626
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,077
Shade plants?

627
00:48:58,175 --> 00:49:00,112
- To us.
- Hm?

628
00:49:00,211 --> 00:49:03,415
And to the seeds
we'll plant together.

629
00:49:03,513 --> 00:49:07,486
Yeah, I'll, uh,
I'll d-drink to that.

630
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:14,359
Mm. You probably killed him,
you know?

631
00:49:18,395 --> 00:49:21,033
Sleep well.

632
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:24,103
And when you wake,
drown in my eyes

633
00:49:24,202 --> 00:49:27,106
and be all mine.

634
00:49:29,206 --> 00:49:32,144
If that's the goddamn
Jehovah's witnesses again...

635
00:49:32,242 --> 00:49:34,346
I'll get it.

636
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,523
Oh, hello, Nigel. It's you.

637
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:46,758
Nice suit.

638
00:49:46,852 --> 00:49:49,761
- Subtle.
- I want to see Selena.

639
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,863
She's indisposed at the moment.

640
00:49:51,962 --> 00:49:55,367
'Whoever it is,
we don't want any.'

641
00:49:55,466 --> 00:49:57,998
It's Nigel,
and he's not going away

642
00:49:58,102 --> 00:50:00,205
until he talks to you.

643
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,575
What the devil do you want?

644
00:50:03,674 --> 00:50:06,178
I want to make
a very serious proposal.

645
00:50:06,277 --> 00:50:07,712
In that outfit?

646
00:50:08,879 --> 00:50:09,814
This is a leisure suit.

647
00:50:09,914 --> 00:50:11,011
I've got three days off

648
00:50:11,115 --> 00:50:12,517
from those little beasts
at Midvale

649
00:50:12,616 --> 00:50:14,786
and I intend
to let my hair down.

650
00:50:21,493 --> 00:50:23,262
Oh. Oh.

651
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:08,840
That ball will not operate
at its fullest

652
00:51:08,939 --> 00:51:12,611
until you internalize
your powers, Selena.

653
00:51:12,705 --> 00:51:15,247
Some mosaic invocations.

654
00:51:15,345 --> 00:51:17,016
- Some what?
- Come again?

655
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,251
Exactly. That's my point.

656
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:22,287
You girls are rank amateurs
playing with fire.

657
00:51:22,386 --> 00:51:25,790
Because we own the matches.

658
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:29,628
I, of all people,
know a hustle when I hear one.

659
00:51:29,728 --> 00:51:30,662
Goodbye, Nigel.

660
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:31,896
It was nice talking
to you, Nigel.

661
00:51:31,996 --> 00:51:33,332
No, it wasn't.

662
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:35,300
I hate to seem pushy

663
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:36,969
'my fairest of the fair,
but--'

664
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:38,570
A word of advice, Nigel.

665
00:51:38,669 --> 00:51:41,873
If I had your skin problems,
I'd stop bothering people

666
00:51:41,972 --> 00:51:45,177
put a bag over my head,
and go live under a bridge.

667
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:48,147
- 'Ouch!'
- Ha-ha-ha.

668
00:51:48,245 --> 00:51:50,349
There's nothing wrong
with my skin.

669
00:51:52,617 --> 00:51:54,386
That bitch.

670
00:51:56,821 --> 00:51:58,723
You know, some people.

671
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:02,694
Where is he?

672
00:52:02,794 --> 00:52:04,396
Where is he?

673
00:52:13,871 --> 00:52:16,441
Where is he?

674
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,810
Whoever he sees first,
he'll love with all his heart.

675
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:21,080
What, for a day, tops, right?

676
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,614
He was too young
for you anyway, you know?

677
00:52:22,713 --> 00:52:26,351
No, I do not know.
Where is he?

678
00:52:31,555 --> 00:52:34,659
'Hey, I know that guy.'

679
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,736
- Oh, the cable's out.
- What cable?

680
00:52:44,836 --> 00:52:46,738
This is a mirror.

681
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:51,343
So how come we could
ever see him in it?

682
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:56,176
That was magic, damn it.
The power.

683
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,883
Oh. So make it happen again,
you know?

684
00:52:58,978 --> 00:53:01,220
I can't make it happen again.

685
00:53:01,313 --> 00:53:02,787
I don't know how I did it
the first time.

686
00:53:02,886 --> 00:53:07,326
Oh. Maybe you should let that
thing out of its box, you know?

687
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:09,894
Maybe it's more powerful
if you let it out of its box.

688
00:53:09,994 --> 00:53:11,163
- The box.
- The box.

689
00:53:11,262 --> 00:53:13,132
- Where is it?
- The box?

690
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,866
It's underneath the rug
where you left it.

691
00:53:14,966 --> 00:53:15,935
Go ahead.

692
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:24,944
It's stuck.

693
00:53:29,046 --> 00:53:31,516
This is not my day.

694
00:53:31,615 --> 00:53:35,287
It's stuck?
How could it be stuck?

695
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,590
- It's growing.
- 'How could it be growing?'

696
00:53:38,689 --> 00:53:40,892
'It's made out of lead.'

697
00:53:52,469 --> 00:53:54,907
Oh, too bad there's no sound.

698
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,010
How come there's no sound?

699
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,913
Get off the road, turkey!

700
00:54:02,346 --> 00:54:04,449
Hey, dummy, you wanna die?

701
00:54:04,548 --> 00:54:06,485
'What are you smoking, stupid?'

702
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:08,687
'You wanna kill yourself?'

703
00:54:18,194 --> 00:54:20,565
'Anyway, she saw a lawyer,
and now she's gonna file.'

704
00:54:20,664 --> 00:54:23,868
I told her to take him
for every cent, clean him out.

705
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:25,804
- Thank you very much.
- 'You're welcome.'

706
00:54:25,904 --> 00:54:28,707
'BLT-10, hold the mayo.'

707
00:54:31,141 --> 00:54:33,778
Here you go, everybody.

708
00:54:33,877 --> 00:54:35,414
- 'Who wants onion rings?'
- 'Yeah, here.'

709
00:54:35,512 --> 00:54:36,781
- Thanks.
- 'Some French fries.'

710
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,117
'The French fries are mine.'

711
00:54:38,215 --> 00:54:40,019
Chicken for myself.

712
00:54:40,118 --> 00:54:41,486
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

713
00:54:41,585 --> 00:54:44,056
- 'Side order tomatoes.'
- Thanks for inviting me, Lucy.

714
00:54:44,154 --> 00:54:45,490
I'm glad you could come, Jimmy.

715
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:47,692
- 'You want a root beer?'
- 'Yeah, thanks.'

716
00:54:49,293 --> 00:54:50,729
Oh, there's Linda.

717
00:54:53,565 --> 00:54:55,434
Hey, Linda!

718
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:57,436
- 'Hi!'
- Well, hello.

719
00:54:57,534 --> 00:54:59,538
That's Clark Kent's cousin?

720
00:54:59,637 --> 00:55:01,907
- 'Who's Clark Kent?'
- 'Is that Linda?'

721
00:55:04,876 --> 00:55:06,278
- Guess what.
- What?

722
00:55:06,377 --> 00:55:07,307
There's this all-night party

723
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:08,347
tonight at Eddie's.

724
00:55:08,446 --> 00:55:10,182
He's the guy with the tattoo.

725
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:11,750
His folks are out of town.

726
00:55:11,848 --> 00:55:15,287
And the guy with the bow tie?
That's Jimmy.

727
00:55:15,386 --> 00:55:16,721
So you wanna come?

728
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,191
Oh, I don't know. I'm not
signed out for an overnight.

729
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:21,927
Well, so what? Go back, sign in
and climb out the window.

730
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:24,663
Mrs. Murphy's drunk
as a skunk by now.

731
00:55:24,762 --> 00:55:26,031
Totally on another planet.

732
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,600
Oh, I don't know.
It just doesn't seem right.

733
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,502
But that's why it'll be fun.

734
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:32,104
- Okay?
- Okay.

735
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:37,542
- Get off the road, buddy!
- Hey, stupid!

736
00:55:37,642 --> 00:55:39,611
Look at that dingleberry.

737
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,313
What's a dingleberry?

738
00:55:41,412 --> 00:55:44,883
Hey, you, space cadet!
Get outta the street!

739
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,955
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

740
00:55:50,054 --> 00:55:51,156
He's probably on drugs.

741
00:55:51,255 --> 00:55:53,758
And he's gonna get creamed
if he's not too careful.

742
00:55:53,857 --> 00:55:57,029
- Hi. Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
- Oh, I-I'm Kara.

743
00:55:57,128 --> 00:55:58,297
- <i>Who?</i>
- Who?

744
00:55:58,395 --> 00:56:01,500
Oh, I'm...c-concerned.

745
00:56:01,598 --> 00:56:03,268
Well,
that if we don't do something.

746
00:56:03,367 --> 00:56:05,737
Oh, yeah, you go out there,
and try to help a guy like that

747
00:56:05,836 --> 00:56:07,572
<i>and he's probably got
a gun or a knife.</i>

748
00:56:07,672 --> 00:56:10,075
You know, it's not too safe.

749
00:56:10,174 --> 00:56:12,144
Hey, I'm starving. Let's eat.

750
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,113
Come on, Linda.

751
00:56:18,182 --> 00:56:20,953
Power of Shadow...

752
00:56:22,486 --> 00:56:25,324
<i>Bring him...</i>

753
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,192
...to me.

754
00:57:00,424 --> 00:57:01,560
Whoa.

755
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,464
Whoa, whoa!

756
00:57:05,563 --> 00:57:08,000
Look at that.

757
00:57:13,637 --> 00:57:16,308
Hey, turkey, get out.

758
00:57:20,178 --> 00:57:22,481
'Look out. Watch out.'

759
00:57:32,756 --> 00:57:34,426
'My car!'

760
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:53,245
Oh!

761
00:58:41,092 --> 00:58:42,761
You've never seen
a tattoo before, Linda?

762
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,563
- 'Look!'
- 'What's that?'

763
00:58:44,661 --> 00:58:46,431
'I don't know, there's
somebody hanging out of it.'

764
00:58:49,667 --> 00:58:52,037
Oh, my God. It's a runaway!

765
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,211
- Somebody's gotta do something!
- Hey, what's she doing?

766
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:01,746
Lucy, be careful. Lucy!

767
00:59:02,881 --> 00:59:04,849
- 'Lucy!'
- 'Wait!'

768
00:59:12,923 --> 00:59:16,061
'Get the kids off the street!'

769
00:59:35,646 --> 00:59:38,383
'Get off the street!
Get off the street!'

770
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:12,384
'She's still in there.'

771
01:00:18,455 --> 01:00:22,227
- Oh, excuse me. I'm in a rush.
- I know the feeling.

772
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:28,767
Are you okay?

773
01:00:28,865 --> 01:00:32,237
'It's gasoline!
It's gasoline!'

774
01:01:13,277 --> 01:01:15,981
Hey! Look at that.

775
01:01:47,478 --> 01:01:49,214
A storm dragon?

776
01:01:50,615 --> 01:01:53,318
A super girl.

777
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,937
Oh, my God.

778
01:02:48,105 --> 01:02:52,044
Don't. Don't look at her.

779
01:02:58,382 --> 01:03:02,087
You're gonna be alright.
There's no broken bones.

780
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,395
I love you.

781
01:03:12,329 --> 01:03:13,793
What did he say?

782
01:03:13,898 --> 01:03:15,634
What did he say?

783
01:03:15,727 --> 01:03:17,536
Looked like
I love you to me.

784
01:03:17,635 --> 01:03:20,472
No! No!

785
01:03:21,505 --> 01:03:23,275
You love me?

786
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:26,979
With all my heart, forever.

787
01:03:27,077 --> 01:03:28,713
"A bird of free
and careless wing

788
01:03:28,812 --> 01:03:31,183
"was I through many
a smiling spring.

789
01:03:31,281 --> 01:03:32,851
"The cold repulse,

790
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:35,287
"the lightning of love's
angry glance, stay.

791
01:03:36,821 --> 01:03:38,690
Let me behold you."

792
01:03:53,605 --> 01:03:56,008
I-I have to go.

793
01:03:58,976 --> 01:04:01,046
Oh, I-I have to go.

794
01:04:03,747 --> 01:04:05,417
'We've got everything
under control.'

795
01:04:05,517 --> 01:04:06,551
Lucy!

796
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:08,848
'Just go on back to your homes.'

797
01:04:08,953 --> 01:04:10,655
Lucy.

798
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:12,992
- Oh.
- Thank God.

799
01:04:14,458 --> 01:04:17,529
- You alright?
- I think so.

800
01:04:17,629 --> 01:04:19,031
I hit my head.

801
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,699
Nigel must know her.

802
01:04:20,797 --> 01:04:23,969
She must be one of his students.
He must have put her up to it.

803
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:26,866
No. I don't think that at all.

804
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:28,974
Oh, she just happened
to be in the wrong place

805
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,976
at the wrong time, right?

806
01:04:31,075 --> 01:04:34,246
Materializing
in a bulldozer, huh?

807
01:04:34,345 --> 01:04:35,875
She's a wimpy little thing.

808
01:04:35,974 --> 01:04:37,983
I don't know why you care
what she does, anyway.

809
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:41,453
Because<i> nobody</i>
gets in my way.

810
01:04:41,552 --> 01:04:43,188
Why don't you just leave
this poor kid alone

811
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:45,157
and worry about
the other one that flies?

812
01:04:45,255 --> 01:04:49,328
I worry about everything.
It's my job. Stand back.

813
01:04:49,426 --> 01:04:52,932
Oh, come on, now.
She's just a teenager.

814
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:55,034
What good is a sword

815
01:04:55,132 --> 01:04:57,602
if it's not unleashed?

816
01:04:57,701 --> 01:05:00,572
But she's a total zero.
You don't even know her name.

817
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:04,343
The naming of names
is not necessary.

818
01:05:04,441 --> 01:05:07,512
Let us concentrate
on her face.

819
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:11,416
And my shadow
will do the rest.

820
01:05:11,516 --> 01:05:12,985
Your what?

821
01:05:13,084 --> 01:05:15,687
Power of Shadow...

822
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:18,657
...take shape.

823
01:05:18,757 --> 01:05:22,661
Look like a vicious dark star.

824
01:05:22,759 --> 01:05:26,865
Seek out that wretched
young creature.

825
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:30,635
And destroy her
wherever she...

826
01:05:32,837 --> 01:05:34,073
...are.

827
01:05:34,172 --> 01:05:35,807
Oh, God. That's awful.

828
01:05:35,907 --> 01:05:37,576
That's never gonna work.

829
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:54,759
Quiet, listen.

830
01:05:56,795 --> 01:05:59,398
Oh, my God! Oh!

831
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:01,100
Oh, I'm scared.

832
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:29,428
Next time...

833
01:06:29,526 --> 01:06:32,631
...remind me to
do this outside.

834
01:07:05,257 --> 01:07:07,732
- Absolutely not.
- Why? It's terrific.

835
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:18,363
Leave this place
and do no harm.

836
01:09:20,064 --> 01:09:22,201
There she is again.

837
01:09:23,935 --> 01:09:25,437
What'd she say?

838
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,206
No, this is not possible.

839
01:09:27,305 --> 01:09:29,808
This is not right.

840
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:31,710
Where's the wimp?

841
01:09:31,809 --> 01:09:32,912
Ah!

842
01:09:34,112 --> 01:09:35,447
Aah!

843
01:09:44,756 --> 01:09:45,925
Ah!

844
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:49,594
I think he can
take care of her.

845
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:13,852
See? Hee!

846
01:10:13,951 --> 01:10:15,654
What did I tell ya?

847
01:10:15,752 --> 01:10:18,390
- She quit, right?
- Wrong.

848
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:26,391
Every time!

849
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,160
Every time!

850
01:11:28,259 --> 01:11:32,292
Send a man to do a woman's job,
and that's what you get.

851
01:11:32,396 --> 01:11:36,135
Damn her eyes.
Who is she?

852
01:11:36,234 --> 01:11:37,402
Are you asking me?

853
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:39,838
I'm telling you.

854
01:11:39,937 --> 01:11:42,574
- Find out!
- Well, sure, but...

855
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:46,211
You know, I think
I recognize the costume.

856
01:11:46,309 --> 01:11:48,580
<i>It wasn't his fault.
It wasn't his fault!</i>

857
01:11:48,673 --> 01:11:50,215
<i>Well, then, who's fault was it?</i>

858
01:11:50,314 --> 01:11:52,312
<i>Leave him alone.
Let him play.</i>

859
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:54,286
Where have you been?

860
01:11:54,384 --> 01:11:56,989
- Outside--
- Look at you.

861
01:11:57,088 --> 01:11:58,357
Look at those clothes.

862
01:11:58,456 --> 01:11:59,891
Oh, I'll go change.
I-I'm sorry--

863
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:03,595
And you'll put on
your proper school uniform.

864
01:12:03,693 --> 01:12:05,931
And get out of that
ridiculous costume.

865
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,467
- Yes, ma'am.
- And cover your legs.

866
01:12:08,567 --> 01:12:10,135
Yes, ma'am.

867
01:12:10,234 --> 01:12:12,837
Don't you
"Yes, ma'am" me.

868
01:12:12,937 --> 01:12:14,506
No, ma'am.

869
01:12:14,605 --> 01:12:16,641
Cut that out!

870
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,243
I think you're blowing
this thing out of proportion

871
01:12:18,342 --> 01:12:19,611
if you want my opinion.

872
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:23,582
No, this box is definitely
getting bigger...

873
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:25,717
...and uglier.

874
01:12:25,816 --> 01:12:27,920
All I'm saying is
you can't go nuts

875
01:12:28,018 --> 01:12:30,956
over a landscape guy
and a teenager in a blue suit.

876
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:32,791
She flies.

877
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,027
Can you get that
through your thick skull

878
01:12:35,126 --> 01:12:38,030
and into your
tiny brain, Bianca?

879
01:12:38,129 --> 01:12:40,732
The girl can fly.

880
01:12:58,015 --> 01:12:59,318
Okay.

881
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:04,223
Now, let's get serious.

882
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:07,426
Come to mama.

883
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,262
'Oh.'

884
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:11,696
'Oh.'

885
01:13:14,031 --> 01:13:16,168
Oh! Whoa!

886
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,219
Selena, cut it out!

887
01:13:34,318 --> 01:13:36,721
I'm not doing it!

888
01:14:05,884 --> 01:14:08,020
I think we're venturing where...

889
01:14:08,118 --> 01:14:11,490
...you know, fools rush in
and angels fear to tread.

890
01:14:11,589 --> 01:14:14,626
I'm no angel.

891
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,111
It's the wimp again.

892
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,147
And she's trespassing.

893
01:15:26,664 --> 01:15:28,167
Hello.

894
01:15:28,266 --> 01:15:30,635
Oh, no. Not now.

895
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,972
'Tis only but me, my love.

896
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,074
Please, you'll let
everyone know.

897
01:15:35,173 --> 01:15:36,641
What? That I love you?

898
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:37,943
I'd shout it
from the highest hill.

899
01:15:38,042 --> 01:15:40,345
Please don't.

900
01:15:40,444 --> 01:15:42,814
I know you think me the fool,
but at least tell me your name.

901
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:44,616
Linda. Linda Lee.

902
01:15:44,716 --> 01:15:46,485
Linda.

903
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:49,288
Lovely Linda Lee.

904
01:15:49,387 --> 01:15:51,323
These roses pale beside thee.

905
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:55,427
Oh.

906
01:15:55,526 --> 01:15:56,761
Well, thank you, but I'm--

907
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:59,098
And sweet chocolates
for my sweet Linda.

908
01:16:00,665 --> 01:16:01,967
Hm.

909
01:16:11,342 --> 01:16:13,045
What're you doing?

910
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:15,915
Please?

911
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:19,484
Oh, no, I...

912
01:16:19,584 --> 01:16:20,752
Please?

913
01:16:20,851 --> 01:16:22,821
Well, alright.
But just for a minute.

914
01:16:36,567 --> 01:16:38,904
You hate me, don't you?

915
01:16:39,003 --> 01:16:41,640
Hate you?
I don't even know you.

916
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:43,675
I don't even know your name.

917
01:16:43,775 --> 01:16:45,477
Ethan.

918
01:16:45,576 --> 01:16:49,581
Say my name aloud but once,
and I shall die the happy fool.

919
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,816
- Look, Ethan--
- Huh!

920
01:16:54,285 --> 01:16:55,687
Ethan.

921
01:16:57,589 --> 01:16:58,857
Ethan.

922
01:17:00,357 --> 01:17:02,427
Her soft caress
did at once renew

923
01:17:02,526 --> 01:17:05,264
the beating
of his broken heart.

924
01:17:05,362 --> 01:17:07,332
Are you crazy?

925
01:17:10,201 --> 01:17:11,403
Marry me?

926
01:17:22,446 --> 01:17:24,249
Marry you, but...

927
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,618
- I don't--
- Don't say it. Don't, please.

928
01:17:26,718 --> 01:17:28,220
I know.

929
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,354
What?

930
01:17:30,454 --> 01:17:32,124
We're from different worlds.

931
01:17:32,221 --> 01:17:35,760
- You mean, you know where I'm--
- Just give me a chance, Linda.

932
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,697
Love makes everything possible.

933
01:17:38,796 --> 01:17:40,132
A poor, uneducated gardener

934
01:17:40,231 --> 01:17:42,334
can indeed worship
a rich debutante

935
01:17:42,433 --> 01:17:44,469
and make her happy,
if she'd just...

936
01:17:44,569 --> 01:17:46,666
Oh, Ethan.

937
01:17:46,771 --> 01:17:48,273
I'm not rich. I'm just--

938
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,976
Well, then
I'll support us both.

939
01:17:52,504 --> 01:17:54,379
You're nuts, you know that?

940
01:17:54,478 --> 01:17:58,150
You're so sweet,
but you're out of your mind.

941
01:17:59,651 --> 01:18:00,953
Over you.

942
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:11,863
What a touching scene.

943
01:18:41,892 --> 01:18:45,430
Round and round they go...

944
01:18:45,529 --> 01:18:48,467
...where they stop...

945
01:18:58,409 --> 01:19:02,147
Boy, you're really getting
the hang of this.

946
01:19:09,887 --> 01:19:11,456
Where is she?

947
01:19:15,326 --> 01:19:17,029
Jesus.

948
01:19:17,895 --> 01:19:20,132
Who are you?

949
01:19:20,231 --> 01:19:22,935
I am Selena.

950
01:19:23,034 --> 01:19:25,938
Diadanus of Catania,
priestess of Sekhnet.

951
01:19:26,036 --> 01:19:28,908
I am the ultimate Siren of Endor

952
01:19:29,006 --> 01:19:31,043
and you, little lady

953
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:35,614
are trespassing
on private property.

954
01:19:35,713 --> 01:19:37,549
She means him.

955
01:19:37,649 --> 01:19:39,718
I am Kara of Argo City.

956
01:19:39,818 --> 01:19:42,187
Daughter of Alura and Zor-El.

957
01:19:42,286 --> 01:19:44,889
And I don't scare easily.

958
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:48,460
- No?
- <i>No.</i>

959
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,929
Try...

960
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:53,298
...this.

961
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,852
This lady is improving my leaps
and bounds, I gotta tell ya.

962
01:21:18,448 --> 01:21:20,085
Whoa!

963
01:21:37,068 --> 01:21:38,370
You okay?

964
01:21:39,337 --> 01:21:40,439
No.

965
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,876
You want a hacksaw
or somethin'?

966
01:21:57,288 --> 01:22:01,393
Now I am really upset.

967
01:22:49,874 --> 01:22:51,343
What's going on?

968
01:22:52,543 --> 01:22:54,079
Whoa!

969
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:55,614
Put me down.

970
01:23:04,488 --> 01:23:06,125
- Where am I?
- You're safe.

971
01:23:06,223 --> 01:23:08,860
Safe? Where's Linda?

972
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,095
Put me down.

973
01:23:15,599 --> 01:23:17,502
- Where's my Linda?
- Take it easy.

974
01:23:25,643 --> 01:23:26,645
Ethan!

975
01:23:26,744 --> 01:23:28,647
Very clever.

976
01:23:28,746 --> 01:23:31,550
That oughta keep her out
of your hair for a few hours.

977
01:23:31,649 --> 01:23:32,817
Clever?

978
01:23:32,917 --> 01:23:34,686
A cheap trick.

979
01:23:38,556 --> 01:23:40,559
Power of Shadow

980
01:23:40,659 --> 01:23:44,429
bring him to me.

981
01:23:50,001 --> 01:23:54,773
Bring him to me.

982
01:23:57,475 --> 01:23:59,444
- Ugh!
- Didn't work, huh?

983
01:23:59,543 --> 01:24:01,146
Maybe they're too far away.

984
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,383
I can make the sky rain coconuts
with pinpoint accuracy

985
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:08,453
but I still can't control
men's minds.

986
01:24:09,253 --> 01:24:10,889
Not with her around.

987
01:24:10,988 --> 01:24:12,257
So maybe...

988
01:24:12,356 --> 01:24:14,193
Now, don't go through the roof.

989
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:16,161
But maybe we oughta back down

990
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:19,231
and give
old you-know-who a call.

991
01:24:20,064 --> 01:24:21,100
You know who?

992
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,302
- Spit it out.
- Nigel.

993
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,836
I shall pretend
you didn't say that.

994
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:26,371
But I did.

995
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,107
All I'm thinking,
and forgive me

996
01:24:28,206 --> 01:24:30,242
for thinking out of turn here

997
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,611
is that he is been around.

998
01:24:33,444 --> 01:24:35,580
He knows things, we don't.

999
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:37,950
'Plus, the way you wrap him
around your little finger'

1000
01:24:38,049 --> 01:24:40,119
'I'm always amazed.'

1001
01:25:19,819 --> 01:25:22,094
What's in it for me?

1002
01:25:22,193 --> 01:25:24,763
- Me.
- Ah-ha!

1003
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:27,632
My dear, Nigel,
the way to a woman's heart

1004
01:25:27,731 --> 01:25:30,335
is through the elimination
of her rivals.

1005
01:25:30,434 --> 01:25:32,471
- Murder. Are you proposing--
- Oh.

1006
01:25:32,569 --> 01:25:35,340
Certainly not.
Leave that to me.

1007
01:25:35,439 --> 01:25:38,911
You deliver the goods. Her.

1008
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:41,113
Her? How?

1009
01:25:41,212 --> 01:25:44,516
By getting me him.

1010
01:25:44,615 --> 01:25:47,486
- She'll follow.
- Well, I don't.

1011
01:25:47,585 --> 01:25:50,689
- Follow any of this, I mean...
- Put that down.

1012
01:25:53,423 --> 01:25:55,860
Nigel, I want one thing.

1013
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,397
Time to master my new toy.

1014
01:25:58,495 --> 01:26:01,533
'So we can rule the world?'

1015
01:26:01,633 --> 01:26:03,402
And you want him here?

1016
01:26:03,501 --> 01:26:05,270
Johnny Appleseed
in your living room?

1017
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,339
Yes. In the flesh.

1018
01:26:07,438 --> 01:26:11,143
So she will follow?
No other reason?

1019
01:26:11,242 --> 01:26:14,213
- None.
- You're sure of that?

1020
01:26:15,512 --> 01:26:17,449
'Oops, I'm sorry.'

1021
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:19,151
'The little spider got out.'

1022
01:26:20,352 --> 01:26:21,686
What?

1023
01:26:23,816 --> 01:26:25,257
Where am I?

1024
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:30,129
- Who are you?
- Kara.

1025
01:26:30,228 --> 01:26:31,530
Kara?

1026
01:26:33,363 --> 01:26:34,499
What happened?

1027
01:26:34,598 --> 01:26:37,402
You got hit on the head
by a coconut.

1028
01:26:37,501 --> 01:26:39,638
- Huh?
- Hm.

1029
01:26:39,737 --> 01:26:41,840
What's with
the Halloween costume?

1030
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:46,511
This is not a costume.
These are my clothes.

1031
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:49,781
- What do you mean?
- Look, I, I have to go now.

1032
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,350
I will come back
for you later, I promise.

1033
01:26:51,448 --> 01:26:53,352
I've just gotta get back
to the amusement park.

1034
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,820
Amusement park? Linda!

1035
01:26:57,621 --> 01:27:00,892
I gotta find Linda,
she was in trouble.

1036
01:27:00,992 --> 01:27:02,694
Oh, Linda's alright.

1037
01:27:02,794 --> 01:27:04,363
She can take care of herself.

1038
01:27:04,461 --> 01:27:05,664
'No, no, no. She can't.
Something's wrong.'

1039
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:08,228
She's in big trouble,
and I love her.

1040
01:27:08,861 --> 01:27:09,969
I love her.

1041
01:27:11,202 --> 01:27:13,805
Yeah, I do love her.

1042
01:27:16,673 --> 01:27:20,312
- I have to go, Ethan. Goodbye.
- Yeah, so do I.

1043
01:27:21,245 --> 01:27:22,242
Hey.

1044
01:27:27,684 --> 01:27:29,854
I told you,
Linda can take care of herself.

1045
01:27:29,953 --> 01:27:31,590
You just flew over my head,
didn't you? I saw you--

1046
01:27:31,688 --> 01:27:33,092
I'll go back there and I'll
take care of everything, so--

1047
01:27:33,190 --> 01:27:35,995
I said, you just flew over
my head. True or false?

1048
01:27:37,662 --> 01:27:38,697
True.

1049
01:27:39,564 --> 01:27:41,200
Like Superman.

1050
01:27:41,299 --> 01:27:42,567
He's my cousin.

1051
01:27:42,666 --> 01:27:44,703
He's your cousin?

1052
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:46,571
Yes. I shouldn't be
telling you this though.

1053
01:27:46,671 --> 01:27:48,107
- I'm here--
- Wait a minute.

1054
01:27:48,206 --> 01:27:49,508
Wait one minute. I mean,
you can do the whole number

1055
01:27:49,606 --> 01:27:50,875
leap tall buildings
with a single bound?

1056
01:27:50,975 --> 01:27:53,578
- And look right through things?
- Yes.

1057
01:27:53,677 --> 01:27:56,681
- Bend steel bars?
- Yes.

1058
01:27:56,781 --> 01:27:57,849
Whoa!

1059
01:27:59,449 --> 01:28:01,486
Oh, Selena.
I have to go. Selena has--

1060
01:28:01,585 --> 01:28:03,188
Wait a minute.
Please, take me with you.

1061
01:28:03,287 --> 01:28:04,924
I have to find Linda.

1062
01:28:06,724 --> 01:28:09,894
What is it?

1063
01:28:09,994 --> 01:28:11,496
The Burundi Wand.

1064
01:28:11,596 --> 01:28:14,566
Pure, unadulterated evil.

1065
01:28:15,933 --> 01:28:17,369
Ready?

1066
01:28:45,895 --> 01:28:49,268
But how can you love her?
You don't even know her.

1067
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:50,635
Oh, yeah, I do.

1068
01:28:50,734 --> 01:28:52,332
If she's in trouble,
then I got no business

1069
01:28:52,436 --> 01:28:54,639
standing here talking with you.

1070
01:28:54,738 --> 01:28:56,575
Even if you are
what you say you are.

1071
01:28:56,674 --> 01:28:58,710
Linda is not in trouble.

1072
01:28:58,808 --> 01:29:02,381
Look, uh, don't make me
get rough, okay?

1073
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,417
You wouldn't stand a chance.

1074
01:29:05,517 --> 01:29:07,419
Please trust me.

1075
01:29:07,519 --> 01:29:09,621
Linda is alright.

1076
01:29:10,888 --> 01:29:12,757
How do you know?

1077
01:29:12,857 --> 01:29:14,459
I just...

1078
01:29:15,827 --> 01:29:16,595
...know.

1079
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:30,409
Linda.

1080
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:42,955
Oh, my God!

1081
01:29:43,053 --> 01:29:44,489
How did you do that?

1082
01:29:49,994 --> 01:29:50,930
Ethan?

1083
01:29:53,832 --> 01:29:55,067
Ethan!

1084
01:29:58,202 --> 01:30:02,441
Nigel, you are wonderful.

1085
01:30:02,541 --> 01:30:04,977
Pure genius.

1086
01:30:06,243 --> 01:30:09,881
You deserve...me.

1087
01:30:33,170 --> 01:30:34,573
And something else.

1088
01:30:41,112 --> 01:30:44,749
Now, let's get out
of this dump.

1089
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:47,586
Hartley, you've seen this thing?

1090
01:30:47,685 --> 01:30:48,988
Look at this...

1091
01:30:49,086 --> 01:30:51,290
Hey, what's the matter?
You catchin' flies?

1092
01:30:51,389 --> 01:30:52,624
Lucy, look.

1093
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:57,629
Oh!

1094
01:30:57,729 --> 01:30:59,164
What is it?

1095
01:31:00,864 --> 01:31:03,402
It's a mountain, Lucy,
isn't it?

1096
01:31:03,501 --> 01:31:04,803
Tell me I'm not seeing things.

1097
01:31:04,901 --> 01:31:06,271
<i>How did it get there, Jimmy?</i>

1098
01:31:06,370 --> 01:31:08,040
<i>I don't know. It just appeared.</i>

1099
01:31:08,139 --> 01:31:10,775
<i>How can a mountain just appear?</i>

1100
01:31:10,875 --> 01:31:13,512
<i>Hey, there's something on the top.</i>

1101
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:15,414
<i>Looks like a castle.</i>

1102
01:31:15,507 --> 01:31:17,149
<i>Looks more like a fortress.</i>

1103
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:07,299
Ethan?

1104
01:32:14,606 --> 01:32:15,874
Ethan.

1105
01:32:47,572 --> 01:32:48,873
Ethan!

1106
01:33:16,528 --> 01:33:19,304
Enjoy your prison, Supergirl.

1107
01:33:20,571 --> 01:33:24,443
Forever and ever.

1108
01:33:27,812 --> 01:33:29,581
No, Ethan!

1109
01:33:29,681 --> 01:33:32,017
Don't do this!

1110
01:33:32,116 --> 01:33:33,352
'Ethan!'

1111
01:35:03,841 --> 01:35:07,446
Where am I?

1112
01:36:26,457 --> 01:36:28,928
Hey, you can't arrest me
without a warrant.

1113
01:36:30,427 --> 01:36:31,931
'I'm calling my lawyer.'

1114
01:36:40,237 --> 01:36:43,142
- Slow down.
- We want Selena out!

1115
01:36:44,475 --> 01:36:46,845
Smile, lunkhead.
You're not a gardener anymore.

1116
01:36:46,944 --> 01:36:48,413
You're Prince Ethan, now.

1117
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:50,882
Are we gonna stand up to her
or not?

1118
01:36:50,982 --> 01:36:53,118
- 'Yeah. Yeah.'
- Selena must go!

1119
01:36:53,217 --> 01:36:55,087
Who's this little twerpette?

1120
01:36:55,186 --> 01:36:56,688
She's someone
who believes in freedom.

1121
01:36:56,786 --> 01:36:58,991
Uh, Lucy, it's not a good time
to express yourself.

1122
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:00,759
'I don't know who you
think you are'

1123
01:37:00,858 --> 01:37:02,594
or what evil force you represent

1124
01:37:02,693 --> 01:37:04,796
but if you think you can just
get rid of anybody

1125
01:37:04,889 --> 01:37:07,799
who stands up to you,
just make them disappear

1126
01:37:07,899 --> 01:37:09,768
like my friend, Linda...

1127
01:37:09,868 --> 01:37:11,831
- Who?
- Linda, my roommate.

1128
01:37:11,930 --> 01:37:14,206
She disappeared the day
that mountain showed up.

1129
01:37:16,273 --> 01:37:18,377
- The wimp.
- The wimp.

1130
01:37:20,344 --> 01:37:21,513
Seize them!

1131
01:37:25,649 --> 01:37:27,186
'Drive off.'

1132
01:37:27,284 --> 01:37:28,820
Let me go now!

1133
01:37:28,913 --> 01:37:31,123
Nobody messes around
with Jimmy Olsen!

1134
01:37:31,221 --> 01:37:33,358
Now, let-let go off me.
I'm with the press!

1135
01:38:48,699 --> 01:38:51,603
- Zaltar!
- Squirt.

1136
01:38:54,072 --> 01:38:57,042
- Zaltar?
- Squirt.

1137
01:38:58,842 --> 01:39:01,680
Zaltar, it's me.
It's-it's Kara.

1138
01:39:01,779 --> 01:39:03,048
I know.

1139
01:39:05,483 --> 01:39:06,551
Squirt.

1140
01:39:12,123 --> 01:39:13,725
What is that?

1141
01:39:15,025 --> 01:39:18,063
- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

1142
01:39:20,898 --> 01:39:22,701
The Phantom Zone?

1143
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,704
It's lonely here, my Kara.

1144
01:39:26,504 --> 01:39:27,739
So sad.

1145
01:39:30,407 --> 01:39:34,379
I've been here forever,
and I shall stay here forever.

1146
01:39:36,847 --> 01:39:38,583
- Ethan?
- Yes, my darling.

1147
01:39:38,682 --> 01:39:41,520
Don't call me your darling.
You despise me.

1148
01:39:41,618 --> 01:39:44,789
- Get me the Coffer of Shadow.
- Yes, my darling.

1149
01:39:44,889 --> 01:39:46,125
Now...

1150
01:39:47,458 --> 01:39:51,430
I think we need something...

1151
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:54,166
<i>...there.</i>

1152
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:01,073
Oh, Jimmy.

1153
01:40:01,872 --> 01:40:03,375
Oh, terrific.

1154
01:40:03,474 --> 01:40:06,946
The old
dangling-in-a-cage routine.

1155
01:40:07,045 --> 01:40:09,148
Pathetic, Selena.

1156
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:13,552
- Who's that guy?
- He's my math teacher, I think.

1157
01:40:13,651 --> 01:40:15,921
'What are they for?'

1158
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:17,622
Insurance.

1159
01:40:23,394 --> 01:40:25,097
But you can't just give up.

1160
01:40:25,196 --> 01:40:27,166
You founded a whole city.

1161
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:30,235
I did, and then
I doomed it to destruction.

1162
01:40:30,334 --> 01:40:33,005
That was an error. A tragic one.

1163
01:40:33,103 --> 01:40:36,475
When you're my age and you make
as many tragic errors as I do

1164
01:40:36,573 --> 01:40:39,111
it is a different tune
that you will sing.

1165
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:41,313
I will not.
I will never give up.

1166
01:40:41,412 --> 01:40:43,648
I will never spend my entire
life in a place like this.

1167
01:40:43,747 --> 01:40:46,518
- I would die first!
- Strong words.

1168
01:40:46,617 --> 01:40:50,555
There are worst things than
dying, and I deserve every one.

1169
01:41:07,404 --> 01:41:10,375
- What is this?
- A horse.

1170
01:41:10,475 --> 01:41:12,144
I think.

1171
01:41:12,243 --> 01:41:16,515
On Earth, I think
it's called a horse.

1172
01:41:16,613 --> 01:41:19,584
- And you made this here?
- Mm.

1173
01:41:21,685 --> 01:41:24,456
- Then you haven't given up.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1174
01:41:24,555 --> 01:41:26,992
Earth, Zaltar.
Earth, a tree, a horse.

1175
01:41:27,091 --> 01:41:28,593
You keep making things
from Earth.

1176
01:41:28,692 --> 01:41:31,030
- The place intrigues me.
- Well, then, let's go there.

1177
01:41:31,129 --> 01:41:32,697
Certainly.
When is the next train?

1178
01:41:32,797 --> 01:41:33,732
Oh!

1179
01:41:34,966 --> 01:41:36,001
What is a train?

1180
01:41:39,136 --> 01:41:40,739
What's so funny?

1181
01:41:40,838 --> 01:41:42,274
Don't laugh at me, Zaltar.

1182
01:41:42,373 --> 01:41:45,744
I, I'm only laughing at myself.

1183
01:41:45,843 --> 01:41:47,679
For you...

1184
01:41:47,778 --> 01:41:49,881
...I weep.

1185
01:41:49,981 --> 01:41:51,883
Is this train
a way out of here?

1186
01:41:51,983 --> 01:41:54,586
There is no way out of here.

1187
01:41:54,685 --> 01:41:57,722
That is the point
of the Phantom Zone.

1188
01:41:57,821 --> 01:41:59,624
My neighbors know,
the criminals

1189
01:41:59,723 --> 01:42:02,094
the corrupt,
the evil, they're here.

1190
01:42:02,193 --> 01:42:03,963
Over the hill there.

1191
01:42:04,062 --> 01:42:06,565
With no way out.

1192
01:42:06,664 --> 01:42:09,902
But there's always a way out.

1193
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,172
'If there's a way in,
there's a way out.'

1194
01:42:16,073 --> 01:42:17,676
There is a way.

1195
01:42:19,171 --> 01:42:21,713
- But it's impossible.
- Why?

1196
01:42:21,813 --> 01:42:23,815
'No, it wouldn't work.'

1197
01:42:23,914 --> 01:42:26,085
'You'll be swept into a
singularity if it didn't work.'

1198
01:42:26,183 --> 01:42:27,486
No.

1199
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:29,922
Forget I mentioned it.
Have a squirt instead.

1200
01:42:35,325 --> 01:42:37,429
I could do it.

1201
01:42:39,863 --> 01:42:42,434
Then, please.
At least teach me how.

1202
01:42:42,533 --> 01:42:44,203
There's nothing to teach.

1203
01:42:44,301 --> 01:42:46,738
You can't, as they say,
practice at the rift.

1204
01:42:46,838 --> 01:42:49,808
You get one chance only.

1205
01:42:49,906 --> 01:42:53,412
- The rift?
- Sure, you won't have a squirt?

1206
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:56,615
'Once you get used to it,
I think it's delicious.'

1207
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,257
You're right.

1208
01:43:05,356 --> 01:43:07,960
You are absolutely right.

1209
01:43:10,828 --> 01:43:14,299
There is enough doom and gloom
in the air already.

1210
01:43:14,398 --> 01:43:16,601
And it is better
to accept defeat

1211
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:19,471
than to take a chance and try
like fools to redeem ourselves

1212
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:21,806
and save our city
and all those who we love there.

1213
01:43:21,905 --> 01:43:24,443
Plus, all the people on Earth
that this wicked sorceress

1214
01:43:24,541 --> 01:43:26,711
is going to make suffer
just because of us.

1215
01:43:26,811 --> 01:43:28,247
Cheers!

1216
01:43:32,149 --> 01:43:34,519
We could die trying.

1217
01:43:34,618 --> 01:43:37,156
But we won't.

1218
01:43:37,254 --> 01:43:39,524
We won't. Come on.

1219
01:44:07,351 --> 01:44:09,354
'Tomorrow.'

1220
01:44:09,453 --> 01:44:12,424
Thursday. Friday.

1221
01:44:12,523 --> 01:44:14,393
Just like here,
we go for the cops first, right?

1222
01:44:14,492 --> 01:44:16,761
Hm, and the army.

1223
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:19,965
By Saturday, we have
the continental United States

1224
01:44:20,064 --> 01:44:22,001
Mexico, Canada.

1225
01:44:25,664 --> 01:44:28,473
'Oh, my God, Selena.
It's the box.'

1226
01:44:28,572 --> 01:44:31,143
- Hush it up!
- No.

1227
01:44:31,242 --> 01:44:33,273
What the box wants...

1228
01:44:33,377 --> 01:44:35,647
...the box gets.

1229
01:44:51,395 --> 01:44:55,034
- What is it?
- Fascinating.

1230
01:44:57,501 --> 01:44:59,038
I don't know.

1231
01:45:00,837 --> 01:45:02,074
Is this it?

1232
01:45:02,173 --> 01:45:03,442
Is this the way out?

1233
01:45:03,541 --> 01:45:04,743
Not yet!

1234
01:45:04,842 --> 01:45:07,947
This is the Quantum Vortex!

1235
01:45:08,046 --> 01:45:11,483
We must risk our destruction
in it.

1236
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:13,552
To move mountains...

1237
01:45:13,652 --> 01:45:15,720
...you must make sacrifices.

1238
01:45:15,819 --> 01:45:18,123
Zaltar, I'm scared!

1239
01:45:18,222 --> 01:45:20,525
Accept your fears.

1240
01:45:21,325 --> 01:45:23,462
Confront your demons.

1241
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:27,366
Find your destiny
in the maelstrom!

1242
01:46:17,614 --> 01:46:20,119
Zaltar, I can't. I can't.

1243
01:46:20,217 --> 01:46:23,383
You...can!

1244
01:46:48,012 --> 01:46:50,410
Two specks. Look!

1245
01:46:56,587 --> 01:46:58,890
What do I do?

1246
01:46:58,989 --> 01:47:02,627
How do you murder someone
in the Phantom Zone?

1247
01:47:06,596 --> 01:47:09,429
She's with some old guy,
it looks like.

1248
01:47:09,534 --> 01:47:12,271
Move, huh? Come on!

1249
01:47:12,370 --> 01:47:14,434
Calm down, okay?

1250
01:47:14,539 --> 01:47:15,640
Ah.

1251
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:18,710
This is what I want.

1252
01:47:19,510 --> 01:47:22,414
The Salian Fireballs.

1253
01:47:22,514 --> 01:47:24,416
'"Page 321"'

1254
01:47:24,516 --> 01:47:26,585
'"chapter 6."'

1255
01:47:41,499 --> 01:47:42,767
Whoa!

1256
01:47:43,968 --> 01:47:46,638
- What was that?
- I don't...

1257
01:47:49,101 --> 01:47:50,910
- Aah!
- No!

1258
01:47:51,008 --> 01:47:52,377
No!

1259
01:48:01,586 --> 01:48:02,887
'No!'

1260
01:48:18,735 --> 01:48:20,572
"Power Of Rainmaking." No!

1261
01:48:20,671 --> 01:48:22,074
"How To Separate
Husband And Wife."

1262
01:48:22,167 --> 01:48:23,742
No, not now. Not now!

1263
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,577
Well, you better find
something fast

1264
01:48:25,677 --> 01:48:27,346
like an atom bomb.

1265
01:48:39,223 --> 01:48:40,825
I found it.

1266
01:48:41,793 --> 01:48:43,562
"Summoning...

1267
01:48:43,661 --> 01:48:47,066
...the demon storm."

1268
01:48:47,164 --> 01:48:49,268
We go.

1269
01:48:49,366 --> 01:48:53,005
Higher, girl! Higher!

1270
01:48:53,103 --> 01:48:54,339
Come with me!

1271
01:48:54,439 --> 01:48:57,042
I am with you!

1272
01:48:57,141 --> 01:48:58,510
On, girl.

1273
01:49:11,421 --> 01:49:13,325
I am with you.

1274
01:49:17,328 --> 01:49:18,998
Zaltar!

1275
01:50:12,416 --> 01:50:13,785
Oh, thank God!

1276
01:50:17,254 --> 01:50:20,926
You've had your fun, Selena.
The game is finished.

1277
01:50:21,025 --> 01:50:22,361
Hardly.

1278
01:50:22,459 --> 01:50:25,464
One false step, bluebird

1279
01:50:25,563 --> 01:50:30,002
and even if you don't,
your friends will get the point.

1280
01:50:32,671 --> 01:50:33,705
Hey, no!

1281
01:50:41,512 --> 01:50:43,048
I don't like this.

1282
01:50:43,147 --> 01:50:45,717
Don't worry, Lucy.
Don't worry.

1283
01:50:47,484 --> 01:50:49,454
I wouldn't if I were you.

1284
01:50:49,553 --> 01:50:51,991
Well, you're<i> not</i> me.

1285
01:51:00,463 --> 01:51:02,902
Quick, get out of the way.
Into the alcove over there.

1286
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,303
- Come on.
- Hurry, Jimmy.

1287
01:51:04,401 --> 01:51:06,271
- Out!
- Hurry!

1288
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:12,444
The Omegahedron, Selena.

1289
01:51:12,543 --> 01:51:14,013
I want it.

1290
01:51:14,111 --> 01:51:16,448
Well, then, Supergirl

1291
01:51:16,548 --> 01:51:19,151
you shall have it.

1292
01:52:04,862 --> 01:52:07,466
Supergirl, above you. Look out!

1293
01:52:10,234 --> 01:52:11,836
Aah!

1294
01:52:20,877 --> 01:52:24,316
I think I'll be going.
If you'll excuse me.

1295
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:32,291
That's what I said.
I'm staying, I'm staying.

1296
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:48,707
You have no friends, Selena.

1297
01:52:48,806 --> 01:52:51,243
You treat everyone as if
they were put on this Earth

1298
01:52:51,342 --> 01:52:53,378
to serve you.

1299
01:52:53,477 --> 01:52:56,415
More or less,
I think they were.

1300
01:52:56,514 --> 01:52:58,883
You included.

1301
01:53:01,819 --> 01:53:04,323
Power of Shadow...

1302
01:53:04,422 --> 01:53:06,858
...appear!

1303
01:53:27,511 --> 01:53:29,949
Power of Shadow...

1304
01:53:31,849 --> 01:53:34,519
...destroy her!

1305
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,396
Ah!

1306
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:32,311
Ah, I can't.

1307
01:54:33,778 --> 01:54:36,115
I can't...

1308
01:54:36,213 --> 01:54:39,018
<i>You can!</i>

1309
01:54:40,545 --> 01:54:42,087
<i>On, girl!</i>

1310
01:55:03,141 --> 01:55:05,744
Confront her with it!
It's the only way!

1311
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:40,312
No, no, no, no, no!

1312
01:56:28,292 --> 01:56:31,196
Oh! I have to go.

1313
01:56:31,295 --> 01:56:33,265
I have to return this
to where it belongs.

1314
01:56:33,364 --> 01:56:35,334
<i>And I must ask you all something.</i>

1315
01:56:35,433 --> 01:56:38,203
It's alright, Supergirl.
We never saw you.

1316
01:56:38,302 --> 01:56:40,139
We never even heard of you.

1317
01:56:40,237 --> 01:56:41,941
Thank you.

1318
01:56:42,040 --> 01:56:44,076
<i>Ethan, Linda, she...</i>

1319
01:56:44,169 --> 01:56:46,278
Well, she had to leave
in a hurry, but she...

1320
01:56:46,377 --> 01:56:48,914
You don't have to say a word.

1321
01:56:49,013 --> 01:56:50,449
I know.

1322
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:58,223
I'll explain about Linda.

1323
01:57:00,024 --> 01:57:01,626
Thank you, Ethan.

1324
01:57:02,793 --> 01:57:04,696
Take care of yourself, kiddo.

1325
01:57:26,083 --> 01:57:28,887
Phew! Wow!

1326
01:57:28,986 --> 01:57:30,689
That was some kiss.

1327
01:57:30,789 --> 01:57:32,391
Wow!

1328
01:57:34,125 --> 01:57:36,095
Goodbye, Linda.
