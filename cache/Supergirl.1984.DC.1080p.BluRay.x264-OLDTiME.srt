1
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:36,883
- Hello to you.
- Hello to you.

2
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,301
I hope you're fine.

3
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:50,522
Now, let's try something
different: a challenge.

4
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,025
<i>Who knows the electron wave functions...</i>

5
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,028
<i>for Kryptonian convalent bonding?</i>

6
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,030
Sorry.

7
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,033
Leya?

8
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,036
<i>The cube root of the wavelength
over the natural log...</i>

9
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,040
of the integral of the speed of light...
I think squared.

10
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,043
Well, maybe that was a bit too easy.

11
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,340
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

12
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,302
- Hello, Kara.
- Hello to you.

13
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,980
<i>Oh, it is beautiful.</i>

14
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,441
What's that gonna be, Zaltar?

15
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,444
I think... a tree.

16
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,529
A tree.

17
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,615
What is a tree?

18
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,075
A lovely thing
which grows on Earth.

19
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,620
Earth? You mean
where my cousin went?

20
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,747
Hmm, and to where,
one day soon perhaps

21
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,874
I might venture as well.

22
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,668
I don't believe you. How?

23
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:58,048
- In that. Through there.
- The binary chute?

24
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,050
But you'd never survive
the pressure. It'll destroy...

25
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,594
In that I can.
Zip-zap and I'm gone.

26
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,596
But you'd never
leave us, Zaltar.

27
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,432
- <i>You'd never leave Argo City.</i>
- Indeed, I might, Kara.

28
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,100
Too much of a good thing here.

29
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,939
<i>Perhaps I'll try Saturn instead.</i>
Yes, I think I might.

30
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,442
Saturn is... is that
further away than Earth?

31
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,568
Silly question.

32
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,071
Didn't you study six-dimensional
geometry at school?

33
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,656
Do they not teach
anything anymore?

34
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,117
Well, of course they do.
I know the equations.

35
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,873
I just can't see
them in my head.

36
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,086
Most great artists find
mathematics troublesome, Kara.

37
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,589
- Only use your imagination.
- Mm-hm.

38
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,716
Saturn and Earth
are in outer space

39
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,470
but we, we are in inner space.

40
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,348
Our city has two great
power sources.

41
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,600
This is one of them. Look.

42
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,400
An omegahedron.

43
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,569
The Guardians let you have it?

44
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,989
Not exactly. I borrowed it.

45
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,408
You stole it. Oh, Zaltar,
they're gonna...

46
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,620
No, borrowed it...
for the afternoon.

47
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,917
- For inspiration.
- Inspiration.

48
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,066
But I think that
I shall never see

49
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,193
the branches
of a living tree.

50
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,947
Why? An omegahedron
can create life, can't it?

51
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,784
It can't, child, it can't.
Just the illusion of life.

52
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,203
That's a fancy shadow
of the real thing

53
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,206
which is the most we can hope
for on this lonely old rock.

54
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,791
Kara.

55
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,295
- Kara!
- I'm here, mother, I...

56
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,343
Kara, I've been looking
for you for ages.

57
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,594
Oh, I'm sorry, mother.

58
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,930
- Zaltar.
- Alura, join us.

59
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,599
We're just inventing
miracles.

60
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,811
Put your fingers here,
Kara, and press hard.

61
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,732
Good. Now try it.

62
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,945
Let your imagination explode
and give it a try. Go on.

63
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,490
Zaltar, my-my husband
tells me you talk

64
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,826
of leaving Argo City.
For where?

65
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,162
Parts unknown.
It is, alas, a fact.

66
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,122
You and Zor-El
have a life here.

67
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,791
You've each other and Kara.

68
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,670
But, Zaltar, you founded this city.
It's yours.

69
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,215
As far as the eye can see,
right to the veil, smack

70
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,051
and then what?
What is beyond?

71
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,762
Alura, I cannot contain
myself to Argo City only.

72
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,098
My head is boiling with ideas.

73
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,017
My imagination is too vast,
it's uncontrollable.

74
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,728
If you want my opinion, Zaltar,
you're starting to repeat

75
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:02,732
yourself here with
all this airy, glittery stuff.

76
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,528
Exactly. That's why
I'm going to Venus.

77
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,073
Venus? When?

78
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,326
Tomorrow or the next day,
at the latest.

79
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,662
Zaltar, have you
thought about this?

80
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,706
It doesn't make sense to me.

81
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,043
I have thought intensely.
My mind is made up.

82
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,343
Kara! The power source!

83
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:20,101
Oh, Zaltar!
Save me. Please! Help!

84
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,854
- No!
- Kara!

85
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,901
Zaltar!
Help! No!

86
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,582
You took the omegahedron.

87
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,918
That's not correct,
I lost the omegahedron.

88
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,836
- No, father, I did...
- Shh, Kara.

89
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,254
No matter who.

90
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,882
Without it this city can't
survive more than a few days.

91
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,260
Our lights will grow dim and
the very air we breathe so thin.

92
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,262
I know. So I shall find it.

93
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,432
I shall go right to the end of
inner space and I'll return it.

94
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,520
Impossible. How? No one can
leave Argo City and you know it.

95
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,356
This is our universe and
you've destroyed it with a game.

96
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,110
- A childish game.
- I think it can be done.

97
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,823
Through there, the binary chute,
in the traveler.

98
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,284
Like a coward you choose
instant destruction

99
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,578
while the rest of us
are doomed to stay here...

100
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,729
Kara!

101
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,439
Kara, no!

102
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,583
- You lunatic!
- She'll be killed.

103
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,376
Oh, no, she won't.

104
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,713
She will be safe,
through the binary

105
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,007
through the warp,
into another register.

106
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,008
Another what?

107
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,885
Gravitational radiation

108
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,555
a pathway from inner space
to outer space.

109
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,474
Then she'll never
be the same, ever.

110
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,560
At least she'll be alive.

111
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,813
And my fate is sealed.

112
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,608
I've lost the omegahedron

113
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,194
I must be sent
to the Phantom Zone.

114
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,988
<i>Your suffering will be short,</i>

115
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,658
mine... forever.

116
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,571
Some more champagne,
my dear Selena?

117
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,117
What are you thinking about?

118
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,415
It's such a pretty world.

119
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,044
I can't wait until
it's all mine.

120
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,255
The only way you
can rule the world

121
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,841
is to become invisible,
my pumpkin.

122
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,176
Invisible?

123
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,180
You'd almost know
how to make me invisible.

124
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,724
Oh, I do know.

125
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,977
Take five black beans
and the head of a dead man,

126
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,689
place one bean in his mouth,
two beans in his eyes, then...

127
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,733
Nigel, enough.

128
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,528
But it works. Then you can
get anywhere, do anything.

129
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:44,198
Nigel, how long have
we been together?

130
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,617
Ooh. Months, darling.

131
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,787
Then why does
it seem like <i>years</i>?

132
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:54,709
Because you're so impatient.
You want everything yesterday.

133
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,211
It's a lifetime
to discover the secrets

134
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,214
of black magic from
the ancient grimoires.

135
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,051
More champagne, my sweetness?

136
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:09,057
Don't call me...

137
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,559
"Your sweetness."

138
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,562
I am not sweet.

139
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,565
I am Selena.

140
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:22,570
And I am a bitter, bitter pill to swallow.

141
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,367
Holy cow.

142
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,977
I wonder.

143
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:06,906
Immortality be upon this one.

144
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:12,495
She is a sharer
of the sun's everlasting life.

145
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,207
There will now
be no danger of death.

146
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:21,003
This world will
keep her forever.

147
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,673
What is it?

148
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,467
What's going on?
Hey, what's going on?

149
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,303
I've just outgrown you, Nigel.

150
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,097
These things happen.

151
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,766
You can't treat me
like this, Selena.

152
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,269
Without me you'd
still be reading tea leaves

153
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,104
at Lake Tahoe.

154
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:47,155
<i>Amsterdam and more. That's TWA.
Never has flying been easier.</i>

155
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,868
You can't run out on me, Selena.

156
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,370
I've got the keys, sweetheart.

157
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,165
<i>The president confirmed reports
that Superman has embarked</i>

158
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,709
<i>on a special peace-seeking
mission to a galaxy</i>

159
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,294

160
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,629
<i>several hundred trillion
light-years from our own...</i>

161
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,904
Whoo-whoo!

162
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,118
<i>Now, here's the weather
from the general Chicago area</i>

163
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,662
<i>increasing cloudiness with
the possibility of showers.</i>

164
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,165
<i>Breezy but warm with a high of 62.</i>

165
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,719
Bianca!

166
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,637
I'm home.

167
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,851
Bianca!

168
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,561
<i>What?</i>

169
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,481
Show your face.

170
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,736
I have a surprise for you.

171
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,495
<i>They've turned off
the hot water again.</i>

172
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,540
I'm really gonna have to kill
somebody down at the DWP.

173
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,210
The only way we're gonna
pay our bills next month

174
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,963
in this dump, is to just go
ahead and start our own coven.

175
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,965
No longer necessary.

176
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,134
I was reading in this book

177
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,928
"The Witches Guide
to Heaven and Hell"

178
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,680
if you start your
own coven all you've to do

179
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,266
is charge five bucks a head,
minimal admission. That's great.

180
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,644
- Chicken feed.
- That's better than goose egg.

181
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,522
What's in the Coffer of Shadow
there? Where's little Nigel?

182
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,941
Nigel, my dear Bianca,
is history.

183
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,400
Oh, yeah? How so?

184
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,112
The water department is history.
The car payments are history.

185
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,906
The mortgage
payments are history.

186
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,242
- How are the property taxes?
- History.

187
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,954
The world is at last my oyster.

188
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,998
If I can figure this thing out...

189
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,503
Would you mind letting Bianca in
on this unexpected bit of good luck?

190
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,505
Or whatever it is?

191
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,007
Ba-ad luck.

192
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:26,011
I have been chosen.
The powers of darkness...

193
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:30,015
I think may, at long last...
Have come to their senses.

194
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,018
You wanna hear some bad luck?
The phone company says...

195
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,522
unless we pay this bill today,
they're turning the phone off!

196
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,524
Shut up, shut up.
Watch.

197
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,779
Learn something for a change.

198
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,167
Oh, my god.

199
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,046
Are you doing that?

200
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:04,300
It's a trick, right?
It's a trick.

201
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,305
I think it's done.
Selena, I think it's done.

202
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,943
Oh, my god.

203
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,446
It's gonna take a little practice.

204
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,074
Now, this I like.

205
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,745
- Hello.
- "Hello," she says.

206
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,497
- Well, hello to you, honeybun.
- Hello.

207
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,250
I was wondering if you could
tell me where I am?

208
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:46,628
What do they call this place,
Eddie? Lovers' Lane, isn't it?

209
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:50,090
You got it in one,
Billy boy. Lovers' Lane.

210
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,052
Oh, no, you see,
what I meant was is

211
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,429
well, those lights over there.
What are they called?

212
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:58,432
Check out the view
from back here, Eduardo.

213
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,600
Ah!

214
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,185
Stop that.

215
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,564
You're, uh, Superman's
best friend, huh?

216
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:10,778
No. His cousin. I've come here
to search for the omegahedron.

217
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,448
It's a power source vital to
Argo City. That's where I live.

218
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,033
No kidding.

219
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,786
Eddie and me here

220
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,330
we're on a secret mission also.

221
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,999
We're out looking
for a good time.

222
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,836
And you just won
the brass ring, baby.

223
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,897
Oh, she works out, huh?

224
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,440
Why are you doing this?

225
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,443
It's just the way we are.

226
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,286
You shouldn't have
done that, baby.

227
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,124
Come on.

228
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,757
Oh, I see.

229
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,970
You really wanna play games,
eh, sweetheart?

230
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,597
Come on. Come...

231
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:21,765
ow!

232
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,689
Huh?

233
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:34,069
Eddie, I think
maybe we should

234
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:38,157
kinda keep this to ourselves.
What do you think?

235
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,456
Freddie, you little
devil. How are you?

236
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,335
Fresh ammunition, everybody.

237
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,096
Try telling your wife.
I need another.

238
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,515
Where is it? Where's
the little mystery ball?

239
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,310
Let me have a peek.
Maybe I can shed some light.

240
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,311
I hate light.

241
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,813
Is it electrical?
Is it hot to the touch?

242
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,107
- Where is it?
- Safe and sound.

243
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,068
Go mix.
Leave me to my thoughts.

244
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,529
Go mix? With these people?
You must be mad.

245
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,781
Who are they?
Wrinkly little wretches.

246
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,701
These are my
foot soldiers, Nigel.

247
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,329
My army of the night.

248
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:29,958
I'm considering nothing
less than world... domination.

249
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,253
World domination? So you start by
letting Bianca get on the phone

250
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,756
to the local psychical research
society and say,

251
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,759
"Hello, got anyone over there
wants to join a coven?"

252
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,262
There are time-honored ways
of doing this, honeybunch.

253
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,766
Centuries-old rules to follow.

254
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,768
I have a secret, Selena.

255
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,270
How exciting for you, Nigel.
Best write it down before you forget it.

256
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,147
After you left me in the lurch

257
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,358
I saw something that should
worry you greatly

258
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,027
if you're serious about
taking over this planet.

259
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:01,865
My secret was blue and red
and it knew how to fly.

260
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,660
I've a secret too, Nigel.

261
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,537
I have the power.

262
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,623
Get that through your head.

263
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,292
Selena is through worrying.

264
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:16,296
The shoe is on the other foot
and it's their turn to worry,

265
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:20,300
All those who mocked me
when my chips were down.

266
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,262
Oh, I bet they're
in for it now, eh?

267
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,264
Count on it.

268
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,313
I have in my time seen
a great number of things

269
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,815
even more impressive

270
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,818
than a human cigarette
lighter, dear lady.

271
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,195
To wit.

272
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:46,994
What is that?

273
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,664
Overreaching ambition.

274
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,832
Take heed.

275
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,752
Touched a little
nerve, didn't I?

276
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,089
Hello.

277
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,799
Hello.

278
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,010
The red toad
that lurks in the briars

279
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,262
and brambles
is full of sorceries.

280
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,264
There's a little bone
on the left side.

281
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,098
A little bone?

282
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,059
A little bone, which
if bound to a man stirs up

283
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,853
the greatest lust.

284
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,273
- I wanna be rich and famous.
- Then stick with me.

285
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,360
I was put on this earth
to thrill millions.

286
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,739
Mmm, this is scrumptious.

287
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,367
Why don't we go somewhere else
and dance cheek to cheek?

288
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,129
Stop it, Selena!
That's not fair.

289
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,839
Pick on me.

290
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,058
- Thanks.
- Hey, no sweat.

291
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,727
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing much.

292
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,646
Get out of my house, Nigel

293
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,233
and don't come slithering back.

294
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,736
Listen, Selena, I'm the only one
who can save you from yourself.

295
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:07,240
- You need me.
- Like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower, kiddo.

296
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,118
I'm warning you, Selena

297
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,287
don't be so shortsighted.

298
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:23,256
Okay, folks. The show's over!

299
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,258
Let's party.

300
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,642
Freddie, darling, thank you for coming.
Goodbye!

301
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,644
- Good party.
- Thank you. Lovely to see you.

302
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,146
Bye!

303
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:47,531
Four people signed up. We got 20 bucks,
cash on the barrelhead.

304
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,033
- Four people?
- They loved the food.

305
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:54,037
They were real impressed with that
spinning top number you did on that girl.

306
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,540
But when Nigel walked out
the way he did,

307
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,042
I gotta say it hurt us.

308
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:02,546
They thought he was giving you
a warning to slow down.

309
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,549
Rome wasn't built in a day.

310
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:10,554
A warning?
A warning, they say?

311
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:16,059
Nobody gets a warning anymore.

312
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,741
Good morning.

313
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,460
<i>Have you got it, Lucy?
Must be near that oak tree.</i>

314
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,795
- <i>Hurry up!</i>
- Found it, guys.

315
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:47,674
<i>What are you doing?
You're supposed to find the ball.</i>

316
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,097
<i>Come on, don't take all day.
You're holding up the game.</i>

317
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,601
- Hey, it's your turn to bat.
- Let's go. Let's go.

318
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,686
Okay. Okay.
Let's play ball.

319
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,605
Alright, batter.

320
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,492
I couldn't make it.
I have to finish my...

321
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,306
<i>Hey, toss the ball back, will you?</i>

322
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,737
<i>Come on, make it two in a row.</i>

323
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,031
Play ball.

324
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,303
- <i>Where have you been?</i>
- With the principal.

325
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,055
Danvers is doing
his usual number.

326
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,057
Jeez, another
barfy new student.

327
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,977
They're really scraping the
bottom of the barrel these days.

328
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,063
Hang in there, Danvers.

329
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,690
Don't let them get to you.

330
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,403
Thirty days. Semester
just started. You'll be...

331
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,573
- Hello, I...
- Didn't knock.

332
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,075
Don't we teach you
manners around here?

333
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,952
Don't we try to impress
on our young ladies

334
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,870
that animals
in the jungle never knock

335
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,207
but Midvale girls always do.
Where you going? Come back here.

336
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,042
Come in.

337
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,504
I forgot, I'm just not used to...

338
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,172
Wait a minute.

339
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,092
Wait just one second.

340
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:58,179
I have never before
in my life laid eyes on you

341
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,347
have I, young lady?

342
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,224
- No, sir, I'm new here.
- New here?

343
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,019
Obviously you're new if I've
never laid eyes on you before.

344
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,771
The question remains,
just who on earth are you?

345
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,274
Umm...

346
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,570
On Earth, I'm Lee.

347
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,071
Linda Lee.

348
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,991
Where's your letter
of recommendation?

349
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,034
Letter?

350
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,119
I must talk to you, principal.

351
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,289
- I am busy now.
- So are they, them.

352
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,666
All the little monsters
you admit to the place.

353
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,794
They have nailed
my desk drawers shut.

354
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,797
Never in all my years
as a school teacher...

355
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:33,965
Come, Danvers.

356
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:35,425
I will not be provoked.

357
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,011
I will not let him
get to me this semester.

358
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,638
I'll be strong.
Be strong.

359
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,264
Be like a rock.

360
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:56,237
What did you say
your name was?

361
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,407
Oh, yes.
Linda Lee, huh?

362
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,326
Yes, my cousin
probably wrote you.

363
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,245
Umm, maybe you got
his letter under K for Kent?

364
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,705
In your files.

365
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:06,915
Kent?

366
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,208
Kent?

367
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,711
It doesn't ring any bells.

368
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,547
Doesn't even ring a...

369
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,802
Oh, here it is.
Big as life.

370
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,804
“My dear Mr. Danvers,
I'm writing on behalf

371
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,722
of a very
special young lady."

372
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,307
An orphan?

373
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,476
Don't expect to be treated
any differently

374
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,769
on that account, Miss Lee.

375
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,354
Oh, no, sir, I won't.

376
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,147
One way or another,
we're all alone

377
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,401
on this... miserable
little planet.

378
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,444
Yes, sir, I know.

379
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,280
Since your school records were
obviously lost in the mail

380
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,324
you'll have to start
at the bottom.

381
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,118
It's only fair
to the other girls.

382
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,996
You'll have English, Latin,
math, biology, computing...

383
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,373
All at once?

384
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,708
...and chemistry.

385
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,086
Idle hands are the
devil's playground. This way.

386
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,637
- Man on the floor!
- Man on the floor!

387
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,238
Open up, Lane, I know
you're in there.

388
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,575
I'm not decent,
Mr. Danvers sir.

389
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,327
And you never will be either.
You little liar.

390
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,541
Come on in. Come on in.
I haven't got all year.

391
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,001
No.

392
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,086
I'm supposed to have
a single this term.

393
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,338
We don't always get
what we want, Miss Lane.

394
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,591
Disappointments
thicken our skins.

395
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,718
Who wants thick skin?

396
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,180
I'm Linda Lee.

397
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,809
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

398
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,437
I'm Lucy Lane.

399
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,355
Lucy Lee, this is Linda Lane.

400
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,191
- No, itisn't.
- What?

401
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,568
- She's Linda Lee and I'm...
- Lucy Lane.

402
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,528
You two know each other.

403
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,405
Oh, no. We just met.

404
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,741
- When?
- Just now.

405
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,368
But we've known each other
for years, haven't we, Linda?

406
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,662
- Oh, gee, I don't think I...
- Oh, of course.

407
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,040
The Daily Planet, of course.

408
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:15,794
Linda's cousin works there. And
your sister, what's her name?

409
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,213
The one that's always
calling me and bothering me?

410
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,924
- Lois.
- Ah, yes, that's the one.

411
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,803
Anyway, show our new
Miss Lee around, Miss Lane.

412
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,431
Oh, by the way,
she's an orphan

413
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,017
but don't let her play
on your sympathies, hmm?

414
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,077
So, who's your cousin?

415
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,245
Clark Kent.

416
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,540
You're kidding me.

417
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,459
Clark Kent's your cousin?
You're putting me on.

418
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,837
- You know him?
- Do I know him?

419
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,505
Does my sister know him?

420
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,300
- Now, that's the big question.
- Oh, I see.

421
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,052
I guess, if they worked
at the same newspaper

422
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,428
they must know each other.

423
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,265
- Well...
- Is this where I'll sleep?

424
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,976
Well, this is your bed,
but we don't sleep around here.

425
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,770
Nonstop excitement
in this dorm.

426
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,941
All the real dementals
are sent here.

427
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,570
So, when's the rest
of your stuff arriving?

428
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,406
I don't have any other stuff.

429
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,283
What? It's all
in that little bag?

430
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:34,455
Oh, well, you see, I have the
means to buy more, it's just...

431
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:36,791
Well, I just haven't
had the chance since...

432
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:56,394
- Do you know him?
- Superman? Sure.

433
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,772
My sister's got something
goin' with the big guy.

434
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,441
Listen, you can borrow
any of my clothes

435
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,819
any time you want.
Just dig in and help yourself.

436
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,322
Thank you.
You're very kind.

437
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,785
He's a real character.
A real hunk.

438
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,246
I'll introduce you
to him someday

439
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:16,831
if we wind up getting along.

440
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,882
Well, you haven't had
a chance since, what?

441
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,052
- Did you have a fire at your house or something?
- Fire?

442
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:32,138
Well, you know.
How your parents got killed.

443
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,060
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- Oh, sure.

444
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,563
I'm sorry. Me and my motor mouth.

445
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,608
Now, then, focus
your tiny minds

446
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,944
on the kind of problem
that it used to take

447
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,863
weeks of thought
before the computer.

448
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,990
Even now it can take
a long time

449
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,326
without certain algorithms

450
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,955
which... if you behave
for two seconds

451
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,457
I might reveal to you.

452
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,926
Love, hate, love, hate.

453
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:11,886
Love.

454
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,097
The cards have decided

455
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,266
people will do
anything for love.

456
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,228
They'll jump off
cliffs for love.

457
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,939
They'll drown themselves
like lemmings.

458
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:28,653
So... I'll make
everybody love me.

459
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,530
Oh, no chance.

460
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,032
You're an awful person,
honey, remember? Forget it.

461
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,661
Use your imagination, pinhead.
That's what magic is all about.

462
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,457
Why are we not moving?

463
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,877
Because I'm in love.

464
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,965
<i>Come here, you beautiful thing.</i>

465
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,802
He's cute.

466
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,599
Hey, what's going on?

467
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,894
<i>Here's an exercise in
big numbers I want you to try...</i>

468
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,606
It's trying to tell me something.

469
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,026
Well, what?
That we're near danger?

470
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,861
I don't know.
How do I know?

471
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,995
- I know.
- Well, tell me.

472
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,414
My prince has come.

473
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,875
Oh, no.

474
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,376
I saw him first, Selena.

475
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,712
That's not fair.
I copied his number first.

476
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,256
Well done.
Now, let's get out of here.

477
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,428
...average size
of a Chinese family

478
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:39,223
average age of death
and marriage and pregnancy.

479
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,809
Use this equation to compute
the population of China

480
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,728
in the year 2040.

481
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,773
Linda... are you with us?

482
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,402
Umm...

483
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,864
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Oh, are you?

484
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,282
Where, might I ask?

485
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,077
W-well, here, sir.
On Earth... sir.

486
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,039
How fortunate
for the rest of us.

487
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,000
May I presume that whilst
you were staring at the wall

488
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,796
and not at your terminal like
your other little friends here

489
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,131
you were in fact,
hard at work

490
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,384
solving this little equation?

491
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,595
Oh, yes, sir, I was.

492
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,472
- I mean, I was...
- Excellent.

493
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:20,890
The answer, please.

494
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,727
Pay attention, class, Miss Lee
is about to enlighten us.

495
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,772
Five billion, two hundred
and seventy one million

496
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,023
nine thousand and ten.

497
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,115
Come on, let's get outta here
before he makes you stay.

498
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,158
Come on, hurry.

499
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,332
Miss Lee.

500
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,584
- Oh, shit.
- Yes, sir?

501
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,878
Have you been going
through my papers?

502
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:52,964
Of course not, sir.

503
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,216
Then how do you know
the correct answer?

504
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,426
- How?
- I guess, I just...

505
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,762
It's all this crazy weather
we've been having, sir.

506
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,890
All the storms, shock waves,
electromagnetism.

507
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,143
It makes people smarter
than they are for a second.

508
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,602
We gotta go, sir.

509
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,440
Oh, boy, thanks.
You know I gotta learn...

510
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,192
How did you know the answer?

511
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,362
I don't know.
Six-dimensional geometry.

512
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,489
- I never could do it before.
- Yeah.

513
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,616
Well, you want some
friendly advice?

514
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,661
Don't go showing it off
‘cause nobody's gonna like you.

515
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,288
I'll see you later.

516
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,221
Hey, Lucy, where's your roomie?
Out to lunch?

517
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:45,975
No, she heard you were gonna be here,
Myra, and she got sick to her stomach.

518
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,981
Hey, Linda, wait a minute.
Come on. Stay.

519
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,983
Yeah, aren't we good enough for you?

520
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,485
Can I have my books back, please, Myra?

521
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,487
Say "please".

522
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,991
- I just did.
- Say it again.

523
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:08,497
Please, can I have my books back?

524
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,502
God, what a wimp.

525
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:16,005
Geography? You're not taking
geography, are you, Linda?

526
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,508
- "Midvale and its points of interest?"
- Good, short book.

527
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:23,512
I'm just trying to learn
a little bit about...

528
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:27,016
More in the... in the place that I...
I live.

529
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,518
I have to go study.

530
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:33,522
"Oh, I have to go study.
I'm not boring enough yet."

531
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,525
- Shut up, Myra.
- Make me.

532
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:39,695
Bug off.

533
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,701
All right.
All right!

534
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:54,043
Now, who's gonna clean up this mess?
Not me.

535
00:45:56,045 --> 00:46:00,549
- Why didn't anybody tell us she was coming?
- We didn't care.

536
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,766
Ah!

537
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,978
Nice going.

538
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,855
You know she tripped
you on purpose?

539
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:18,484
Absolutely.
She's retarded.

540
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,114
There's not much time left.
Come on, let's go.

541
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,118
You take it, Myra.

542
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:31,247
Hey, Myra, see if you can
put Lane out for good.

543
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,336
Come on, team. Come on.

544
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,179
Hey, you guys alright?

545
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,016
- Oh, God. What happened?
- Yes. You alright?

546
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,767
Myra, how'd she do that?

547
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,686
- It hit her shoulder.
- I don't know.

548
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,868
Listen, you better keep an eye out for Myra now.
She's out to get you.

549
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:13,372
- Me? Why?
- Because she hates anybody who's not afraid of her.

550
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,256
Hey, you guys, did you see that
cute guy in the softball field?

551
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:23,549
Oh, yes.

552
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,344
With the black hair
and the big muscles?

553
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,470
He was something else.

554
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,264
- Did you talk to him?
- No, but I'm gonna.

555
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:31,807
Talk? Who'd
waste time talking?

556
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,935
He's working on the trees,
could be around for a while.

557
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,440
- Are they in?
- Yes.

558
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,905
Myra, you sure you wanna
go through with this?

559
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,240
Hey, what's with you?
Chicken?

560
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,369
Oh, boy, I'm really
gonna enjoy this.

561
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,871
I can't wait to hear
them scream.

562
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,249
Why don't you shut off the hot
and give them an ice bath?

563
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,585
Are you kidding me?
That's nowheresville.

564
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,921
If you shut off the cold
you'll scald them.

565
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,507
So they lose a little skin.
Serves them right.

566
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,051
I want to see them suffer.

567
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,221
A-ah!

568
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,895
I am wet!

569
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,146
ow!

570
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,775
Don't leave me. Don't leave me!

571
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,904
I hate you!

572
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,572
You never looked better!

573
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,533
We'll get you all!

574
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,707
What do you think?

575
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,544
It looks the same to me.
It's kinda dull.

576
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,340
All you need is a couple of
streaks and your ears pierced.

577
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,134
I can doit
free of charge.

578
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,844
My ears what?

579
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,929
Pierced. Like in you know,
I take a needle

580
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:55,516
I heat it up and then I dab it
with some alcohol and zap.

581
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,143
All the guys go crazy.

582
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,812
Because I've holes in my ears?

583
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,605
What are you, putting me on?

584
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,191
Sometimes I can't
figure you out, Linda.

585
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,113
So, where are you
going this weekend?

586
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,322
Nowhere.

587
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,241
Nowhere? Well, you can't
stay around here.

588
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,909
This place is depressing.

589
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,870
I mean, like the tombs.

590
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,621
- Why?
- Why?

591
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,707
What, were you born
yesterday?

592
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,959
This is a three-day weekend.

593
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,003
A three-day weekend.

594
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,506
So, listen. Why don't
you come home with me?

595
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,426
I only live about five miles
from here and I got this guy

596
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,011
coming up from Metropolis.

597
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,346
I think he knows
your cousin Clark.

598
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,474
His name's Jimmy Olsen.

599
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:39,101
I think he's real stuck on me.

600
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,938
Anyways, I could ask him
to bring a friend along.

601
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,817
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

602
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:47,943
Nothing.

603
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,530
No, I think I'm gonna
stay here and study

604
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,491
get things organized.

605
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,911
Don't forget to
call me Saturday.

606
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:58,746
Just a sec.

607
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,624
- Hey, Linda.
- Hi.

608
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,626
I'll see you later
at Popeye's then, okay?

609
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,879
- Alright, I'll try. I promise.
- You better. It's gonna be fun.

610
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:07,963
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

611
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:09,089
Have a good time.

612
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,550
Come along now, Lucy.

613
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,930
- Oh, mom, how are you doing?
- I've had a terrible week.

614
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:27,334
"Take a spider off his web...

615
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:32,464
"...and shut him up inside...

616
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,635
"_..two shells of a nut.

617
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,974
"Now, boil the nut in oil

618
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,268
"into which has been added

619
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,312
"some of the web.

620
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:51,191
"With a silver spoon,
put two drops...

621
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:53,777
"...of the oil

622
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,865
"into some water.

623
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,408
Right.

624
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,578
"He who drinks the water

625
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:06,874
"shall be in love
with the first person he sees.

626
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,878
"Uh, so long as the spider
is shut up in the nutshell.

627
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,922
"Or one day goes by...

628
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,592
...whichever comes first."

629
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,636
Big deal, one day.

630
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,721
Why don't you just use,
you know.

631
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,806
I'm saving it for bigger things.

632
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,643
<i>Hi, folks,
you're missing the big sale.</i>

633
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,646
<i>Country and western boys
from the Chicago area.</i>

634
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,106
<i>Now to start off the hour.</i>

635
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:50,167
Bianca, get the door.

636
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,796
Bianca!

637
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:00,636
You rang?

638
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,595
Hey, you!

639
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,557
I said...

640
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,726
...you rang?

641
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:08,852
Oh, yeah.

642
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,354
How you doing?

643
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,859
Uh, I'm looking for some person
called Mrs. Selena?

644
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,613
- <i>Madame</i> Selena.
- Oh.

645
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:23,450
And you found her, lucky boy.

646
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,911
<i>Entrer.</i>

647
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,709
You must be very popular
in the neighborhood.

648
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,836
I always see your truck
parked around.

649
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,337
Oh, yeah.

650
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:38,841
Yeah, I get a lot of repeat
business. People like my work.

651
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,261
Yes, I'm sure they do.

652
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,808
- Wet your whistle?
- Huh?

653
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:51,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, as a matter
of fact, I don't mind if I do.

654
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,677
So, uh, where's
the one... ha-ha at?

655
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:24,803
It dropped dead.

656
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,430
Where at exactly?
Uh, out back?

657
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,057
We might get to know each other
a little more

658
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:34,146
before we dig in
and talk real turkey.

659
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,734
Well, uh, see, I'm kind of
a private person, you know.

660
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,445
I mean, I do my work,
I go home.

661
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:43,447
- To your wife?
- No.

662
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,783
At the present moment in time
I'm currently enjoying

663
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,826
a single status in
my personal life.

664
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,077
Cheers.

665
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,246
Bottoms up, huh?

666
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:52,414
Bottoms up.

667
00:54:57,753 --> 00:55:01,048
I, I noticed you got a pretty
alkaline-looking soil out there.

668
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,966
What I want...

669
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:06,678
...are some houseplants
inside here.

670
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,974
Something that goes well
with the house.

671
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,185
This is a house?

672
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,437
Of course, it's a house.

673
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,607
There's the bedroom
over there.

674
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,946
I think it's getting
dark in here.

675
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:29,910
You know, what kind of plant
is gonna wanna...

676
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,246
...grow in this dump?

677
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:34,915
I don't know.

678
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:37,251
Shade plants?

679
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,753
- Hmm.
- To us.

680
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,923
Yeah, I'll-I'll drink...

681
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,424
...to that.

682
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,931
Hm, you probably killed him,
you know.

683
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,396
Sleep well.

684
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,189
And when you wake...

685
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:03,527
...drown in my eyes
and be all mine.

686
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,823
I'll get it.

687
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,915
Oh, hello, Nigel.
It's you.

688
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:18,876
Nice suit.

689
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:20,752
Subtle.

690
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:22,880
I want to see Selena.

691
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,299
She's indisposed
at the moment.

692
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,677
Whoever it is,
we don't want any.

693
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:31,221
It's Nigel and
he's not going away

694
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,265
until he talks to you.

695
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,019
What the devil do you want?

696
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,354
I want to make
a very serious proposal.

697
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:40,564
In that outfit?

698
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,318
This is a leisure suit.
I've got three days off

699
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,944
from those little beasts
at Midvale

700
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,155
and I intend to let
my hair down.

701
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:52,826
Let's talk. Together we could really
rattle some cages.

702
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,913
- Know what I mean?
- I'm listening. Make it snappy.

703
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,046
Uh-oh.

704
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:50,008
That ball will not operate
at it's fullest

705
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,428
until you internalize
your power, Selena.

706
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,473
Some mosaic invocations.

707
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,141
- Some what?
- Come again?

708
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,268
Exactly, that's my point.

709
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:03,522
You girls are rank amateurs
playing with fire.

710
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,525
Because we own the matches.

711
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:10,529
I, of all people,
know a hustle when I hear one.

712
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,780
Now, goodbye, Nigel.

713
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,199
- It was nice talking to you.
- No, it wasn't.

714
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:17,953
I hate to seem pushy,
my fairest of the fair but...

715
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,579
A word of advice, Nigel.

716
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:21,748
If I had your skin problems,

717
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:24,459
I'd stop bothering people,
put a bag over my head,

718
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,169
and go live under a bridge!

719
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,129
Ouch!

720
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,258
There's nothing wrong
with my skin.

721
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:36,471
You know, some people.

722
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,474
Where is he?

723
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,144
Where is he?

724
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:53,030
Where is he?

725
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,158
Whoever he sees first,
he'll love with all his heart.

726
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,951
What?
For a day tops, right?

727
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,037
He was too young
for you anyway, you know.

728
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,290
No, I do not know.
Where is he?

729
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,215
Hey, I know that guy.

730
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:21,683
- Oh, the cable's out.
- Oh, what cable?

731
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:23,852
This is a mirror.

732
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,397
So, how come we could...

733
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,066
...ever see him in it?

734
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,568
That was magic, dammit.

735
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,487
The power.

736
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:36,239
Oh, so make it happen again,
you know?

737
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:40,327
I... can't make it happen again.
I don't know how I did it.

738
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:41,578
Oh.

739
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,539
Maybe, you should let
that thing out of it's box.

740
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,459
Maybe, it's more powerful
if you let it out of it's box.

741
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,627
- The box.
- The box.

742
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,504
- Where is it?
- The box?

743
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,547
It's underneath the rug,
where you left it.

744
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,174
Go ahead.

745
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,682
It's stuck.

746
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:08,063
This is not my day.

747
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,148
It's stuck?

748
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,566
How could it be stuck?

749
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:14,402
It's growing.

750
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:17,697
How could it be growing?
It's made out of lead.

751
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:30,919
Oh.

752
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,504
Too bad, there's no sound.

753
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:35,674
How come there's no sound?

754
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,552
Get off the road, turkey!

755
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,638
Hey, dummy,
you wanna die?

756
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:43,682
Smoking, stupid?

757
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:45,642
You wanna kill yourself?

758
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,821
She saw a lawyer,
and now she's gonna file.

759
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:01,283
I told her to take him for
every cent, clean him out.

760
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,702
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

761
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:12,169
Here you go, everybody.
Who wants onion rings?

762
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:13,420
- Yeah, here.
- Thanks.

763
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,714
- Some French fries?
- French fries are mine.

764
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,091
Chicken for myself.
Thank you.

765
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,885
- Thanks.
- Side order tomatoes?

766
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,428
Thanks for inviting me,
Lucy.

767
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:22,971
I'm glad you could come,
Jimmy.

768
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,432
- You want a root beer?
- Yeah, thanks.

769
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:28,476
Oh, there's Linda.

770
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,480
Hey, Linda!

771
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,983
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

772
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,526
That's Clark Kent's cousin?

773
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,028
Who's Clark Kent?

774
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:38,987
Is that Linda?

775
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,867
- Guess what.
- What?

776
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,827
There's this all-night party
tonight at Eddie's.

777
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,454
He's the guy
with the tattoo.

778
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,039
His folks are out of town.

779
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:52,334
And the guy with the bow tie,
that's Jimmy.

780
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,336
So, you wanna come?

781
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,922
I don't know. I'm not
signed out for an overnight.

782
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,758
So what? Go back, sign in
and climb out the window.

783
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,927
Mrs. Murphy's drunk
as a skunk by now.

784
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,637
Totally on another planet.

785
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,972
Oh, I don't know.
It just doesn't seem right.

786
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:07,974
But that's why
it'll be fun.

787
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:09,434
- Okay?
- Okay.

788
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,313
Get off the road, buddy.

789
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,606
Hey, stupid.

790
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:18,860
- Hey, you, space cadet, get out of the street!
- Hey, idiot!

791
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:23,406
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

792
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:25,033
He's probably on drugs.

793
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,577
And he's gonna get creamed
if he's not too careful.

794
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:30,413
- Hi. Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
- Oh, I-I'm Kara.

795
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:31,790
- <i>Who?</i>
- Who?

796
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,083
Oh, I'm...

797
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,001
...concerned.

798
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,128
Well, that if we don't do something.

799
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:39,923
You go out there, try to help
a guy like that and he's

800
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,050
<i>probably got a gun or a knife.</i>

801
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,385
It's not too safe.

802
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,553
Hey, I'm starving.
Let's eat.

803
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,222
Come on, Linda.

804
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,604
Power of Shadow.

805
01:02:56,314 --> 01:03:00,860
Bring him to me.

806
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:35,395
Whoa.

807
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,693
Look at that.

808
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,825
Hey, get out.

809
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:55,999
Look out.
Watch out.

810
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:07,469
My car!

811
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,579
You've never seen a tattoo
before, Linda?

812
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,456
- Look!
- What's that?

813
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:20,250
There's somebody hanging
out of it.

814
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,127
Doesn't look like
there's anybody driving.

815
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,880
Oh, my God.
It's a runaway.

816
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:32,720
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- Hey, what's she doing?

817
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,889
Lucy, be careful.
Lucy!

818
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,976
- Come on.
- Lucy!

819
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,553
God, there's the pump?

820
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,252
She's still in there.

821
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:55,386
- Oh, excuse me. I'm in a rush.
- I know the feeling.

822
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,435
Are you okay?

823
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:05,230
It's gasoline!
It's gasoline!

824
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,731
- Hey, look at that.
- What?

825
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,640
A storm dragon?

826
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,686
A Supergirl.

827
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,237
Oh, my God!

828
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:25,453
Don't. Don't look at her.

829
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,628
You're gonna be alright.

830
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,922
There's no broken bones.

831
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:43,638
I love you.

832
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:47,016
What did he say?

833
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:48,851
What did he say?

834
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:51,145
Looked like
"I love you", to me.

835
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:54,190
No! No!

836
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:56,484
You love me?

837
01:09:58,444 --> 01:10:00,113
With all my heart,
forever.

838
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,490
A bird of free
and careless wing

839
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,659
was I through many
a smiling spring.

840
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,411
The cold repulse,
the look askance.

841
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,372
The lightning of
love's angry glance, stay.

842
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,458
Let me behold you.

843
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,392
I-1 have to go.

844
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,479
Like melting wax or withering flower,

845
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,481
I feel my passion...

846
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:37,483
and thy power.

847
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,611
Oh, I-l have to go.

848
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:44,824
Everything's under control.

849
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,200
Lucy!

850
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,536
Just go on,
back to your homes.

851
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:49,537
Lucy.

852
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,831
- Oh.
- Thank God.

853
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:56,627
- You alright?
- I think so.

854
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,087
I hit my head.

855
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,173
Nigel must know her.

856
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:03,634
She must be one of his students.
He must have put her up to it.

857
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:06,095
No. I don't think that at all.

858
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:08,473
Oh, she just happened
to be in the wrong place

859
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,433
at the wrong time, right?

860
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:14,020
Materializing
in a bulldozer, huh?

861
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,396
She's a wimpy little thing.

862
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,482
I don't know why you care
what she does, anyway.

863
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:21,152
Because <i>nobody</i> gets in my way.

864
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:22,653
Why don't you just leave
this poor kid alone

865
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,781
and worry about the
other one that flies?

866
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:28,743
I worry about everything.
It's my job. Stand back.

867
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:32,538
Oh, come on now.
She's just a teenager.

868
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:37,293
What good is a sword
if it's not unleashed?

869
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:40,004
But she's a total zero.
You don't even know her name.

870
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:43,716
The naming of names
is not necessary.

871
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:47,011
Let us concentrate
on her face.

872
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:50,515
And my Shadow
will do the rest.

873
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,099
Your what?

874
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:54,435
Power of Shadow...

875
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,188
...take shape.

876
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:01,734
Look like a
vicious dark star.

877
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:06,155
Seek out, that
wretched young creature.

878
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:09,700
And destroy her
wherever she...

879
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:13,412
...are.

880
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,164
Oh, God.
That's awful.

881
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:16,833
That's never
gonna work.

882
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:37,645
Oh, my God!

883
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,481
I'm scared.

884
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:07,550
Next time...

885
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,095
...remind me to
do this outside.

886
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:57,845
Leave this place
and do no harm.

887
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,640
There she is again.

888
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:04,560
What did she say?

889
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,812
No, this is not possible.

890
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:09,398
This is not right.

891
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:10,983
Where's the wimp?

892
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:12,568
Ah!

893
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:14,945
Argh!

894
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,498
Argh!

895
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:29,085
I think he can
take care of her.

896
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:30,169
Ah!

897
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:32,880
Argh!

898
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,568
See?
What did I tell you?

899
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,029
She quit, right?

900
01:16:57,238 --> 01:16:58,072
Wrong.

901
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:05,890
Every time!

902
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,975
Every time!

903
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:11,145
Send a man to do a woman's job
and that's what you get.

904
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:15,566
Damn her eyes.
Who is she?

905
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:18,819
- Are you asking me?
- I'm telling you.

906
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,738
Find out!

907
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:24,783
Well, sure. But, you know,
I think I recognize the costume.

908
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,832
<i>Leave him alone. Let him play.</i>

909
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,792
Where have you been?

910
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,669
- Outside...
- Look at you.

911
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:37,880
Look at those clothes.

912
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,423
Oh, I'll go change.
I-I'm sorry.

913
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:42,927
And you'll put on
your proper school uniform.

914
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,638
And get out of that
ridiculous costume.

915
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:46,805
Yes, ma'am.

916
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:49,099
- And cover your legs.
- Yes, ma'am.

917
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:52,144
Don't you "yes, ma'am" me.

918
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:53,604
No, ma'am.

919
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:58,150
I think you're blowing
this thing out of proportion

920
01:18:58,359 --> 01:18:59,360
if you want my opinion.

921
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:02,947
Oh, no. This box is
definitely getting bigger...

922
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,366
...and uglier.

923
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,493
All I'm saying is
you can't go nuts

924
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,371
over a landscape guy and a
teenager in a blue suit.

925
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:11,997
She flies.

926
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,750
Can you get that through
your thick skull

927
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:17,461
and into your tiny brain, Bianca?

928
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,089
The girl can fly.

929
01:19:37,398 --> 01:19:38,565
Okay.

930
01:19:38,941 --> 01:19:40,025
Now.

931
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,987
Let's get serious.

932
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:46,782
Come to mama.

933
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,202
- Oh.
- Oh.

934
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:54,498
Oh.

935
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:55,624
Whoa.

936
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:58,395
- Selena, cut it out.
- I'm not doing it.

937
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,760
I think we're venturing where

938
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,930
you know, fools rush in
and angels fear to tread.

939
01:21:33,263 --> 01:21:36,266
I'm no angel.

940
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,025
It's the wimp again.

941
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,028
And she's trespassing.

942
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:33,907
First the school,

943
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:36,910
Now here.

944
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:40,914
You know, this thing reacts
whenever she's around.

945
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:44,418
And whenever she shows up,
that girl that flies...

946
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,420
that "Supergirl"...

947
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,923
Isn't far behind.

948
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:52,426
Maybe they're best friends.

949
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:12,488
Hello.

950
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:15,032
Oh, no. Not now.

951
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,409
"Tis only but me,
my love.

952
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:19,369
Please, you'll let
everyone know.

953
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:20,913
What?
That I love you?

954
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:22,664
I'd shout it from
the highest hill.

955
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,500
Please don't.

956
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,461
I know you think me the fool,
at least tell me your name.

957
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:29,046
Linda. Linda Lee.

958
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:30,464
Linda.

959
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:32,716
Lovely Linda Lee.

960
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:35,844
These roses pale
beside thee.

961
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:38,722
Oh.

962
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:41,141
Well, thank you,
but I'm...

963
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,685
And sweet chocolates
for my sweet Linda.

964
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,396
Hm.

965
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:56,865
What are you doing?

966
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:00,536
Please?

967
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:03,747
Oh, no, I...

968
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:04,790
Please.

969
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:06,917
Well, alright.
But just for a minute.

970
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,599
You hate me,
don't you?

971
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:26,144
Hate you?
I don't even know you.

972
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:27,646
I don't even know
your name.

973
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:29,523
Ethan.

974
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:33,986
Say my name aloud but once
and I shall die the happy fool.

975
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:35,445
- Look, Ethan...
- Huh!

976
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:39,992
Ethan.

977
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:42,786
Ethan.

978
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,999
Your soft caress
did at once renew

979
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,834
the beating of
this broken heart.

980
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:51,295
Are you crazy?

981
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:55,757
Marry me?

982
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:08,103
Marry you?

983
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,231
- I don't...
- Don't say it. Don't, please.

984
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,232
I know.

985
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,567
What?

986
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:16,320
We're from
different worlds.

987
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:19,823
- You mean, you know where I'm...
- Just give me a chance, Linda.

988
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:22,576
Love makes
everything possible.

989
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:26,830
A poor uneducated gardener can
indeed worship a rich debutante

990
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,832
and make her happy
if she'd just...

991
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,500
Oh, Ethan.

992
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:32,836
I'm not rich.
I'm just...

993
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,297
Well, then
I'll support us both.

994
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:38,884
You're nuts,
you know that?

995
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:42,137
You're so sweet,
but you're out of your mind.

996
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:45,265
Over you.

997
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,276
What a touching scene.

998
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:29,101
Round and round they go.

999
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:32,437
Where they stop.

1000
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:46,034
Boy, you're really getting
the hang of this.

1001
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:48,995
Oh.

1002
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,002
Where is she?

1003
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:01,425
Jesus.

1004
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:03,885
Who are you?

1005
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,763
I am Selena.

1006
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:09,433
Diadanus of Catania.

1007
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:13,562
Priestess of Sechnid.
I am the ultimate Siren of Endor

1008
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:19,568
and you, little lady, are
trespassing on private property.

1009
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:21,486
She means him.

1010
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,197
I am Kara of Argo City.

1011
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:26,324
Daughter of Alura and Zor-ElI.

1012
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:29,411
And I don't scare easily.

1013
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:30,579
No?

1014
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:32,205
<i>No.</i>

1015
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:34,458
Try...

1016
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,169
...this.

1017
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:58,231
This lady is improving by leaps
and bounds, I gotta tell you.

1018
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:22,941
You okay?

1019
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:24,818
No.

1020
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,447
You want a hacksaw or somethin'?

1021
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:46,006
Now I am really upset.

1022
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:35,639
What's going on?

1023
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:37,974
Oh.

1024
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:39,976
Put me down.

1025
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,862
- Where am I?
- You're safe.

1026
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:53,114
Safe? Where's Linda?

1027
01:30:53,323 --> 01:30:54,950
Put me down.

1028
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:02,165
- Where's my Linda?
- Take it easy.

1029
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,007
Ethan.

1030
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,176
Ha-ha. Very clever.

1031
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:15,762
That ought to keep her out
of your hair for a few hours.

1032
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,723
Clever?
A cheap trick.

1033
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:24,980
Power of Shadow.

1034
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:28,775
Bring him to me.

1035
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:39,452
Bring him... to me.

1036
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:43,123
Ugh!

1037
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:44,374
Didn't work, huh?

1038
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:45,917
Maybe they're too far away.

1039
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:48,962
I can make the sky rain coconuts
with pinpoint accuracy.

1040
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:52,966
But I still can't control
men's minds.

1041
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,427
Not with her around.

1042
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:56,678
So maybe...

1043
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:58,888
Now, don't go
through the roof.

1044
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:00,724
But maybe we
ought to back down

1045
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,727
and give old
you-know-who a call.

1046
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:05,729
You-know-who.

1047
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:07,605
- Spit it out.
- Nigel.

1048
01:32:07,814 --> 01:32:09,399
I shall pretend
you didn't say that.

1049
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:10,775
But I did.

1050
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:12,527
All I'm thinking, and forgive me

1051
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:14,696
for thinking out of turn here...

1052
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:17,115
...is that he's been around.

1053
01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:19,743
He knows things we don't.

1054
01:32:20,285 --> 01:32:22,412
Plus, the way you wrap
him around your little finger

1055
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,414
I'm always amazed.

1056
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:07,957
- You must think me a babe in the woods.
- Not at all.

1057
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:10,460
Scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours.

1058
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:12,295
What's in it for me?

1059
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:14,422
Me.

1060
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:15,882
Ah-ha.

1061
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:20,595
Think of the combination, Nigel.

1062
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:24,099
- The two of us.
- One more time, please.

1063
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:27,310
My dear Nigel, the way to
a woman's heart is through

1064
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:29,395
the elimination of her rivals.

1065
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:30,980
Murder?
Are you proposing that...

1066
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:34,442
Oh, certainly not.
Leave that to me.

1067
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:37,862
You deliver the goods.
Her.

1068
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:39,614
Her? How?

1069
01:33:40,323 --> 01:33:41,741
By getting me...

1070
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:43,326
...him.

1071
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:46,162
- She'll follow.
- Well, I don't.

1072
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:49,165
- Follow any of this, I mean...
- Put that down.

1073
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:54,546
Nigel, I want
one thing.

1074
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:57,465
Time to master
my new toy.

1075
01:33:57,674 --> 01:34:00,176
So, we can rule the world?

1076
01:34:00,176 --> 01:34:02,512
We...

1077
01:34:04,013 --> 01:34:06,516
and she, I have become convinced,

1078
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:12,021
poses some vague yet
potent and undeniable threat.

1079
01:34:12,397 --> 01:34:16,901
She's authentic, then?
The suit is not a joke. It's not rented.

1080
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:22,407
- The cape flaps for real.
- We have every reason to believe it's legitimate.

1081
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:24,450
And you want him here?

1082
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,161
Johnny Appleseed
in your living room?

1083
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:28,329
Yes. In the flesh.

1084
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:29,914
So, she'll follow?

1085
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,959
- No other reason?
- None.

1086
01:34:33,418 --> 01:34:35,461
You're sure of that?

1087
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:40,717
Whoops, I'm sorry.
The little spider got out.

1088
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:42,594
What?

1089
01:34:44,721 --> 01:34:46,097
Where am I?

1090
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:50,560
- Who are you?
- Kara.

1091
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:52,061
Kara?

1092
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:55,523
What happened?

1093
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:57,901
You got hit on the head
by a coconut.

1094
01:34:58,568 --> 01:35:00,153
- Huh?
- Hm.

1095
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:02,322
What's with
the Halloween costume?

1096
01:35:04,324 --> 01:35:07,327
This is not a costume.
These are my clothes.

1097
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:08,620
What do you mean?

1098
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:10,872
Look, I-l have
to go now.

1099
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,333
I'll come back for you later.
I've just gotta get back to

1100
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:14,626
the amusement park.

1101
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:16,961
Amusement park?
Linda!

1102
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:21,090
I gotta find Linda,
she was in trouble.

1103
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:25,053
Well, Linda's alright.
She can take care of herself.

1104
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:26,429
No, no. She can't.
Something's wrong.

1105
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:28,514
She's in big trouble
and I love her.

1106
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:30,892
I love her.

1107
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,354
Yeah, I do love her.

1108
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:39,234
I have to go, Ethan.
Goodbye.

1109
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:41,027
Yes, so do I.

1110
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:43,738
Hey!

1111
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:51,037
I told you Linda can
take care of herself.

1112
01:35:51,246 --> 01:35:54,290
- You just flew over my head.
- I'll take care of everything.

1113
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,168
I said you just flew over
my head. True or false?

1114
01:35:58,336 --> 01:35:59,295
True.

1115
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:02,131
Like Superman.

1116
01:36:02,507 --> 01:36:03,675
He's my cousin.

1117
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:06,761
- He's your cousin?
- Yes.

1118
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:08,680
I shouldn't be telling you
this though...

1119
01:36:08,888 --> 01:36:10,974
Wait one minute. I mean you can
do the whole number, leap tall

1120
01:36:11,182 --> 01:36:13,393
buildings with a single bound?
And look right through things?

1121
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:15,895
- Yes
- Bend steel bars?

1122
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:18,564
- Yes.
- Whoa!

1123
01:36:20,483 --> 01:36:22,694
- Oh, Selena. I have to go.
- Wait a minute.

1124
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:24,153
- Selena has the Omegahedron.
- Please take me with you.

1125
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:25,863
I have to find Linda.

1126
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:28,992
Well, Nigel. Are we in business?

1127
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:31,995
- I'm thinking about it.
- He probably can't even do it.

1128
01:36:31,995 --> 01:36:35,498
Oh, indeed I can, but I need
the little mystery ball.

1129
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:39,502
- No way.
- No ball, no trick.

1130
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:43,006
Okay. But I keep hold of it.

1131
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:53,057
What is it?

1132
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:54,726
The Burundi Wand.

1133
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:58,062
Pure, unadulterated evil.

1134
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,523
Ready?

1135
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:30,928
But how can you love her?

1136
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:33,431
- You don't even know her.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

1137
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:35,725
And she's in trouble,
then I got no business

1138
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:37,810
standing here,
talking with you.

1139
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:40,063
Even if you are
what you say you are.

1140
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:42,523
Linda is not in trouble.

1141
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:45,818
Look, uh, don't make me
get rough, okay?

1142
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:48,196
You wouldn't
stand a chance.

1143
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:50,323
Please trust me.

1144
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:52,700
Linda is alright.

1145
01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:55,328
How do you know?

1146
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,538
I just...

1147
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:00,083
...know.

1148
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:13,679
Linda.

1149
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:25,733
Oh, my God.

1150
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:27,693
How did you do that?

1151
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:34,242
Ethan.

1152
01:38:37,036 --> 01:38:38,079
Ethan!

1153
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:45,294
Nigel, you are wonderful.

1154
01:38:45,962 --> 01:38:48,381
Pure genius.

1155
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:51,384
You deserve...

1156
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,261
...me.

1157
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:18,494
And something else.

1158
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:28,421
Now, let's get out
of this dump.

1159
01:39:30,298 --> 01:39:31,966
Did you see this thing?
Look at this!

1160
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:34,427
Hey, what's the matter?
Catchin' flies?

1161
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,345
Lucy, look.

1162
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:40,808
One minute nothing.
The next minute this.

1163
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:42,477
What is it?

1164
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:46,481
It's a mountain, Lucy.
Isn't it?

1165
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:48,316
Tell me I'm not seeing things.

1166
01:39:48,524 --> 01:39:49,609
<i>How did it get there, Jimmy?</i>

1167
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:51,486
<i>I don't know. It just appeared.</i>

1168
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:53,654
<i>How can a mountain just appear?</i>

1169
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:56,199
<i>Hey, there's something on the top.</i>

1170
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:58,659
<i>Looks like a castle.</i>

1171
01:39:58,868 --> 01:40:00,536
<i>Looks more like a fortress.</i>

1172
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:50,628
Ethan?

1173
01:40:58,010 --> 01:40:59,011
Ethan.

1174
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:32,461
Ethan!

1175
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:34,422
Ah.

1176
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:02,825
Enjoy your prison,
Supergirl...

1177
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:07,538
...forever and ever.

1178
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:13,044
No, Ethan!

1179
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:15,004
Don't do it!

1180
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:16,839
Ethan!

1181
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:49,265
Where am I?

1182
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:12,306
You can't arrest me
without a warrant.

1183
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:15,059
I'm calling my lawyer.

1184
01:45:23,776 --> 01:45:24,610
Slow down.

1185
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:26,362
We want Selena out.

1186
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:30,032
Smile, lunkhead.
You're not a gardener anymore.

1187
01:45:30,241 --> 01:45:31,951
You're Prince Ethan, now.

1188
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:34,703
How much longer are the telephone lines
going to be closed?

1189
01:45:34,703 --> 01:45:37,206
My wife's very sick in the hospital in Metropolis.
I've got to get through!

1190
01:45:37,706 --> 01:45:39,708
When are you going to reopen the airport?

1191
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:41,293
Are we gonna stand up
to her or not?

1192
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:42,419
Yes.

1193
01:45:42,628 --> 01:45:43,754
Selena must go!

1194
01:45:43,963 --> 01:45:45,589
Who's this little twerpette?

1195
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:47,466
She's someone
who believes in freedom.

1196
01:45:47,716 --> 01:45:49,468
Lucy, it's not a good time
to express yourself.

1197
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:51,512
I don't know, who you are.

1198
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,305
Or what evil force
you represent.

1199
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:56,642
But if you think you can get rid
of anybody who stands up to you.

1200
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:59,687
Just make them disappear.
Like my friend Linda.

1201
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:01,272
Who?

1202
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:02,523
Linda, my roommate.

1203
01:46:02,731 --> 01:46:04,775
She disappeared the day
that mountain showed up.

1204
01:46:07,111 --> 01:46:08,988
The wimp.

1205
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:12,283
Seize them!

1206
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:16,161
Leave her alone!

1207
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:17,538
Drive off.

1208
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,290
Leave her alone.

1209
01:46:19,623 --> 01:46:21,458
Nobody messes around
with Jimmy Olsen!

1210
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:24,295
Now, let go of me.
I'm with the press!

1211
01:48:10,901 --> 01:48:12,152
Zaltar.

1212
01:48:12,361 --> 01:48:13,362
Squirt.

1213
01:48:16,198 --> 01:48:18,993
- Zaltar?
- Squirt.

1214
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:24,039
Zaltar, it's me.
It's-it's Kara.

1215
01:48:24,248 --> 01:48:25,457
I know.

1216
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:29,128
Squirt.

1217
01:48:34,299 --> 01:48:35,843
What is that?

1218
01:48:37,136 --> 01:48:40,556
- Where are we?
- Where are we?

1219
01:48:43,267 --> 01:48:47,271
- Here.
- But where?

1220
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:49,481
Nowhere.

1221
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:53,902
The Phantom Zone?

1222
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:56,488
It's lonely here,
my Kara.

1223
01:48:57,781 --> 01:48:59,074
So sad.

1224
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:03,787
So long ago.

1225
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:07,791
No, Zaltar, only days.

1226
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:10,794
And only days left.

1227
01:49:10,794 --> 01:49:12,796
Zaltar, we have to get back to earth.

1228
01:49:12,796 --> 01:49:15,299
We have to get the omegahedron
and get it back to Argo City.

1229
01:49:16,884 --> 01:49:20,596
I've been here forever
and I shall stay here forever.

1230
01:49:23,807 --> 01:49:28,312
Zaltar, the person who has the
power source, she tricked me.

1231
01:49:28,312 --> 01:49:32,816
- She sent me here and I have to...
- Stay here forever, too.

1232
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:37,321
She sounds formidable,
someone to be reckoned with.

1233
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,823
She's a sorceress, a wicked and desp...

1234
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:43,452
More powerful than the guardians, is she?

1235
01:49:44,953 --> 01:49:49,958
- But the guardians are good.
- Zaltar is bad.

1236
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:54,463
Worse than this wicked sorceress.

1237
01:49:58,467 --> 01:50:01,470
Self-pity.

1238
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:04,973
You always taught me
to have pride, Zaltar.

1239
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:07,101
Pride...

1240
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:09,103
Should a man whose foolish ambitions

1241
01:50:09,103 --> 01:50:14,108
destroy all that he loves have pride?

1242
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:17,611
If you think that, then I am a fool
who has taught you nothing.

1243
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:26,120
I guess our next move is
to take over the world, huh?

1244
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:29,623
- I'm ready when you are, honey.
- First things first.

1245
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:31,625
- Ethan.
- Yes, my darling?

1246
01:50:32,126 --> 01:50:34,628
Don't call me your "darling",
you despise me.

1247
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:38,132
- Bring me the Coffer of Shadow.
- Yes, my darling.

1248
01:50:40,134 --> 01:50:44,638
I think we need something...

1249
01:50:46,682 --> 01:50:47,641
<i>There.</i>

1250
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:53,730
Oh, Jimmy.

1251
01:50:55,149 --> 01:50:56,692
Oh, terrific.

1252
01:50:56,900 --> 01:51:00,237
The old dangling-in-a-cage
routine.

1253
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:02,531
Pathetic, Selena.

1254
01:51:04,324 --> 01:51:07,035
- Who's that guy?
- He's my math teacher, I think.

1255
01:51:08,537 --> 01:51:11,039
I would have thought a ceiling fan, myself.

1256
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:13,041
But it's your house.

1257
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:15,544
What are they for?

1258
01:51:17,546 --> 01:51:19,548
Insurance.

1259
01:51:23,051 --> 01:51:24,595
But you can't just give up.

1260
01:51:24,803 --> 01:51:26,847
You founded a whole city.

1261
01:51:27,055 --> 01:51:29,766
I did, and then
I doomed it to destruction.

1262
01:51:29,975 --> 01:51:32,227
That was an error.
A tragic one.

1263
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:34,563
When you're my age
and you make as many

1264
01:51:34,771 --> 01:51:37,566
tragic errors as I do,
it is a different tune

1265
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:38,734
that you will sing.

1266
01:51:38,942 --> 01:51:40,819
I will not.
I'll never give up.

1267
01:51:41,028 --> 01:51:43,572
I will never spend my entire
life in a place like this.

1268
01:51:43,822 --> 01:51:46,200
- I would die first!
- Strong words.

1269
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:50,120
There are worse things than
dying and I deserve every one.

1270
01:52:07,095 --> 01:52:10,766
- What is this?
- A horse... I think.

1271
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:15,854
On earth I think
it's called a horse.

1272
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:18,732
- And you made this here?
- Mm.

1273
01:52:21,652 --> 01:52:24,112
- Then you haven't given up.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1274
01:52:24,363 --> 01:52:26,615
Earth, Zaltar.
Earth, a tree, a horse.

1275
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:28,242
You keep making things
from earth.

1276
01:52:28,450 --> 01:52:30,661
- The place intrigues me.
- Well, then, let's go there.

1277
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:33,205
Certainly.
When is the next train?

1278
01:52:34,706 --> 01:52:36,041
What is a train?

1279
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:42,506
What's so funny?
Don't laugh at me, Zaltar.

1280
01:52:43,799 --> 01:52:45,509
I'm only laughing
at myself.

1281
01:52:45,717 --> 01:52:48,387
For you, I weep.

1282
01:52:49,638 --> 01:52:51,431
Is this train
a way out of here?

1283
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,059
There is no way
out of here.

1284
01:52:54,726 --> 01:52:57,229
That is the point
of the Phantom Zone.

1285
01:52:57,646 --> 01:53:00,607
My neighbors now: the criminals,
the corrupt, the evil...

1286
01:53:00,816 --> 01:53:01,858
...they're here.

1287
01:53:02,067 --> 01:53:03,652
Over the hill there.

1288
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:05,529
With no way out.

1289
01:53:06,405 --> 01:53:09,908
But, there's always a way out.

1290
01:53:10,117 --> 01:53:12,786
If there's a way in,
there's a way out.

1291
01:53:15,872 --> 01:53:17,541
There is a way.

1292
01:53:18,875 --> 01:53:21,295
- But it's impossible.
- Why?

1293
01:53:21,503 --> 01:53:23,505
No, it wouldn't work.

1294
01:53:23,714 --> 01:53:25,090
You'd be swept into a singularity

1295
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:26,591
if it didn't work. No.

1296
01:53:27,342 --> 01:53:29,970
Forget I mentioned it.
Have a squirt instead.

1297
01:53:35,183 --> 01:53:36,893
I could do it.

1298
01:53:40,022 --> 01:53:42,733
Then, please.
At least teach me how.

1299
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:44,860
There's nothing to teach.
You can't, as they say

1300
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:49,656
practice at the rift.
You get one chance only.

1301
01:53:50,365 --> 01:53:53,035
- The rift?
- Sure? You won't have a squirt?

1302
01:53:53,285 --> 01:53:56,413
Once you get used to it,
I think it's delicious.

1303
01:54:02,919 --> 01:54:04,129
You're right.

1304
01:54:05,172 --> 01:54:07,799
You are absolutely right.

1305
01:54:10,802 --> 01:54:13,847
There is enough doom
and gloom in the air already.

1306
01:54:14,056 --> 01:54:16,266
And it is better
to accept defeat

1307
01:54:16,475 --> 01:54:18,977
than to take a chance and try
like fools to redeem ourselves

1308
01:54:19,269 --> 01:54:21,730
and save our city and all those
who we love there.

1309
01:54:21,938 --> 01:54:24,149
Plus all the people on Earth
that this wicked sorceress

1310
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:27,194
is going to make suffer
just because of us. Cheers!

1311
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:33,450
We could die trying.

1312
01:54:34,868 --> 01:54:36,453
But we won't.

1313
01:54:36,995 --> 01:54:38,997
Come on.

1314
01:55:15,742 --> 01:55:17,119
Tomorrow.

1315
01:55:17,536 --> 01:55:20,414
Thursday. Friday.

1316
01:55:20,622 --> 01:55:22,999
Just like here, we go
for the cops first, right?

1317
01:55:23,208 --> 01:55:24,876
And the army.

1318
01:55:25,085 --> 01:55:28,046
By Saturday, we have
the continental United States,

1319
01:55:28,255 --> 01:55:30,215
Mexico, Canada.

1320
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:35,554
- Wish we'd kept our mouths shut.
- I'm not afraid to die.

1321
01:55:35,554 --> 01:55:38,306
I'm proud of us.

1322
01:55:40,809 --> 01:55:44,813
Lucy, there's something I've always
wanted to say to you.

1323
01:55:45,313 --> 01:55:48,442
Guess I'd better say it now.

1324
01:55:48,442 --> 01:55:53,947
Um, I've been in love with you f...
for many years.

1325
01:55:54,448 --> 01:55:58,952
- You have?
- Mm-hmm.

1326
01:55:59,453 --> 01:56:03,957
Remember when you used to visit
your sister in the newsroom?

1327
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:06,460
You used to put your fingerprints on my lens.

1328
01:56:06,460 --> 01:56:09,963
Remember? I was trying desperately
to get you attention.

1329
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:12,466
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1330
01:56:14,468 --> 01:56:18,472
You mean, we could have...
we could have been...

1331
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:21,475
You know what...
all this time?

1332
01:56:21,475 --> 01:56:23,977
You betcha.

1333
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:30,484
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You were supposed to guess.

1334
01:56:37,491 --> 01:56:39,493
- Aah!
- Careful!

1335
01:56:39,493 --> 01:56:42,496
Kara! Kara! My child!

1336
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:45,999
Where is it, Zaltar?
Where's the rift?

1337
01:56:45,999 --> 01:56:49,002
- Where is it?
- Everywhere. And nowhere.

1338
01:56:50,504 --> 01:56:54,007
We don't find the rift, we make it.

1339
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:58,011
Zaltar, now of all times,
no double-talk, I beg you.

1340
01:56:58,011 --> 01:57:00,013
Double-talk?

1341
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:04,017
Our life is too short to squander it
on double-talk.

1342
01:57:04,017 --> 01:57:07,521
Look: The Phantom Zone.

1343
01:57:09,022 --> 01:57:12,025
Get up.

1344
01:57:24,829 --> 01:57:27,249
Oh, my God, Selena.
It's the box.

1345
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:29,709
- Hush it up.
- No.

1346
01:57:30,293 --> 01:57:34,047
What the box wants, the box gets.

1347
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:51,648
What is it?

1348
01:57:51,856 --> 01:57:53,525
Fascinating.

1349
01:57:56,361 --> 01:57:57,946
I don't know.

1350
01:57:59,656 --> 01:58:01,074
Is this it?

1351
01:58:01,283 --> 01:58:02,450
Is this the way out?

1352
01:58:02,659 --> 01:58:06,413
Not yet!
This is the Quantum Vortex!

1353
01:58:07,122 --> 01:58:10,041
We must risk our destruction in it.

1354
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:14,921
To move mountains,
you must make sacrifices.

1355
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:17,048
Zaltar, I'm scared!

1356
01:58:17,424 --> 01:58:19,926
Accept your fears.

1357
01:58:20,218 --> 01:58:22,345
Confront your demons.

1358
01:58:22,637 --> 01:58:26,182
Find your destiny
in the maelstrom!

1359
01:59:16,608 --> 01:59:18,818
Zaltar, I can't.
I can't.

1360
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:22,072
You... can!

1361
01:59:46,888 --> 01:59:49,140
Two specks.
Look!

1362
01:59:55,438 --> 01:59:56,981
What do I do?

1363
01:59:58,024 --> 02:00:01,361
How do you murder someone
in the Phantom Zone?

1364
02:00:05,490 --> 02:00:08,326
She's with some old guy,
it looks like.

1365
02:00:08,535 --> 02:00:11,121
Move, huh.
Come on!

1366
02:00:11,329 --> 02:00:12,914
Calm down, okay.

1367
02:00:13,456 --> 02:00:17,210
Ah. This is what I want.

1368
02:00:18,461 --> 02:00:21,256
The Salian Fireballs.

1369
02:00:21,464 --> 02:00:25,427
Page 321. Chapter 6.

1370
02:00:40,442 --> 02:00:41,443
Whoa!

1371
02:00:42,652 --> 02:00:44,154
What is that?

1372
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:49,951
Watch out!

1373
02:01:17,937 --> 02:01:19,564
"Power of Rainmaking". No!

1374
02:01:19,773 --> 02:01:21,107
"How to separate
husband and wife."

1375
02:01:21,316 --> 02:01:22,817
No, not now.
Not now!

1376
02:01:23,026 --> 02:01:25,904
Well, you better find something
fast, like an atom bomb.

1377
02:01:37,957 --> 02:01:39,000
I found it.

1378
02:01:40,877 --> 02:01:45,507
"Summoning... the demon storm."

1379
02:01:45,715 --> 02:01:48,051
Hurry... go.

1380
02:01:48,259 --> 02:01:51,596
Higher girl, higher.

1381
02:01:51,805 --> 02:01:55,767
- Come with me!
- I am with you!

1382
02:01:55,975 --> 02:01:57,477
On, girl.

1383
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:12,200
I am with you.

1384
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:17,747
Zaltar!

1385
02:03:11,259 --> 02:03:12,635
Oh, thank God.

1386
02:03:16,264 --> 02:03:19,601
You've had your fun, Selena.
The game is finished.

1387
02:03:19,809 --> 02:03:21,102
Hardly.

1388
02:03:21,311 --> 02:03:24,397
One false step, bluebird.

1389
02:03:24,606 --> 02:03:28,776
And even if you don't,
your friends will get the point.

1390
02:03:31,571 --> 02:03:32,947
Hey, no!

1391
02:03:40,371 --> 02:03:41,331
I don't like this.

1392
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,250
Don't worry, Lucy.
Don't worry.

1393
02:03:46,252 --> 02:03:48,254
I wouldn't if I were you.

1394
02:03:48,463 --> 02:03:50,840
Well, you're <i>not</i> me.

1395
02:03:57,472 --> 02:03:58,765
- Oh!
- Ah!

1396
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:02,101
Quick, get out of the way.
Into the alcove over there.

1397
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:04,687
- Come on, out.
- Hurry, Jimmy. Hurry.

1398
02:04:08,691 --> 02:04:11,235
The Omegahedron, Selena.

1399
02:04:11,444 --> 02:04:12,862
I want it.

1400
02:04:13,154 --> 02:04:17,784
Well, then, Supergirl.
You shall have it.

1401
02:04:42,892 --> 02:04:43,851
Ah!

1402
02:04:51,025 --> 02:04:51,985
Ah!

1403
02:05:03,746 --> 02:05:05,581
Supergirl, above you.
Look out!

1404
02:05:10,086 --> 02:05:10,962
Ah!

1405
02:05:19,804 --> 02:05:23,224
I think I'll be going.
If you'll excuse me.

1406
02:05:28,479 --> 02:05:31,065
That's what I said.
I'm staying, I'm staying.

1407
02:05:45,079 --> 02:05:47,373
You have no friends, Selena.

1408
02:05:47,582 --> 02:05:49,917
You treat everyone as if
they were put on this earth

1409
02:05:50,126 --> 02:05:51,586
to serve you.

1410
02:05:52,211 --> 02:05:54,213
More or less,
I think they were.

1411
02:05:55,298 --> 02:05:57,300
You included.

1412
02:06:00,678 --> 02:06:02,764
Power of Shadow.

1413
02:06:03,181 --> 02:06:05,099
Appear!

1414
02:06:26,329 --> 02:06:28,247
Power of Shadow...

1415
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:33,461
...destroy her!

1416
02:07:13,626 --> 02:07:14,669
Ah!

1417
02:07:14,877 --> 02:07:15,753
Oh!

1418
02:07:29,225 --> 02:07:31,602
I... can't.

1419
02:07:33,146 --> 02:07:35,148
I can't!

1420
02:07:35,356 --> 02:07:37,608
<i>You can!</i>

1421
02:07:39,443 --> 02:07:41,696
<i>On, girl.</i>

1422
02:07:50,788 --> 02:07:51,831
Yes!

1423
02:08:02,008 --> 02:08:04,594
Confront her with it!
It's the only way!

1424
02:08:20,318 --> 02:08:21,569
O-oh!

1425
02:08:35,625 --> 02:08:37,251
No, no, no!

1426
02:08:47,887 --> 02:08:49,305
Argh!

1427
02:09:27,218 --> 02:09:27,969
Oh!

1428
02:09:28,844 --> 02:09:30,179
I have to go.

1429
02:09:30,388 --> 02:09:32,181
I have to return this
to where it belongs.

1430
02:09:32,431 --> 02:09:33,933
<i>And I must ask you all something.</i>

1431
02:09:34,141 --> 02:09:37,103
It's alright, Supergirl.
We never saw you.

1432
02:09:37,311 --> 02:09:38,813
We never even heard of you.

1433
02:09:39,188 --> 02:09:40,314
Thank you.

1434
02:09:40,856 --> 02:09:42,775
<i>Ethan, Linda, she...</i>

1435
02:09:42,984 --> 02:09:45,111
Well, she had to leave
in a hurry, but she...

1436
02:09:45,319 --> 02:09:46,988
You don't have to say a word.

1437
02:09:47,822 --> 02:09:49,073
I know.

1438
02:09:55,121 --> 02:09:57,039
I'll explain about Linda.

1439
02:09:58,624 --> 02:10:00,001
Thank you, Ethan.

1440
02:10:01,419 --> 02:10:03,045
Take care of yourself, kiddo.

1441
02:10:26,402 --> 02:10:29,363
Wow! That was some kiss.

1442
02:10:29,572 --> 02:10:30,448
Wow!

1443
02:10:36,287 --> 02:10:38,789
Better get a shot of where
that mountain used to be.

1444
02:10:38,789 --> 02:10:42,793
Oh, Jimmy. Can't you stop thinking
of your career for a second?

1445
02:10:43,294 --> 02:10:44,795
Haven't we wasted
enough time?

1446
02:10:50,301 --> 02:10:53,804
Nigel! I'm so glad to see you.

1447
02:10:53,804 --> 02:10:55,806
I've been trying to find you.

1448
02:10:55,973 --> 02:10:59,977
I wanted to know more about the little bone
in the right side of a frog.

1449
02:10:59,977 --> 02:11:02,980
Uh, it's a toad, my dear.
A red toad.

1450
02:11:03,064 --> 02:11:06,817
And that little bone is
in the left hand side.

1451
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:10,946
Goodbye, Linda.

1452
02:11:42,937 --> 02:11:45,022
- You guys take it easy, okay?
- Take care.

1453
02:11:45,022 --> 02:11:47,024
- Good luck!
- Bye. See you soon.

1454
02:11:47,316 --> 02:11:49,026
Take it easy.
