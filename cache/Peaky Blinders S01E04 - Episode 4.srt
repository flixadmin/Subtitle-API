1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,280
When I've achieved what I set out to achieve
I'll let you know where to find the guns.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,780
So what shall I do?

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,340
Get close to him.
Find out where those guns are hidden.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,980
Raise a hand if you want to strike!
CHEERING

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Freddie Thorne is at the very
top of my list.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,220
Well, cross him off.
I'll make him part of our deal.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,340
To hell with them.

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,780
The more they try to stop us,
the madder I'll be.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,980
Times like these, a communist
in the family is bad for business.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,120
You have to leave the city.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,060
You are also at war with
the Lees, Mr Kimber, am I right?

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,860
Together we can beat them.
Divided, maybe not.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,840
SHOUTING

God, he's getting big now.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,280
Do you still love me even though
I am fat? No. Not at all?

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,500
You married me,
now you're stuck with me.

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,460
So, how was London?

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,380
It's crackling with revolution.

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,820
The Poplar docks are on strike.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,160
Did our friends give us
what we asked for?

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,620
How much? £200.

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,420
Who did you meet?

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,820
An attache from the Russian embassy.

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,360
In a Chinese restaurant.

32
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,060
Our revolution is international.

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,320
And it grows by the day.

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,380
Jeremiah, Jeremiah...
What do you see?

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,980
Your sister
and Freddie got back this morning.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,980
I tried following them...

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,620
but Freddie's so good
at getting away.

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,660
He's like a fish.

39
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,640
Right, well, keep fishing, eh?

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,600
Last bets now!
Don't spend your rent money, Charlie!

41
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,820
That's your starters, gentlemen.

42
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
No more bets.

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,860
I was here on time. Finished.

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,620
I've had a tip-off, I need this bet.

45
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,460
The race has started. Please.

46
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,300
No!

47
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,460
Fine.

48
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,940
Get rid of him.

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,680
We said, "no", now get out! All
right. All right, I'm off. I'm off.

50
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,600
Night, lads. See you tomorrow.

51
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,660
It's a good day.

52
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,740
Where's John?

53
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,660
John is in the Garrison.

54
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,360
He says he wants
a meeting about a family matter.

55
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,900
After he's said his piece

56
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,740
he'll come back and take his place
with Scudboat.

57
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,840
Scudboat? John will be here in ten
minutes. All right. Five.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wait.

59
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,200
Good boy.

60
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
John?

61
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,300
SCREAMING

62
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,920
Put that down! Put that down!

63
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,580
This is for Cheltenham.

64
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,500
We're just taking back what's ours.

65
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,640
There's money here.
Search everywhere.

66
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,180
All right, John.
There's only one right... No.

67
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,900
There's only one man
guarding the house.

68
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,160
What's troubling you?

69
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,380
Polly, you know what it's
been like since Martha died.

70
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,380
God takes the best first.

71
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,560
The truth is, my kids have been
running bloody rings around me.

72
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,400
Running barefoot with the dogs
until all hours.

73
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,940
Pol, give him ten bob, some shoes.
Is that it, John?

74
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,440
Tommy, we'd be better doing
this without you.

75
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
Now, what's your point?

76
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,880
What the kids need is a mother.

77
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
So, that's why I'm getting married.

78
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,140
Does this poor girl
know you're going to marry her

79
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,300
or are you going to spring it
on her all of a sudden?

80
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,700
I've already proposed
and she said "yes".

81
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,360
I think there's a shell
about to land and go bang.

82
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,580
It's, er... It's Lizzie Stark.

83
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,920
THEY CHUCKLE

84
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,180
John, Lizzie Stark's a strong woman

85
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,460
and I am sure she provides a fine
service for her customers.

86
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,020
I WON'T hear the word.

87
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,540
Understand? Do not use that word.

88
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,880
What word is that, John?

89
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,580
You know what word that is.

90
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,460
Everybody bloody knows...

91
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,980
Everybody can go to hell...

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,580
"Whore"? That word? Or "prostitute"?

93
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,420
How about that one?

94
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,860
Right, I want it known...

95
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,540
if anyone calls her a "whore" again,

96
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,020
I will push the barrel
of my revolver

97
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,740
down their throats and blow the word
back down into their hearts.

98
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,100
Men and their cocks
never cease to amaze me.

99
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,460
John, Lizzie Stark never did
a day's work vertical.

100
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,460
She's changed. All right.
People change.

101
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,900
Like wi-wi-with religion.

102
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,660
Oh, Lizzie Stark
has got religion, eh?

103
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,980
No, no, she doesn't
have religion. But...

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,180
Well, she loves me.

105
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,040
Now, listen, Tommy.
I won't do it without your blessing.

106
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,800
But of all the people in the
world...

107
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,360
..I want you to see it...

108
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,060
..as brave.

109
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,500
It's brave all right.

110
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,620
"Brave" is going
where no man has gone before.

111
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,900
With Lizzy Stark, John, that is
REALLY not what you'll be doing.

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Listen, Tommy.
Welcome her to the family.

113
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,160
As someone who's had a hard life.

114
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,720
All right? Because, I need someone.

115
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,740
All right, the kids need someone.

116
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,140
CHILD: Tommy! We've been done over!

117
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,360
What?

118
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,540
Jesus Christ.

119
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,860
What the bloody hell happened here?

120
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,720
The Lees. All of them.

121
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,880
Cousins, nephews,
even the bastards.

122
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,840
They've taken anything they can
lay their hands on.

123
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,960
Four cash boxes.

124
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,540
They left these....

125
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,540
Wire cutters.
Why would they leave wire cutters?

126
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,640
Nobody move.

127
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,420
I think our friends
are playing the game.

128
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,040
What game?
Aunt Pol. Don't touch anything.

129
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,080
Erasmus Lee was in France.

130
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,320
Shit.

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,040
When we gave up
ground to the Germans...

132
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,880
..we'd leave behind booby traps,
set up with wires.

133
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,160
And we'd leave wire cutters
as part of the joke.

134
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,480
Somewhere in here there's
a hand grenade... Holy Jesus.

135
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,600
..attached to a wire.

136
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't move any chairs
or open any doors.

137
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,600
Go easy, John boy. Easy.

138
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Boys, no. It's not in here.

139
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,340
If it was in here,
it would have blown by now.

140
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,640
It was my name on that bullet
Erasmus sent.

141
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,440
He's set a trap all right.

142
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,840
But he's set it up just for me.

143
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,280
Finn?

144
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,640
Finn, stay exactly where you are.

145
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,000
I was pretending I was you.

146
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,100
Which door did you open to
come in, Finn?

147
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,640
I didn't. I climbed in.

148
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,720
I want you to climb out exactly
the same way you climbed in, OK?

149
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,800
No, no... Finn!

150
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,880
Clear!

151
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,460
What happened? Are you all right?
It could have killed us.

152
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,600
THEY PANT

153
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,420
That's why you should never pretend
to be me.

154
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,240
OK? OK?

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,260
You can at least say thank you.

164
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,320
It's easier to get to see
the Pope these days.

165
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,260
Put your hand on the Bible.

166
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,400
I don't believe.

167
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,640
Anyway, I didn't come here to lie.

168
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,960
This war is cutting us all up.

169
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,880
SHE LAUGHS

170
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,260
You're all children.

171
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,100
I say enough.

172
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
Your boys tried to kill me -
it didn't work.

173
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,980
No wonder you won't touch a Bible.

174
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,660
I have ambitions.
You want to play a switch.

175
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,220
I need your boys.

176
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,500
For what?

177
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,660
Kimber's not the brains.

178
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,020
There's a gadze who runs the races.

179
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,080
I'm collecting smart people.
But I need strong men too.

180
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,940
Now your boys should know this,

181
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,500
we now get the winner in one
of every three races

182
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,540
before the race even starts.

183
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,620
No need for chalkers or rafflers.

184
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,900
I'm talking certainties.

185
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,460
You come in here boasting
you're going to do someone down

186
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,600
and in the same breath you ask me
to trust you.

187
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,200
On my mother's side, we are kin.

188
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,960
Ada, can you do my back?

189
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,520
Ada?

190
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,700
I know what was in the envelope.

191
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,300
I looked. Money.

192
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,300
And that bloke we met in London who
you said was a Frenchman.

193
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,700
He was Russian.
I'm not an idiot, Freddie.

194
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,260
How is it you take all the risks

195
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,980
and Stanly Chapman gets the money?

196
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,120
It's money for the cause.

197
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,060
You're blind.

198
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,420
I would be if your brothers had
anything to do with it.

199
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,140
This isn't about them.
This is about you.

200
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,960
And me. And...this.

201
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,160
You're a dreamer, Freddie.

202
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,580
You give money away
while we rot in here...

203
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,040
and you talk about revolution.

204
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,120
I need to know.

205
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,680
Who are you loyal to, Freddie?

206
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,920
I said, "Who are you loyal to?"

207
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,240
DOOR OPENS

208
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,800
Did you have something to
do with this?

209
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,900
I asked an acquaintance
for an address.

210
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,700
She said she would only give it to
me anonymously.

211
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,160
She was afraid of the
consequences.

212
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,360
Whose address is it? Tommy, I'd like
to suggest a strategy.

213
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,640
Your message said you have
an address for me.

214
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,000
Anonymous tip off.

215
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,640
The address of Stanly Chapman.

216
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,940
You promised me Freddie Thorne.

217
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,460
This is instead of Freddie Thorne.
No deal.

218
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Inspector, Stanly Chapman is
a bigger fish than Freddie Thorne.

219
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,000
He is currently holding
£200 in cash.

220
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,360
Given to the Communist party
by the Russian Government.

221
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,820
That's right,

222
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,100
Chapman has snow on his boots

223
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,640
and all you'll need is a shovel.

224
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,120
If he talks, you'll have proof.

225
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,160
You might even get that medal.

226
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,440
Now...

227
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,680
..before I give you the address...

228
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,320
..I want your word...

229
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,120
..that you will let Freddie Thorne
and my sister leave the city.

230
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,920
Very well. You have my word.

231
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,180
I'd say our little truce
is proving productive

232
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,560
for both of us, Inspector.

233
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,380
I get the information...

234
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,480
and protection and you...

235
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,600
Well...

236
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,400
..you get Bolsheviks.

237
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,880
But on a more pressing matter...

238
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,600
I'm afraid that Mr Churchill
is becoming impatient.

239
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
And I fear that...

240
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,040
..if you don't give back those stolen
weapons soon...

241
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,660
..I will be replaced.

242
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,220
That would be the finish of me,
that's for sure.

243
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,820
When my business with Kimber is done

244
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,100
the guns will be returned.
That was the deal.

245
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,040
Then I am in your hands. Completely.

246
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,880
You hold all the cards.

247
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,380
But I hope to God that my dismissal

248
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,540
doesn't come before your decision
to hand back those guns.

249
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,400
I say this for your sake,
because...

250
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,520
..if I were to be fired
and it were your fault...

251
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
..I would do things that would
shame the devil.

252
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,940
HE CHUCKLES

253
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,200
My fury is a thing to behold.

254
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,740
On my last day in power, for example,

255
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,660
I would see to it that you
and your scum brothers

256
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,000
have your heads stoved in
with mallets and spades.

257
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,640
And your sister too.

258
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,200
That baby inside her
would be of no consequence to me.

259
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,040
The only one to be spared...

260
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
..would be your little brother Finn.

261
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,900
He would however
be lifted as a juvenile

262
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,320
and dumped into that part of the
adult prison...

263
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,360
..where men have most appetite for
boys like him.

264
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,280
That would be a dark day indeed,
Mr Shelby.

265
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,560
If my dismissal comes
before YOUR decision.

266
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,360
Do you understand?

267
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,720
And know this...

268
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,720
..the clock is ticking.

269
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,080
Stanly, it's the police.
Stanly, get here!

270
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,960
You're under arrest, mate!
You bastards!

271
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,760
MAN SCREAMS

272
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,320
Look what we found.

273
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,760
It seems Stanly Chapman really
does have snow on his boots.

274
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,960
Mr Chapman...

275
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,760
..you're fucked.

276
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,360
He still refuses to say where
it came from.

277
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,760
I'm sure, with a little persuasion,
he'll tell us everything he knows.

278
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,720
Including the whereabouts
of Freddie Thorne.

279
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,320
Sir?
Your face is a picture.

280
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,540
I thought you had done a deal.

281
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,340
Oh, is that is what you thought.

282
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,760
Well, you gave your word.

283
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,240
My word?

284
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,660
Do people still talk about
such things this idiotic century?

285
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,720
My word to who?

286
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,600
To a Peaky Blinder?

287
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,740
Now, go and interrogate Mr Chapman

288
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,840
until he tells us where we can find
Freddie Thorne and his wife.

289
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,400
The source of the money
is of secondary importance.

290
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,760
You think my campaign against
Shelby has become personal?

291
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,980
Correct.

292
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,120
"Spot-on", as they say
in London society.

293
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,820
Now, go and interrogate Mr Chapman

294
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,720
and do not make the mistake
of being too gentle.

295
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,360
Right, sir.

296
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,180
DOOR OPENS

297
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,280
DOOR CLOSES

298
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,120
Today's her birthday.

299
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,200
I know you never miss it.

300
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,900
Then I'm lucky you're not a copper.

301
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,260
What do you want?

302
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,240
I came to warn you.

303
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,700
They've lifted Stanly Chapman.

304
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,620
How do you know?
Police don't spill that information.

305
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,740
I know cos it was me and Tommy who
tipped them off. Tommy did a deal.

306
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,940
In return for safe passage
for you and Ada he's given them
Stanly and the money.

307
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,160
Money? What money?

308
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,400
Who told you about the money?
Who do you think?

309
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,660
Yeah, it was Ada's idea.
That's how desperate she is

310
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,360
to get out of that rat-hole
you're keeping her in.

311
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,180
She doesn't mind if you knew
she just didn't want to be here
when you found out.

312
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,020
Sometimes the women have to
take over. Like in the war.

313
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,260
Who the hell do you think
you are, you fucking Shelbys.

314
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,440
Don't swear over
your mother's grave.

315
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,300
You play your tune, you expect
the whole world to dance to it.

316
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,460
You don't have time for this,
Freddie.

317
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,500
You did a deal for me?

318
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,620
Don't flatter yourself. For Ada.

319
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,540
And you think this copper
will keep his word.

320
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,900
If he does, you're safe. If he
doesn't, Chapman will give you up,

321
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,480
you'll still have to leave town.
Same result.

322
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,940
So neat(!) So leave.

323
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,540
Except there's one thing
that you got wrong.

324
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,340
Stanly won't be able to give up my
address because he doesn't know it.

325
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,060
That's how it works.

326
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,880
None of us know each other's
addresses.

327
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,160
So, you've wasted your fucking time.

328
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,140
They'll keep beating him and beating
him for information he doesn't have.

329
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,160
All you've done is sign the death
warrant of a good man.

330
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,900
So, you won't leave.

331
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,300
No! I won't fucking leave!

332
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,240
If you want me out of Birmingham
it'll have to be in a wooden box.

333
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,320
You lay a hand on our Ada,
I'll put you in a wooden box myself.

334
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,480
You raised a stubborn one there,
Irene.

335
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,440
You told me to carry on.
I wanted to stop.

336
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,760
He had some kind of seizure.

337
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,760
So, you killed him?

338
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,800
Did he give you an address?

339
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,820
What's the matter with you?
He fell down some stairs.

340
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,380
This is not bloody Belfast!

341
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,740
Not yet, but if men like him get
their way, it soon will be.

342
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,360
So, find some stairs, throw him
down, and call the coroner.

343
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,540
Use Grayson.

344
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,180
If he has any awkward questions

345
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,680
ask about the welfare
of his mistress in Saltley.

346
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,840
That'll shut him up.

347
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,340
To think I used to live in
a shit-hole like this.

348
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,140
Bloody animals.

349
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,520
But the Shelbys really
are doing an excellent job for us.

350
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,620
We haven't lost a single penny
to rafflers or chalkers

351
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,620
in eight race meetings.

352
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,060
The bookies are purring.

353
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,680
So, we throw the dog a bone.

354
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,160
I think so.

355
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,440
Mr Kimber. Mr Roberts.
Come and have a look around.

356
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,340
After you.

357
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,460
Come on, Fred.

358
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,180
You can feed half of Birmingham
with what you have had for lunch.

359
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Get back to work.

360
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,060
We heard the Lees
had turned you over.

361
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,760
You shouldn't listen to gossip,
Mr Kimber. This way.

362
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,120
Business is good.

363
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,260
Especially since now you know
which horse is going to win

364
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,880
before you set the odds.
Your information
is very much appreciated.

365
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,080
Right, well, where are they?

366
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,520
John, Lovelock, Scudboat, in here.

367
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,060
This is my team.

368
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,020
They will take up their pitch
at your convenience, Mr Kimber.

369
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,180
John is the book.
Scudboat is the bag man.

370
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,320
And, of course,
we bring our own protection.

371
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,520
Warwick, next Saturday. At least
fifty yards from the beer tent.

372
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,600
Gentlemen...

373
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
And lady.

374
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,020
I have in my hand a legal
betting licence.

375
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,400
Issued by the board of control.

376
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,900
The Shelby family has its
first legal racetrack pitch.

377
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,760
CHEERING

378
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,620
We're a business, Pol.

379
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,760
Congratulations. There you go.

380
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,300
Congratulations.

381
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,040
30, 40, 50...

382
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,540
These cigarettes have
a strange smell, Arthur.

383
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,540
They smell like rotting water.
And look.

384
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,980
Rats have gotten some of them.

385
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,700
They're stolen, are they not?

386
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,260
Don't ask. They smell
because you keep them on a boat.

387
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,480
What do you care? Now, can you come
and check my adding up, please?

388
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,180
You know, you should make a new
start with this place.

389
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,780
Do it properly. These cigarettes
are not fit to sell.

390
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,460
Smells like Gallipoli.

391
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,700
You should find
a new place to store them.

392
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,520
It has to be far away from coppers.

393
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,480
But not rats?
All the wharves have rats, Grace.

394
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,360
What's wrong with a dry warehouse?
Tommy's orders.

395
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,640
What orders? Always keep contraband
near to petrol boat moorings.

396
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,260
Don't boats get searched?

397
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,140
We moor them at junctions...

398
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,340
so there's more than one way out.

399
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,880
No locks within a mile
so we can move that stuff fast.

400
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,700
Your brother doesn't obey the law,
but he has rules.

401
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,000
A precise man, your brother.

402
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,400
Is my adding up right?
It is now.

403
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,900
SERGEANT MOSS: One.

404
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,540
Two.

405
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,400
Three...and four.

406
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,980
And we'll search them one by one.

407
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
MUSIC: "Broken Boy Soldier"
by The Raconteurs

408
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,320
Please, Lord,
let that which I seek be found here.

409
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,540
♪ I'm pulling my questions
from my shelf

410
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,940
♪ I'm asking forgiveness

411
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,540
♪ I'm asking about it for myself

412
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,500
♪ And I want you to know this... ♪

413
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,080
Not so much as a bullet, sir.
Just more cigarettes and whisky.

414
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,080
Arthur tells me
you've been asking questions...

415
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,060
..about how we run our business.

416
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,620
And how we get our booze
and where we keep it.

417
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,000
I am just trying to help.

418
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,800
Let's you and me go for a walk.

419
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,920
Where to? Come on.

420
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,000
Why here?

421
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,240
You're a good Catholic girl,
aren't you?

422
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,840
Yes. Well, then you know it's here
people come to confess.

423
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,760
After you.

424
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,000
Well, here it is, Grace.

425
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
I confess.

426
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,760
I need someone.

427
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,860
Kimber has an adviser
by the name of Roberts.

428
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,580
He talks well.

429
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,820
Keeps the accounts.

430
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,960
Runs the legal side of the business.
And you need a Roberts.

431
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,620
Arthur tells me you have ideas.
I'm not an accountant. Nor a lawyer.

432
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,600
No.

433
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,600
No, but you have something I need.
Class.

434
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,900
I need someone who looks right
at the big meetings.

435
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,540
Epsom, Ascot...

436
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,700
Is a job interview? Arthur says
you're good with numbers.

437
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,240
Well, that's relative.
He is quite poor.

438
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,280
You keep the books in order.
They were chaotic.

439
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,800
But you're a liar.

440
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,660
No Catholic girl would
enter a church

441
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,360
and forget to make
the sign of the cross.

442
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,060
You are very perceptive.

443
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,420
First, you lied about that pub
you used worked in.

444
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,440
Now I find out you're a Protestant.

445
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,420
Do you care?

446
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,300
No.

447
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,440
I lied to fit in.

448
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,180
You pull a pint like someone
who's thinking about it.

449
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,280
This is not an interview,
it is an interrogation. Sit down.

450
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,960
Look, Grace...

451
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,780
HE SIGHS

452
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,440
You washed up in a place you don't
belong for whatever reason.

453
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,520
My good fortune. And perhaps mine.

454
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,220
You know that most of what I do
is illegal. I'm not blind.

455
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,400
And yet, you'd still be
willing to work for me?

456
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,600
Are you offering me the job?

457
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,680
Then I accept.

458
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,800
There's something else you
should know.

459
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,880
A very important detail
about my reasons for employing you.

460
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,200
You disappoint me.

461
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,240
Do you resign?

462
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,840
No.

463
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,240
My appetite for the work
has only increased.

464
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,060
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

465
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,880
Tomorrow I'll show you around.

466
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,320
Lizzie. Hello, Lizzie.

467
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,260
That bag looks heavy, jump in.

468
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,420
Kids' teas.

469
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,220
You like kids?

470
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,000
Yeah. Good,
cos John's got four of them.

471
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,200
It's all right. I'm not going to try
to talk you out of it.

472
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,780
I just want to talk.

473
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,700
You're not against us?

474
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,580
John is his own man.

475
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,680
And you are your own woman.

476
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,020
Now, Lizzie...

477
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,200
since I came back from France,
I've come to you on many occasions.

478
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,160
Tommy, you didn't tell him?
No, I didn't tell him.

479
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,760
Just like you didn't tell him.

480
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,060
Now, why didn't you tell him, Lizzie?

481
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,140
Why didn't you tell him

482
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,960
that you'd been serving his brother
for the past two years?

483
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,480
Because the past is the past.

484
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,240
I don't want to lose him.
He's a good man.

485
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,260
That was the answer I was hoping
you'd give - the past is the past.

486
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,780
You see our John says
you've changed. And I believe him.

487
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,000
And that's good. Change is good.

488
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,520
These are new times I'm told.

489
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,700
So I wish you both
every happiness.

490
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,880
And I want you to see that
as my wedding gift to you.

491
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,800
And our farewell
to pleasures gone by.

492
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,280
You mean...

493
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,920
..one last time?

494
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,920
One last time. You and me.

495
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,800
It's eight bloody pounds.

496
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,440
So, where shall we go?

497
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,200
Tommy, shall we go to my lodging?

498
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,400
So, the past is not the past.

499
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,660
You can keep the money, Lizzie.
Just get out of the car.

500
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,200
Tommy, please... Get out of the car.
I love him, Tommy. Really.

501
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,760
Really.

502
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,280
John will make his own decision.

503
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,200
But he will have the facts.

504
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,920
Your brother is ten times
the man you are!

505
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,200
Of that I have no doubt.

506
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,120
He is obviously not stupid.

507
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,340
All we found was stolen tobacco
and whisky. Which you left in place.

508
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,860
Of course.

509
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,400
I would never endanger you.

510
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,040
You are doing well, Grace.

511
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,240
I've been working on Arthur -
he's easier. Than Thomas. Yes.

512
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Less intelligent.

513
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,780
Yes.

514
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,080
Is that a word you would
use about Thomas? It's your word.

515
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,600
He has promoted me.

516
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,440
He wants me to be his book-keeper
and secretary.

517
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,120
A cut-throat gangster
with a secretary.

518
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,980
The pretensions of these hoodlums
are quite breathtaking!

519
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,660
Are they not?

520
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,040
Yes. Quite breathtaking.

521
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,340
He has obviously fallen quite
heavily for you.

522
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,980
I thought you would be pleased.

523
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,300
I just hope you remember
who you are dealing with here.

524
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,040
A man who cuts off ears
and cuts out tongues.

525
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,360
I know what he is, sir.

526
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,760
The difficulty with undercover work,
Grace, is to remember what you are.

527
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,320
I come here with good news
and I get this.

528
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,640
Grace!

529
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,780
Tommy. I need a favour.

530
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,580
I want to borrow the car.

531
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,740
I want to take Lizzie for a ride
in the country with the kids.

532
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,840
We're going to celebrate getting
the licence. Not a problem, John.

533
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,120
I'll need the keys.

534
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,320
Look, John, you're my brother...

535
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,480
There's something
I have to tell you.

536
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,820
Yesterday on the front
seat of that car,

537
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,440
I offered Lizzie some money.

538
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,800
And, John, she said "yes".

539
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,980
Now, that's a fact.

540
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,780
You do with it what want.

541
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,260
Take the keys.

542
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,020
Take Lizzie to the country.

543
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,920
Marry her if you want.

544
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,360
But you have to know...

545
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,440
..she said "yes".

546
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,880
Get another glass.

547
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,200
Can you make a toast?

548
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,780
I'm Irish,
I can make a million toasts.

549
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,860
May you be in heaven
a full half hour

550
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,120
before the devil
knows you're dead.

551
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,980
What are we celebrating?

552
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,440
Contract of employment.

553
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,500
Book-keeper.
Shelby Brothers Limited.

554
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,000
I don't like that word, "Limited".

555
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,040
To be respectable, you have to be
"Limited". That's what worries me.

556
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,880
I had the phone put in.

557
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,200
It's in the back.

558
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,920
If we knew someone else who
had a phone, we could call them.

559
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,680
And since we are celebrating...

560
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,640
..I had this delivered from
Rackham's Department Store.

561
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,320
Will you open it?

562
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,900
No.

563
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,280
Save it for a special occasion.

564
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,300
Right, your first job for the
company.

565
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,940
I want you to get that to my sister.

566
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,100
I don't see her?

567
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,280
No-one does. She is hiding from me.

568
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,540
I am told she goes to
a bathhouse on Montague Street

569
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,500
on woman-only days.

570
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,260
She goes in disguise,
so I need to get someone inside.

571
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,320
What am I delivering?

572
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,340
It's an invitation to a family
occasion. I want her there.

573
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,700
So, tell her there will be a truce.

574
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,200
Am I delivering bait for a trap?

575
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,700
If you check that contract

576
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,580
I think you'll find it doesn't say
anything about asking questions.

577
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,440
Just give her the invitation.

578
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
And put that in the cupboard
until I say.

579
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,200
DOOR OPENS

580
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,420
What the hell, John? I couldn't
get it lit. Couldn't even do that.

581
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,780
Why would you want to be
smoking that for? Same reason as you.

582
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,800
Pain in the head.

583
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,040
I spoke to Lizzie.

584
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,560
I told her what you told me.

585
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,000
She said, "Your brother Tommy
is a dirty liar."

586
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,340
But then I spoke to her sister
and her cousin.

587
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,480
Bought them a couple drinks.

588
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,200
"Just a few of regulars," they said.
"That's all."

589
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,860
"To keep the wolf from the door,

590
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,800
"she still sees
a couple of regulars."

591
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,960
You must think I'm an idiot.

592
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,260
I think you're the first
Shelby in history...

593
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,040
to have a legal licence for anything.

594
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,920
What would our granddad say, eh?

595
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,640
He'd be turning in his grave.

596
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,020
HE IMITATES HIS GRANDDAD:
"Honest bloody money? Eh?"

597
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,460
"In this house? Here?"

598
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,080
You always used to do voices
when we were kids.

599
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,120
We're not kids now, John.

600
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,320
But we still have to look
out for each other, right?

601
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,800
Yeah.

602
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,260
Yeah.

603
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,560
Come on. Go home. Get some sleep.

604
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,660
We've got a big day tomorrow.

605
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,720
We have?

606
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,240
Tomorrow, we finish the war with
the Lees for once and for all.

607
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,960
Since when? Since just now.

608
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,280
Ten o'clock tomorrow.

609
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,000
Be ready for anything.

610
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,720
Out you get, boys.

611
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,480
Ready, boys?

612
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,080
John, ready? Yeah. Yeah I'm fine.
Have a drink.

613
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,740
What? What are you all staring
at me for? What?

614
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,880
Good. Let's go.

615
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,280
What?

616
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,360
Tommy, what you playing at?
We're in shotgun range.

617
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
John...

618
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,000
..before we go into battle, there's
something you are going to need.

619
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,200
What are you bloody doing, Tommy?

620
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,060
Smile, John, it's a wedding.

621
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,160
Whose bloody wedding? Now if we'd
told you, you wouldn't have come.

622
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,940
There's a girl from the Lee family
who's going a bit wild.

623
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,180
And she needs marrying her off.
Fuck!

624
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,100
THEY TALK OVER EACH OTHER

625
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,060
John!
You have no bloody right, Tommy!

626
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,640
Listen to me. Listen to me.

627
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,000
A girl who needs a husband.
A man who needs a wife.

628
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,580
Tommy, I'm not bloody marrying
some fucking mushroom picker!

629
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,360
Shh, John boy, come on. Listen.

630
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,860
I have already betrothed you.

631
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,540
So if you back out now there's going
to be one fucking mighty war

632
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,620
breaking out here that's going to
make the Somme...

633
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,540
It's going to make the Somme
look like a fucking tea party.

634
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,220
But if you marry her,

635
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,780
our family and the Lee family
will be united for ever.

636
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,520
And this war will be over.
It's up to you John.

637
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,600
War...?

638
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,480
..or peace?

639
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,560
Let go of me.

640
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,400
Right... You should see
the size of her dowry.

641
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,580
Her what?

642
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,720
Her dad is giving you a car.

643
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,400
Will he do?

644
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,180
He'll do.

645
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,640
CHEERING

646
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,820
Here she is.

647
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,780
She'd better be under 50.

648
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,320
Come here. Go on.

649
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,300
We're here today to join in
matrimony

650
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,200
this man and this woman...

651
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,500
You look well.

652
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,200
..and harmony and togetherness.

653
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,700
Which is sanctioned and honoured by
the presence and the power

654
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,200
of these two families around us.

655
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:20,380
Do you John Michael Shelby
take Esme Martha Lee

656
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,180
to be your beautiful wife?
You got my invitation?

657
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,360
Grace said there's a truce.

658
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,120
Family day.

659
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,340
Your husband couldn't make it?

660
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,500
He's not speaking to me.

661
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,100
And when he does he calls me
a fucking Shelby

662
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,180
even though I'm a Thorne now.

663
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,940
Thorn in my side, that's for sure.

664
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,900
..to have and hold...

665
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:43,920
My God, Tommy.

666
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,300
You admire him, don't you?

667
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,860
There remains one more
part of the ceremony.

668
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,920
It's the mingling of the two bloods.

669
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,240
Where the two families
become the one...family.

670
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,900
I now pronounce you man and wife!

671
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,460
CHEERING

672
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,940
Come on, John, kiss the bride

HE RETCHES

684
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,540
CHEERING

685
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,840
FIREWORKS CRACKLE AND BANG

686
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,000
WOMAN SQUEALS

687
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,060
And again.

688
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,660
Come on, spin me round again.
You should tell Ada to slow down.

689
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,860
HE SCOFFS
You think she'll listen to me?

690
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,900
I tried to stop her
but she's been drinking.

691
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,060
Been stuck in that little basement
for weeks. What do we expect?

692
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,620
She's going off like a firecracker.

693
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,660
Oh, Christ, Tommy, please...

694
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,840
Enough now. Come on. Enough.

695
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,140
All right, Ada, come on, have a
rest, sit down. Come and look, Esme.

696
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,700
Come and look at the family
you've joined. Come and look
at the man who runs it.

697
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:36,100
Chooses his brother's wives
for them. He hunts his
own sister down like a rat

698
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,540
and he tries to kill his own
brother-in-law!

699
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,180
Ada, that's enough. And now he won't
even let me have a fucking dance!

700
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,100
Not even at a fucking wedding!
Sit her down.

701
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,880
Calm down, Ada. Ada, calm down.

702
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,980
Holy shit!

703
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,700
Water. Right.

704
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,200
ARTHUR: Not now, Ada. Bloody hell,
you do pick your times!

705
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,080
ENGINE DRONES

706
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,460
Slow her up. Nice and easy.

707
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,900
Story of your fucking life, Arthur.

708
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,600
Right, we are here.

709
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,640
Come on.

710
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,860
Nice car, John. How's she run?

711
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,620
Yeah, beautiful. Really smooth.

712
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,660
Your sister in there giving birth,
you're talking about the bloody car.

713
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,340
Not much us men can do now, Pol.
Except go get drunk.

714
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,440
Right, come on.
There's one man should be here.

715
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,960
You are right, Pol,
Freddie should be here.

716
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,820
Is that a heartbeat
I hear inside that chest?

717
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,860
The truce lasts till sunrise.
On my oath.

718
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,540
Tell Freddie it's safe.

719
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,200
Ada! Right, boys,
let's wet this baby's head.

720
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,060
SHE GROANS

721
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,640
Keep going. That's right. Push.

722
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,440
SHE SCREAMS

723
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,260
I think it might be
the wrong way round.

724
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,560
I tended three sisters.

725
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,260
Yeah, I think you're right.

726
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,180
We should move her forward.
Come on, Ada.

727
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,200
Right, come on.

728
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,100
It's not long to go now, darling.

729
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,180
ADA SCREAMS

730
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,900
Push. Two, three.
SHE SCREAMS

731
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,920
Two beautiful women.

732
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,420
I should go. I should go.
It's my wedding night.

733
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,180
No, you sit down.

734
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,780
You don't want to be among the women
when there's a baby coming.

735
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,820
Have another.

736
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,060
So, do you think her husband will
take the same advice and stay away?

737
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,980
Nah. Freddie will be there.
Nothing will keep him away.

738
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,340
Tommy's said it's
all right for him to be there.

739
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,140
Isn't that right, Tommy?

740
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,840
That's right. I'm all heart tonight.

741
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,500
You know what, John boy?

742
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,340
I think it's that lovely barmaid,

743
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,180
that pretty barmaid
that's just walked out

744
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,780
that's made our brother go all soft.

745
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,660
Drinks to that.

746
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,840
NO AUDIO

747
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,520

Come on, open up.

It's a beautiful baby boy.

755
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:07,960
There you go.

756
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,800
Welcome to the world, Son.

Freddie?

762
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,220
Don't hurt him. Freddie!

763
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,460
You are hurting him,
leave him alone.

764
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,300
You're taking me away from my baby?
