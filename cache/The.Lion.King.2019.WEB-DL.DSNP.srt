understand that balance...

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,360
and respect
all the creatures...

eat the grass...

The birds are tweeting
at 4:00 in the morning.

167
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,240
I'm like, "Birds, we get it."

are going ape.

Of course, as I say,
cheetahs never prosper.

That's what I say.

No, son.
You stay with the other cubs.

Did he show you the shadows
beyond the northern borders?

No. He said I can't go there.

See? All clean. Can we go?

00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,560
There's no hyenas.
You just chased them all off.

245
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Just to the watering hole
and no further.

246
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,840
And stay downwind.

about this place, Nala.

The most incredible,
amazing...

259
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,760
Just tell me where.

260
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,720
An elephant graveyard.

261
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Whoa. How far is it?

262
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,000
Not far. Just to the shadows.

263
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,040
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

264
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,560
We've never been
that far before.

265
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,600
-What if we get lost?
-Relax, Nala.

266
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,240
I patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad.

267
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,840
There's nothing
to worry about.

268
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,920
Well, there is one thing.

269
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,520
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

270
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,600
Oh, wait, scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

271
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,680
How we getting rid
of the dodo?

272
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,440
Trust me, I got this.

273
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,960
Follow me to freedom.

274
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,240
ZAZU: Oh, how lovely it is...

275
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,640
to see the future king
with his future queen.

276
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,560
I could just molt.

277
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,360
What do you mean,
"future queen"?

278
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,360
Well, one day the two of you
will be betrothed.

279

I've tried it once.

291

We are never
getting married, Zazu.

292

A monarch
who ignores tradition?

293

With an attitude like that,

294
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,280
I'm afraid you'll be
a pretty pathetic king.

295
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
Well, I'm not letting anyone
tell me where to go,

what to do...

The greatest leader
the pride has ever known.

683
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,480
To lose a brother...

684
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,600
such a deep, personal loss.

And little Simba,
who had barely begun to live.

A cub whose blood
held our future.

687

It's almost too much
to endure.

I only wish I had gotten
to the gorge in time...

been there to save them.

that I must assume the throne.

692

Mufasa and Simba are gone...

I cannot bear
this burden alone.

696
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,040
