1
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,289
Well, it's got to be the Mountain.
He's the biggest.

2
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,416
-He's the strongest.
-Bulls are bigger than lions.

3
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,335
Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.

4
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,295
Well, if the bull
had fangs and claws, I would.

5
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,422
All right.

6
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,092
The Mountain, our man, Jaime.

7
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,010
If he ever gets out.

8
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,722
-Loras Tyrell.
-Loras Tyrell.

9
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,683
He's prettier than the Queen.

10
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,894
I don't care about pretty.
He's better with a sword than any of 'em.

11
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,982
How good could he be?
He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon

12
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,692
for years and Renly ain't dead.

13
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,620
The horses seem a little spooked to you?

14
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,666
They're horses,
they get spooked by their own shadows.

15
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,672
Did you hear that?

16
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,133
No…

17
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,844
There's something out there.

18
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,079
You're a right little prick.

19
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,292
You should see your face.
I swear you pissed yourself.

20
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,210
Halt, who goes there?

21
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,757
-There is something out there.
-Yeah, don't even try me.

22
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,801
-Rennick...
-Do you think I'm an idiot?

23
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,137
Rennick!

24
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,187
Take their heads off!

25
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,773
Take their heads off!

26
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,462
Five Lannisters dead
for every one of ours.

27
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,339
If they're dead,
take everything they've got.

28
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,966
We have nowhere
to keep all these prisoners.

29
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,551
And barely enough food to feed our own.

30
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,054
We're not executing prisoners,
Lord Bolton.

31
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,349
Well, of course, Your Grace.
The officers will be useful.

32
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,186
Some of them may be privy
to Tywin Lannister's plans.

33
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,229
I doubt it.

34
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,690
Well, we learn soon enough.

35
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,320
In my family, we say a naked man
has few secrets. A flayed man, none.

36
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,032
-My father outlawed flaying in the North.
-We're not in the North.

37
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,659
We're not torturing them.

38
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,828
The high road's very pretty,

39
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,539
but you'll have a hard time
marching your army down it.

40
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,083
The Lannisters
hold prisoners of their own.

41
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,420
I won't give them
an excuse to abuse my sisters.

42
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,464
No, don't. Don't!

43
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,341
Please!

44
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,011
Thank you.

45
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,013
The rot's set in.

46
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,057
No, don't. No, don't!

47
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,521
Please, don't... It'll get better.
It doesn't even hurt.

48
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,691
The rot will spread.
If we don't take the foot now--

49
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:17,900
No, you can't!

50
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,157
Sir, please, sir, I can't lose my--

51
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,201
-You'll die if she doesn't.
-I don't want to be a cripple, please.

52
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,954
Surely, one of our men needs
your attention more than this cub.

53
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,041
Your men are not my men, My Lord.

54
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,460
Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don't want to watch.

55
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,837
-No! You can't!
-Bite on it.

56
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,131
It's better than biting
your own tongue, believe me.

57
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,834
-What's your name?
-Talisa.

58
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,669
Your last name?

59
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,881
You want to know
what side my family fights on?

60
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,175
You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.

61
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,677
That boy lost his foot on your orders.

62
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,930
They killed my father.

63
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,808
-That boy did?
-The family he fights for.

64
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,851
Do you think he's friends
with King Joffrey?

65
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,605
He's a fisherman's son
that grew up near Lannisport.

66
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,273
He probably never
held a spear before they shoved

67
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,193
-one in his hands few months ago.
-I have no hatred for the lad.

68
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,489
That should help his foot grow back.

69
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:54,330
You'd have us surrender,
end all this bloodshed, I understand.

70
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,917
The country would be at peace
and life would be just

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,836
under the righteous hand
of Good King Joffrey.

72
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,296
-Are you going to kill Joffrey?
-If the gods give me strength.

73
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,841
-And then what?
-I don't know.

74
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,468
We'll go back to Winterfell.

75
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,929
I have no desire
to sit in the Iron Throne.

76
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,766
-So who will?
-I don't know.

77
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,812
You're fighting to overthrow
a king and yet you have no plan

78
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,273
-for what comes after.
-First, we have to win the war.

79
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,072
You never told me where you're from.

80
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,949
Volantis.

81
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,868
Volantis? You're far from home.

82
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,787
The boy was lucky you were here.

83
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,540
He was unlucky that you were.

84
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,635
You're here to answer
for your brother's latest treasons.

85
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,891
Your Grace, whatever my traitor
brother has done, I had no part.

86
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,935
-You know that, I beg you, please--
-Ser Lancel tell her of this outrage.

87
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,190
Using some vile sorcery,
your brother fell in Stafford Lannister

88
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,232
with an army of wolves.

89
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,110
Thousands of good men were butchered.

90
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:10,406
After the slaughter, the northmen
feasted on the flesh of the slain.

91
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,994
Killing you
would send your brother a message.

92
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,042
But my mother insists
on keeping you alive.

93
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,585
Stand.

94
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,049
So, we'll have to send
your brother a message some other way.

95
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,760
Meryn...

96
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,682
Leave her face.

97
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,893
I like her pretty.

98
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,027
Meryn, My Lady is overdressed.

99
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,071
Unburden her.

100
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,790
If you want Robb Stark to hear us,
we're going to have to speak louder!

101
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,001
What is the meaning of this?

102
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,680
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?

103
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,016
-The kind who serves his king, Imp.
-Careful now.

104
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,560
We don't wanna get blood all over
your pretty white cloak.

105
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,729
Someone get the girl something
to cover herself with.

106
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,442
She's to be your queen.
Have you no regard for her honor?

107
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,736
-I'm punishing her.
-For what crimes?

108
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,989
She did not fight
her brother's battle, you halfwit.

109
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,992
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

110
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,160
The Mad King did as he liked.

111
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,289
Has your uncle Jaime
ever told you what happened to him?

112
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,709
No one threatens His Grace
in the presences of the Kingsguard.

113
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,421
I'm not threatening the king, Ser,
I am educating my nephew.

114
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,966
Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn
speaks, kill him.

115
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,928
That was a threat, see the difference?

116
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,328
I apologize for my nephew's behavior.

117
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,167
Tell me the truth,
do you want an end to this engagement?

118
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,962
I'm loyal to King Joffrey,
my one true love.

119
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,092
Lady Stark...

120
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,346
you may survive us yet.

121
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,979
The little king's backed up,
clogged from balls to brains.

122
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,191
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

123
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,485
There's no cure for being a cunt.

124
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,363
But the boy's at that age.

125
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,991
And he's got nothing to do
all day but pick wings off flies.

126
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,952
Couldn't hurt to get
some of the poison out.

127
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,379
What are you doing here, dog?

128
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:16,175
Your uncle left your name day present
and asked me to see that you got it.

129
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,554
And…

130
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,556
what is it?

131
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,351
Look inside, Your Grace.

132
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,317
Your Grace!

133
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,571
-Happy Name Day, Your Grace.
-My name day is past.

134
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,573
We won't tell if you won't.

135
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,829
No!

136
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,540
Her.

137
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,127
Touch her.

138
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,067
Could you hit her?

139
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,665
My uncle sent you?

140
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,669
Yes, Your Grace. He chose us himself.

141
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,556
Use this.

142
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,529
Harder.

143
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,577
I said…

144
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:08,996
harder.

145
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,250
He'd want me to get his money's worth.

146
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:00,839
Your Grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.

147
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,141
Please, Your Grace.

148
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,938
-Your Grace, if your uncle finds out...
-I want him to find out.

149
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,484
You will bring her
to his chambers when you're finished,

150
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,611
and show him what you've done.

151
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,698
Or the same thing will happen to you.

152
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:33,914
Begin.

153
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,008
Harder!

154
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,231
If it isn't my favorite whoremonger.

155
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,609
I pray I haven't kept you waiting long.

156
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,613
Your Grace.

157
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,453
So now you do
the Lannisters' bidding, is that it?

158
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:18,334
Tell me, was my brother's body even cold
before you secured your newest patron?

159
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,878
I am a practical man.

160
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,839
Just not a loyal one.

161
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,885
And who would you have me
be loyal to, your brother's corpse?

162
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,723
I don't like you, Lord Baelish.

163
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,517
I don't like your face.

164
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,396
I don't like the words
that come oozing out of your mouth.

165
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,816
I don't want you in my tent
one minute more than necessary.

166
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,194
So, tell me, why are you here?

167
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,283
You can trust Brienne.
Her loyalty comes without charge.

168
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,372
You still have many friends
at Court, Your Grace.

169
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,165
Many who believe

170
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,835
Ned Stark erred
by not supporting your claim.

171
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,005
Now I understand.

172
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,217
You know I have the numbers.

173
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,011
You know I'm marching on King's Landing.

174
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,932
When I take the Throne,
you hope to retain your position...

175
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,643
and your head.

176
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,062
I would give priority to my head.

177
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,734
I understand that you don't like me,
and while that saddens me greatly,

178
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,529
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

179
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,117
When you march on King's Landing,
you may find yourself

180
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,244
facing a protected siege or…

181
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,038
open gates.

182
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,476
-Your Grace.
-Lord Baelish.

183
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,689
All of these tents look the same to me.

184
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,358
-Would you be so kind--
-It would be my pleasure.

185
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,194
It took me weeks
to learn my way around the camp.

186
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,322
Twice I walked in
on officers in stages of undress.

187
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:15,117
And the moment I learn which tent is mine,

188
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,120
-we're on the move again.
-Your tent?

189
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,789
Not our tent.

190
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:26,170
The king snores perhaps
or simply prefers solitude?

191
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,964
The pressures of command, no doubt.

192
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,259
Four kings, vying for the throne.

193
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,470
I am not tutored in warfare,

194
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,057
but basic arithmetic
favors the side with the greater numbers.

195
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,102
If war were arithmetic,
the mathematicians would rule the world.

196
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,231
I did notice your brother
entering His Grace's tent just now.

197
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,692
The place of a kingsguard
is by the king's side.

198
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,905
And on the night of your wedding,
who was by the king's side then?

199
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,407
You seem quite interested in our marriage.

200
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,534
Your marriage is quite interesting.

201
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,038
Not only to me but to the realm.

202
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,584
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest if nothing else.

203
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,921
You have never married, have you?

204
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,757
I've been unlucky in my affections,

205
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,342
sadly.

206
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,471
That is sad.
Though perhaps, it's for the best.

207
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,807
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you.

208
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,391
So, allow me to explain.

209
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,394
My husband is my king
and my king is my husband.

210
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,274
Here is your tent, Lord Baelish.
Good night.

211
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,707
What do you know of this place?

212
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,295
Only that the desert around their walls
is called the Garden of Bones.

213
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,716
Every time the Qarthian
shut their gates on a traveler,

214
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,801
the Garden grows.

215
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,620
What kind of fire melts stone?

216
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,789
Dragon fire.

217
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,585
-There's dragons here?
-No, all the dragons are dead.

218
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,671
What's that smell?

219
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,716
Dead people.

220
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,218
Move.

221
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,813
Please! Please, no! No!

222
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,501
He's dead.

223
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:56,630
He was my son.

224
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,343
My sister was three days ago.

225
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,846
My husband, the day before that.

226
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,141
They take someone every day?

227
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,396
Does anyone live?

228
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,754
Joffrey...

229
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,298
Cersei...

230
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,217
Ilyn Payne...

231
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,011
the Hound.

232
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,138
Joffrey...

233
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,348
Cersei...

234
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,059
Ilyn Payne...

235
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,061
the Hound.

236
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:54,938
Joffrey...

237
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,314
Cersei...

238
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,941
Ilyn Payne...

239
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,901
the Hound.

240
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,657
How dare you?

241
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:09,077
-You may have heard false reports.
-You betrayed Ned.

242
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,247
Betrayed? I wanted him
to serve as Protector of the Realm.

243
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:17,085
-I begged him to seize the moment--
-I trusted you, my husband trusted you.

244
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,298
And you repaid our faith with treachery.

245
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,507
-No, My Lady--
-Get out!

246
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,592
Hey, I don't…

247
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,012
I've loved you since I was a boy.

248
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,391
I mean, it seems to me
that fate has given us this chance to--

249
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,477
Have you lost your mind? Get out!

250
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,243
Do you want to see your girls again?

251
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,290
Sansa? More beautiful than ever.

252
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,920
And Arya… just as wild as ever.

253
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,631
You have Arya too?

254
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,593
Both girls are healthy and safe...

255
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,804
for now.

256
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,390
But you know the Queen
and you know Joffrey.

257
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:18,063
I fear for their longevity
if they remain in the capital.

258
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,503
What do you want?

259
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,216
The Lannisters will trade
your daughters for the Kingslayer--

260
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:50,262
Of course they will,
Jaime Lannister for two girls?

261
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,889
Robb will never agree to those terms.

262
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,268
I'm not bringing these terms to him.
I'm bringing them to you.

263
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,229
You think I keep secrets from my son?

264
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,065
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle

265
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,191
but he's not a mother.

266
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,735
Consider it, Cat.

267
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,156
You may not get another chance.

268
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,705
-I've brought you a gift.
-I don't want your gifts.

269
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,374
A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill.

270
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:24,087
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

271
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,215
-is offered in good faith.
-Good faith.

272
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,139
What's this?

273
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,712
Your husband was an honorable man.

274
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,342
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

275
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,681
-You may not believe me--
-Get out.

276
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,342
-Get up! Get up!
-Get on your feet!

277
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,273
That's him, the one who picks.

278
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,566
The Mountain.

279
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,238
What are you doing?

280
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:17,242
He told me he stares at him every day,
that's why he doesn't get picked.

281
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,644
You.

282
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:46,980
Move, boy!

283
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,024
Move!

284
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,087
Is there gold and silver in the village?

285
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,381
-I don't know.
-Gems?

286
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,842
I didn't see any.

287
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,345
-Where's the Brotherhood?
-I don't know.

288
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,364
-Where is the Brotherhood?
-I don't know, please.

289
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,699
-Where is the Brotherhood?
-I don't know.

290
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,499
Which of the villagers aided them?

291
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,667
-I don't know.
-Who?

292
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,960
I--

293
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,425
-Who?
-I never saw.

294
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,219
-Who?
-I never saw.

295
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,680
Please, please stop.
Please, it's starting to--

296
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,642
-Who?
-I didn't see anyone help him.

297
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,354
-Take it off! Take it off!
-Who helped him?

298
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,731
Ganes! The butcher and his son.

299
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,192
That's better. You've been very helpful.

300
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,946
No, stop, please!
What are you doing? Please, stop!

301
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:24,619
Please, stop now! No!
I told you everything. No, no!

302
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,081
Joffrey...

303
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,959
Cersei...

304
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,002
Ilyn Payne...

305
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:37,132
-the Hound.
-Please, Polliver, some food.

306
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,217
Just a crust of bread.

307
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,098
Polliver...

308
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,308
the Mountain.

309
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,246
Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.

310
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,249
I had not thought
to be here, Lord Stannis.

311
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,003
-Can that truly be you?
-Who else might it be?

312
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,881
When I saw your standard,
I couldn't be sure.

313
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,592
-Whose banner is that?
-My own.

314
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,180
I suppose if we used the same one,
the battle would be terribly confusing.

315
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,640
Why is your stag on fire?

316
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,146
The king has taken for his sigil
the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.

317
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,609
And you must be this fire priestess
we hear so much about.

318
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,114
Brother, now I understand why
you've found religion in your old age.

319
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,534
-Watch yourself, Renly.
-No, no. I'm relieved.

320
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,579
I never really believed
you were a fanatic.

321
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:54,918
Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes.
But… but not a godly man.

322
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:59,047
You should kneel before your brother.
He's the Lord's chosen,

323
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,091
born amidst salt and smoke.

324
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,177
Born amidst salt and smoke.

325
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:05,887
Is he a ham?

326
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,555
That's twice I've warned you.

327
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,309
Listen to yourselves.
If you were sons of mine.

328
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,062
I would knock your heads together
and lock you in a bed chamber

329
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,105
until you remembered
that you were brothers.

330
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,983
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

331
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,611
Your husband was a supporter of my claim.

332
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,780
Lord Eddard's integrity cost him his head,

333
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,783
and you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

334
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,535
We share a common enemy.

335
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,496
The Iron Throne is mine by right.

336
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,457
All those that deny that are my foes.

337
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,878
The whole realm
denies it from Dome to the Wall.

338
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,006
Old men deny it with their death rattle
and unborn children

339
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,550
deny it in their mother's wombs.

340
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,929
No one wants you for their king.

341
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,431
You never wanted any friends, brother.

342
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,768
But a man without friends
is a man without power.

343
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,813
For the sake of the mother who bore us,

344
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,691
I will give you this one night
to reconsider.

345
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,153
Strike your banners,
come to me before dawn,

346
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,699
and I will grant you
your old seat in the council.

347
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,952
I'll even name you my heir...

348
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,580
until a son is born to me.

349
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,417
Otherwise I shall destroy you.

350
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,506
Look across those fields, brother.

351
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:26,134
Can you see all those banners?

352
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,970
You think a few bolts
of cloth will make you king?

353
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,013
No.

354
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,017
The men holding
those bolts of cloth will make me king.

355
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,229
We shall see, Renly.
Come the dawn, we shall see.

356
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:43,401
Look to your sins, Lord Renly.
The night is dark and full of terrors.

357
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,619
Would you believe? I loved him once.

358
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,724
I thought we were welcome.

359
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,353
If you heard a Dothraki hoard
was approaching your city,

360
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,021
you might do the same, Khaleesi.

361
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:23,816
Hoard?

362
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,542
My name is Daenerys--

363
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,545
Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen.

364
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,422
You know me, My Lord?

365
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,925
Only by reputationKhaleesi,

366
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,928
and I'm not Lord,
merely a humble merchant.

367
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,309
-They call you the Mother of Dragons.
-And what should I call you?

368
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,772
My name is quite long and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

369
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,025
I am simply a trader of spices.

370
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:09,862
But we are the Thirteen,

371
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,116
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

372
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,244
the greatest city
that ever was or will be.

373
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,791
-The beauty of Qwath is legendary--
-Qarth.

374
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,545
Qarth.

375
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,922
Might we see the dragons?

376
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,762
My…

377
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,681
friend…

378
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,350
we have travelled very far.

379
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,186
We have no food, no water.

380
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,605
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored--

381
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,191
Forgive me, Mother of Dragons,

382
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,820
but no man alive has seen a living dragon.

383
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,283
Some of my more skeptical friends
refuse to believe

384
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,786
your children… even exist.

385
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,914
All we ask is the chance
to see for ourselves.

386
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,085
-I am not a liar.
-I don't think you are.

387
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,463
But as I've never you before,

388
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,007
my opinion on the matter
is of limited value.

389
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,594
Where I come from...

390
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:20,892
guests are treated with respect
not insulted at the gates.

391
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,603
Then perhaps you should return
to where you come from.

392
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,646
We wish you well.

393
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:33,780
What are you doing?
You promised to receive me.

394
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,410
We have received you.
Here we are and here you are.

395
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,706
If you do not let us in,
all of us will die.

396
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,750
Which we shall deeply regret.

397
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,545
But Qarth did not become
the greatest city that was or will be

398
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,882
by letting Dothraki savages
through its gates.

399
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,891
Khaleesi, please be careful.

400
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,103
Thirteen!

401
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:13,069
When my dragons are grown,
we will take back what was stolen from me,

402
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,030
and destroy those who have wronged me.

403
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:20,326
We will lay waste to armies
and burn cities to the ground.

404
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,789
Turn us away and we will burn you first.

405
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:30,127
Now, you are a true Targaryen.

406
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:35,049
Only, as you said a moment ago,
if we don't let you in to the city,

407
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,343
you will all die and so…

408
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,804
Retreating in fear from a little girl

409
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,808
is unbecoming of the greatest city
that ever was or will be.

410
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,311
The discussion is over, Xaro Xhaon Daxos.

411
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,647
The Thirteen have spoken.

412
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,776
But I am one of the Thirteen,
and I am still speaking.

413
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,280
The girl threatens
to burn our city to the ground

414
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,657
and you would invite her
in for a cup of wine?

415
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,868
She is the mother of dragons.

416
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,621
Do you expect her
to watch her people starve

417
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,707
without breathing fire?

418
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,460
I believe we can allow a few Dothraki
through our gates

419
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,212
without dooming our city.

420
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,590
After all, here I am,

421
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:20,344
a savage from the Summer Isles
and Qarth still stands.

422
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,471
Our decision is final.

423
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:24,849
Very well.

424
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,687
I invoke Sumi.

425
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,652
I will vouch for her, her people,

426
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,947
and her dragons
in accordance with the law.

427
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,039
Be it on your head.

428
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,168
Welcome to Qarth, My Lady.

429
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,427
You.

430
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,981
Is there gold or silver in the village?

431
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,567
-I'm not from the village.
-Where is the Brotherhood?

432
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,237
I don't know what that is.

433
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,771
What's this?

434
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,858
We weren't expecting you
'til tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

435
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,235
Evidently not.

436
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,614
Why are these prisoners
not in their cells?

437
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,199
Cells are overflowing, My Lord.

438
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,662
These lot won't be here long.
Don't need no permanent place.

439
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,248
After we interrogate them,
we usually just…

440
00:38:55,624 --> 00:39:00,838
Are we so well-manned that we can afford
to discard able young bodies

441
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,214
and skilled laborers?

442
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,351
You, do you have a trade?

443
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,021
Smith, My Lord.

444
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,400
What you looking at? Kneel!

445
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,613
Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy.

446
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,490
You'll do no such thing.

447
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,368
This one's a girl, you idiot.

448
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,332
-Dressed as a boy, why?
-Safer to travel, My Lord.

449
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,586
Smart, more than I can say for this lot.

450
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,713
Get these prisoners to work.

451
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,924
Bring the girl.

452
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,010
-I need a new cupbearer.
-My Lord.

453
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,729
Your visits are too few, cousin.

454
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,232
Her Grace, the Queen Regent,
commands you to release

455
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,733
Grand Maester Pycelle.

456
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:03,859
Here's your warrant.

457
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,696
So it is. Will you take a cup with me?

458
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,741
I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.

459
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:14,286
I'm here at Her Grace's behest,
not to drink with you, Imp.

460
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,706
If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle,

461
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:21,669
I would have thought she'd come herself,
instead she sends you.

462
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,464
-What am I to make of that?
-I don't care what you make of it.

463
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,591
So long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

464
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,470
And you've received these
instructions directly from Cersei?

465
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,348
As I've said several times.

466
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:37,101
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

467
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,021
When the Queen Regent gives me
a command, I carry it out without delay.

468
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,402
Cersei must have great trust in you.

469
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:51,031
Allowing you into her chamber
during the Hour of the Wolf.

470
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,372
The Queen Regent
has a great many responsibilities.

471
00:40:58,455 --> 00:40:59,957
She often works from dusk 'til dawn.

472
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,170
She must be very glad to have you
helping her from dusk 'til dawn.

473
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:10,718
Lavender oil, she always loved
lavender oil even as a girl.

474
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,680
-I am a knight.
-An anointed knight, yes.

475
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,852
Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted
before or after she took you into her bed?

476
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,898
What? Nothing to say?

477
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,983
No more warnings for me, ser--

478
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,735
You will withdraw
these filthy accusations--

479
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,447
Have you ever given any thought
to what King Joffrey will have to say

480
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,782
when he finds out
you've been bedding his mother?

481
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:42,625
-It's not my fault!
-Did she take you against your will?

482
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,877
Can you not defend yourself, knight--

483
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,172
Your own father Lord Tywin,
when I was named the king's squire,

484
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,216
he told me to obey her in everything.

485
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,218
Did he tell you to fuck her too?

486
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,471
I only meant… I did as I was bid. I--

487
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,682
Hated every moment of it.
Is that what you'll have me believe?

488
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,978
A high place in Court, a knighthood,
my sister's legs spreading open

489
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,023
for you at night.
Yes, it must have been terrible.

490
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,067
Wait here.
His Grace will want to hear this.

491
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,694
-Mercy, mercy, My Lord, I beg you--
-Save it for Joffrey.

492
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,196
He loves a good grovel.

493
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,698
My Lord, it was your sister's bidding.
The Queen.

494
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,951
-I'll leave the city at once, I swear.
-No.

495
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,495
-I think not.
-My Lord?

496
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,705
You heard me.

497
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,795
My father told you
to obey my sister, obey her.

498
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,048
Stay close to her side, keep her trust.

499
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:35,135
Pleasure her whenever she requires.
No one ever need know...

500
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,514
as long as you keep faith with me.

501
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,601
I want to know what Cersei is doing.

502
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:47,690
Where she goes, who she sees,
what they talk of, everything.

503
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,317
And you will tell me.

504
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,488
Yes, My Lord, I will.
I swear it. As you command.

505
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,202
Rise, rise!

506
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,080
Let us drink to our understanding.

507
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,749
You don't have a cup, well.

508
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,670
Smile, cousin.
My sister is a beautiful woman

509
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,297
and it's all for the good of the realm.

510
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,799
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

511
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,884
that I want no more conflict between us

512
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:19,471
and that henceforth,
I shall do nothing without her consent.

513
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:23,475
-But her demands?
-I'll give her Pycelle.

514
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,270
-You will?
-Yes. I'll release him in the morning.

515
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,440
Cersei can keep him as a pet if she wants
but I will not have him on the council.

516
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,735
I could swear that I had not harmed
a single hair on his head,

517
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,779
but that would
not strictly speaking be true.

518
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:49,793
Stay within one table length.

519
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,425
Your Grace...

520
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,183
Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?

521
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,938
My life's been good
since you hacked them off, Your Grace.

522
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,733
And it's four less fingernails to clean.

523
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,860
-Fewer.
-Pardon?

524
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,238
Four fewer fingernails to clean.

525
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,949
I never understood
why you had to wear them.

526
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,578
Reminds me
of where I come from and where I am now.

527
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,664
Reminds me of your justice.

528
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,584
It was an honest punishment
and you were good with the cleaver.

529
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:32,336
You were a hero and a smuggler.

530
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,717
A good act does not wash out the bad,
nor a bad to good.

531
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,762
A lesson I tried to teach my son.

532
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,432
-Does he listen?
-To me? Gods, no.

533
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,104
But if your red woman
told him to leap from the crow's nest.

534
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,230
She has a name.

535
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,361
I trust you haven't forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

536
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,909
-I've lived within the law for seventeen--
-I want you to be a smuggler this time.

537
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:08,580
Any shore, any night.
What am I bringing ashore?

538
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:09,915
The red woman.

539
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,044
No one must know what you do.

540
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,338
And we'll not speak of this again.

541
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,216
I am true to Your Grace
and always will be.

542
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:22,761
But surely there are other ways,
cleaner ways.

543
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,805
Cleaner ways don't win wars.

544
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,129
Are you afraid, Onion Knight?

545
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:03,844
Someone once told me
the night is dark and full of terrors.

546
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,015
You've carried
more unpleasant cargo in your time.

547
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,813
Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?

548
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:19,109
I'd say my parts are mixed,
My Lady. Good and bad.

549
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,821
If half an onion is black with rot,
it's a rotten onion.

550
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,699
A man is good or he is evil.

551
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,076
-And which are you?
-Good.

552
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:33,665
I am a knight myself, of sorts.
A champion of light and life.

553
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,419
Well, that must be very nice for you.

554
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:55,562
You love your wife?

555
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:57,814
I do.

556
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,944
-Yet you have known other women.
-Don't talk about my wife.

557
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:04,780
I'm not. I'm talking about other women.

558
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,991
Like me, Ser Davos.

559
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:17,251
You want me.
You want to see what's beneath this robe.

560
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,171
And you will.

561
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:31,014
It's strange that this Lord of Light
asked you to work in the shadows.

562
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,060
Shadows cannot live
in the dark, Ser Davos.

563
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,062
They are servants of the light.

564
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,940
The children of fire.

565
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:43,777
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

566
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,572
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

567
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,866
They can't bar our passage.

568
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,373
Gods protect us.

569
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,543
There's only one God, Ser Davos.

570
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,714
And He only protects those who serve Him.
