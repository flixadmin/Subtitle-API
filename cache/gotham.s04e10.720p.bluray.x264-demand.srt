1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,118
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,212 --> 00:00:05,420
<i>You paid off the mayor
to make Jim Gordon captain.</i>

3
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,373
- Don't ever betray me again.
- Never.

4
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:11,676
I need to know what Sofia is planning
and who she is planning it with.

5
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:13,795
<i>Plain, dumb, Ed.</i>

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,551
I would like you to go to The Narrows

7
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,382
and bundle him up
and bring him back to me.

8
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,350
They're the ones that are the problem.

9
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,222
They work for Penguin.

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,932
I would like to announce that we just
quit working for Penguin.

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,107
This is your turf now.

12
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,314
<i>What is he doing to them?</i>

13
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,565
<i>He's cooking them.</i>

14
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:31,863
<i>They're people pies.</i>

15
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,072
Eat the pies or the boy dies.

16
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,528
<i>No!</i>

17
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,784
<i>Jim!</i>

18
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,625
<i>The suspect known as the Pyg
is in custody.</i>

19
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,502
<i>The GCPD kept its promise.</i>

20
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,383
I'm not your enemy, Jim.

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,676
I never will be.

22
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,804
<i>Did you find anything out?</i>

23
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,722
She will answer for what she's done.

24
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,852
Thursday.

25
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,363
Thursday's my day.

26
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,532
Thursday's my day.

27
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,913
Thursday's my day.

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,612
I don't like that song.

29
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,403
My ma used to beat me to it.

30
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,289
It was playing when I killed her.

31
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,244
So now you turn it off.

32
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,127
Or I do the same to you.

33
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,293
Why did your mother beat you?

34
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,838
Were you a naughty boy?

35
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,676
Did you soil your trousers?

36
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,389
Stutter,

37
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,559
perhaps?

38
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,279
Open the gate. Open the gate, now.

39
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,660
All right, everybody calm down.

40
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,870
Back off, just back off.

41
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,457
I really wish you hadn't done that.

42
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,306
I paid a fortune to look this good.

43
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,699
Everybody,
stay where you are.

44
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,405
All right, open the gate,
that's enough.

45
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,242
Okay, it's over. Just open the gate
and let us in.

46
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,352
The doctors at Arkham took these
after the fight.

47
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:51,895
The Pyg had titanium plates

48
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,894
surgically grafted
onto the bones of his face,

49
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,897
the result of which,
radically changed his appearance.

50
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,570
When we booked him,
his fingerprints were burned off.

51
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,153
I've seen it before on criminals
that want to hide their identity.

52
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,987
But never anything like this.

53
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,160
That's not all. The doctors
also noticed scar tissue

54
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,908
behind his ears
and along his neckline,

55
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,830
indicating he's had
multiple surgeries.

56
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,245
That explains why we couldn't ID him
off his photo.

57
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,043
This doesn't make any sense.

58
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,537
The Pyg is a glory hound.

59
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,213
Everything he's done, it's all been
about grabbing the spotlight.

60
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,711
Classic sociopath behavior.

61
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,884
So why doesn't he want us to know
who he really is?

62
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,838
Now is the time he should be
taking credit for his crimes.

63
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,800
Can you use this x-ray
to reconstruct his face?

64
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,435
See what he looked like
before he had any work done?

65
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,055
It's certainly possible,
but it'll take some time.

66
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,397
Get started.

67
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,729
I wanna know who the Pyg really is.

68
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,073
- Morning, Cap.
- Harper.

69
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,859
How's the shoulder?

70
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,568
This? Just a scratch.

71
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,160
You got a visitor.

72
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,412
Thanks.

73
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,502
Sofia, what are you doing here?

74
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,467
I haven't heard from you
in a few days.

75
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,924
I didn't realize
I was supposed to call.

76
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,507
I figured after the other night,

77
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,467
we were gonna start
seeing each other again.

78
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,969
We're not.

79
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,598
I get it.

80
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,557
You're worried about Penguin
finding out about us,

81
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,314
that I made you Captain.

82
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,065
You don't have to be.

83
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,362
I already told him.

84
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,236
I'm sorry, you did what?

85
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,612
I have it under control.

86
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:28,863
Is that what you think?

87
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,945
It's what I know.

88
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,207
I am going to remove Penguin
from the picture,

89
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,251
and when I do,
I want us to be together.

90
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,084
It's not gonna work, Sofia.

91
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,587
Even if Penguin
is out of the picture.

92
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,382
I just don't see a way forward
for us. I'm sorry.

93
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,353
I run the dog races,
he runs the cock fights.

94
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,609
Now he's coming
and muscling in on my business.

95
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,403
- I got mouths to feed.
- You race those dogs again

96
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,064
and I'll slit your damn throat.

97
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,194
All right. Enough.

98
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,489
If she stabs him,
it solves the issue.

99
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,701
I started this court, so we could
work out disputes peacefully.

100
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,080
This is how things are gonna be done
from now on, understood?

101
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,829
Now you're both admitting
to having down months.

102
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,039
Seems the only solution
is for you to partner up.

103
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,216
Both of you work together,
you stay strong.

104
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:31,635
Okay. That's settled. Thank you.
Moving on. Next.

105
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,257
Wait.

106
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,975
How's your daughter?

107
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,645
Fever came down,

108
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,147
thanks to you, Doc.

109
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:42,979
Good.

110
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,238
These bums are so lucky to have you.

111
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,661
You cure their children,
you solve their problems.

112
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,204
I haven't forgotten about you, Ed.

113
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,704
Yes, you say that
and yet I remain a moron.

114
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,707
I said I would fix you, and I will.

115
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,211
Out of my way.

116
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,584
Move out of my way.

117
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,586
Out of my way, I need to see the Doc.

118
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,463
What happened?

119
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,630
Sampson sent his thugs to my shop,
demanding protection money.

120
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,389
I told them no.

121
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,384
I said,
this is your neighborhood now.

122
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,014
I'm sorry, who's Sampson?

123
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,970
He controls the territory
just south of here.

124
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,016
All right. Go to the clinic,
I'll stitch you up.

125
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,899
You know, this was bound to happen.

126
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,776
You're new leader of The Narrows.

127
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,444
Sampson's just testing you.

128
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,948
But you have to show him,
and these people,

129
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,779
that you can't be pushed around.

130
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,081
What, should I send Grundy
to rip his arms off?

131
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,283
Look at him, it's what he lives for.

132
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,791
I'm asking these people
to settle things amicably.

133
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,416
I can't just be a hypocrite and send
Grundy every time I have a problem.

134
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,461
Okay, what would you like to do?

135
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,222
Hello, Sofia.

136
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,527
Oswald, what a pleasant surprise.

137
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,357
Oh, I assure you, dear,

138
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,032
there is nothing pleasant about it.

139
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,872
I've continually been suspicious of you.

140
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,789
And yet, at every turn,

141
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,541
you always had
the perfect explanation

142
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,714
to put my mind at ease.

143
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,837
But now,

144
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,847
I finally have proof
that you are my enemy.

145
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,758
You lied to me.

146
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,427
You told me you hated Gordon.

147
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,976
You are his lover.

148
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,812
Martin saw you kissing him
after the party.

149
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,520
That's ridiculous.

150
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,275
I'm not sure
what Martin thought he saw,

151
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,106
but I can assure you it was no kiss...

152
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,486
Enough of your lies!

153
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,530
Our entire friendship,

154
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,910
the intimacies we shared,

155
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,789
they were nothing more
than a pathetic charade.

156
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,043
No, Oswald, I swear.
I swear, I care for you deeply...

157
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,465
Ha! Oh, I wish that were true!

158
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,801
But after Martin told me about
you and Gordon,

159
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,301
I did a little digging
into your boyfriend.

160
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,805
Interesting. He took a trip
down south

161
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,184
shortly before you arrived in Gotham.

162
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,148
Coincidence? I think not.

163
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,268
So you see, I know

164
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,604
that the two of you
have been plotting

165
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,941
to destroy me
from the very beginning.

166
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,534
Bravo, Oswald.

167
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,327
Do you know, I was warned
you were a mastermind?

168
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,124
Turns out you're an easy mark.

169
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,215
It is truly amazing,
what you can accomplish

170
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,714
with goulash and a good foot rub.

171
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,059
Now I see the real you.

172
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,683
I was blind to your manipulations.

173
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,731
But today, I'm going to
correct that mistake.

174
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,439
You will tell me
the full extent of your plan,

175
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,156
if your father was involved,

176
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,200
which of my captains you have turned

177
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,449
and how you intend
to rid me from this city.

178
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:24,454
Bring him out.

179
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,500
Allow me to introduce you
to the dentist.

180
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,628
And he is not the kind
who gives out lollipops

181
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,080
after the visit.

182
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,852
Captain Gordon.

183
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,023
I wondered if my little scuffle would
bring you here. I'm so glad it did.

184
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,351
- I've missed our little chats.
- Good.

185
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,646
Then you can start by telling me
who you really are.

186
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,064
Don't you know?

187
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,828
Jim, I'm a reflection of you.

188
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,789
I don't see it.

189
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,169
Oh, James, you swine.

190
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,262
I want to know who's hiding
behind that mask.

191
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,058
What you see is what you get.

192
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,860
What I see is someone
who craves attention.

193
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,652
So why are you concealing
your true identity?

194
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,576
Don't you wanna take the credit
for all your brilliant crimes?

195
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,327
Oh, I get all the credit.

196
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,666
The whole town has gone
hog wild for the Pyg.

197
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,243
Not since I caught you.

198
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,252
You're yesterday's news.

199
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,960
- It's not true.
- This is Gotham.

200
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,510
You're a second-class psychopath
compared to what we've got.

201
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,097
Jerome Valeska, Fish Mooney, Penguin.

202
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,097
- They have staying power, you don't.
- You're wrong.

203
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,934
I terrified this whole city for months.

204
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,939
- People will remember that.
- No, they won't.

205
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,983
In fact, they've already forgotten you.

206
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,692
Hmm, but not you, Jim. You're here.

207
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,027
A final visit.

208
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,321
Now I'm gonna walk out that door
and never think about you again.

209
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,782
Mind games.

210
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,249
You really think that's going to work
on me?

211
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,249
Guard, we're done here.

212
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,548
James, we're not done here.

213
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,799
Have a nice life.

214
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:49,391
Don't you walk out on me!

215
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,812
You'll never forget me.

216
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,890
I promise you that.

217
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,684
There you are.

218
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,515
So, you're Doc?

219
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,433
I heard you had a giant.

220
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,886
I figured you might have brought him
along with you,

221
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,393
rather than this, uh, has-been.

222
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,472
Excuse me.

223
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,111
Why would I bring Grundy along
for a friendly conversation?

224
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,486
Look, I understand you had a deal
with Cherry,

225
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,283
where you left her people alone.

226
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,244
I expect you to honor
the same with me.

227
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,993
Why would I do that?

228
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,117
You'e not even from The Narrows.

229
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,793
You have no idea
how things work around here.

230
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,708
Maybe you're right.

231
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,547
But I do know that you love money.

232
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,671
I'm willing to offer you
10% of fight night.

233
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,590
You just don't get it, huh?

234
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,088
I'm not negotiating.

235
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,635
I'm taking.

236
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,349
I'm taking your clinic.

237
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,560
I'm taking your club.

238
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,596
I'm taking your whole
damn neighborhood.

239
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,277
Okay, we tried this your way.
Let's use Grundy.

240
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,320
That doesn't sound so good.

241
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,989
You cough up blood yet?

242
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,570
What's it to you?

243
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,664
Bad case of Narrows Lung
going around.

244
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,787
What the hell is that?

245
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,455
It's a new virus.

246
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,461
I've seen it
kill a few people already.

247
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,423
First you cough up blood
and within a few days you're dead.

248
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,625
Unless you have treatment.

249
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,678
I'll sweeten the deal. I will doctor
your people, free of charge.

250
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,924
Not gonna get
a better offer than that.

251
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,559
All right.

252
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,686
I'll be back in a few days

253
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,733
to negotiate with whoever
takes your place,

254
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,069
after you drown in your own blood.

255
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:11,821
Tell you what, Doc.

256
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,991
Make it 30% of fight night,

257
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,121
you got yourself a deal.

258
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,619
It's too much, don't take it.

259
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,456
Come by the clinic later.

260
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,257
We'll see about that cough.

261
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,758
Your teeth are quite lovely.

262
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,678
I look forward to putting them
in my trophy case.

263
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,894
You have no idea who I am, do you?

264
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,190
Of course, I do.

265
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,564
You are Don Falcone's daughter.

266
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,071
He killed my brother.

267
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,902
I'm going to enjoy this.

268
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,655
It's true he killed your brother,

269
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,866
but not your wife, Elaine,
or your son, Joseph.

270
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,452
No, they're still alive,
probably having lunch

271
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,708
in your two-bedroom on
7th Ave right now.

272
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,052
See, I made it a point to learn
every detail

273
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,630
of Penguin's organization.

274
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:19,093
For instance, I learned that he only
trusts one man for this type of job.

275
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,260
You.

276
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,646
And in the event
that I am ever tortured,

277
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,564
my people have instructions

278
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,608
to kill your family.

279
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,686
Interesting threat.

280
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,024
But no one's going to know
that you were tortured.

281
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,285
Because no one is
going to find your body.

282
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,951
Oh! 'Cause you don't think I have spies
inside Penguin's organization?

283
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,872
He's right about me, though.

284
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,996
I have been conspiring
against him for months,

285
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,373
turning his captains against him
one by one.

286
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:51,084
And today is the day that I will
finally take him down.

287
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,553
So, if my people
don't hear from me soon,

288
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:56,884
your family's dead.

289
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,679
But if you don't believe me,

290
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,057
drill away.

291
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,731
Excuse me,

292
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,101
her restraints need tightening.

293
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,083
Hmm. A wise decision.

294
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,458
Now, untie me.

295
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,982
Things are finally looking up.

296
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,655
Wakey, wakey.

297
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,692
Oh, hello.

298
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,574
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Barbara Kean.

299
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,451
This ferocious lady is Tabitha Galavan

300
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:06,284
and that kitty cat, that's Selina Kyle.

301
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,577
I know who you are.

302
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,872
Penguin wants you dead for
betraying him down in The Narrows.

303
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,128
What do you want with me?

304
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,086
Well, we heard you and Ozzy are BFFs.

305
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:22,470
So, you're going to try and leverage
me to get Penguin not to kill you.

306
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,309
We have some other demands.

307
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,144
But essentially, yeah.

308
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,604
That's a good plan,

309
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,398
except for the fact
that Penguin just tried to kill me.

310
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,609
Why would he do that?

311
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,314
Because I am so close to taking
his underworld from him.

312
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,318
You're lying.

313
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,777
Am I?

314
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,119
I've been working Penguin for months,

315
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,002
manipulating him into behaving
exactly how I want him to.

316
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,330
Every move he made today,
I orchestrated.

317
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,213
Now you three are screwing things up.

318
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,759
So, you want him out of your life,
let me go.

319
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,434
Maybe she's telling the truth.

320
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,682
She's a Falcone.

321
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,688
She learned to lie
before she could read.

322
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,068
But whether you are friend or foe
makes no difference to me,

323
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,570
because Penguin
will still make the deal.

324
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,780
Get him on the phone.

325
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,411
You'll grow into it.

326
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,253
Because of you,
I was able to vanquish my enemy.

327
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,846
And now that you've proven yourself,

328
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,726
I see a beautiful future ahead
for you.

329
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,268
I have so much wisdom to impart.

330
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,650
And if you pay attention,

331
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,938
one day all of this could be yours.

332
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,440
What's wrong?

333
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,048
What are you talking about?

334
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,389
You mean, you did not see
Sofia kissing Gordon?

335
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,110
Why would she do that?

336
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,742
Unless...

337
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,239
She knew exactly how I would respond.

338
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,330
She wanted me to confront her.

339
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,794
Even torture her.

340
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,752
Boss, we have a problem.

341
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,128
The dentist is gone.

342
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,589
What happened to Sofia?

343
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,420
To be honest,
that's still a little unclear.

344
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,256
Barbara Kean has her.

345
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,842
What?
How do you know this?

346
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,926
She's on the phone.

347
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,138
Says she wants to make a deal.

348
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,936
Give me that.

349
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,397
Barbara.

350
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,979
Hello, Oswald.

351
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,866
I see you have crawled out from
whatever rock you were hiding under.

352
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,534
What are you doing with Sofia?

353
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,907
We scooped her up this morning.

354
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,290
And of course, when we did,
we thought she was your best friend.

355
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,742
Turns out, she's your worst enemy.

356
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,003
I want her back. Name your price.

357
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,790
We keep the gun shop,
we don't share profits

358
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,753
and from this point forward
we operate with complete autonomy.

359
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,054
Fine.

360
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,845
I will send Zsasz over
to collect her.

361
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,639
She had better be there
when he arrives.

362
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,969
She will be.

363
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,196
And as for you, young man,

364
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,988
our conversation is not over.

365
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:18,953
So, this is what the Pyg
used to look like?

366
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,036
That's him.

367
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,873
All right, send it out to
police stations across the country.

368
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,129
- Start in the South.
- The South? Why?

369
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,461
When I pressed him,
he spoke in a Southern accent.

370
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,755
He could have done that deliberately
to throw you off.

371
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,590
No, he slipped up.

372
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,099
I saw it in his eyes.

373
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,596
This is the best lead we've got.

374
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,390
Let's see where it goes.

375
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,891
I don't understand you.

376
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,860
If Sampson's cough will kill him,
why not let him die?

377
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,109
There's no such thing
as Narrow's Lung.

378
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,690
He probably just has bronchitis.

379
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,326
I give him some medicine,
he feels better, problem solved.

380
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,153
Okay, what about the 30%?

381
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,988
Once he has that,
he's just gonna want more.

382
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,072
Maybe.

383
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,008
Sampson, you son of a bitch.

384
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,519
Now do you see
who you're dealing with?

385
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,107
I know you wanted
to try this your way.

386
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,482
No more diplomacy, Lee.

387
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,527
Take Grundy and end this.

388
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,817
No.

389
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,903
I have a better idea.

390
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,241
- That was easy.
- Yeah, a little too easy.

391
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,498
Because he couldn't wait
to get you off the phone.

392
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,537
We need to get out of here.

393
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,839
And then what happens?

394
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,008
You take over from Penguin?

395
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,130
We are not working for anyone
but ourselves.

396
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,715
I'm not asking you to.

397
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,470
I will give you everything you want
from Penguin.

398
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,556
You're not in a position
to offer us anything.

399
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,228
We're in charge here.

400
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,355
Uh, guys, I think
we should listen to her.

401
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,435
Why?

402
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,442
Because Zsasz is standing out front
holding a rocket launcher.

403
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,067
Ladies.

404
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,385
I'm gonna break
his little beak in half.

405
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,216
Jim.

406
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,018
Sorry, Captain. I tried to stop her.
I told her she had to wait.

407
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,184
It's okay, Detective. I've got it.

408
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,561
Sofia, what happened to you?

409
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,642
I underestimated Oswald.

410
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,603
He found out
we were plotting against him

411
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,233
and he just tried to kill me, Jim.

412
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,697
He can't hurt you here.

413
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,362
If he finds out I'm alive,
he will come after me

414
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,569
and he won't stop until I'm dead.

415
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,206
You are the Captain of the GCPD,
your men would follow you anywhere.

416
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:04,955
Please, please, use the position
I gave you and end this.

417
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,003
What are you proposing I do?

418
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,214
You have an army,
just take the fight to Penguin.

419
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,461
So, this was your plan.

420
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,888
To start a war.

421
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,560
You knew you didn't have the numbers
to fight Penguin on your own,

422
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,807
so you made me Captain,
knowing it would come to this,

423
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,058
and I'd take him out for you.

424
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,732
Your job is to stop criminals, Jim,
here you go.

425
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,525
It is not that simple,
and you know it.

426
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,525
We could bring law and order
back to Gotham.

427
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,904
This is exactly what you asked for
when you came down south

428
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,986
and it is yours for the taking.

429
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,329
You know what has to be done, Jim.

430
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,498
Crush Penguin.

431
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,421
I trusted you, Martin.

432
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,711
And you betrayed me.

433
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,607
I think it's time for you
to go back to the orphanage.

434
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,644
- Boss.
- Hold on.

435
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,023
Let the little spy
step out of the room.

436
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,910
So?

437
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,498
The place went up
like a great ball of fire.

438
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,296
Good. Alert the capos.

439
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:40,051
We are going to unleash a crime wave
on this city like it has never seen.

440
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,056
That will teach Jim Gordon

441
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,134
to align himself with Sofia Falcone.

442
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,060
I wouldn't make that call
if I were you.

443
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,521
I just spoke with Sofia.

444
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,019
She's alive.

445
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,147
And she told me
you tried to kill her.

446
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,145
Hearsay, Jim.

447
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,446
Been here all day. I have witnesses.

448
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,652
I don't care.

449
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,780
I'm not here to arrest you.

450
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,654
I came to make a deal.

451
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,744
I think we've both put up
with Sofia long enough.

452
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,420
Victor, would you give us a moment?

453
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,835
Okay, Jim. You have my attention.

454
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,214
Since the moment
she set foot in Gotham,

455
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,765
Sofia has put us on a path to war.

456
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,219
She's willing to let this city
burn to the ground

457
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,598
to prove herself to her father.

458
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:29,850
I can't allow that.

459
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,773
So, what do you want from me?

460
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,731
I'm putting her
on a train home tonight.

461
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,313
But I need assurances from you,
you won't get involved.

462
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,322
Not good enough.

463
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,151
She needs to suffer
for what she has done.

464
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,281
That is not gonna happen.

465
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,408
And how do you think
your girlfriend's gonna react

466
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,989
when she realizes you betrayed her?

467
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,826
You think she's just gonna
run away quietly?

468
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,621
If she sets foot in Gotham again,
I'll put her behind bars.

469
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,046
And if I say no?

470
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,256
Then I'll have no choice

471
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,843
but to use the full force of the GCPD

472
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:06,470
to tear you apart,

473
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,511
piece by piece.

474
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,313
That does not sound very pleasant.

475
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,765
It won't be.

476
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,690
I guess I can put aside
my personal feelings

477
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,396
for the good of this city.

478
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,941
But I do have
one question for you, Jim.

479
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,443
When Sofia is gone,

480
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,661
where does that leave us?

481
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,743
No more licenses.

482
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,701
If you or any other criminal
in this city break the law,

483
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:34,035
my men will enforce it.

484
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,289
But at least you won't have to worry
about Sofia again.

485
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:41,794
So, do we have a deal?

486
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,760
After all we have been through
together, Jim,

487
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,888
it is nice that we can
resolve this matter with diplomacy.

488
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,731
Doc.

489
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,612
I heard about what happened
to your clinic.

490
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,114
What a shame.

491
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:11,414
I was looking forward to you
curing my Narrows Lung.

492
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,416
I want you cleared out of The Narrows
by the end of the day.

493
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,086
- What did you say to me?
- I think she was pretty clear.

494
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,003
Well, allow me to be clear.

495
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,051
This is my turf
and I'm not going anywhere.

496
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,973
And you two have dug your own graves.

497
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,884
Oh, well, then I guess
you don't want this.

498
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,100
What's that?

499
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,514
The antidote to the poison

500
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,816
I had slipped in your drink
about 30 minutes ago.

501
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,149
Ironic, isn't it?

502
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,356
It's the only thing from the clinic
that wasn't destroyed,

503
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,906
some vials of medicine I had mixed
into a deadly combination.

504
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,158
It should be kicking in
right about now.

505
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,040
You're bluffing.
I feel absolutely fine.

506
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,868
I'm sorry, what was that?

507
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,832
Get them.

508
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,331
Come any closer
and I'll destroy this.

509
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,009
Like I said,

510
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,600
leave by the end of the day
and you live.

511
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:19,724
Deal?

512
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,020
Oh!

513
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,400
Catch.

514
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,457
I know you're disappointed,
but I am doing this to protect you.

515
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,538
Disappointment
doesn't quite cover it, Jim.

516
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,585
If you stay in Gotham,
Penguin will kill you.

517
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,753
Don't put this on Penguin.

518
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,583
If you have something to say,
I think you should say it.

519
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:56,765
We're the same, Jim.

520
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,766
I saw it the first moment we met.

521
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,816
We both want power.

522
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,816
You want to deny it, but it's true.

523
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:08,273
And it is just easier
to send me away.

524
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,866
Detective Harper, please take
Miss Falcone to the train station

525
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,542
and escort her back home.

526
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,535
Please, don't do this.

527
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:22,828
Better get going.

528
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,421
You'll miss your train.

529
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,602
Gordon put her on the train.

530
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,480
Talk about a turn of events.

531
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,228
I did not see that coming.

532
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,150
What about the kid? You want me
to take him back to the orphanage?

533
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,319
That won't be necessary.

534
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,870
Martin, I have been thinking.

535
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:01,997
I was angry.

536
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,457
I did not mean what I...

537
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,751
Martin.

538
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,892
Martin.

539
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,148
Aw!

540
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,608
He's cute.

541
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,155
He doesn't talk.

542
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,830
Kid gives me the creeps.

543
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,955
Let's get this over with.

544
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,596
Nervous about something?

545
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,015
Well, we have a long way to go.

546
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:07,521
So, get comfy.

547
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,321
Tickets, please.

548
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,906
What...

549
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,584
- Hello, Victor.
- Where's the boy?

550
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,248
Alive, for now.

551
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,210
If Oswald wants to keep it that way,

552
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,213
he will meet me under
the Crown Point Bridge in one hour.

553
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,885
<i>Next stop, Stevenstown.</i>

554
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,511
It's my stop.

555
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,798
Do you mind?

556
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,016
Not at all.

557
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,561
Thank you.

558
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,834
Glad you could make it, Oswald.

559
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,006
Everything will be all right, Martin,
I promise.

560
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,138
Well, that depends on you.

561
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,841
Turn over control
of the underworld to me

562
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,394
and I'll let little Martin here
keep his head.

563
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,775
The name Falcone
used to mean something in this town.

564
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:35,150
Wait until your father hears of this.

565
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,199
Threatening the life of a child?
He will be disgusted.

566
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,526
Wrong.

567
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,199
My father will be proud.

568
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,580
Must be hard to live your whole life

569
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,128
trying to get Daddy's approval.

570
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,830
I, myself, can't relate,

571
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,588
seeing as my parents loved me
without condition.

572
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,132
Say one more word and I will kill him

573
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,057
and then I will execute you.

574
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,226
I am choosing compassion,

575
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,430
but I am willing
to change my position.

576
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,644
Don't hurt the boy.

577
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,938
He's innocent.

578
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,325
I submit!

579
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,157
Go ahead.

580
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,962
Martin, I want you to know,

581
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,677
I am sorry for what I said today.

582
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:43,843
I do care about you.

583
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,184
You know that's true, don't you?

584
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,355
Good.

585
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,691
Now, go wait in the car.

586
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,135
You were wise to use the boy.

587
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,637
As you know,

588
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,721
my heart is my greatest weakness.

589
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,441
But I will not allow him
to be used as a pawn

590
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,440
in your game anymore.

591
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,287
You wanted a war,

592
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,706
you've got one!

593
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,398
Ed, why so blue?

594
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,892
We had a great day.

595
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,355
You had a great day.

596
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,403
I did nothing to help.

597
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,938
That's not true.

598
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,773
I couldn't have done it without you.

599
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,656
I'm not meant to be a sidekick, Lee.

600
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,700
Sampson is right. I'm a has-been.

601
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,458
No, you're not.

602
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:43,126
Look, I asked you to trust me
with something today, and you did.

603
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,336
So, I'm gonna trust you
with something.

604
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,844
I haven't been looking
for a cure for your brain, Ed,

605
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:52,059
because there's nothing wrong
with you.

606
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,519
- But you...
- Sure,

607
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,598
at first there was an effect
from the ice.

608
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,399
But I ran all the tests, checks out.

609
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,065
There's nothing wrong
with you physically.

610
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,816
Your condition is psychological.

611
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:06,820
Think about it.

612
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,655
You knew every move
that Sampson was gonna make

613
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:10,987
before he made it.

614
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,744
You lied to me.

615
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:17,702
Why?

616
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,041
Because I was afraid
that if I told you the truth,

617
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,214
you would go back to being
who you were before.

618
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,499
The Riddler.

619
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,800
And I like who you've become.

620
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:28,922
Who's that?

621
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,641
Ed Nygma.

622
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,640
The Ed that you were before.

623
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,685
My friend.

624
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,065
Well, that backfired.

625
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,445
Penguin's gonna be coming for us.
What are we gonna do?

626
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,993
We hit him before he hits us.

627
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,495
Lady, you lost.

628
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,614
Penguin just blew up that kid.

629
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,541
I admit I didn't see that coming.

630
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,210
But Oswald still has to align
his capos before he moves on us.

631
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,288
We use that window of time
to make our play.

632
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:06,000
You didn't get told "no" a lot
as a kid, did you?

633
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,210
You took your shot and you missed.

634
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:09,796
We're going it alone from here.

635
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:10,963
You leave now,

636
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,056
and you will never have
a piece of this city.

637
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,520
Now, that sounded like a threat.

638
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,892
Your club is destroyed.
You have nowhere else to turn.

639
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,397
You need me.

640
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,026
Penguin may have won the battle,

641
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,316
but tomorrow, we win the war.

642
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,152
Boss.

643
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,538
My boy,

644
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,545
you did a splendid job of dying.

645
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,182
Victor will take you
to a safe location.

646
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,310
You can never return to Gotham.

647
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,352
This is goodbye, my friend.

648
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,452
There, there.

649
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:22,998
This is what I have to do
to protect you.

650
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,421
One day, when you're older,
you will understand.

651
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,764
Sofia's on our heels, boss.

652
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,011
Let's finish her off.

653
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,972
Have someone else take the kid.

654
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,441
No! I want my top man on this.

655
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:51,648
Besides, I have something much better
planned for Sofia Falcone.

656
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,494
You were right about the Pyg.

657
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,289
A precinct down south
recognized the picture

658
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,491
you had me send out.

659
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,625
His real name is Lazlo Valentine.

660
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,914
What do we know about him?

661
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,879
He was being held for a string
of murders down there 10 years ago.

662
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:08,956
But here's the thing.

663
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,542
His previous victims
weren't police officers

664
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,628
and there was no Pyg persona.

665
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,509
Serial killers
don't usually change their MO.

666
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:17,719
This guy did.

667
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,600
You said he was being held.

668
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:23,350
Did they say
why their case fell apart?

669
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,101
It didn't. He escaped.

670
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,977
Call Arkham. Have them
put a guard on his cell.

671
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,152
I'm on my way.

672
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,158
Pyg?

673
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,889
Pyg!

674
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,964
- Hello, Ed.
- No.

675
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,379
No!

676
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,847
Miss me?

677
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,267
Open it, let's go.

678
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,189
Sound the alarm!
