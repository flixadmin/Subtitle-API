Yeah, that's right. It is time.

475
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,118
And this is my way to go.

476
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,414
Suicide Squad, remember?

477
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,791
I'm expendable, John.

478
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,502
Even got the damn bomb in my head
to prove it.

479
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,756
This way, at least I get to go out doing
something honorable.

480
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,468
-You don't get to die that easy, Lawton.
-Really?

481
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,430
Why don't you give me even just one
good reason why not, huh?

482
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,141
Zoe.

[MUTTERS]

484
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,777
-What about the nerve gas?
-Believe me...

485
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,905
...Waller's already got that covered.

486
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,208
Go. Go. Go.

487
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,971
The drone shifted course.

488
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,807
-It's following us.
-Ha-ha-ha.

489
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,645
-Do you find that funny?
-Waller, what a woman.

490
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,231
How do you think she knew where to
send the drone, huh?

491
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,483
And I mean, the precise coordinates.

492
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,444
-The implants.
-Bomb and GPS.

493
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,196
Pretty clever, right?

494
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,783
The drone ain't targeting Gholem's house.
It's targeting me.

495
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,500
Hang on, do I get a say in this?

496
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,960
-Turn around.
-What are you doing?

497
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,004
-Look, I think I'd rather get blown up.
-Hold still.

498
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,297
This is gonna hurt.

499
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,661
The Markovian government is threatening
retaliation...

500
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,831
...following an unprovoked drone attack
over a no-fly zone.

501
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:46,418
Just the attention we wanted to avoid.
Well done.

502
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,671
-I'm not the one that sent that drone.
-It was cloaked.

503
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,008
An explosion atop a chemical weapons
cache is easy to explain.

504
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:57,345
Instead, there were witnesses and we had to
send in a SEAL team to clean out the estate.

505
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,140
Think twice before
dragging me in to do your dirty work.

506
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,393
Somehow I don't think it will be an issue.
Good day, Mr. Diggle.

507
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,197
Kind of uncanny.

508
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,701
How Diggle knew exactly where
Lawton's implant was.

509
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,997
Still, it exposed an obvious design flaw.

510
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,917
We'll be putting the implants
in their spinal vertebrae now.

511
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,879
Have Lawton and the others
prepped for surgery.

512
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,560
Waller said in a few years
you might even get a pardon.

513
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,896
Don't worry, John.

514
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,732
We both know
I'm not gonna be around that long.

515
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,669
DIGGLE:
You still employed?

516
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,880
People with my security clearance
aren't that easy to get rid of.

517
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:15,507
Right.

518
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,388
What about us, Johnny?

519
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,559
Last night, the man who killed my brother
showed more character...

520
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,479
...than the woman charged
with protecting the world.

Good and bad is not so clear to me.

00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,362
One thing I do know for sure...

524
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,114
...black and white...

525
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,577
...is that I can never lose you again.

526
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,706
Finally.

527
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,709
Something we agree on.

Well, there goes another...

...terrorist-turned-ally.

530
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,899
By the way, I put you in for a commendation
for saving Qadir's ass.

531
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,527
You owe me a beer.

532
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,828
Congratulations.

533
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,122
Yeah, well. "Kill a kid, get a medal," right?

534
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,459
When someone's shooting
a Kalashnikov at you...

535
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,752
...he's not a kid.

536
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,296
I see things differently.

537
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,089
It's a complicated world, Johnny.

538
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,176
Is it okay if I call you Johnny?

539
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,179
I don't think I caught
your first name, Michaels.

00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,181

It's really good to meet you, Lyla.

So does Thea.

a casual relationship with the truth.

You mean, for not letting you
push me away?

I'm going to stop doing that.

00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,748
Yeah. Good.

...can't be easy.

00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,403
Helping two people I care about?
There's nothing easier.

564
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,239
I came by to take Sara to dinner.

Okay.

Hello, Oliver.

569
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,438
Hello, Amanda.

00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,315
-Still mad at me?
-Lucky for you...

-...you've been pushed down that list.
-Really?

Who do you wanna kill more than me?

573
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,321
Slade Wilson is alive.

574
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,699
You killed him. It's not possible.

575
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,327
Everything is possible
where Slade is concerned.

576
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,496
And I need your help to find him.

00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,126
-I might have something.
-What?

578
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:24,088
There's a new player we've been tracking.
Mercenary.

00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:28,176
He's left a trail of bodies from Macao
to Istanbul to Lisbon.

580
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,845
A trail that leads right here to Starling.

We've been calling him Deathstroke.
