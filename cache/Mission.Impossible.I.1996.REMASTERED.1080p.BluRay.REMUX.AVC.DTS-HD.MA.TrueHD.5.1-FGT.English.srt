<i>an attaché at our embassy in Prague.</i>

48

<i>He is also a traitor.</i>

49
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,717
<i>He has stolen one half
of a CIA NOC list...</i>

50

<i>a record of all our deep-cover agents
working in Eastern Europe.</i>

51

<i>For security reasons,
the NOC list is divided in two.</i>

52

<i>The portion that Golitsyn already has
contains code names</i>

<i>but this half is useless
without its mate</i>

for the duration of the interior.

90
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,397

- No problem.

Of IMF agents at the embassy tonight.

You're worried about me. Why?

366
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,599
Well, for a little over two years,

367
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,520
we've been spotting serious blowback
in IMF operations.

368
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,230
We have a penetration.

369
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:36,441
The other day, we decoded a message
on the internet

370
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,777
from a Czech we know as Max.

371
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,697
- The arms dealer.
- That's right.

372
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,534
Max, it seems, has two unique gifts,

373
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:50,205
a capacity for anonymity
and for corrupting susceptible agents.

374
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,542
This time, he'd gotten to someone
on the inside.

375
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,004
He'd gotten himself
in a position to buy our NOC list.

376
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,132
An operation he referred to as job 314,

377
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,176
the job he thought
Golitsyn was doing tonight.

378
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,432
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.

379
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,478
That's correct.
The actual list is secure at Langley.

380
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:16,064
Golitsyn was a lightning rod.
He was one of ours.

381
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,654
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

382
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,871
This whole operation was a mole hunt.

383
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,706
Yeah.

384
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,586
The mole's deep inside

385
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,590
and like you said

386
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,720
you survived.

387
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,391
I want to show you something, Ethan.

388
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,896
Since your father's death,

389
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,024
your family's farm has been
in receivership

390
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:03,528
and now, suddenly, they're flush
with over 120 grand in the bank.

391
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:07,199
Your father's illness was supposed
to have wiped out that bank account.

392
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,330
Dying slowly in America, after all,
can be a very expensive proposition.

393
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,416
So...

394
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:21,588
Why don't we quietly get out of here
and onto a plane?

395
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,259

Kittridge, you've
never seen me very upset.

397

All right, Hunt. Enough is enough.

398
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,434
You have bribed, cajoled, and killed.

399

And you have done it using loyalties
on the inside.

Sir.

962
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,434
- What's this?
- Incoming, sir, for you.

963
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:37,145
X-ray's clean, electronics,
and no explosives.

964

Gene?

965
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,916
- How long to the London Terminus?
- Twenty, twenty-five minutes.

966

It's him.

This was not what we discussed.

I hope this doesn't preclude
a meeting in private.

<i>Not as long as you tell me
where the money is.</i>

977
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:41,394
The mere possibility is
worth $10 million.

Wouldn't worry about him.
When you get the money, he'll find you.

982
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:12,717
What's the matter?

983

- Try it. Try it again.

before we hit the Chunnel.

985

- MAX: What's the problem?
- Connection denied.

986
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:37,701
MAX: I can see that.
Did you check the batteries?

987
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:39,786
I always check the batteries.

988

Look, we don't need to know.

992
01:31:52,549 --> 01:31:54,426
If he's got that list,
he's gonna want to check it.

993

Listen, Jim,
is it such a good idea to kill him?

1011

Kittridge is here.

No one will believe him.

Of course...

1017
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:42,635
I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Claire.

- Ethan.
- JIM: Yes.

Ethan Hunt, darling.
You remember him, don't you?

1020
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:57,901
- You knew about Jim?
- Of course.

1021
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:03,323
Just exactly when he knew
is something of a question.

1022
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:04,657
Mind telling me, Ethan?

1023
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:07,827
Before or after I showed up in London?

1024
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:10,580
Before London...

1025
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,000
but after you took the Bible
from the Drake Hotel in Chicago.

Those damn Gideons.

1027

Ethan, if you knew about Jim, why...

1028
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:26,971
Why the masquerade? Why take the risk?

1029
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,850
Well, Claire, you've asked the question.

1030
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:33,144
And you are the answer.

1031
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:35,939
I knew about Jim.

1032
01:35:36,522 --> 01:35:38,107
JIM: But he didn't know about you.

1033

In all fairness, Ethan...

1034

Claire was never convinced
her charms would work on you.

having tasted the goods.
