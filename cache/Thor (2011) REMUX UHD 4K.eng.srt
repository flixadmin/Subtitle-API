1
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:22,443
Wait for it.

2
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,362
- Can I turn on the radio?
- No.

3
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,369
Jane, you can't keep doing this.

4
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,208
The last 17 occurrences
have been predictable to the second.

5
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,793
Jane, you're an astrophysicist,
not some storm chaser.

6
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:41,712
I'm telling you, there's a connection

7
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:44,590
between these atmospheric
disturbances and my research.

8
00:01:44,673 --> 00:01:49,261
Erik, I wouldn't have asked you to
fly out here if I wasn't absolutely sure.

9
00:01:49,553 --> 00:01:50,721
Jane?

10
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:52,389
I think you want to see this.

11
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:57,895
What is that?

12
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:07,905
I thought you said
it was a subtle aurora!

13
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:09,156
Go!

14
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,415
- Get closer.
- Right. Good one.

15
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:19,583
Go!

16
00:02:37,434 --> 00:02:38,561
What are you doing?

17
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:41,730
I am not dying for six college credits!

18
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:04,670
I think that was legally your fault.

19
00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:06,255
Get the first aid kit.

20
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:08,007
Do me a favour and don't be dead.

21
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,383
Please.

22
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:16,223
Where did he come from?

23
00:03:34,074 --> 00:03:35,743
Once,

24
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:39,580
mankind accepted a simple truth,

25
00:03:39,663 --> 00:03:43,334
that they were not alone
in this universe.

26
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:49,340
Some worlds man believed
to be home to their gods.

27
00:03:49,673 --> 00:03:52,426
Others, they knew to fear.

28
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,768
From a realm of cold and darkness
came the Frost Giants,

29
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:18,661
threatening to plunge the mortal world
into a new ice age.

30
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,088
But humanity
would not face this threat alone.

31
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:10,003
Our armies drove the Frost Giants
back into the heart of their own world.

32
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:15,634
The cost was great.

33
00:05:16,343 --> 00:05:18,053
In the end,

34
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:20,347
their king fell.

35
00:05:24,518 --> 00:05:28,021
And the source of their power
was taken from them.

36
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:31,191
With the last great war ended,

37
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:35,612
we withdrew from the other worlds
and returned home

38
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:37,865
to the Realm Eternal,

39
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,868
Asgard.

40
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,152
Here we remain as a beacon of hope,

41
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:19,072
shining out across the stars.

42
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:23,452
And though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends,

43
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:27,039
it was Asgard

44
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:29,124
and its warriors

45
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,667
that brought peace

46
00:06:31,376 --> 00:06:32,419
to the universe.

47
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:39,134
But the day will come

48
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:42,012
when one of you

49
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:44,932
will have to defend that peace.

50
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:47,851
Do the Frost Giants still live?

51
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:49,186
When I'm king,

52
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:53,190
I'll hunt the monsters down
and slay them all!

53
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:55,859
Just as you did, Father.

54
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:57,986
A wise king

55
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:02,157
never seeks out war.

56
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:09,581
But he must always be ready for it.

57
00:07:21,385 --> 00:07:23,846
- I'm ready, Father.
- So am I.

58
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,808
Only one of you can ascend
to the throne.

59
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:31,895
But both of you were born to be kings.

60
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,001
Oh, please.

61
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:54,102
Thor Odinson,

62
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:57,189
my heir,

63
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:02,152
my firstborn.

64
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:08,408
So long entrusted with
the mighty hammer Mjolnir,

65
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:11,578
forged in the heart of a dying star,

66
00:09:12,162 --> 00:09:14,915
its power has no equal,

67
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:17,709
as a weapon to destroy

68
00:09:17,793 --> 00:09:20,003
or as a tool to build.

69
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:23,298
'Tis a fit companion for a king.

70
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,386
I have defended Asgard

71
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:31,556
and the lives of the innocent
across the Nine Realms

72
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,017
from the time of the great beginning.

73
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:36,353
Though the day has come...

74
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:05,674
Do you swear to guard
the Nine Realms?

75
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:07,300
I swear.

76
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:10,595
And do you swear
to preserve the peace?

77
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:12,180
I swear.

78
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:14,266
Do you swear

79
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:17,894
to cast aside all selfish ambition

80
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,856
and to pledge yourself only
to the good of the Realms?

81
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:22,107
I swear!

82
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:24,776
Then, on this day,

83
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,487
I, Odin Allfather,

84
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:30,574
proclaim you...

85
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:45,380
The Frost Giants!

86
00:11:30,717 --> 00:11:32,719
The Jotuns must pay
for what they've done!

87
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:35,138
They have paid, with their lives.

88
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:38,308
The Destroyer did its work,

89
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:40,644
the Casket is safe, and all is well.

90
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:41,978
All is well?

91
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:45,524
They broke into the weapons vault!

92
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:48,193
If the Frost Giants had stolen
even one of these relics...

93
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:50,529
- They didn't.
- Well, I want to know why!

94
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:55,534
I have a truce with Laufey,
King of the Jotuns.

95
00:11:55,784 --> 00:12:00,205
He just broke your truce!
They know you are vulnerable!

96
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,249
What action would you take?

97
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:05,710
March into Jotunheim as you once did.
Teach them a lesson.

98
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:07,212
Break their spirits

99
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,422
so they'll never dare
try to cross our borders again.

100
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:10,858
You're thinking only as a warrior.

101
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:12,134
This was an act of war!

102
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:14,469
It was the act of but a few,
doomed to fail.

103
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:16,054
Look how far they got!

104
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:18,578
We will find the breach in our defences
and it will be sealed.

105
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,975
As King of Asgard...

106
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:22,811
But you're not king!

107
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,065
Not yet.

108
00:12:58,805 --> 00:13:01,808
It's unwise to be in my company
right now, Brother.

109
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:05,729
This was to be my day of triumph.

110
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:09,274
It'll come.

111
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:11,860
In time.

112
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:14,196
What's this?

113
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:18,783
If it's any consolation,
I think you're right.

114
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,703
About the Frost Giants,
about Laufey, about everything.

115
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:25,665
If they found a way to penetrate
Asgard's defences once,

116
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:27,292
who's to say they won't try again?

117
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,419
- Next time with an army.
- Exactly.

118
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:32,297
There's nothing you can do
without defying Father.

119
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:36,301
No, no, no. I know that look.

120
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:38,654
That's the only way
to ensure the safety of our borders.

121
00:13:38,678 --> 00:13:39,763
Thor, it's madness.

122
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:42,682
Madness? What sort of madness?

123
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:44,976
We're going to Jotunheim.

124
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:47,604
What?

125
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:49,898
This isn't like a journey to Earth

126
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:52,025
where you summon
a little lightning and thunder,

127
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:54,778
and the mortals worship you as a god.

128
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:56,154
This is Jotunheim.

129
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,531
My father fought his way into Jotunheim,

130
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:01,368
defeated their armies
and took their Casket.

131
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:03,119
We would just be looking for answers.

132
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:04,496
It is forbidden!

133
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,834
My friends, have you forgotten
all that we have done together?

134
00:14:10,168 --> 00:14:11,962
Fandral, Hogun.

135
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:14,923
Who led you
into the most glorious of battles?

136
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:16,883
You did.

137
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:19,302
And Volstagg,
to delicacies so succulent,

138
00:14:19,386 --> 00:14:21,972
you thought you'd died
and gone to Valhalla?

139
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,391
You did.

140
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:25,517
Yes!

141
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,560
And who proved wrong
all who scoffed at the idea

142
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:30,105
that a young maiden could be
one of the fiercest warriors

143
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:31,228
this realm has ever known?

144
00:14:31,273 --> 00:14:32,274
I did.

145
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:35,318
True, but I supported you, Sif.

146
00:14:35,402 --> 00:14:36,736
My friends,

147
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:39,155
we're going to Jotunheim.

148
00:15:30,373 --> 00:15:31,583
You leave this to me.

149
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:35,879
- Good Heimdall...
- You're not dressed warmly enough.

150
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:37,088
I'm sorry?

151
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,966
Do you think that you can deceive me?

152
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:41,993
- You must be mistaken...
- Enough!

153
00:15:46,097 --> 00:15:47,640
Heimdall, may we pass?

154
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:54,230
Never has an enemy slipped my watch
until this day.

155
00:15:55,732 --> 00:15:57,734
I wish to know how that happened.

156
00:15:57,817 --> 00:16:00,445
Then tell no one where we have gone
until we've returned.

157
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:02,364
Understand?

158
00:16:06,743 --> 00:16:08,995
What happened?
Silver tongue turn to lead?

159
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:55,083
Be warned.

160
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,754
I will honour my sworn oath
to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.

161
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:03,216
If your return
threatens the safety of Asgard,

162
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:05,677
Bifrost will remain closed to you

163
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:09,222
and you'll be left to die
in the cold waste of Jotunheim.

164
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:11,266
Couldn't you just
leave the bridge open for us?

165
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,642
To leave the bridge open

166
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:14,894
would unleash
the full power of the Bifrost

167
00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:17,981
and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.

168
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:20,358
I have no plans to die today.

169
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:22,152
None do.

170
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:09,699
We shouldn't be here.

171
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,495
Let's move.

172
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:13,680
Where are they?

173
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:15,098
Hiding,

174
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:16,766
as cowards always do.

175
00:19:27,193 --> 00:19:31,489
You've come a long way to die,
Asgardians.

176
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:34,117
I am Thor Odinson!

177
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,202
We know who you are.

178
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:38,871
How did your people get into Asgard?

179
00:19:48,214 --> 00:19:52,343
The House of Odin is full of traitors.

180
00:19:52,427 --> 00:19:54,929
Do not dishonour my father's name
with your lies!

181
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:58,850
Your father is a murderer and a thief!

182
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:02,312
And why have you come here?
To make peace?

183
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:05,648
You long for battle. You crave it.

184
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:08,234
You're nothing but a boy

185
00:20:08,484 --> 00:20:10,903
trying to prove himself a man.

186
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:15,617
Well, this "boy"
has grown tired of your mockery.

187
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:24,751
Thor, stop and think.

188
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:26,544
Look around you, we're outnumbered.

189
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:28,338
Know your place, Brother.

190
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:32,008
You know not
what your actions would unleash.

191
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:36,012
I do.

192
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:40,892
Go now, while I still allow it.

193
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:54,906
We will accept your most gracious offer.

194
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:09,003
Come on, Brother.

195
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,761
Run back home, little princess.

196
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,221
Damn.

197
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:24,852
Next?

198
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,249
At least make it a challenge for me!

199
00:22:06,644 --> 00:22:08,271
That's more like it.

200
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:45,183
Don't let them touch you!

201
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,310
Thor!

202
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:32,688
- We must go!
- Then go!

203
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,922
Run!

204
00:23:59,882 --> 00:24:01,217
Thor!

205
00:25:06,949 --> 00:25:08,284
Heimdall!

206
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:10,286
Open the bridge!

207
00:26:15,768 --> 00:26:18,437
Father! We'll finish them together!

208
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:19,939
Silence!

209
00:26:25,736 --> 00:26:27,321
Allfather.

210
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:30,825
You look weary.

211
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:34,120
Laufey,

212
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:36,038
end this now.

213
00:26:36,122 --> 00:26:38,165
Your boy sought this out.

214
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,084
You're right.

215
00:26:41,711 --> 00:26:44,630
And these are the actions of a boy,
treat them as such.

216
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:49,885
You and I can end this here and now,
before there's further bloodshed.

217
00:26:49,969 --> 00:26:53,639
We are beyond diplomacy now,
Allfather.

218
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:57,393
He'll get what he came for.

219
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:58,519
War

220
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:00,604
and death.

221
00:27:02,148 --> 00:27:03,733
So be it.

222
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:28,424
Why did you bring us back?

223
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:29,943
Do you realise what you've done?
What you've started?

224
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:33,054
- I was protecting my home.
- You cannot even protect your friends!

225
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:34,889
How can you hope
to protect a kingdom?

226
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:36,682
Get him to the healing room! Now!

227
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:40,561
There won't be a kingdom to protect
if you're afraid to act.

228
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:45,149
The Jotuns must learn to fear me,
just as they once feared you.

229
00:27:45,483 --> 00:27:47,860
That's pride and vanity talking,
not leadership.

230
00:27:48,027 --> 00:27:50,988
You've forgotten everything I taught you
about a warrior's patience.

231
00:27:51,072 --> 00:27:54,742
While you wait and be patient,
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

232
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:56,202
The old ways are done.

233
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:58,954
You'd stand giving speeches
while Asgard falls.

234
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,541
You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

235
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:05,669
And you are an old man and a fool!

236
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:13,677
Yes.

237
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:16,180
I was a fool

238
00:28:17,223 --> 00:28:18,432
to think you were ready.

239
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:20,059
Father...

240
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:26,690
Thor Odinson,

241
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,445
you have betrayed
the express command of your king.

242
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,323
Through your arrogance and stupidity,

243
00:28:34,406 --> 00:28:37,284
you've opened these peaceful realms
and innocent lives

244
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:41,080
to the horror and desolation of war!

245
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:51,048
You are unworthy of these realms!

246
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,968
You're unworthy of your title!

247
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:55,719
You're unworthy

248
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:02,852
of the loved ones you have betrayed.

249
00:29:13,154 --> 00:29:15,322
I now take from you your power!

250
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:19,493
In the name of my father

251
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:21,787
and his father before,

252
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,748
I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!

253
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:34,675
Whosoever holds this hammer,
if he be worthy,

254
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:36,427
shall possess the power of Thor.

255
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:03,162
I think that was legally your fault.

256
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:04,914
Get the first aid kit.

257
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,415
Do me a favour and don't be dead.

258
00:30:12,296 --> 00:30:14,506
Does he need CPR?
Because I totally know CPR.

259
00:30:27,353 --> 00:30:28,854
Where did he come from?

260
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:33,776
You all right?

261
00:30:33,943 --> 00:30:34,944
Hammer?

262
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:36,237
Hammer?

263
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,480
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
It's pretty obvious.

264
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:41,492
Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!

265
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:44,370
We have to move quickly
before this all changes.

266
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:47,122
Jane, we have to take him
to the hospital.

267
00:30:47,289 --> 00:30:49,625
- Father!
- He's fine, look at him.

268
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:53,712
Heimdall! I know you can hear me!
Open the Bifrost!

269
00:30:53,796 --> 00:30:55,714
Hospital. You go, I'll stay.

270
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:58,300
You. What realm is this?

271
00:30:58,384 --> 00:30:59,885
Alfheim? Nornheim?

272
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,011
New Mexico?

273
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,432
You dare threaten me, Thor,
with so puny a weapon?

274
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:10,938
What? He was freaking me out!

275
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:13,399
Next time
you decide to taser somebody,

276
00:31:13,482 --> 00:31:15,901
make sure he's already in the car, okay?

277
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:19,196
Jane! Come on.

278
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:38,257
Name?

279
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,884
He said it was Thor?

280
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,221
T-H-O-R.

281
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,308
- And your relationship to him?
- I've never met him before.

282
00:31:47,391 --> 00:31:48,892
Until she hit him with a car.

283
00:31:49,018 --> 00:31:51,687
I grazed him, but she tasered him.

284
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:53,314
Yes, I did.

285
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:56,025
Hi.

286
00:31:57,401 --> 00:31:58,481
Just taking a little blood.

287
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,904
How dare you attack the son of Odin?

288
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:02,865
I need some help!

289
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:05,492
Call security!

290
00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:07,911
Security to ER 3, stat!

291
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:23,886
You're no match for the Mighty...

292
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:28,200
You don't think
this was just a magnetic storm, do you?

293
00:33:28,492 --> 00:33:31,286
Look, the lensing around these edges

294
00:33:31,412 --> 00:33:33,789
is characteristic
of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

295
00:33:33,997 --> 00:33:35,040
A what?

296
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:37,268
- I thought you were a science major?
- Political science.

297
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,128
She was the only applicant.

298
00:33:39,211 --> 00:33:41,880
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection

299
00:33:41,964 --> 00:33:43,274
between two different points
of space-time.

300
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:44,633
It's a wormhole.

301
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:47,719
- Erik, look. What do you see?
- Stars.

302
00:33:47,803 --> 00:33:49,638
Yeah, but not our stars.

303
00:33:49,721 --> 00:33:53,475
See, this is the star alignment
for our quadrant this time of year,

304
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:56,687
and unless Ursa Minor decided
to take a day off,

305
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,981
these are
someone else's constellations.

306
00:33:59,064 --> 00:34:00,899
Hey! Check this out.

307
00:34:07,698 --> 00:34:09,491
No, it can't be.

308
00:34:11,452 --> 00:34:13,662
I think I left something at the hospital.

309
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,263
It's not possible!

310
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:47,654
He was on drugs or something.
He just went nuts.

311
00:34:56,288 --> 00:34:57,956
Oh, my God.

312
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:03,504
I just lost
my most important piece of evidence.

313
00:35:03,587 --> 00:35:04,630
Typical.

314
00:35:04,713 --> 00:35:06,882
- So now what?
- We find him.

315
00:35:06,965 --> 00:35:08,342
Did you see what he did in there?

316
00:35:08,425 --> 00:35:10,219
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

317
00:35:10,302 --> 00:35:12,697
Well, our data can't tell us
what it was like to be inside that event,

318
00:35:12,721 --> 00:35:15,390
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

319
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:16,517
Okay.

320
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,228
So we're gonna look
all over New Mexico, right?

321
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:20,646
Exactly.

322
00:35:24,942 --> 00:35:25,943
What?

323
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:30,155
I'm so sorry.
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

324
00:35:47,256 --> 00:35:48,840
I got it, I got it.

325
00:35:58,642 --> 00:36:00,477
Come on, kick it in now!

326
00:36:09,152 --> 00:36:10,362
Did it work?

327
00:36:32,175 --> 00:36:34,303
Sir, we found it.

328
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:44,896
You know, for a crazy homeless person,
he's pretty cut.

329
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:50,027
Hey, sorry I tased you!

330
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:54,448
Excuse me, excuse me!

331
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:03,206
What is this?

332
00:37:06,126 --> 00:37:07,377
My ex.

333
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:11,923
Good with patients
and bad with relationships.

334
00:37:12,924 --> 00:37:14,485
They're the only clothes I had
that would fit you.

335
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:15,552
They will suffice.

336
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:17,638
You're welcome.

337
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:19,181
This mortal form has grown weak.

338
00:37:20,057 --> 00:37:21,099
I need sustenance.

339
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:42,162
We should never have let him go.

340
00:37:42,412 --> 00:37:43,914
There was no stopping him.

341
00:37:43,997 --> 00:37:45,957
Well, at least he's only banished,
not dead.

342
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,334
Which is what we'd all be

343
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:50,128
if that guard hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.

344
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,011
How did the guard even know?

345
00:37:58,512 --> 00:37:59,596
I told him.

346
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:02,099
What?

347
00:38:02,182 --> 00:38:04,768
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

348
00:38:04,935 --> 00:38:06,329
He should be flogged for taking so long.

349
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:07,896
We should never have
reached Jotunheim.

350
00:38:07,979 --> 00:38:09,022
You told the guard?

351
00:38:09,189 --> 00:38:11,108
I saved our lives.

352
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:13,026
And Thor's.

353
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,570
I had no idea Father would banish him
for what he did.

354
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,781
Loki.

355
00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:21,326
You must go to the Allfather
and convince him to change his mind.

356
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:24,037
And if I do, then what?

357
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:26,957
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is.

358
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,168
He's arrogant.
He's reckless. He's dangerous.

359
00:38:30,252 --> 00:38:32,212
You saw how he was today.

360
00:38:32,504 --> 00:38:34,104
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

361
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:43,473
He may speak of the good of Asgard,
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

362
00:38:44,474 --> 00:38:46,643
We should be grateful to him,
he saved our lives.

363
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:48,812
Laufey said

364
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:51,398
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

365
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:56,319
A master of magic
could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.

366
00:38:58,155 --> 00:38:59,823
Loki's always been one for mischief,

367
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:02,325
but you're talking
about something else entirely.

368
00:39:22,846 --> 00:39:24,181
Stop!

369
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:29,352
Am I cursed?

370
00:39:29,686 --> 00:39:30,854
No.

371
00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:36,193
What am I?

372
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,695
You're my son.

373
00:39:48,872 --> 00:39:50,874
What more than that?

374
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:58,298
The Casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day,

375
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,382
was it?

376
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:07,474
No.

377
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:10,644
In the aftermath of the battle,

378
00:40:10,727 --> 00:40:13,563
I went into the temple
and I found a baby.

379
00:40:18,068 --> 00:40:20,904
Small for a giant's offspring.

380
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:24,241
Abandoned, suffering, left to die.

381
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:26,910
Laufey's son.

382
00:40:28,745 --> 00:40:30,413
Laufey's son.

383
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:35,252
Yes.

384
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:39,840
Why?

385
00:40:40,257 --> 00:40:43,593
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood,
why would you take me?

386
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:45,178
You were an innocent child.

387
00:40:45,262 --> 00:40:49,266
No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?

388
00:40:52,936 --> 00:40:54,938
Tell me!

389
00:40:56,606 --> 00:40:59,442
I thought
we could unite our kingdoms one day.

390
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:02,863
Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.

391
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:04,531
Through you.

392
00:41:04,614 --> 00:41:05,782
What?

393
00:41:06,783 --> 00:41:09,202
But those plans no longer matter.

394
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:14,040
So I am no more
than another stolen relic,

395
00:41:14,124 --> 00:41:16,585
locked up here
until you might have use of me.

396
00:41:16,668 --> 00:41:18,128
Why do you twist my words?

397
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:20,273
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning,

398
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:21,298
why didn't you?

399
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:22,716
You're my son.

400
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,385
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

401
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,471
Because I'm the monster

402
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:30,640
parents tell their children about
at night?

403
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:32,809
- No, no.
- You know, it all makes sense now!

404
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,645
Why you favoured Thor all these years!

405
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:38,607
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,

406
00:41:39,065 --> 00:41:42,319
you could never have a Frost Giant
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

407
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:03,673
Guards!

408
00:42:04,507 --> 00:42:06,676
Guards, please, help!

409
00:42:12,515 --> 00:42:14,267
How'd you get inside that cloud?

410
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:17,020
Also, how could you eat
an entire box of Pop-Tarts

411
00:42:17,103 --> 00:42:18,647
and still be this hungry?

412
00:42:24,444 --> 00:42:26,821
- This drink, I like it.
- I know. It's great, right?

413
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:28,031
Another!

414
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:31,117
Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

415
00:42:34,704 --> 00:42:36,790
- What was that?
- It was delicious. I want another.

416
00:42:36,873 --> 00:42:39,084
- Well, you could have just said so.
- I just did.

417
00:42:39,209 --> 00:42:42,587
- No, I mean, ask nicely.
- I meant no disrespect.

418
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:44,031
All right. Well, no more smashing.

419
00:42:44,255 --> 00:42:45,340
Deal?

420
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:48,802
You have my word.

421
00:42:50,053 --> 00:42:51,096
Good.

422
00:42:52,472 --> 00:42:54,349
The usual, please, Izzy.

423
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:56,977
You missed all the excitement
out at the crater.

424
00:42:57,394 --> 00:43:00,480
They're saying some kind of satellite
landed out in the desert.

425
00:43:00,563 --> 00:43:02,440
Yeah, we were having
a good time with it

426
00:43:02,857 --> 00:43:04,234
until the Feds showed up.

427
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:07,153
Excuse me.
Did you say there was a satellite crash?

428
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:08,279
Yeah.

429
00:43:08,363 --> 00:43:10,782
Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook.
Smile.

430
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:15,078
What did it look like, the satellite?

431
00:43:15,912 --> 00:43:18,832
I don't know anything about satellites,
but it was heavy.

432
00:43:19,582 --> 00:43:23,086
I mean, nobody could lift it.

433
00:43:23,169 --> 00:43:25,839
They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.

434
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:27,590
Which way?

435
00:43:29,759 --> 00:43:31,761
Fifty miles west of here.

436
00:43:32,095 --> 00:43:33,805
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

437
00:43:33,888 --> 00:43:35,888
Looked like the whole Army
was coming when we left.

438
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:42,063
Dumbass!

439
00:43:42,897 --> 00:43:44,232
Where are you going?

440
00:43:44,607 --> 00:43:46,651
- Fifty miles west of here.
- Why?

441
00:43:46,735 --> 00:43:50,113
- To get what belongs to me.
- So you own a satellite now?

442
00:43:50,196 --> 00:43:51,257
It's not what they say it is.

443
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:52,323
Well, whatever it is,

444
00:43:52,407 --> 00:43:53,801
the government seems to think
it's theirs.

445
00:43:53,825 --> 00:43:55,869
So, you just intend to go in there
and take it?

446
00:43:55,952 --> 00:43:57,037
Yes.

447
00:43:58,496 --> 00:43:59,706
If you take me there now,

448
00:43:59,789 --> 00:44:01,469
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

449
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,043
- Everything?
- Yes.

450
00:44:03,126 --> 00:44:05,920
All the answers you seek will be yours
once I reclaim Mjolnir.

451
00:44:06,004 --> 00:44:08,048
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?

452
00:44:08,131 --> 00:44:10,091
Can I have a word, Jane?

453
00:44:14,137 --> 00:44:15,638
Please don't do this.

454
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:17,807
You saw what I saw last night.

455
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:20,369
This is no coincidence.
We have to find out what's in that crater.

456
00:44:20,393 --> 00:44:22,413
But I'm not talking about the crater,
I'm talking about him.

457
00:44:22,437 --> 00:44:25,148
- But he's promising us the answers.
- He's delusional.

458
00:44:25,231 --> 00:44:26,311
Listen to what he's saying.

459
00:44:26,357 --> 00:44:30,278
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

460
00:44:30,612 --> 00:44:32,822
It's the stories I grew up with as a child.

461
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:35,742
I'm just going to drive him. That's it.

462
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:37,952
He's dangerous, Jane.

463
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:46,795
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

464
00:44:46,878 --> 00:44:48,338
Then this is where we say goodbye.

465
00:44:58,807 --> 00:45:00,475
Thank you?

466
00:45:01,226 --> 00:45:02,977
Jane Foster,

467
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:04,646
Erik Selvig,

468
00:45:04,729 --> 00:45:06,231
Darcy,

469
00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:07,774
farewell.

470
00:45:11,402 --> 00:45:12,737
All right.

471
00:45:13,404 --> 00:45:14,989
Back to work.

472
00:45:35,426 --> 00:45:37,011
That's my stuff!

473
00:45:41,724 --> 00:45:43,017
What the hell is going on here?

474
00:45:43,101 --> 00:45:45,103
Ms Foster,
I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

475
00:45:45,186 --> 00:45:46,855
Is that supposed to mean something
to me?

476
00:45:46,938 --> 00:45:48,231
- You can't do this!
- Jane!

477
00:45:48,606 --> 00:45:51,442
Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realise. Let it go.

478
00:45:51,526 --> 00:45:53,570
Let it go? This is my life.

479
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,905
We're investigating a security threat.

480
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:58,700
We need to appropriate your records
and all your atmospheric data.

481
00:45:58,783 --> 00:46:01,202
By "appropriate," do you mean steal?

482
00:46:01,286 --> 00:46:02,996
Here, this should
more than compensate you

483
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:04,080
for your trouble.

484
00:46:04,205 --> 00:46:06,749
I can't just buy replacements
at Radio Shack,

485
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:08,543
I made most of this equipment myself!

486
00:46:08,626 --> 00:46:09,986
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

487
00:46:10,044 --> 00:46:13,173
And I'm sure I can sue you
for violating my constitutional rights!

488
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:15,758
I'm sorry, Ms Foster,
but we're the good guys.

489
00:46:15,842 --> 00:46:17,927
So are we!

490
00:46:18,011 --> 00:46:21,222
I'm on the verge of understanding
something extraordinary.

491
00:46:21,306 --> 00:46:23,099
And everything I know
about this phenomenon

492
00:46:23,183 --> 00:46:25,059
is either in this lab or in this book.

493
00:46:25,143 --> 00:46:27,854
And you can't just take this away... Hey!

494
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:31,733
Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...

495
00:46:34,152 --> 00:46:35,987
Thank you for your cooperation.

496
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:55,673
Years of research,

497
00:46:55,757 --> 00:46:56,758
gone.

498
00:46:57,175 --> 00:46:59,677
They even took my iPod.

499
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:02,430
- What about the backups?
- They took our backups.

500
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,184
They took the backups of our backups.
They were extremely thorough.

501
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:08,603
I just downloaded, like,
30 songs onto there.

502
00:47:08,686 --> 00:47:11,606
Could you please stop with your iPod?

503
00:47:12,148 --> 00:47:14,317
Who are these people?

504
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:17,779
I knew this scientist.

505
00:47:18,321 --> 00:47:20,823
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

506
00:47:20,907 --> 00:47:23,034
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up

507
00:47:24,285 --> 00:47:25,954
and he wasn't heard from again.

508
00:47:26,788 --> 00:47:30,208
They're not gonna do that to us.
I'm gonna get everything back.

509
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:33,086
Come on, please.
Let me contact one of my colleagues.

510
00:47:33,211 --> 00:47:35,672
He's had some dealings
with these people before.

511
00:47:35,922 --> 00:47:38,383
I'll e-mail him and maybe he can help.

512
00:47:39,425 --> 00:47:40,885
They took your laptop, too.

513
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,563
Allfather,
we must speak with you urgently.

514
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,412
My friends.

515
00:48:07,745 --> 00:48:09,414
Where's Odin?

516
00:48:09,664 --> 00:48:12,583
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.

517
00:48:14,085 --> 00:48:16,754
Mother fears
he may never awaken again.

518
00:48:17,255 --> 00:48:18,464
We would speak with her.

519
00:48:18,673 --> 00:48:21,843
She has refused to leave
my father's bedside.

520
00:48:24,095 --> 00:48:26,848
You can bring your urgent matter to me.

521
00:48:34,272 --> 00:48:35,606
Your king.

522
00:48:46,826 --> 00:48:51,164
My King, we would ask
that you end Thor's banishment.

523
00:48:55,835 --> 00:48:59,255
My first command
cannot be to undo the Allfather's last.

524
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:04,510
We're on the brink of war
with Jotunheim.

525
00:49:05,678 --> 00:49:08,556
Our people need a sense of continuity,

526
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:11,434
in order to feel safe
in these difficult times.

527
00:49:12,643 --> 00:49:14,437
All of us must stand together

528
00:49:15,271 --> 00:49:16,939
for the good of Asgard.

529
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,985
Yes, of course.

530
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:24,280
- Good. Then you will wait for my word.
- If I may

531
00:49:25,948 --> 00:49:30,453
beg the indulgence of Your Majesty
to perhaps reconsider...

532
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:31,788
We're done!

533
00:50:35,768 --> 00:50:36,769
I need a horse!

534
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:42,191
We don't have horses.
Just dogs, cats, birds...

535
00:50:42,316 --> 00:50:44,527
Then give me one of those
large enough to ride.

536
00:50:45,153 --> 00:50:46,696
Hey, you still need a lift?

537
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:54,620
I've never done anything like this before.

538
00:50:55,997 --> 00:50:59,375
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

539
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:00,960
Many times.

540
00:51:01,794 --> 00:51:03,296
But you're brave to do it.

541
00:51:03,379 --> 00:51:05,923
Well, they just stole
my entire life's work.

542
00:51:06,007 --> 00:51:07,925
I don't really have much left to lose.

543
00:51:09,302 --> 00:51:10,303
Yeah, but you're clever.

544
00:51:11,387 --> 00:51:14,307
Far more clever than anyone else
in this realm.

545
00:51:14,557 --> 00:51:16,934
"Realm"? "Realm"?

546
00:51:17,351 --> 00:51:20,104
- You think me strange.
- Yeah, I do.

547
00:51:20,646 --> 00:51:22,982
Good strange or bad strange?

548
00:51:23,191 --> 00:51:25,151
I'm not quite sure yet.

549
00:51:30,156 --> 00:51:31,824
I'm sorry.

550
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:38,080
But who are you?

551
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:41,667
Really?

552
00:51:44,212 --> 00:51:45,630
You'll see soon enough.

553
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:48,090
You promised me answers.

554
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:53,638
What you seek, it's a bridge.

555
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:55,890
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

556
00:51:55,973 --> 00:51:57,141
More like a Rainbow Bridge.

557
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:02,605
God, I hope you're not crazy.

558
00:52:12,365 --> 00:52:15,785
I never get used to seeing him like this.

559
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:19,705
He's put it off for so long now,
that I fear...

560
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,960
How long will it last?

561
00:52:24,377 --> 00:52:28,631
I don't know. This time it's different.
We were unprepared.

562
00:52:30,883 --> 00:52:32,552
So why did he lie?

563
00:52:33,386 --> 00:52:37,640
He kept the truth from you
so that you would never feel different.

564
00:52:37,723 --> 00:52:40,059
You are our son, Loki,

565
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,687
and we, your family.

566
00:52:44,564 --> 00:52:48,568
We mustn't lose hope
that your father will return to us.

567
00:52:49,735 --> 00:52:51,237
And your brother.

568
00:52:52,655 --> 00:52:54,490
What hope is there for Thor?

569
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:58,327
There's always a purpose
to everything your father does.

570
00:53:31,068 --> 00:53:32,695
That's no satellite crash!

571
00:53:32,778 --> 00:53:34,089
They would have hauled
the wreckage away,

572
00:53:34,113 --> 00:53:35,793
they wouldn't have built a city around it.

573
00:53:37,116 --> 00:53:40,620
- You're going to need this.
- What? Wait, why?

574
00:53:43,956 --> 00:53:45,291
Now stay here.

575
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:49,211
Once I have Mjolnir, I will return
the items they've stolen from you.

576
00:53:49,545 --> 00:53:50,546
Deal?

577
00:53:50,921 --> 00:53:53,215
No. Look what's down there.

578
00:53:53,299 --> 00:53:56,177
You think you're just gonna walk in,
grab our stuff and walk out?

579
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,304
No. I'm going to fly out.

580
00:54:06,228 --> 00:54:08,981
Sir, feed from the keyhole
can barely penetrate the cloud cover.

581
00:54:09,315 --> 00:54:10,608
Tech's barely working as it is,

582
00:54:10,691 --> 00:54:12,902
with all the interference
that thing's giving off.

583
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:15,738
And we've got a commercial aircraft
coming right over us.

584
00:54:15,821 --> 00:54:18,908
Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.

585
00:54:18,991 --> 00:54:20,231
Reroute it like all the others.

586
00:54:20,951 --> 00:54:21,994
Hold a sec.

587
00:54:22,578 --> 00:54:25,414
We've got something outside the fence,
west side.

588
00:54:25,581 --> 00:54:28,959
Delancey, Jackson.
West side perimeter. Go check it out.

589
00:54:31,462 --> 00:54:32,797
There it is.

590
00:54:41,597 --> 00:54:43,224
Delancey, Jackson. Report.

591
00:54:51,524 --> 00:54:53,442
Agent down.
We've got a perimeter breach.

592
00:55:06,414 --> 00:55:10,543
You've reached Dr Erik Selvig.
Please leave me a message.

593
00:55:11,377 --> 00:55:14,547
Hi, Erik, it's me. Don't worry, I'm fine,

594
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,258
but just in case
you don't hear from me in the next hour,

595
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:20,219
just come by the crater site
and try and find me, okay?

596
00:55:20,302 --> 00:55:23,139
I did exactly what you told me not to.
I'm sorry.

597
00:55:23,389 --> 00:55:24,890
So sorry. Bye.

598
00:55:28,728 --> 00:55:30,020
Bravo quadrant, move!

599
00:55:43,534 --> 00:55:44,660
Entering south tunnel!

600
00:55:46,787 --> 00:55:48,330
Negative, negative.
I have no comms.

601
00:56:02,386 --> 00:56:04,221
Target sighted, east tunnel!

602
00:56:04,472 --> 00:56:06,182
I need eyes up high, with a gun.

603
00:56:31,957 --> 00:56:33,167
Moving north!

604
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:42,134
What have we got?

605
00:56:42,218 --> 00:56:43,738
There's a massive
electromagnetic surge

606
00:56:43,803 --> 00:56:44,929
coming off that thing.

607
00:56:45,012 --> 00:56:46,806
Systems are barely coping.

608
00:56:46,972 --> 00:56:48,724
Barton? Talk to me.

609
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,727
You want me to slow him down, sir?

610
00:56:52,937 --> 00:56:55,189
Or are you sending in more guys
for him to beat up?

611
00:56:55,397 --> 00:56:56,899
I'll let you know.

612
00:57:11,747 --> 00:57:13,082
You're big.

613
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:15,543
Fought bigger.

614
00:58:00,045 --> 00:58:03,883
Better call it, Coulson,
'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.

615
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:25,571
Last chance, sir.

616
00:58:25,654 --> 00:58:27,740
Wait. I want to see this.

617
00:59:36,767 --> 00:59:39,770
All right, show's over.
Ground units, move in.

618
01:00:32,448 --> 01:00:34,450
He committed a crime. He's in jail!

619
01:00:34,533 --> 01:00:36,702
- I can't just leave him there!
- Why?

620
01:00:36,952 --> 01:00:38,954
You didn't see what I saw!

621
01:00:39,288 --> 01:00:41,290
Look! Look, it's Myeu-muh.

622
01:00:46,045 --> 01:00:47,129
Where'd you find this?

623
01:00:47,421 --> 01:00:48,547
The children's section.

624
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:51,050
I just wanted to show you
how silly his story was.

625
01:00:51,133 --> 01:00:53,052
But you're the one
who's always pushing me

626
01:00:53,135 --> 01:00:55,262
to chase down every possibility,
every alternative!

627
01:00:55,345 --> 01:00:57,598
I'm talking about science, not magic!

628
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,993
Well, magic's just science
that we don't understand yet.

629
01:01:00,017 --> 01:01:02,644
- Arthur C. Clarke.
- Who wrote science fiction.

630
01:01:02,728 --> 01:01:05,230
- A precursor to science fact!
- In some cases, yeah.

631
01:01:05,314 --> 01:01:06,994
Well, if there is
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

632
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:08,501
then there's something
on the other side.

633
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:10,235
And advanced beings
could have crossed it!

634
01:01:10,402 --> 01:01:11,403
Jane.

635
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,530
A primitive culture like the Vikings
might have worshipped them as deities.

636
01:01:14,573 --> 01:01:16,325
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

637
01:01:24,083 --> 01:01:25,250
You made my men,

638
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:27,795
some of the most
highly trained professionals in the world,

639
01:01:27,878 --> 01:01:30,672
look like a bunch of minimum-wage
mall cops.

640
01:01:32,508 --> 01:01:33,717
That's hurtful.

641
01:01:34,802 --> 01:01:38,263
In my experience, it takes someone
who's received similar training

642
01:01:38,722 --> 01:01:39,802
to do what you did to them.

643
01:01:41,433 --> 01:01:43,936
Why don't you tell me
where you received your training?

644
01:01:44,311 --> 01:01:47,898
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?

645
01:01:49,149 --> 01:01:52,402
No, you strike me
more as the soldier of fortune type.

646
01:01:53,237 --> 01:01:56,073
Where was it? South Africa?

647
01:01:57,574 --> 01:02:01,495
Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.

648
01:02:03,831 --> 01:02:05,249
Who are you?

649
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:12,631
One way or another,
we find out what we need to know.

650
01:02:13,006 --> 01:02:14,299
We're good at that.

651
01:02:20,055 --> 01:02:21,390
Don't go anywhere.

652
01:02:27,855 --> 01:02:30,357
Loki! What are you doing here?

653
01:02:30,691 --> 01:02:32,192
I had to see you.

654
01:02:33,861 --> 01:02:35,195
What's happened?

655
01:02:35,529 --> 01:02:37,531
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

656
01:02:37,865 --> 01:02:39,283
Let me explain to Father.

657
01:02:39,366 --> 01:02:40,701
Father is dead.

658
01:02:46,874 --> 01:02:48,208
What?

659
01:02:50,043 --> 01:02:51,712
Your banishment,

660
01:02:52,713 --> 01:02:54,882
the threat of a new war,

661
01:02:55,966 --> 01:02:57,718
it was too much for him to bear.

662
01:03:00,387 --> 01:03:02,556
You mustn't blame yourself.

663
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:04,892
I know that you loved him.

664
01:03:05,809 --> 01:03:08,562
I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.

665
01:03:10,772 --> 01:03:13,066
It was so cruel
to put the hammer within your reach,

666
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:15,110
knowing that you could never lift it.

667
01:03:18,447 --> 01:03:20,699
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

668
01:03:27,289 --> 01:03:28,957
Can I come home?

669
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,878
The truce with Jotunheim
is conditional upon your exile.

670
01:03:33,212 --> 01:03:39,343
- Yes, but couldn't we find a way...
- And Mother has forbidden your return.

671
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:44,306
This is goodbye, Brother.

672
01:03:46,725 --> 01:03:48,644
I'm so sorry.

673
01:03:54,233 --> 01:03:55,400
No.

674
01:03:56,902 --> 01:03:58,570
I am sorry.

675
01:04:03,992 --> 01:04:06,245
Thank you for coming here.

676
01:04:10,749 --> 01:04:12,084
Farewell.

677
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,431
Goodbye.

678
01:04:27,432 --> 01:04:28,433
Goodbye?

679
01:04:29,017 --> 01:04:30,352
I just got back.

680
01:05:06,305 --> 01:05:07,306
Sir?

681
01:05:08,223 --> 01:05:09,558
He's got a visitor.

682
01:05:15,063 --> 01:05:16,732
His name is Donald Blake?

683
01:05:16,982 --> 01:05:18,650
Dr Donald Blake.

684
01:05:18,859 --> 01:05:20,610
You have dangerous coworkers,
Dr Selvig.

685
01:05:20,902 --> 01:05:24,740
He was distraught when he found out
that you've taken all our research.

686
01:05:25,324 --> 01:05:27,826
That was years of his life, gone!

687
01:05:29,745 --> 01:05:32,080
You can understand
how a man could go off like that.

688
01:05:32,497 --> 01:05:34,624
A big, faceless organisation like yours

689
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,626
coming in with their
jackbooted thugs and...

690
01:05:38,837 --> 01:05:40,255
That's how he put it.

691
01:05:40,422 --> 01:05:41,465
That still doesn't explain

692
01:05:41,548 --> 01:05:43,268
how he managed
to tear through our security.

693
01:05:43,508 --> 01:05:46,845
Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.

694
01:05:48,513 --> 01:05:49,681
Sir?

695
01:05:54,353 --> 01:05:55,687
It says here that he's an M.D.

696
01:05:55,937 --> 01:05:58,231
Well, he is! Or he was.

697
01:05:58,315 --> 01:06:00,859
He switched careers
and became a physicist.

698
01:06:01,068 --> 01:06:02,861
A brilliant physicist.

699
01:06:02,944 --> 01:06:05,155
He's a wonderful man.
He's a man in pain.

700
01:06:07,699 --> 01:06:10,452
Donny, Donny, Donny!

701
01:06:10,952 --> 01:06:14,956
There you are. You're gonna be all right.
I'm taking you home now.

702
01:06:29,388 --> 01:06:30,889
Dr Selvig!

703
01:06:31,973 --> 01:06:34,393
Just keep him away from the bars.

704
01:06:34,893 --> 01:06:36,228
I will!

705
01:06:38,063 --> 01:06:40,899
- Where are we going?
- To get a drink.

706
01:06:41,233 --> 01:06:42,567
Follow them.

707
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:51,159
You know, I had it all backwards.

708
01:06:53,245 --> 01:06:54,746
I had it all wrong.

709
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:01,837
It's not a bad thing finding out
that you don't have all the answers.

710
01:07:02,254 --> 01:07:04,089
You start asking the right questions.

711
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:12,264
For the first time in my life,

712
01:07:12,347 --> 01:07:16,977
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

713
01:07:18,019 --> 01:07:20,981
Anyone who's ever going to
find his way in this world

714
01:07:21,064 --> 01:07:24,192
has to start by admitting
he doesn't know where the hell he is.

715
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:27,696
Thank you for what you've done.

716
01:07:27,863 --> 01:07:30,198
No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.

717
01:07:31,783 --> 01:07:34,453
Her father and I
taught at university together.

718
01:07:34,786 --> 01:07:36,371
He was a good man.

719
01:07:37,372 --> 01:07:38,457
He never listened.

720
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:41,376
Neither did I.

721
01:07:42,627 --> 01:07:44,713
My father
was trying to teach me something,

722
01:07:44,796 --> 01:07:46,715
but I was too stupid to see it.

723
01:07:47,799 --> 01:07:51,845
I don't know if you're delusional
or if you're pulling some kind of con,

724
01:07:51,928 --> 01:07:53,263
I don't care.

725
01:07:53,346 --> 01:07:54,681
I just care about her.

726
01:07:56,057 --> 01:07:58,477
I've seen the way she looks at you.

727
01:08:01,813 --> 01:08:04,399
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

728
01:08:04,649 --> 01:08:05,650
Good.

729
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:10,322
In that case, I'll buy you another round,
and you leave town tonight.

730
01:08:15,494 --> 01:08:17,329
Two boilermakers.

731
01:09:08,922 --> 01:09:10,507
Kill him.

732
01:09:12,008 --> 01:09:14,094
After all I've done for you?

733
01:09:16,471 --> 01:09:21,101
So you're the one
who showed us the way into Asgard.

734
01:09:21,434 --> 01:09:23,603
That was just a bit of fun, really.

735
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:27,774
To ruin my brother's big day.

736
01:09:28,608 --> 01:09:32,445
And to protect the realm
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

737
01:09:33,738 --> 01:09:36,074
I will hear you.

738
01:09:39,494 --> 01:09:43,957
I will conceal you
and a handful of your soldiers,

739
01:09:44,624 --> 01:09:49,629
lead you into Odin's chambers,
and you can slay him where he lies.

740
01:09:50,046 --> 01:09:51,756
Why not kill him yourself?

741
01:09:53,842 --> 01:09:56,511
I suspect that the Asgardians
would not take kindly

742
01:09:56,595 --> 01:09:58,847
to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.

743
01:10:00,015 --> 01:10:03,101
Once Odin is dead,
I will return the Casket to you

744
01:10:05,186 --> 01:10:08,189
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

745
01:10:11,067 --> 01:10:12,402
Glory.

746
01:10:13,695 --> 01:10:15,030
I...

747
01:10:16,531 --> 01:10:18,366
Accept.

748
01:10:24,205 --> 01:10:25,790
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

749
01:10:26,041 --> 01:10:31,046
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

750
01:10:31,713 --> 01:10:32,964
You were shrouded from me,

751
01:10:33,048 --> 01:10:35,216
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

752
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:38,887
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

753
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:40,639
Or perhaps someone has found a way

754
01:10:40,722 --> 01:10:43,808
to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.

755
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:47,145
You have great power, Heimdall.

756
01:10:49,648 --> 01:10:51,149
Did Odin ever fear you?

757
01:10:53,401 --> 01:10:55,070
- No.
- And why is that?

758
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,406
Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.

759
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:02,911
He was your king
and you're sworn to obey me now.

760
01:11:03,745 --> 01:11:04,829
Yes?

761
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,670
Yes.

762
01:11:12,379 --> 01:11:15,090
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

763
01:11:15,173 --> 01:11:18,009
until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

764
01:11:32,774 --> 01:11:34,776
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

765
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:37,112
He's fine. Not injured at all.

766
01:11:38,029 --> 01:11:39,531
I'm sorry, my friend.

767
01:11:39,656 --> 01:11:41,449
- What happened?
- We drank, we fought,

768
01:11:41,533 --> 01:11:43,034
he made his ancestors proud.

769
01:11:43,493 --> 01:11:45,328
Put him on the bed.

770
01:11:56,548 --> 01:12:00,135
I still don't think
you're the God of Thunder.

771
01:12:00,802 --> 01:12:02,971
But you ought to be.

772
01:12:14,065 --> 01:12:15,567
Are these your chambers?

773
01:12:15,984 --> 01:12:19,654
It's more of a temporary living situation.

774
01:12:20,488 --> 01:12:24,325
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

775
01:12:24,993 --> 01:12:27,829
Actually, I never have guests.

776
01:12:29,998 --> 01:12:32,167
That's not the right place for it.

777
01:12:33,168 --> 01:12:34,836
I'm sorry.

778
01:12:37,922 --> 01:12:38,965
Can we go outside?

779
01:12:39,841 --> 01:12:41,259
Yes, of course.

780
01:12:46,765 --> 01:12:49,058
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep

781
01:12:49,142 --> 01:12:53,271
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

782
01:12:54,522 --> 01:12:57,859
I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

783
01:13:01,863 --> 01:13:03,782
I'm really glad you're safe.

784
01:13:04,866 --> 01:13:07,368
You've been very kind to me,

785
01:13:08,077 --> 01:13:10,288
and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.

786
01:13:10,455 --> 01:13:12,165
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

787
01:13:12,248 --> 01:13:14,292
so I think that kind of evens things out.

788
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:18,546
Perhaps I had it coming.

789
01:13:24,385 --> 01:13:25,720
Oh, my God!

790
01:13:26,971 --> 01:13:28,306
I don't believe it!

791
01:13:28,556 --> 01:13:31,976
It was all I could get back.
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

792
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:36,731
No, no, this is great! This is...
I don't have to start from scratch now.

793
01:13:37,065 --> 01:13:38,399
Thank you.

794
01:13:43,071 --> 01:13:44,489
What's wrong?

795
01:13:45,907 --> 01:13:46,908
S.H.I.E.L.D.

796
01:13:46,991 --> 01:13:48,326
Whatever they are,

797
01:13:49,828 --> 01:13:51,468
they're gonna do
everything in their power

798
01:13:51,538 --> 01:13:54,249
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

799
01:13:54,415 --> 01:13:55,750
No, Jane.

800
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,253
Listen to me. You must not give up.

801
01:13:58,503 --> 01:14:00,505
- You must finish what you've started.
- Why?

802
01:14:00,755 --> 01:14:02,340
Because you're right.

803
01:14:02,841 --> 01:14:04,175
Here, look.

804
01:14:06,761 --> 01:14:10,265
Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

805
01:14:10,849 --> 01:14:13,601
Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

806
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:29,784
What is that?

807
01:14:30,785 --> 01:14:33,913
My father explained it to me like this,

808
01:14:33,997 --> 01:14:35,748
that your world

809
01:14:35,832 --> 01:14:38,668
is one of the Nine Realms
of the Cosmos,

810
01:14:38,751 --> 01:14:41,754
linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil,

811
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:44,048
the Worlds Tree.

812
01:14:44,299 --> 01:14:46,968
Now you see it every day
without realising.

813
01:14:47,302 --> 01:14:50,305
The images glimpsed through...
What did you call it?

814
01:14:50,805 --> 01:14:52,557
This Hooble Telescope.

815
01:14:53,141 --> 01:14:55,977
- Hubble.
- Hubble Telescope.

816
01:14:59,063 --> 01:15:00,398
Tell me more.

817
01:15:00,982 --> 01:15:02,483
So, the Nine Realms.

818
01:15:03,151 --> 01:15:05,653
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.

819
01:15:05,987 --> 01:15:07,488
This is Alfheim.

820
01:15:07,822 --> 01:15:10,491
Vanaheim. Jotunheim.

821
01:15:11,326 --> 01:15:12,660
And Asgard.

822
01:15:13,161 --> 01:15:15,079
And that's where I come from.

823
01:15:32,513 --> 01:15:33,848
Thank you, Jane.

824
01:15:37,268 --> 01:15:40,229
Our dearest friend banished,
Loki on the throne,

825
01:15:40,313 --> 01:15:43,691
Asgard on the brink of war,
yet you've managed to consume

826
01:15:43,858 --> 01:15:46,945
four wild boar,
six pheasant, a side of beef,

827
01:15:47,028 --> 01:15:50,490
and two casks of ale. Shame on you.
Don't you care?

828
01:15:51,282 --> 01:15:53,368
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!

829
01:15:53,618 --> 01:15:55,453
Stop it, both of you!

830
01:15:55,787 --> 01:15:56,788
Stop.

831
01:15:58,122 --> 01:16:00,541
- We all know what we have to do.
- We must go.

832
01:16:03,127 --> 01:16:05,463
We must find Thor.

833
01:16:06,631 --> 01:16:07,632
It's treason.

834
01:16:07,882 --> 01:16:09,634
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

835
01:16:09,884 --> 01:16:11,886
Thor would do the same for us.

836
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:14,305
Now shush.

837
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:18,142
Heimdall might be watching.

838
01:16:23,147 --> 01:16:25,817
Heimdall demands your presence.

839
01:16:30,321 --> 01:16:31,656
We're doomed.

840
01:16:31,906 --> 01:16:35,410
You would defy the commands of Loki,
our king,

841
01:16:36,077 --> 01:16:38,496
break every oath you
have taken as warriors,

842
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:40,915
and commit treason to bring Thor back?

843
01:16:41,082 --> 01:16:42,583
- Yes.
- Good.

844
01:16:43,167 --> 01:16:44,252
So you'll help us?

845
01:16:44,419 --> 01:16:49,215
I am bound by honour to our king.
I cannot open the bridge to you.

846
01:16:49,924 --> 01:16:51,592
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

847
01:16:51,843 --> 01:16:53,511
Now what do we do?

848
01:16:54,929 --> 01:16:56,180
Look!

849
01:17:15,575 --> 01:17:16,969
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, sir.

850
01:17:16,993 --> 01:17:18,345
We got massive energy readings
out of nowhere

851
01:17:18,369 --> 01:17:20,872
and then they just disappeared.
Fifteen miles due northwest.

852
01:17:20,955 --> 01:17:22,290
Let's go take a look.

853
01:17:47,273 --> 01:17:48,524
Thank you.

854
01:17:48,608 --> 01:17:50,610
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

855
01:17:57,742 --> 01:18:00,578
Base to Team 2,
we've got activity outside the town.

856
01:18:00,661 --> 01:18:01,788
Stay on your target.

857
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:13,633
Ensure my brother does not return.

858
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:19,138
Destroy everything.

859
01:18:29,982 --> 01:18:31,317
Mom?

860
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,202
Is there a Renaissance Fair in town?

861
01:18:41,285 --> 01:18:42,620
Call it in.

862
01:18:43,287 --> 01:18:44,288
Yeah.

863
01:18:46,207 --> 01:18:49,794
Base, we've got Xena, Jackie Chan
and Robin Hood.

864
01:18:50,378 --> 01:18:52,630
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

865
01:18:53,381 --> 01:18:56,634
But you won't be able to convince
the scientific community of any of it.

866
01:18:56,717 --> 01:18:58,052
Not without hard evidence.

867
01:18:58,970 --> 01:18:59,971
Found you!

868
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:07,979
My friends!

869
01:19:09,438 --> 01:19:11,482
This is good! This is good.

870
01:19:11,858 --> 01:19:13,067
I don't believe it.

871
01:19:13,526 --> 01:19:16,195
Excuse me.
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

872
01:19:18,948 --> 01:19:20,491
My friends,

873
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:23,077
I've never been happier to see anyone.

874
01:19:23,452 --> 01:19:24,954
But you should not have come.

875
01:19:27,039 --> 01:19:28,249
We're here to take you home.

876
01:19:29,792 --> 01:19:31,419
You know I can't go home.

877
01:19:33,796 --> 01:19:35,339
My father

878
01:19:36,382 --> 01:19:37,508
is dead because of me.

879
01:19:38,467 --> 01:19:40,720
And I must remain in exile.

880
01:19:40,803 --> 01:19:42,013
Thor,

881
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:44,056
your father still lives.

882
01:19:59,447 --> 01:20:02,408
Tell me, Loki,
how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?

883
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:06,120
You think the Bifrost is the only way
in and out of this realm?

884
01:20:06,204 --> 01:20:07,804
There are secret paths
between the worlds

885
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,541
to which even you, with all your gifts,
are blind.

886
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:13,794
But I have need of them no longer,
now that I am king.

887
01:20:13,878 --> 01:20:15,546
And I say, for your act of treason,

888
01:20:15,838 --> 01:20:18,549
you are relieved of your duties
as Gatekeeper,

889
01:20:18,674 --> 01:20:20,426
and no longer citizen of Asgard.

890
01:20:20,885 --> 01:20:23,512
Then I need no longer obey you.

891
01:20:44,033 --> 01:20:46,911
Get somebody from Linguistics
down here.

892
01:21:14,230 --> 01:21:15,898
Was somebody else coming?

893
01:21:20,152 --> 01:21:21,195
Is that one of Stark's?

894
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:24,865
I don't know.
The guy never tells me anything.

895
01:21:28,577 --> 01:21:29,829
Hello.

896
01:21:29,912 --> 01:21:32,623
You are using
unregistered weapons technology.

897
01:21:32,707 --> 01:21:33,874
Identify yourself.

898
01:21:37,628 --> 01:21:38,629
Here we go.

899
01:21:42,216 --> 01:21:43,384
Incoming!

900
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,435
Jane, you have to leave.

901
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,562
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm staying here.

902
01:21:54,812 --> 01:21:56,480
Thor's going to fight with us!

903
01:21:56,814 --> 01:21:58,149
My friends,

904
01:21:58,566 --> 01:22:02,570
I'm just a man. I'll only be in the way,
or worse, get one of you killed.

905
01:22:02,653 --> 01:22:04,739
But I can help
get these people to safety.

906
01:22:04,989 --> 01:22:07,074
Well, if you're staying, then so am I.

907
01:22:07,325 --> 01:22:09,660
- We'll need some time.
- You'll have it!

908
01:22:10,286 --> 01:22:11,787
Okay, move it, people!

909
01:22:12,663 --> 01:22:14,832
Everybody out! Use the back door.

910
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:16,834
Go, hurry! You can eat later.

911
01:22:29,513 --> 01:22:31,432
Keep it distracted.

912
01:22:46,072 --> 01:22:48,532
For Asgard!

913
01:23:23,901 --> 01:23:24,902
Fall back!

914
01:23:41,585 --> 01:23:42,628
Go. Now. Run!

915
01:24:10,906 --> 01:24:13,409
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.

916
01:24:13,742 --> 01:24:15,995
No. I will die a warrior's death.

917
01:24:16,245 --> 01:24:18,205
Stories will be told of this day.

918
01:24:18,456 --> 01:24:21,208
Live, and tell those stories yourself.

919
01:24:23,752 --> 01:24:25,337
Now go.

920
01:24:32,803 --> 01:24:35,764
You must return to Asgard.
You have to stop Loki.

921
01:24:36,015 --> 01:24:37,433
What about you?

922
01:24:37,516 --> 01:24:40,019
Do not worry, my friends. I have a plan.

923
01:24:40,769 --> 01:24:41,937
Come on.

924
01:24:45,983 --> 01:24:48,319
We need to fall back. Come on.

925
01:24:48,402 --> 01:24:49,403
Come on.

926
01:24:57,286 --> 01:24:58,454
Wait!

927
01:25:06,378 --> 01:25:07,546
What's he doing?

928
01:25:34,365 --> 01:25:38,077
Brother,
whatever I have done to wrong you,

929
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:41,413
whatever I have done
to lead you to do this,

930
01:25:41,747 --> 01:25:43,582
I am truly sorry.

931
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:46,794
But these people are innocent.

932
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,257
Taking their lives will gain you nothing.

933
01:25:58,764 --> 01:26:00,266
So take mine

934
01:26:01,016 --> 01:26:02,309
and end this.

935
01:26:16,365 --> 01:26:17,366
No.

936
01:26:33,465 --> 01:26:34,800
It's over.

937
01:26:35,134 --> 01:26:37,469
No. It's not over.

938
01:26:38,053 --> 01:26:40,014
I mean, you're safe.

939
01:26:40,306 --> 01:26:42,099
We're safe.

940
01:26:42,474 --> 01:26:43,809
It's over.

941
01:26:49,815 --> 01:26:51,066
No.

942
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:10,544
No.

943
01:27:36,403 --> 01:27:38,572
- We're spiking.
- Levels increase!

944
01:27:38,864 --> 01:27:40,532
Whosoever holds this hammer,

945
01:27:43,077 --> 01:27:44,078
if he be worthy,

946
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:49,249
shall possess the power of Thor.

947
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:06,141
Jane!

948
01:28:08,644 --> 01:28:11,689
- No. No. No!
- Come!

949
01:28:32,543 --> 01:28:36,130
Oh. My. God.

950
01:29:45,574 --> 01:29:46,950
So, is this how you normally look?

951
01:29:47,826 --> 01:29:48,827
More or less.

952
01:29:49,745 --> 01:29:51,413
It's a good look.

953
01:29:51,914 --> 01:29:55,000
We must go to the Bifrost site.
I would have words with my brother.

954
01:29:55,083 --> 01:29:56,168
Excuse me!

955
01:30:00,088 --> 01:30:01,423
Donald?

956
01:30:02,508 --> 01:30:04,027
I don't think
you've been completely honest with me.

957
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:05,260
Know this, Son of Coul.

958
01:30:05,511 --> 01:30:08,514
You and I, we fight for the same cause,
the protection of this world.

959
01:30:08,597 --> 01:30:10,641
From this day forward,
you can count me as your ally

960
01:30:10,724 --> 01:30:13,727
if you return the items
you have taken from Jane.

961
01:30:13,811 --> 01:30:15,479
- Stolen.
- Borrowed.

962
01:30:16,355 --> 01:30:18,482
Of course,
you can have your equipment back.

963
01:30:18,565 --> 01:30:20,734
You're gonna need it
to continue your research.

964
01:30:21,527 --> 01:30:23,821
Would you like to see
the bridge we spoke of?

965
01:30:24,988 --> 01:30:26,114
Sure.

966
01:30:27,783 --> 01:30:29,785
Wait, I need to debrief you!

967
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,210
Welcome to Asgard.

968
01:31:03,861 --> 01:31:06,029
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.

969
01:31:13,745 --> 01:31:15,038
Heimdall?

970
01:31:19,251 --> 01:31:20,586
Heimdall!

971
01:31:22,713 --> 01:31:24,131
He doesn't answer.

972
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,383
Then we are stranded.

973
01:31:26,466 --> 01:31:29,386
Heimdall!
If you can hear me, we need you now!

974
01:31:30,304 --> 01:31:33,056
Heimdall! We need you now!

975
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:40,772
Heimdall!

976
01:31:55,329 --> 01:31:58,457
I must go back to Asgard,
but I give you my word,

977
01:31:59,666 --> 01:32:02,002
I will return for you.

978
01:32:09,593 --> 01:32:10,802
Deal?

979
01:32:24,358 --> 01:32:25,692
Deal.

980
01:32:42,084 --> 01:32:44,211
Get him to the healing room!

981
01:32:45,629 --> 01:32:47,214
Leave my brother to me.

982
01:33:12,072 --> 01:33:13,573
It's said

983
01:33:13,907 --> 01:33:18,578
you can still hear and see
what transpires around you.

984
01:33:19,913 --> 01:33:22,082
I hope it's true,

985
01:33:23,917 --> 01:33:26,086
so that you may know

986
01:33:27,087 --> 01:33:31,049
your death came at the hand

987
01:33:31,925 --> 01:33:33,260
of Laufey.

988
01:33:42,352 --> 01:33:44,896
And your death came
by the son of Odin.

989
01:33:50,777 --> 01:33:52,154
Loki!

990
01:33:52,237 --> 01:33:53,739
You saved him!

991
01:33:58,201 --> 01:34:00,495
I swear to you, Mother,

992
01:34:00,579 --> 01:34:03,040
that they will pay for what
they've done today.

993
01:34:03,415 --> 01:34:04,458
Loki.

994
01:34:05,208 --> 01:34:06,293
Thor!

995
01:34:07,294 --> 01:34:09,212
I knew you'd return to us.

996
01:34:14,801 --> 01:34:16,261
Why don't you tell her

997
01:34:16,470 --> 01:34:19,973
how you sent the Destroyer
to kill our friends, to kill me?

998
01:34:20,057 --> 01:34:21,058
What?

999
01:34:21,141 --> 01:34:23,560
Why, it must have been enforcing
Father's last command.

1000
01:34:23,643 --> 01:34:26,521
You're a talented liar, Brother.
Always have been.

1001
01:34:27,147 --> 01:34:28,398
It's good to have you back.

1002
01:34:28,815 --> 01:34:32,402
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to destroy Jotunheim.

1003
01:35:13,985 --> 01:35:15,320
You can't stop it.

1004
01:35:15,403 --> 01:35:18,740
The Bifrost will build until
it rips Jotunheim apart.

1005
01:35:40,595 --> 01:35:41,763
Jane?

1006
01:35:43,723 --> 01:35:45,225
Why have you done this?

1007
01:35:45,475 --> 01:35:49,229
To prove to Father
that I am the worthy son.

1008
01:35:49,312 --> 01:35:52,149
When he wakes,
I will have saved his life.

1009
01:35:52,232 --> 01:35:54,943
I will have destroyed that
race of monsters.

1010
01:35:55,026 --> 01:35:57,154
And I will be true heir to the throne!

1011
01:35:57,529 --> 01:35:59,531
You can't kill an entire race!

1012
01:35:59,614 --> 01:36:00,949
Why not?

1013
01:36:03,743 --> 01:36:06,997
And what is this newfound love
for the Frost Giants?

1014
01:36:07,998 --> 01:36:11,418
You could have killed them all
with your bare hands.

1015
01:36:11,501 --> 01:36:13,587
- I've changed.
- So have I.

1016
01:36:15,338 --> 01:36:16,840
Now fight me.

1017
01:36:19,759 --> 01:36:21,678
I never wanted the throne!

1018
01:36:23,013 --> 01:36:24,848
I only ever wanted to be your equal.

1019
01:36:25,682 --> 01:36:27,684
I will not fight you, Brother!

1020
01:36:27,767 --> 01:36:29,186
I'm not your brother.

1021
01:36:29,936 --> 01:36:31,229
I never was.

1022
01:36:31,313 --> 01:36:32,814
Loki, this is madness.

1023
01:36:33,398 --> 01:36:35,025
Is it madness?

1024
01:36:35,859 --> 01:36:37,027
Is it?

1025
01:36:38,445 --> 01:36:39,696
Is it?

1026
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:44,784
Come on. What happened to you
on Earth that turned you so soft?

1027
01:36:45,577 --> 01:36:48,288
Don't tell me it was that woman.

1028
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:51,499
It was!

1029
01:36:51,583 --> 01:36:55,712
Well, maybe, when we're finished here,
I'll pay her a visit myself!

1030
01:37:38,046 --> 01:37:39,965
Thor!

1031
01:37:46,721 --> 01:37:48,223
Brother, please.

1032
01:37:59,734 --> 01:38:00,902
Enough!

1033
01:38:44,696 --> 01:38:45,864
Look at you,

1034
01:38:48,533 --> 01:38:49,868
the Mighty Thor,

1035
01:38:52,954 --> 01:38:55,123
with all your strength,

1036
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:58,460
and what good does it do you now?

1037
01:38:59,794 --> 01:39:03,590
Do you hear me, Brother?
There's nothing you can do!

1038
01:39:21,566 --> 01:39:22,859
What are you doing?

1039
01:39:24,569 --> 01:39:27,947
If you destroy the bridge,
you'll never see her again!

1040
01:39:37,582 --> 01:39:39,250
Forgive me, Jane.

1041
01:40:17,747 --> 01:40:19,749
I could have done it, Father!

1042
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:22,585
I could have done it!

1043
01:40:23,002 --> 01:40:24,337
For you!

1044
01:40:25,046 --> 01:40:26,548
For all of us!

1045
01:40:28,716 --> 01:40:30,051
No, Loki.

1046
01:40:38,810 --> 01:40:39,811
Loki, no.

1047
01:40:41,062 --> 01:40:43,231
No!

1048
01:40:47,485 --> 01:40:48,653
No.

1049
01:41:05,003 --> 01:41:06,337
It's gone.

1050
01:42:18,868 --> 01:42:21,704
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1051
01:42:21,955 --> 01:42:26,042
I flew into the giant metal creature
and laid him low!

1052
01:42:26,209 --> 01:42:29,796
Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?

1053
01:42:29,879 --> 01:42:35,885
As a matter of fact, falling was a tactic
lulling the Destroyer...

1054
01:42:50,066 --> 01:42:52,902
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1055
01:42:58,741 --> 01:43:00,076
How is he?

1056
01:43:02,412 --> 01:43:04,414
He mourns for his brother.

1057
01:43:05,748 --> 01:43:06,916
And...

1058
01:43:08,084 --> 01:43:09,669
He misses her.

1059
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:12,005
The mortal.

1060
01:43:28,438 --> 01:43:30,189
You'll be a wise king.

1061
01:43:34,611 --> 01:43:37,030
There will never be
a wiser king than you.

1062
01:43:38,448 --> 01:43:40,116
Or a better father.

1063
01:43:51,002 --> 01:43:54,172
I have much to learn.

1064
01:43:56,174 --> 01:43:57,675
I know that now.

1065
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:04,641
Someday, perhaps,

1066
01:44:05,933 --> 01:44:07,852
I shall make you proud.

1067
01:44:15,485 --> 01:44:17,695
You've already made me proud.

1068
01:44:32,251 --> 01:44:34,253
So Earth is lost to us.

1069
01:44:35,588 --> 01:44:36,589
No.

1070
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:39,592
There is always hope.

1071
01:44:43,596 --> 01:44:45,098
Can you see her?

1072
01:44:48,017 --> 01:44:49,352
Yes.

1073
01:44:53,022 --> 01:44:54,941
I have the particle detectors!

1074
01:44:55,024 --> 01:44:57,110
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite codes?

1075
01:44:57,193 --> 01:44:59,278
Yeah. Have you seen my taser?

1076
01:44:59,362 --> 01:45:00,780
How is she?

1077
01:45:00,863 --> 01:45:02,949
In the car. Come on, Jane!

1078
01:45:03,282 --> 01:45:05,368
She searches for you.

1079
01:53:14,940 --> 01:53:16,859
Dr Selvig.

1080
01:53:19,695 --> 01:53:21,864
So you're the man behind all this?

1081
01:53:24,033 --> 01:53:26,035
It's quite a labyrinth.

1082
01:53:26,785 --> 01:53:30,706
I was thinking
they're taking me down here to kill me.

1083
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:40,883
I've been hearing
about the New Mexico situation.

1084
01:53:41,717 --> 01:53:45,387
Your work has impressed a lot of people
who are much smarter than I am.

1085
01:53:45,471 --> 01:53:47,473
I have a lot to work with.

1086
01:53:48,057 --> 01:53:51,352
The Foster Theory.
A gateway to another dimension.

1087
01:53:52,019 --> 01:53:53,020
It's unprecedented.

1088
01:53:55,731 --> 01:53:56,982
Isn't it?

1089
01:54:00,402 --> 01:54:03,739
Legend tells us one thing,
history, another.

1090
01:54:04,073 --> 01:54:08,285
But every now and then,
we find something that belongs to both.

1091
01:54:16,085 --> 01:54:17,086
What is it?

1092
01:54:17,169 --> 01:54:18,295
Power, Doctor.

1093
01:54:18,837 --> 01:54:20,839
If we can figure out how to tap it,

1094
01:54:21,257 --> 01:54:22,758
maybe unlimited power.

1095
01:54:28,514 --> 01:54:34,770
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
