1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,335
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:04,105
This is a plan to
level all of Star City.

3
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:05,816
Felicity wouldn't do
something like this.

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,325
Maybe she had a change of heart,

5
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:08,703
tried to back out last second.

6
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:10,787
It'd explain why someone
would want her dead, right?

7
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,790
Last call out was to someone named...

8
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:14,648
- Blackstar.
- What's this?

9
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:16,672
Something I lifted off Byrd
before he went into custody.

10
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:17,517
It's a painting?

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,229
Looks like someone doesn't
want us to see this.

12
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:22,056
Ricardo Diaz is behind bars tonight,

13
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:24,356
thanks to the unidentified Green Arrow.

14
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,809
Felicity put a gun right to my face.

15
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:28,106
I don't believe you.

16
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:29,874
I made a deal with the feds.

17
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:31,523
Oliver will be a free man again.

18
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:21,392
After keeping a low profile

19
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:23,927
since his release last
week, Oliver Queen will make

20
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,051
his first public appearance tonight

21
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:28,900
at a gala supporting prison reform.

22
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:31,936
But will Star City welcome
back its former vigilante

23
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:33,429
with open arms?

24
00:01:33,432 --> 00:01:36,407
Or has public opinion soured
against the Green Arrow

25
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:39,243
now that we know who's under that hood?

26

27
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,005
Aah!

28
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:11,084
Hey. It's just me.

29
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:15,680
Hey. I'm sorry about earlier.

30
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:17,215
I didn't mean to freak you out.

31
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:18,981
No. I'm just, um, getting used

32
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:20,118
to being home.

33
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:24,622
Mm. I missed that.

34
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,398
Having someone to zip your dress?

35
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:29,302
Well, that, and you.

36
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,032
And I really miss William.

37
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:36,114
Yeah. Christmas vacation feels like

38
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:37,869
it's 20 years from now.

39
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:42,306
So why aren't you dressed?

40
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:44,075
I'm gonna sit this one out.

41
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:47,311
Oh, no, no, no.

42
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:48,913
I don't think that's how this works,

43
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:51,049
especially when you're
the one being honored.

44
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:53,801
Besides, you've been spending more time

45
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:54,903
in the shadows recently

46
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:56,356
than when you were the Green Arrow.

47
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,656
The last time I faced
the city, I was in cuffs.

48
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:00,622
A lot of people are mad at me, Felicity.

49
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,054
I lied to them.

50
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,475
They have a right to be mad at me.

51
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:05,207
Which is exactly why this event is

52
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,997
so important.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,169
They want to publicly
recognize you as a hero.

54
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,337
And after all the lives
you saved at Slabside,

55
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:16,340
let them see you for who you really are,

56
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:19,790
without a mask.

57
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:21,793
I mean, you're probably right.

58
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:23,848
Oh, I'm always right.

59
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,758
You will always be the best part of me

60
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:36,494
for the rest of my life.

61
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:37,762
You remember.

62
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:39,764
Of course I remember.

63
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:41,203
Happy anniversary.

64
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:42,773
Happy anniversary.

65
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:02,854
This used to be the nicest club in town

66
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:04,355
20 years ago.

67
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:06,290
You can practically smell the money.

68
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:09,160
Yeah. Definitely not smelling that.

69
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:12,109
I can't believe Roy's
missing out on all the fun.

70
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:14,564
If he got recognized here,
we'd have big trouble.

71
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:17,201
And you're sure Blackstar's here?

72
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:19,312
The Canary network couldn't find much,

73
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:21,972
but they did learn Blackstar
likes to frequent this club.

74
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:24,984
I seriously question this
person's choice of friends.

75
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:26,945
That's why we need to
keep our heads down.

76
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:28,728
Blackstar was the last
one to talk to Felicity.

77
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,669
Whoever this is could have
either been helping her or...

78
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,383
Or they're the one who killed her.

79
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:36,156
And you were worried this
was going to be dangerous.

80
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,622
Hey, we're looking for
someone named Blackstar.

81
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,624
You know who that is?

82
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:41,526
Yeah. She's right there.

83
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:43,327
Uh!

84
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:36,640
Blackstar! Blackstar!
Blackstar! Blackstar!

85
00:05:36,643 --> 00:05:40,779
Blackstar! Blackstar!
Blackstar! Blackstar!

86
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:42,984
Blackstar! Blackstar...

87
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:45,221
Well, she seems easy to talk to.

88
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,829
We didn't get this treatment after we

89
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:53,931
put Diaz behind bars.

90
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:56,304
Envy is not a good look on you.

91
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,840
Neither is the crab cake

92
00:05:57,843 --> 00:05:59,509
on your face.

93
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:03,875
This event is messed up.

94
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:06,093
Rich folk and politicians fronting

95
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:08,343
like they actually care
about prison reform.

96
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:10,609
If everybody in here
actually gave a crap,

97
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:12,429
they'd use that money to help people

98
00:06:12,432 --> 00:06:14,352
in hard-up neighborhoods
who end up in the system

99
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:16,254
because they don't have anything else.

100
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,122
What?

101
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:20,558
You ever think about running for office?

102
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:25,062
Oliver, what's it like
to be out of prison?

103
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:26,262
How does it feel to be back home

104
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:27,954
with everyone knowing
you're the Green Arrow?

105
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:29,594
Are you gonna put on the
hood now that you're back?

106
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:32,230
My husband is very grateful

107
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,667
to be home with his family. Thank you.

108
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:44,415
Excuse me. Queen!

109
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,640
Max Fuller.

110
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:47,625
Hey, man, I know we've
had some bad history.

111
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:49,054
You, uh, had your bodyguards

112
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:50,960
kick the crap out of me
and Tommy at your club.

113
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:52,555
Right. Well, you slept with my wife.

114
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:53,976
Well, now my ex-wife.

115
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,062
Dude, all that is in the past, okay?

116
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:58,043
You're the freaking Green Arrow.

117
00:06:58,046 --> 00:06:59,085
Well, I'm Felicity.

118
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:01,959
I am the wife of the
freaking Green Arrow.

119
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:03,982
That sounded a little
less strange in my head.

120
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:05,265
Impressed.

121
00:07:05,268 --> 00:07:07,102
You see, he didn't used
to be the marriage type.

122
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:08,218
- Ah. Hmm.
- Yeah.

123
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:09,632
But, hey, people change, right?

124
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:11,054
Yes, they do.

125
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:13,051
And we are just gonna
say hi to some friends

126
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:14,148
if you'll excuse us.

127
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:16,018
Yeah, please.

128
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:17,585
Is it just me,

129
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:19,679
or is that guy the absolute worst?

130
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:22,483
Uh...

131
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:23,968
I never got to ask you.

132
00:07:23,971 --> 00:07:26,323
What was your first
meal when you got back?

133
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:28,426
Double Double at Big Belly Burger.

134
00:07:28,428 --> 00:07:30,261
That's what I'm talking about.

135
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:34,331
Taking a while to get
those sea legs back, huh?

136
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:35,703
Speaking of,

137
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,180
you thinking about
getting back out there,

138
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:38,617
trying that old suit on for size?

139
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,769
Shh, shh. No, no, no.

140
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:40,679
He's absolutely not

141
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:42,656
just like we don't do that anymore.

142
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,259
Dinah's right.

143
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:46,428
I'm very much enjoying
not being in prison.

144
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,578
So what now?

145
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:49,214
I don't know.

146
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:50,910
Find a different way to help the city,

147
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:52,479
way you guys did.

148
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:53,851
What about you, Felicity?

149
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:55,754
Well, I'm developing
a new security system.

150
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:58,591
Well, then I'm sure it's
the best one in town.

151
00:07:58,594 --> 00:07:59,906
We're friends with her now?

152
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,375
It's more like frenemies.

153
00:08:01,378 --> 00:08:02,482
It's a long story.

154
00:08:02,485 --> 00:08:05,906
Relax. I'm just here
keeping up appearances.

155
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:06,945
D.A., remember?

156
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:08,984
Actually, we should all
really be thanking Laurel.

157
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:10,700
I mean, she is the one who did the trade

158
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:11,926
to get Oliver out of prison.

159
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:13,218
That's true.

160
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:15,054
I'm very grateful.

161
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:17,265
I know that I haven't always given you

162
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:19,542
the benefit of the doubt, so...

163
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:21,460
Well, it was really Felicity

164
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:24,297
who was willing to do
anything to stop Diaz.

165
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,070
She's ruthless.

166
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:28,539
Welcome.

167
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,375
Thank you all for
attending this evening.

168
00:08:30,378 --> 00:08:33,273
I would like to introduce
this evening's honoree,

169
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,276
Mr. Oliver Queen.

170
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:44,307
Thank you, Mayor Pollard.

171
00:08:46,046 --> 00:08:49,023
I used to believe that justice was

172
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:54,396
as simple as putting
criminals behind bars...

173
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,467
but then I spent some time in prison,

174
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,604
and I realized that the truth is

175
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,445
nowhere near that black and white.

176
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,226
The truth is that our institutions have

177
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:05,445
a long way to go

178
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,218
before they achieve true justice.

179
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:26,318
The attack perpetrated by
the Green Arrow this evening

180
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:28,094
is further proof why we, as a city,

181
00:09:28,097 --> 00:09:30,813
cannot trust men that hide behind masks.

182
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:33,992
There is a reason why the
anti-vigilante law exists.

183
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:35,526
Thank you.

184
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:37,428
Look, I know how this looks,

185
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,430
but this wasn't the new Green Arrow.

186
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:40,969
He hasn't murdered anyone.

187
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:42,071
That you know of.

188
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:44,251
Has anyone actually seen
who's behind the mask?

189
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:46,865
Well, no. But whoever it is
has been helping the city.

190
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:48,439
And helped us take down Diaz.

191
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,575
This was cold-blooded murder.

192
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:52,944
Now, I appreciate how
all of you feel as though

193
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:54,704
the new Green Arrow is an ally,

194
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:56,408
but I would like to be sure.

195
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:57,677
And how are you gonna do that

196
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,450
if you're a no-go on the Arrow?

197
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:01,008
Is there a law against me consulting?

198
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:02,647
You mean an investigative
consultant, like "The Mentalist"?

199
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:03,680
I love that show.

200
00:10:03,683 --> 00:10:05,493
I can't think of a
better way to investigate

201
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:07,591
a copycat Green Arrow
than with the original.

202
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:09,227
I can. With my help,

203
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:10,907
because I'm not sitting this one out.

204
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,283
I appreciate it, but there's
nothing left to be done tonight,

205
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:14,501
so go home.

206
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:15,904
Let my guys work the scene.

207
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,274
And if I need help,
I'll call you tomorrow.

208
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:25,841
This is everything Dinah's
compiled on the vigilante...

209
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:27,865
Every sighting, targets.

210
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:29,107
It's all there.

211
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,281
It says here the SCPD

212
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:31,616
nearly arrested him last month.

213
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:32,829
But he had an accomplice?

214
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,157
Uh, yeah, that... That was me.

215
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,821
I, uh,

216
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:38,956
I didn't want Dinah to lock him up.

217
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,658
Oh, I bet she really appreciated that.

218
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,021
She threw my ass in jail.

219
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:43,494
I'm really sad I missed that.

220
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:45,071
What else do we know?

221
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:47,033
Uh, he's definitely not
a rookie. I know that.

222
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:50,210
I mean, the guy's efficient,
disciplined, precise.

223
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:51,646
I mean, he works the bow and arrow

224
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,104
about as well as you do.

225
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:56,040
That takes a very
specific type of training.

226
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:00,716
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

227
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,113
Pollard's on the warpath.

228
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:04,782
That's okay. Forensics pull
anything from the scene?

229
00:11:04,784 --> 00:11:06,423
Well, nothing we didn't already suspect.

230
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:08,852
Arrows are consistent
with the vigilante's.

231
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:10,088
Here. Take a look.

232
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,823
Thank you.

233
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,727
Well, they're both handmade.

234
00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:18,712
The materials in the
arrowhead seem to match.

235
00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:20,215
This would be difficult to replicate.

236
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:22,518
But not impossible, right?

237
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:24,168
The security camera footage?

238
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,537
Yeah, but you're not gonna find much.

239
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:28,373
The killer was off-camera.

240
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,868
His arrows weren't.

241
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,671
If this guy is as precise
with a bow and arrow

242
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:34,157
as Rene says, then he
would've had a target.

243
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,760
Based on the trajectory, that guy.

244
00:11:38,818 --> 00:11:41,352
Oh, wait a minute. That's...
That's Clayton Ford.

245
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:43,554
He's a rich dude who
actually helped the Glades.

246
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:44,789
He funded a clinic.

247
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:45,883
This makes no sense.

248
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:47,701
The vigilante's only targeted people

249
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:48,926
who've hurt the Glades.

250
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:50,128
Ford helped it.

251
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,196
Then what the hell's the motive?

252
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:53,431
Sure would help

253
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:55,037
if we could ask directly.

254
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:57,841
Wait. Hang on.

255
00:11:57,844 --> 00:11:59,337
You're... you're in contact?

256
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,891
That was one time, all right?

257
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:03,248
And count me out if we're
gonna roll up and arrest him.

258
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:04,683
I'm not talking about the SCPD.

259
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:07,844
Just us. We just need to
talk to the new Green Arrow.

260
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:10,281
You think he's innocent.
So we'll be fine.

261
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:12,204
And what if we aren't?

262
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:14,117
Then we deal with him.

263
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,654
You should make the call.

264
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:22,460
Hey.

265
00:12:22,462 --> 00:12:24,061
Got to say, I never appreciated

266
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:25,630
how tightly you run this ship

267
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:26,664
until you were gone with the brass.

268
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,915
It is so good to see you
behind that desk again, Lyla.

269
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,918
Flatterer.

270
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:33,155
Shut the door.

271
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:37,542
What's going on?

272
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:39,877
I had my contact look into the image

273
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,847
that Curtis decrypted
from the Malcolm Byrd op.

274
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:44,024
The "Dante" painting.

275
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:45,383
It's being used as some sort of

276
00:12:45,386 --> 00:12:47,584
highly advanced identification protocol

277
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:49,220
within terrorist circles.

278
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:50,888
Kobra, Basilisk,

279
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,352
the Third World Liberation Army...

280
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,657
They're all using the name
Dante like it's a contact.

281
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,793
For what? Or for who?

282
00:12:56,796 --> 00:13:00,571
I don't know, but I might
know how to find out.

283
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:02,567
When I cross-referenced
the terrorist groups

284
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,968
with the financials that
we obtained in Geneva,

285
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:06,604
I found a common account.

286
00:13:06,606 --> 00:13:08,040
- Could you trace it?
- No.

287
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:10,377
Come here. Look at this.

288
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,927
Five transactions in the past 7 months

289
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,610
between Dante and a consulting firm

290
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:17,657
called Rubrum, Silentium, and Ursa.

291
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,984
That's Latin for "red,"
"silent," and "bear,"

292
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,743
the Longbow Hunters.

293
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:24,179
Look.

294
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:32,129
You got to be kidding me.

295
00:13:38,805 --> 00:13:40,638
This is definitely the place.

296
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,306
Then where is he?

297
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:44,308
Maybe he got held up.

298
00:13:46,547 --> 00:13:47,818
Rene, stop.

299
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:49,054
What are you talking about?

300
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:50,490
There are motion detectors.

301
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:52,092
We've been made.

302
00:13:57,824 --> 00:13:59,724
I said, come alone.

303
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:01,446
These are my friends.

304
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,727
You already met Captain Drake.

305
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,963
You can trust them.

306
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:07,274
We only want to talk.

307
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:08,540
I'll pass.

308
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:10,274
A piece of advice

309
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:12,644
from one Green Arrow to another:

310
00:14:12,647 --> 00:14:14,237
cooperate.

311
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,907
Because right now,

312
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,741
most of the people in this city think

313
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:19,477
you're a killer.

314
00:14:21,147 --> 00:14:22,980
Are you?

315
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,418
- Cut him off!
- On it.

316
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:01,893
Mr. Queen. Mr. Queen. Mr. Queen.

317
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:03,449
Do you know who the new Green Arrow is?

318
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:04,848
Are you helping with this investigation?

319
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,057
I have no comment, guys.

320
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,808
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell is this?

321
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,420
You all know the precinct is off-limits.

322
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:11,090
Captain Drake, care to comment?

323
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:14,413
The SCPD does not comment
on ongoing investigations.

324
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,744
But I do. The vigilante didn't do it.

325
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:19,498
Okay. Can somebody please
get these guys out of here?

326
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,276
Not helping.

327
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,866
Hey. Why does the mayor
have to have all the fun?

328
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:25,211
Maybe meeting at the precinct

329
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:26,472
wasn't the best idea.

330
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:27,651
Yeah. Well, I thought the jig was up

331
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:29,109
after you were spotted last night.

332
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:30,429
Oh, and speaking of last night,

333
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:32,511
turns out we were right
about your Green Arrow clone.

334
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:33,712
He is innocent.

335
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:34,642
How do we know?

336
00:15:34,645 --> 00:15:36,810
Remember our second suspected
target, Clayton Ford?

337
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:37,808
- Mm-hmm.
- My guys found him dead

338
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,094
across town at the same time
we were chasing the vigilante.

339
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:42,187
- We're his alibi.
- OK.

340
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:43,722
What do we know about the Ford murder?

341
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:45,499
Emerald arrow, center... chest,

342
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:46,643
same as Hutchinson.

343
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,522
Someone's going through a lot of trouble

344
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,322
to pin this on the new Green Arrow.

345
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,346
We really need to come up
with a better name for him.

346
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:56,830
He's making everyone,
including Pollard, look away.

347
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,166
The question is from what?

348
00:15:58,169 --> 00:15:59,525
Well, Ford may have known.

349
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:01,906
He was trying to skip
town when he was killed.

350
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:03,943
He found him with bags
packed and ready to go,

351
00:16:03,945 --> 00:16:05,210
clothes and cash.

352
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:06,612
Yeah, he knew he was the target.

353
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:08,382
What the hell is going on?

354
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,816
Last time I checked,
Mr. Queen and Mr. Ramirez

355
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,507
were not employed by the SCPD.

356
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,019
Well, they're just
here giving statements.

357
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:16,655
That the vigilante didn't
do it. Yeah, I heard.

358
00:16:16,658 --> 00:16:18,143
You know, it's no big surprise

359
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:19,947
that the old Green Arrow would
be supporting the new one,

360
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:22,585
but I expected more
from my police captain.

361
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:25,431
You telling me how to conduct
my investigation, Ms. Mayor?

362
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,527
Because last I checked,

363
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,268
I was still in control of this precinct.

364
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:31,057
I hired you to restore the
city's faith in this department.

365
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,160
That means bringing that
vigilante to justice.

366
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:34,448
And if you can't do that,

367
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,229
I will find someone else who can.

368
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,073
She may be the tiniest,

369
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:41,379
most unpleasant person I've ever met.

370
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:44,050
You have to listen to her, but I don't.

371
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:45,215
What are you thinking?

372
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:46,617
It says here both victims were

373
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,190
members of the same society at Yale.

374
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:52,112
I know a guy. Max Fuller,
he was a member, too.

375
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:56,047
I could go see him, gather some intel.

376
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,097
I'll be in touch if I
learn anything, all right?

377
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:09,741
Excuse me, Ms., uh, Blackstar?

378
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:11,377
Can we talk to you?

379
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:12,971
I'm kind of busy.

380
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:14,346
Clearly.

381
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:15,664
We only need 5 minutes.

382
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,983
Not interested.

383
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,056
Like I said,

384
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:25,891
I'd love to talk.

385
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:29,561
So this whole fight club thing,

386
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:32,398
you just beat people up for what? Fun?

387
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,233
Stress relief.

388
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:37,403
Do you really want to
spend your 5 minutes

389
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:38,807
talking about my hobbies?

390
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,468
How do you know Felicity Smoak?

391
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:41,874
I don't.

392
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:43,688
Well, that's strange, because you were

393
00:17:43,691 --> 00:17:45,743
the last person she called
before she was killed.

394
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:47,636
Felicity's dead?

395
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:49,248
Oh, so you do know her.

396
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,717
We worked together sometimes.

397
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:53,018
What kind of work was that?

398
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,406
The kind that's none of your business.

399
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,488
So, illegal.

400
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,140
Well, you're one to talk, Canary.

401
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:02,557
You're not as smart
as you think you are.

402
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,896
But you want to come
in here and judge me?

403
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:07,081
At least I'm not lying to everyone,

404
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:09,245
pretending to be some kind of hero.

405
00:18:09,248 --> 00:18:11,602
At least I'm not a vigilante.

406
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:14,139
You don't know what
you're talking about, kid.

407
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:16,461
You know, you're part of
the reason Star City is

408
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:17,876
in the shape it's in right now.

409
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:19,473
Really? 'Cause I could've sworn,

410
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:21,308
the story goes, it's because of you.

411
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,249
Hey, just tell us why
Felicity called you.

412
00:18:24,251 --> 00:18:26,051
Then we'll leave you alone.

413
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:32,424
I work as a broker.

414
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:35,269
I help people find certain items.

415
00:18:35,272 --> 00:18:36,636
Felicity asked me to find her

416
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:37,838
an electrical firing circuit

417
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:39,254
and a couple transmitters.

418
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:41,099
Those are mechanisms
for triggering a bomb.

419
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:42,481
I don't know why she needed 'em.

420
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:44,449
I didn't ask.

421
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:47,220
As long as I get paid, you
can ask for whatever you want.

422
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:49,006
Sounds like you two had a lot in common.

423
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:51,276
If that's it, I have
my next fight coming up,

424
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:52,785
and I really should stretch.

425
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:55,022
Yeah. I'm done here anyway.

426
00:18:57,785 --> 00:18:59,351
Word of advice.

427
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:01,980
Asking questions about Felicity Smoak

428
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:05,386
will not end well for anyone.

429
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,300
Five fully-stocked bars,

430
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:16,635
3 private lounges,

431
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:18,824
and the sound system is the best...

432
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:20,011
outside of Europe.

433
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:21,816
A.I. adjusts the acoustic environment

434
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:23,136
based on capacity.

435
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:25,139
Right this way here.

436
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:28,012
That's a ton of security
you got down there, Max.

437
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:29,902
It must be costing you a fortune.

438
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:32,451
Heh! Not when you pay for them
with crypto you mine yourself.

439
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:34,219
All it costs me is the little USB drive

440
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:36,388
I put it on. Scotch?

441
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,657
It's a 25-year.

442
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:40,225
Why not?

443
00:19:40,227 --> 00:19:42,379
We can toast your new club.

444
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:46,117
Hey. Toast to your new prison-
and Green Arrow-free life.

445
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:51,269
It's really got to piss
you off, though, huh?

446
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:53,816
Seeing some lame copycat screw up

447
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,457
everything you sacrificed for.

448
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,043
I wanted to speak with you about that.

449
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:59,675
The last two murders weren't
connected to the vigilante.

450
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,566
So the rumors are true.

451
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,585
You are helping the
cops investigate this.

452
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:09,188
How can I help?

453
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,157
You were a member of the Scroll and Key

454
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,424
back at Yale.

455
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:13,668
Allegedly.

456
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,105
It is a secret society.

457
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:17,402
Fair point.

458
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:19,152
How well did you know Clayton Ford

459
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:20,355
and Sam Hutchinson?

460
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:22,066
Clay and Hutch.

461
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:23,869
Well enough to mourn them.

462
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:24,886
Mm-hmm.

463
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:27,205
But we'd sort of fallen out of touch.

464
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,832
Ford looked like he
was trying to skip town

465
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:30,996
before he died,

466
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,465
like he knew the hit was coming,

467
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:34,488
but we just... we don't know how.

468
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:36,157
You're looking for skeletons.

469
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,675
And are we gonna find any?

470
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:39,824
I know you're not supposed
to talk ill of the dead

471
00:20:39,827 --> 00:20:42,746
or whatever, but, you know,
there were always rumors

472
00:20:42,749 --> 00:20:44,605
that they had shady
business dealings going on

473
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:47,892
with the Triad, I believe.

474
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:51,296
So who knows? Maybe they
got in over their heads.

475
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:53,165
Probably.

476
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,400
I won't take up any more of your time.

477
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:59,264
Thank you, Max.

478
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:01,267
Mm-hmm.

479
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,337
You mind if I ask you a question?

480
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,908
They sent you to prison
for helping this city.

481
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:11,035
Why the hell should you
care about any of this?

482
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:12,704
Old habits.

483
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:17,210
I guess some people don't
change that much after all.

484
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:24,785
Hey.

485
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:25,997
Hey.

486
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,589
Sorry I'm late.

487
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:29,207
That's okay.

488
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,045
I'm still getting used
to you coming home at all.

489
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:34,315
How did things go with Fuller?

490
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:36,449
Max Fuller is hiding something.

491
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:37,985
Do you mind looking into it?

492
00:21:37,988 --> 00:21:40,155
Of course.

493
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:43,996
Hey, you just came in the front door,

494
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:46,217
and none of my security
measures triggered.

495
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,486
You sure?

496
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:54,726
Felicity!

497
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:30,195
Who are you?

498
00:22:30,197 --> 00:22:33,632
My husband asked you a question.

499
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:34,866
Where'd you get that?

500
00:22:34,868 --> 00:22:37,035
We'll talk about it later.

501
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:38,261
Stay down!

502
00:22:38,264 --> 00:22:39,797
Hey, hey.

503
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,052
All right. As soon as
the doc gives the okay,

504
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:52,630
we'll take him into the
station for questioning.

505
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:55,809
In the meantime, we'll go through
his effects, see what we can find out.

506
00:22:55,812 --> 00:22:57,143
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

507
00:22:57,146 --> 00:22:58,942
Oh, hey, and just a bit of advice.

508
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,004
Yeah.

509
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:02,887
You probably shouldn't be shooting
people your first week out of prison.

510
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,857
- That's a good tip.
- Yeah.

511
00:23:07,507 --> 00:23:09,520
He must've somehow countered my alarm

512
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:12,391
- by sonically hacking into the sensors.
- Felicity.

513
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:14,365
That is a design flaw that
could take weeks to fix.

514
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:16,661
- We need to talk about this.
- No. We need to be safe.

515
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:18,484
This security system was
supposed to bring peace of mind.

516
00:23:18,486 --> 00:23:20,085
- You mean like owning a gun?
- Yeah.

517
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:22,655
Where'd you even get a gun?

518
00:23:22,657 --> 00:23:24,490
Your best new friend Laurel?

519
00:23:24,492 --> 00:23:26,258
Of course not.

520
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,384
I got it from your
ex-best friend, Anatoly.

521
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:30,751
You what?

522
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:32,665
I've barely been gone 7 months,

523
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,028
and you've aligned yourself

524
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:36,228
with two of the most
immoral people we know?

525
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:37,970
Oliver, you don't get to judge me.

526
00:23:37,972 --> 00:23:39,405
You just shot a man in our living room.

527
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:41,439
Something you've done a million times.

528
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:43,134
Hey, this isn't you.

529
00:23:43,137 --> 00:23:46,470
You don't obsess over security.

530
00:23:46,473 --> 00:23:47,913
You certainly don't carry a gun.

531
00:23:47,915 --> 00:23:49,278
This is me, Oliver,

532
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:51,474
not because I was influenced
by Laurel or Anatoly.

533
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:53,134
This is me because of you.

534
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:54,747
You were the one that decided

535
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,072
all on your own that you were
going to sacrifice yourself,

536
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:59,191
leaving your son and your wife

537
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:01,560
alone at home as sitting ducks for Diaz.

538
00:24:01,562 --> 00:24:03,462
And the best part about
the whole thing is that

539
00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:05,164
you didn't even ask us
about how we felt about it.

540
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,076
I've already apologized for this.

541
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,580
I don't know how many times
you need me to apologize.

542
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,142
What am I supposed to do
with an apology, Oliver?

543
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:14,106
I'm just supposed to move on?

544
00:24:14,108 --> 00:24:16,408
While you were gone,

545
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,697
I had to figure out how to survive.

546
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,367
And I am glad that I did

547
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,504
because the old me, she was weak.

548
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:26,608
How could you possibly think that?

549
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,391
The old you was the
person I fell in love with.

550
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:34,093
Well...

551
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,896
she's gone.

552
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,300
And she's not coming back.

553
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,725
I thought you didn't drink.

554
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:08,861
Yeah, well, it's been a tough week.

555
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,395
I know the feeling.

556
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:14,028
You know, Roy told me

557
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:15,700
this would only bring me pain,

558
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:17,870
and he was right.

559
00:25:19,974 --> 00:25:22,341
I'm going home.

560
00:25:22,343 --> 00:25:26,064
Just like that, huh,
without any answers?

561
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,325
Felicity is dead.

562
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:29,759
And before that, she had a
plan to blow up an entire city.

563
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:32,012
So I'm not sure exactly
why I'm supposed to care

564
00:25:32,015 --> 00:25:33,819
about what happened to her.

565
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:36,555
I'm just sorry I dragged
you all into this.

566
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,226
You need to see something.

567
00:25:44,198 --> 00:25:46,532
It's called the mark of four.

568
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:48,267
Your dad came up with it.

569
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:50,106
I don't remember that.

570
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:51,300
You were already gone.

571
00:25:51,303 --> 00:25:54,411
It was right before everything.

572
00:25:56,442 --> 00:26:00,611
It symbolizes the 4
pillars of heroism...

573
00:26:00,614 --> 00:26:07,452
Courage, compassion,
selflessness, and loyalty.

574
00:26:07,454 --> 00:26:09,822
We all got them as a reminder that

575
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:12,825
no matter what happened,
if one of us was in trouble,

576
00:26:12,827 --> 00:26:16,061
the other ones would be there.

577
00:26:16,063 --> 00:26:18,837
That's why Roy came with
you back to Star City.

578
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,386
He saw the symbol written on
the inside of your father's bow.

579
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:24,689
So that's why you're helping us?

580
00:26:24,692 --> 00:26:27,208
I didn't know what to
make of you at first.

581
00:26:28,709 --> 00:26:31,977
Trust doesn't come so easily to me.

582
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:34,446
Yeah? So what changed?

583
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:39,997
I started seeing the best
parts of your dad in you...

584
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,188
The strength that made him a hero.

585
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:46,793
I am not that.

586
00:26:46,796 --> 00:26:48,894
You sure about that?

587
00:26:48,896 --> 00:26:54,583
'Cause your dad, he had this
way of looking into things,

588
00:26:54,586 --> 00:26:57,068
of seeing beyond the evidence.

589
00:26:57,071 --> 00:27:00,806
So what does your gut
tell you about Blackstar?

590
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:07,079
That she isn't telling
us the whole story.

591
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:11,884
Good. Let's find out what she's hiding.

592
00:27:14,588 --> 00:27:16,555
Hey, hey. Who's hungry?

593
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:18,807
Ohh. You're a life saver.

594
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,158
It's not often I get to buy
the police captain dinner.

595
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:22,416
Yeah?

596
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:24,293
Well, you'd better get your fill in now

597
00:27:24,296 --> 00:27:26,430
because I probably won't
have this job much longer.

598
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:29,601
Why? You don't think this
will blow over with Pollard?

599
00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:31,670
Well...

600
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:33,538
I don't know.

601
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,174
You know, maybe it shouldn't.

602
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:37,876
How can I really be effective here

603
00:27:37,878 --> 00:27:40,245
if she's just gonna
undercut me the whole way?

604
00:27:40,247 --> 00:27:42,347
I'd be better off as Black Canary.

605
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:44,049
Whew. You don't know how long

606
00:27:44,051 --> 00:27:45,884
I've been waiting for you to say that.

607
00:27:45,886 --> 00:27:49,454
But you're the best damn
person for this job, D.

608
00:27:49,456 --> 00:27:51,790
This city needs you here.

609
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,689
Hey. How's it going with the hit man?

610
00:27:55,692 --> 00:27:57,457
Good. He's still recovering,

611
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,761
but we got an ID thanks to A.R.G.U.S.

612
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,986
Frank Cassaday, otherwise
known as "the Mirror."

613
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:06,423
Specializes in kills via mimicked m.o.

614
00:28:06,426 --> 00:28:07,859
Proof the vigilante didn't do it,

615
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:09,473
but who ordered the hits?

616
00:28:09,476 --> 00:28:10,892
Where'd you find that?

617
00:28:10,895 --> 00:28:12,955
I found that on Cassaday.
Why? You recognize that?

618
00:28:14,263 --> 00:28:17,014
Fuller. He used those to
pay his muscle in the club.

619
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:18,283
This was Fuller.

620
00:28:18,285 --> 00:28:19,939
He ordered the hit on Hutchinson

621
00:28:19,942 --> 00:28:21,242
and then Ford and then me

622
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:22,400
once I got too close.

623
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:24,432
Why? I mean, he's a rich douche bag,

624
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:26,033
but I didn't peg him to be a killer.

625
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:27,463
Felicity ran background on Fuller.

626
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:28,874
He had secret business dealings

627
00:28:28,877 --> 00:28:30,744
with both Hutchinson and Ford.

628
00:28:30,747 --> 00:28:32,283
If they were gonna cut him out,

629
00:28:32,286 --> 00:28:33,416
this was payback.

630
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,158
All right. Well, the hit on you failed,

631
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:37,055
so that means Fuller's gonna
know something's up soon

632
00:28:37,057 --> 00:28:38,330
if he doesn't already, right?

633
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,831
I'm gonna send S.W.A.T.
in while we still have

634
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:40,885
the element of surprise.

635
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:42,455
It's not that simple.

636
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:45,292
Fuller's in there right now
with at least 12 hired guns,

637
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:46,994
and the club is at capacity.

638
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:48,479
So it could get really messy.

639
00:28:48,482 --> 00:28:50,205
Guys.

640
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,682
It won't get messy

641
00:28:57,685 --> 00:29:00,258
if the Green Arrow
goes in... the O.G. one.

642
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:06,252
No. I... I can't risk being
separated from my family, Rene.

643
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:08,666
I can't do it.

644
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:11,127
I might know a way you can.

645
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,930
Even if you did,

646
00:29:12,933 --> 00:29:15,066
Pollard would never stand for it.

647
00:29:15,069 --> 00:29:16,674
Pollard wanted me to restore

648
00:29:16,677 --> 00:29:17,924
the city's faith in this department,

649
00:29:17,926 --> 00:29:19,459
and that is never gonna happen if we

650
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:21,345
keep treating our heroes like criminals.

651
00:29:21,348 --> 00:29:23,996
It's time the mayor realizes that.

652
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:28,853
Dinah, I trust you,
but you have to be sure.

653
00:29:28,856 --> 00:29:31,058
Half this city believes in the vigilante

654
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,124
because they were hoping it was you.

655
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:37,095
Now they don't have to hope anymore.

656
00:29:40,889 --> 00:29:43,523
Okay.

657
00:29:43,526 --> 00:29:45,582
I need to make a pit stop.

658
00:29:54,112 --> 00:29:56,090
The bunker has seen better days.

659
00:29:56,093 --> 00:29:57,716
Yes, it has.

660
00:29:57,718 --> 00:29:59,684
It didn't seem right coming back here

661
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:01,386
after the team disbanded.

662
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:05,037
Thanks for bringing this.

663
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,313
The FBI still has mine.

664
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:09,361
It's a good thing you made another one.

665
00:30:09,363 --> 00:30:11,396
Yeah.

666
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:13,265
Does that mean you changed your mind

667
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:15,267
about breaking the cycle of violence?

668
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:17,176
No.

669
00:30:19,077 --> 00:30:21,405
I cannot burden William with this.

670
00:30:21,408 --> 00:30:25,777
But it's not just about
breaking the cycle of violence.

671
00:30:28,081 --> 00:30:29,947
It's about accountability.

672
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,308
What does that mean to you?

673
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:35,319
If Star City wants to
hate the Green Arrow,

674
00:30:35,322 --> 00:30:37,389
that's fine.

675
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:40,340
They'll have to hate me, too.

676
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:45,797
You want some backup out there?

677
00:30:45,806 --> 00:30:48,607
Thank you, but this
time, I got to go solo.

678
00:30:50,128 --> 00:30:51,360
Hey.

679
00:30:51,363 --> 00:30:53,497
Yeah.

680
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,215
Don't you need this?

681
00:30:58,879 --> 00:31:00,679
No.

682
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,318
Cassaday, you were
supposed to check in here

683
00:31:27,321 --> 00:31:28,705
when the job was done.

684
00:31:28,707 --> 00:31:30,273
Where the hell are you?

685
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:34,409
Listen, I want everyone
on high alert, okay?

686
00:31:34,412 --> 00:31:36,245
No one gets in here.

687
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:37,613
Go!

688
00:31:46,057 --> 00:31:47,443
I'm in.

689
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:48,954
Copy that. We're ready.

690
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:51,009
Keep your men in position
and wait for my word.

691
00:31:51,012 --> 00:31:53,224
I don't want to tip our
hand or panic the crowd.

692
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:56,299
Let's hope you're not rusty.

693
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:58,868
All units, stand by.

694
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,413
Queen?

695
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:31,768
Aah! Uh! Uh...

696
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:54,190
Aah! Uh! Uh...

697
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:03,232
Oliver, do you have Fuller?

698
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:05,501
I'm about to.

699
00:33:25,824 --> 00:33:26,956
Stay back!

700
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,858
Drop the gun, Max.

701
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,360
- I'll shoot.
- Hiring killers is easy.

702
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:37,166
Taking the shot yourself isn't.

703
00:33:37,168 --> 00:33:40,102
Oh. You're a vigilante.

704
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:42,338
You don't have the
authority to arrest me.

705
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,673
She does.

706
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:46,032
Max Fuller, you are under arrest

707
00:33:46,035 --> 00:33:47,477
for the murder of Clayton Ford

708
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,112
and Sam Hutchinson.

709
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,750
Take Mr. Fuller into booking.

710
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,747
Should I give you two a minute?

711
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,893
We do this together.

712
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:22,065
Ms. Mayor, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

713
00:34:22,067 --> 00:34:23,900
You've got some nerve.

714
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:27,234
I want Mr. Queen booked

715
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:29,171
in violation of the anti-vigilante law.

716
00:34:29,174 --> 00:34:31,141
Hmm. Afraid I can't do that.

717
00:34:31,143 --> 00:34:33,576
Then I want your resignation.

718
00:34:33,578 --> 00:34:35,011
I think that would be a mistake.

719
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh, that's rich, coming from the man

720
00:34:37,003 --> 00:34:39,148
who stared this city
in the face and lied.

721
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:40,850
You made a mockery of city hall.

722
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:43,186
I'm gonna show you that
no one is above the law.

723
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:45,507
I could not agree with you more,

724
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,695
which is why, as of today, Mr. Queen

725
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:51,694
is officially working for the SCPD.

726
00:34:51,696 --> 00:34:53,765
He's no longer a vigilante.

727
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:55,998
I'll get that tossed
by this time tomorrow.

728
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:57,901
Well, you can try, but
I have a strong feeling

729
00:34:57,903 --> 00:35:00,503
the district attorney is going
to side with me on this one.

730
00:35:05,543 --> 00:35:07,776
This isn't over,

731
00:35:07,779 --> 00:35:10,380
not even close.

732
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:20,757
This should be fun.

733
00:35:26,797 --> 00:35:29,398
Got to warn you, this one's a handful.

734
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:30,867
We know.

735
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:32,802
You sure you're good with this?

736
00:35:32,804 --> 00:35:35,672
Hiding the truth from
Oliver and Felicity? No.

737
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,957
But this is the
strongest lead we've got.

738
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,359
If we don't exploit it now,

739
00:35:39,362 --> 00:35:42,296
who knows how many
people will be hurt later?

740
00:35:44,616 --> 00:35:46,416
Open it.

741
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:50,789
We'll take it from here.

742
00:35:57,494 --> 00:36:00,963
Hello, Mr. Diaz. Remember me?

743
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:03,399
I'm sure you remember my husband.

744
00:36:06,152 --> 00:36:08,219
What do you want?

745
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:16,412
We need your help.

746
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,936
Man. And I thought I was messy.

747
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:28,601
How are we supposed to
find anything in this place?

748
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:42,238
Guys!

749
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:48,340
These are the bomb schematics we found

750
00:36:48,343 --> 00:36:49,851
in Felicity's hideout.

751
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:52,114
Blackstar knew about her
plan to blow up Star City.

752
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:54,507
Maybe she didn't just know about it.

753
00:36:54,518 --> 00:36:56,051
Maybe she was part of it.

754
00:36:56,054 --> 00:36:58,203
Huh. If Felicity got cold feet,

755
00:36:58,206 --> 00:36:59,873
that's one hell of a motive to kill her.

756
00:36:59,876 --> 00:37:01,344
Okay. But why hang on to these?

757
00:37:01,347 --> 00:37:03,645
I mean, why not destroy the evidence?

758
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:06,872
Because she's still
planning on using them.

759
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,726
Okay, we have got to go to the cops.

760
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,132
The SCPD are a joke.

761
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:11,507
They'd love to watch

762
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,781
Star City go up in flames.

763
00:37:13,784 --> 00:37:16,619
Well, there is another option.

764
00:37:16,622 --> 00:37:18,607
We go to the Glades.

765
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,543
I thought we weren't welcome there.

766
00:37:20,545 --> 00:37:23,980
Well, we're not, but she is.

767
00:37:23,982 --> 00:37:26,616
No. No way.

768
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:28,226
Zoe, we don't know when or where

769
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:29,828
this is going to happen, right?

770
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,120
And by the time we find
out, it could be too late.

771
00:37:32,123 --> 00:37:34,304
I don't love the idea either,

772
00:37:34,307 --> 00:37:35,762
but we need resources.

773
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:44,300
I guess it's time to pay my dad a visit.

774
00:37:44,302 --> 00:37:47,870
With the successful arrest
of Max Fuller assisted

775
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:51,311
by Oliver Queen, the Green
Arrow will officially be working

776
00:37:51,314 --> 00:37:55,000
on the side of the law
hand in hand with the SCPD,

777
00:37:55,003 --> 00:37:57,093
marking a new era for Star City.

778
00:37:58,298 --> 00:38:01,484
Well... it looks like
you're famous again.

779
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,781
Could you have imagined 7 years ago

780
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:06,289
that you'd be working unmasked
and alongside the cops?

781
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:10,293
A lot has changed.

782
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:12,403
Yeah.

783
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:17,400
All those months at Slabside,

784
00:38:17,402 --> 00:38:19,001
there wasn't a day that went by...

785
00:38:19,003 --> 00:38:20,381
There wasn't an hour

786
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:24,639
that went by I didn't think
about you and William and...

787
00:38:24,642 --> 00:38:27,143
getting our life back.

788
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:28,811
Me, too.

789
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,750
Okay.

790
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:38,250
So what's changed?

791
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,301
I think time apart forced us to move

792
00:38:44,304 --> 00:38:45,928
in different directions.

793
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,431
Okay. But how do we...

794
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:52,117
start pushing in the
same direction again?

795
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,484
I want to.

796
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:55,537
Mm-hmm.

797
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,015
But you're right.

798
00:38:57,018 --> 00:38:59,184
You know, I've changed...

799
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:01,854
more than you know.

800
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:06,179
I almost killed Diaz,

801
00:39:06,182 --> 00:39:07,492
and I would've killed him

802
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:10,152
if Laurel hadn't stopped me.

803
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:13,093
And I know that you're gonna want

804
00:39:13,096 --> 00:39:14,530
to talk me down to the old Felicity,

805
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:16,933
the one that you met
chewing that red pen.

806
00:39:16,936 --> 00:39:19,269
While you were gone,

807
00:39:19,272 --> 00:39:21,506
I had to learn how to protect myself.

808
00:39:23,927 --> 00:39:25,934
I put you in the position
where you had to do that,

809
00:39:25,937 --> 00:39:27,015
and I'm sorry.

810
00:39:27,018 --> 00:39:28,875
No. This isn't on you.

811
00:39:28,878 --> 00:39:31,740
Well... okay.

812
00:39:31,743 --> 00:39:34,500
I love you more than a human being

813
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:36,212
should love another human being.

814
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:39,836
I just don't know

815
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,765
if what's best for me right now is

816
00:39:41,768 --> 00:39:45,609
the same thing as what's best for us.

00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:56,798
Hey, Dad, turns out
Oliver is more like you

818
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:58,768
than I thought,

819
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,770
more like me, too.

820
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:03,473
But I'm not giving up,

821
00:40:03,475 --> 00:40:05,241
not ever.

822
00:41:20,451 --> 00:41:22,240
You failed.

823
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,047
Why are you doing this?

824
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,518
You did this to yourself.

825
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:36,957
And now all of you will perish.

826
00:41:45,373 --> 00:41:51,193
