1
00:00:02,504 --> 00:00:03,630
<i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:06,132
<i>an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,760
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:10,127
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,264
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:14,557
<i>Unfortunately, my plan</i>

7
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:17,185
<i>is opposed by the body
I had sworn my allegiance to,</i>

8
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:18,645
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:21,314
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:23,024
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,735
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

12
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:30,740
<i>Previously, on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

13
00:00:30,907 --> 00:00:32,242
I was her.

14
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,451
Tragedy or heartbreak,

15
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:35,161
<i>that's how it always ends</i>

16
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,746
if the man's not Carter.

17
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,249
Time Master Druce?

18
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,769
You and your band of rogues have
run rampant throughout history.

19
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:43,420
<i>This is why we work alone, Rip.</i>

20
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:44,587
A team is a liability.

21
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:47,132
The Time Masters have issued
Omega Protocols on all of us.

22
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:48,299
They've sent the Pilgrim.

23
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,467
Who's the Pilgrim?

24
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,970
The Pilgrim is the Time Masters'
most deadly assassin.

25
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:54,305
She's hunting
our younger selves.

26
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,100
<i>Kaylex Druzan.</i>

27
00:00:57,684 --> 00:01:01,146
You have been found guilty of
time piracy in the first degree

28
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:05,650
and sentenced to death
via Omega Protocol.

29
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:10,405
The Pilgrim has made contact
with your younger self.

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,660
This will all be over quickly.

31
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,176
Well done.
Here's your next assignment.

32
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:34,387
These individuals have
manipulated the timeline

33
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:38,183
<i>without authorization
on multiple occasions.</i>

34
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:39,768
You are hereby ordered

35
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,896
to hunt down these individuals'
younger selves,

36
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,856
and eliminate them.

37
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:55,575
- This isn't my element.
- It's mine.

38
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:57,702
Just keep a weather eye open
for the Pilgrim.

39
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,704
Gideon calculates a 97% chance

40
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,348
that she will attack
your younger self

41
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:03,124
in this exact time and place.

42
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,292
Got it.

43
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:11,925
Young Rory is not in there.

44
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,594
But we found his parents,
they're dead.

45
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:16,041
All right, where the hell is he?

46
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:34,155
Come with me
if you want to live.

47
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:36,282
I've always wanted to say that.

48
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,646
<i>- That's younger you?
- What did you tell him?</i>

49
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,564
That we work for a secret agency
called A.R.G.U.S.

50
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:51,589
I think he bought it.

51
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:53,466
Of course, he did.
He's an idiot.

52
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:56,135
Hey, no offense,

53
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:57,971
but do you really think
it's a good idea

54
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,177
to leave him unsupervised?

55
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,809
You're right, have fun.

56
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:04,978
- You seem calm.
- You mean considering

57
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:06,563
a temporal bounty hunter
is trying

58
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,356
to murder our younger selves?

59
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,901
I was gonna put it a little more
delicately than that, but yeah.

60
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:13,462
I think at some point,
you just learn

61
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:14,946
to live with a sword
over your head.

62
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,954
Either you're getting better,
or I'm getting lazy.

63
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,957
So, it seems like
you decided to ignore

64
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,417
the advice from Old-West-you,

65
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:28,585
about not being with Ray.

66
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:31,212
Ignoring her advice about Ray
was your advice. Remember?

67
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,381
Don't listen to my advice.

68
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,633
So, did you tell him
what she said?

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,135
Oh, sure.

70
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:40,138
"Hey, Ray, by the way,
the women I met in 1871 was me."

71
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:42,265
"And she told me
our love was doomed"

72
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:43,784
"to fail
because you're not Carter."

73
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:44,809
So, that was a "no"?

74
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,477
Look, Ray and I
are happy together.

75
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,205
We should be able to enjoy that
before I have to drop

76
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,148
the whole doomed-love-affair
thing on his head.

77
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:52,233
Yeah, I mean,
who wants a relationship

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,611
based on honesty
and communication?

79
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:57,655
Believe me, a relationship based
on an ancient Egyptian curse

80
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:58,990
doesn't work much better.

81
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,829
Mr. Rory, how are you feeling?
I mean, your younger self.

82
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:06,539
Jax is watching him.

83
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,833
That young man, you,
just lost his family,

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,919
you might want
a shoulder to cry on.

85
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:14,505
I don't cry, Professor. Oh, and,
Haircut, thanks for saving me.

86
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,673
You're welcome.

87
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,984
You know what I don't get is,

88
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:18,569
why doesn't the Pilgrim
just go back a week earlier

89
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:19,673
and kill younger Rory then?

90
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,679
Because the Omega Protocol
calls for precision.

91
00:04:21,846 --> 00:04:23,157
Multiple attempts
from the Pilgrim

92
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:24,766
could do irreparable
temporal damage.

93
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,293
Which means
she's only got one shot

94
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:27,751
at killing each
and every one of us.

95
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,604
And we only have
one shot to extract

96
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,211
your younger selves
from the timeline

97
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:32,690
before she pulls the trigger.

98
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:34,359
<i>Sir, based on the temporal wake</i>

99
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,110
<i>generated by the
Pilgrim's Timeship,</i>

100
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,029
<i>I calculate a 96% likelihood</i>

101
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:40,949
<i>that she's headed to
Starling City, circa 2007.</i>

102
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,034
Pilgrim is targeting Ms. Lance.

103
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,126
- Name?
- Lance. Sara Lance.

104
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,753
This is ridiculous.

105
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,505
Come on, I thought it was

106
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:57,256
"Take your daughter
to work" day.

107
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,883
Yeah, If I was in grade school.

108
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,986
"Daddy, I'm doing a paper
on the Criminal Justice System,"

109
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,488
"I wanna see what it looks like
on the inside."

110
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:05,139
Well, I didn't mean
inside a jail cell.

111
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,558
Too bad, 'cause that's the
next stop on our little tour.

112
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,727
I think you're enjoying this
a little too much.

113
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,063
Honey, it's the dream
of every father

114
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,208
to keep their daughters
locked up until they are 30.

115
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:15,233
Maybe even 40.

116
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:19,404
What the...

117
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,672
Daddy!

118
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:46,264
Get out of here!
Get out of here! Go! Go! Go!

119
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,595
Oh, my God, she's...

120
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:26,929
Quite the badass.

121
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,986
I put her in the cargo bay
with mini you.

122
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,233
Told them both to stay put.

123
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,281
The less they know
what's going on, the better.

124
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,168
You sure you wanna leave
daddy's little girl

125
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:48,493
with that punk?

126
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,059
Even before
the League of Assassins,

127
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:51,621
I knew how to handle
guys like you.

128
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:53,998
Has Gideon figured out
the Pilgrim's next target yet?

129
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,459
- That's peculiar.
- Peculiar or bad?

130
00:06:56,626 --> 00:07:00,004
Gideon, run another scan for the
whereabouts of the Pilgrim.

131
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:03,341
<i>I'm sorry, sir, the timeline
shows no temporal distortions.</i>

132
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,510
<i>I seem to be unable
to track the Pilgrim.</i>

133
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,638
- That doesn't sound good.
- No. It's quite the opposite.

134
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:10,925
Without a way to track
the whereabouts of the Pilgrim,

135
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:15,478
she could target any one of you
at any point in time.

136
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,527
Gideon was tracking
the Pilgrim's temporal wake.

137
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:23,893
I didn't think it was possible

138
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,696
to conceal one's movements
through time.

139
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,783
Well, it is if the Time Masters
are on your side.

140
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:28,866
How does this all work?

141
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,536
She can travel to any place,
any time?

142
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,538
She could be killing any of us
right now.

143
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,165
- And if we die in the past...
- You die in the present.

144
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:37,708
<i>Wow, this is so interesting.</i>

145
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,877
How long does it take
for what happens in the past

146
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:41,212
to affect the present?

147
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,440
Could I be dead right now
and not know it?

148
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,715
Maybe I am dead right now.

149
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,551
<i>Hello?</i>

150
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,553
- Can anybody hear me?
- No.

151
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,359
Look, the important thing
is not to panic.

152
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:51,824
Somebody is playing
Russian roulette

153
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:53,641
with our younger selves,
why would we panic?

154
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:55,226
Well, there are
a few exceptions.

155
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:56,894
Kendra's ability to reincarnate

156
00:07:57,061 --> 00:08:00,106
means that it would the Pilgrim
no good to target her.

157
00:08:00,273 --> 00:08:01,816
And, as a former Time Master,

158
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:03,776
<i>to remove me from history</i>

159
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,945
would be quite dangerous
to the timeline.

160
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,239
Well, that's convenient.

161
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,575
And what's that
supposed to mean?

162
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,076
Nothing. It just occurs to me,

163
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:15,163
you've never told us
about your past, Rip.

164
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,582
And I don't trust a man
with secrets.

165
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,418
Look, the less information
you have to offer on me,

166
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:24,088
the less valuable you are
to our now numerous enemies.

167
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:27,592
- Like I said, <i>convenient.</i>
- Are they fighting?

168
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,344
This is not a fight, it's merely
an exchange of ideas.

169
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,929
No, not you. Them!

170
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,934
She slapped me.

171
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,246
The little weirdo said that
he liked the way that I smell.

172
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,350
I'm usually a lot smoother,

173
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,023
but I'm sort of freaking out
right now.

174
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,941
You, hands to yourself.

175
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,508
And next time,
hit with a flat palm.

176
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,612
And, you...

177
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,948
You're not her type. Now,
do I need to separate you two?

178
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:53,409
No.

179
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,871
Hey, when do I get to go home?

180
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,123
You're safer here, trust me.

181
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,793
Well, where is here?
And why do you look like me?

182
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,105
Please, will you just tell me
what the hell is going on?

183
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,964
Look, it's safer for you
if I don't.

184
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:09,592
And we look alike because...

185
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:14,472
Because we're like family,
and I need you to trust me.

186
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,475
Look, my dad,
he's gonna be freaking out.

187
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:20,353
- If he ever lost me...
- He won't lose you.

188
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:21,812
Ever.

189
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,441
I promise.

190
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,325
Hey.

191
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:36,327
Hey.

192
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:38,162
Did you know that
Rip has a secret stash

193
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,538
of vintage cereals?

194
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,274
Fruit Brute
was always my favorite.

195
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,167
Are you okay?

196
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,669
I'm a little on edge.

197
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,683
You know, we've been
through a lot together

198
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,925
and you've never quite resorted
to eating sugary cereals.

199
00:09:53,344 --> 00:09:54,345
<i>Look...</i>

200
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,632
I've spent a lot of my life
thinking about the future.

201
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,558
And now, I have to think
about the past,

202
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,852
just sometimes
the present and...

203
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,941
The point is, do you know where
I go to when things get crazy?

204
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,151
Which, for us, is always.

205
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:13,322
I go to those two years
in Hub City

206
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,574
<i>when it was just you and me.</i>

207
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,868
And it felt like we had forever.

208
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,704
Yeah.

209
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,081
That's what kept me grounded.

210
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:28,379
In fact, seconds before
Rip and the team came back,

211
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,548
I was about...

212
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:31,841
<i>Ray!</i>

213
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,176
My God!

214
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,387
What's wrong?

215
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,472
Oh, my God!

216
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,891
Gideon, we need help! Ray...

217
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,270
What's happening to him?

218
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,939
<i>He is suffering
from severe internal injuries.</i>

219
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:52,570
Who's doing this?

220
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,457
<i>A deep scan
of Mr. Palmer's timeline</i>

221
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:58,284
<i>reveals a temporal anomaly
on December 19th, 2014.</i>

222
00:10:58,451 --> 00:10:59,886
<i>In the vicinity
of Palmer Technologies.</i>

223
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,123
The Pilgrim. Gideon,
get us to that location now!

224
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,592
Who are you?

225
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,303
I'm no one.
We have that in common.

226
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,453
We need to get you to cover.

227
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,440
What is that thing?
Who is she? Who are you?

228
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:35,112
No time to explain!

229
00:11:42,453 --> 00:11:44,205
Rip and the team
are saving you in the past,

230
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:45,873
and I'm here now.

231
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,920
However long we have,
I wanna spend it with you.

232
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:52,463
<i>My suit.</i>

233
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:01,389
It works.

234
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,478
<i>Mr. Palmer's vitals
are stabilizing.</i>

235
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:09,814
They did it.

236
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,733
Actually, I think
you get most of the credit.

237
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,153
Couldn't miss spending
the rest of our lives together.

238
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:19,490
I meant it, Ray.

239
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,494
I love you.

240
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,538
I guess you found the ring.

241
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,498
The ring?

242
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,341
Kind of a strange way
to get engaged, but

243
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,387
I'll take it.

244
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,228
What the Pilgrim did,

245
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,188
the way she turned our attacks
back on us.

246
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,857
It's as if she
was reversing time.

247
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,703
It's called,
"Temporal Micro Manipulation."

248
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,069
The ability to control time
in one's immediate vicinity.

249
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,613
We are lucky
to have saved Dr. Palmer.

250
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,033
So, basically, we have no idea
who she's going after next.

251
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,201
We know it's not Rip,

252
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,912
because he doesn't have a past
to go back to.

253
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,639
Gideon, prepare
for multiple time jumps.

254
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:11,041
Plot points here, here and here.

255
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,420
My birthday? Why are we...

256
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:16,690
The only way to ensure you
are not harmed in your past...

257
00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:19,216
Is to abduct ourselves
as newborns.

258
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,052
Thus removing ourselves
from our future timelines.

259
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,103
- It's brilliant.
- It's morally questionable.

260
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:26,098
It's suicidal.

261
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,058
If we take too long
in getting them home...

262
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,393
Then history is altered.

263
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,354
There won't be a <i>home</i>
to go back to.

264
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,315
You'll disappear from the minds

265
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:35,941
of everyone
who's ever known you.

266
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:38,944
You mean, my own mom
wouldn't even know me?

267
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,738
My wife.

268
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:45,117
Yeah. And my...
Oh yeah, I don't have anyone.

269
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:49,038
Sure as hell beats dying.

270
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,751
- Hey.
- Hey.

271
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,003
How's Ray?

272
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,089
Fine, um, his younger self
is in the hospital,

273
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:02,092
so, our Ray
is healing rather quickly.

274
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,011
Though, you don't seem
too happy about it.

275
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,889
I'm not unhappy, I'm...

276
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:11,602
I'm engaged.

277
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:13,270
What?

278
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:17,650
Yeah. Ray proposed to me
while he was...

279
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,276
You know what?
It's a long story.

280
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,819
But you said, "Yes."

281
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,530
At the time.

282
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,618
I never thought about marriage,

283
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:31,163
I didn't think I was able
to think about marriage.

284
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,792
I don't know what to do.

285
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,502
That's hard.

286
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,130
Do you like babies?

287
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,425
Yeah, but that sounds like
doubling down to me.

288
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,345
I need your help and then

289
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:49,306
I'll help you figure out
what you should say to Ray.

290
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:50,766
Okay.

291
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,976
Let's go.

292
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,328
All right, this is just like
any other mission.

293
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:07,575
The mark may be a newborn,

294
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,868
but it might as well be
a diamond or a microchip.

295
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,288
You know, you're starting
to sound like Snart.

296
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,876
Okay. Which one is Snart?

297
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,878
Look for the one with horns.

298
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,171
Found him.

299
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,673
Great. Grab him, let's go.

300
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,842
Hello, baby Snart.

301
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,677
Oh! Look at you.

302
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,014
Kendra, come on,
we don't have time for this.

303
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,348
Look.

304
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:35,185
Look at those cheeks.

305
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:40,190
Oh! You're the cutest little baby
in the world.

306
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:43,986
<i>Poor kid.</i>

307
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,989
He's gonna have a rough life
ahead of him.

308
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,991
Good thing we're kidnapping him.

309
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,123
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting us out of here.

310
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,127
We don't even know
where here is.

311
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,714
<i>Identity confirmed. Sara Lance.</i>

312
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,300
Let's go!

313
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,010
Where do you think you're going?

314
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,596
Give me that! Inside!

315
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,556
Is that a baby?

316
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,475
Yes, and you guys
are in charge of him.

317
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:15,643
Wait, I...

318
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,771
Made five grand last summer,
babysitting. You'll be fine.

319
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,523
- No, I don't do babies.
- You do now.

320
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,069
Think of it as a "thank you"
for saving your life.

321
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,197
You better not drop
my future criminal partner.

322
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:31,075
Otherwise you are in trouble.
<i>Comprende?</i>

323
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,273
We've got Mr. Snart's
younger self.

324
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:40,334
Next up is you, Professor,
and you, Mr. Jackson.

325
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:43,921
How strange to imagine
holding one's infant self.

326
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:45,648
Actually, none of you
should participate

327
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:46,715
in your own abductions.

328
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,094
Let's call it
paradox prevention.

329
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,804
It's almost worth the risk.

330
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,722
To experience
how our own fathers

331
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,058
must have felt
the day we were born.

332
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,686
Yeah, well, not my dad.

333
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:01,980
He shipped out
before my mom went into labor.

334
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,193
He died two weeks later
in Somalia, so...

335
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:09,029
I'm so sorry.

336
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,115
Yeah.

337
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,420
I think I see the head.

338
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,634
Look at that.

339
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,973
What do you think
of "Jeremy" as a name?

340
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,142
I think he looks
more like a "Martin."

341
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,810
You guys asked
for a doctor, right?

342
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:40,978
Yeah, how would we?

343
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:43,564
Uh... He means that we were
on our way to the hospital

344
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,898
and we saw your automobile.

345
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:48,485
Yeah, this little munchkin
needs a checkup.

346
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,321
Pre-natal care.
It's very important.

347
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:53,407
He means "post-natal."

348
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,618
We'll take him straight to the
hospital. We'll meet you there.

349
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,704
What about my wife?

350
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,750
It's somewhat disconcerting
that my father would give me up

351
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,436
so willingly
to two complete strangers.

352
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,503
Well, the 1950s
was a much more trusting time.

353
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,130
Trust me, I lived then.

354
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,048
<i>- He's not in Somalia.
- What?</i>

355
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,179
We need to hold off
on taking baby Jefferson.

356
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,681
I need to find grown Jefferson.

357
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:18,849
But Rip said that we...

358
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,816
I doubt very much
that giving the boy a moment

359
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,091
with his soon-to-be-dead father

360
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,520
will do the universe any harm.

361
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:27,816
What are you doing, Grey?

362
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:29,377
Trust me, Jefferson,
there's someone here

363
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,236
I really think you should meet.

364
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,242
Go talk to him.

365
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,369
And say what?

366
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:42,331
Speak from your heart.

367
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,250
Go.

368
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,722
You were supposed
to be shipping out.

369
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,409
How do you know that?

370
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:05,938
Right. My transport got delayed.

371
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,898
Told my CO,
my wife's giving birth.

372
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,484
He got me a pass and a jeep.

373
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:13,904
And I made it. I saw him.

374
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,031
My boy.

375
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,159
Which one's yours?

376
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:25,457
Oh no, I'm not a dad. I just...
I'm here for my family.

377
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,645
Well, I hope you get
to experience this

378
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:29,920
for yourself one day.

379
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,689
Imagining all the things
my boy's gonna be

380
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:32,714
when he grows up.

381
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,049
How do you know?

382
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,176
'Cause he's my son.

383
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,805
Jefferson Jackson,
remember that name.

384
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,599
He's destined for great things.

385
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,645
I gotta go.

386
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,648
Will you give the nurse
a message for my wife?

387
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:50,816
You're leaving already?

388
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,693
Yeah, well, if I don't...

389
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,695
I just want her to know
that I saw my son,

390
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,864
and that I couldn't be
more proud and happy.

391
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,116
And tell her I'll be home
as soon as I can.

392
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,034
Can you do that?

393
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:06,790
Wait!

394
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,293
I gotta tell you something.

395
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,466
Congratulations.

396
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:20,971
Thanks. Appreciate that.

397
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,303
We're here.

398
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,804
Where is here?

399
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,932
Come, I'll show you.

400
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,020
Again, where is here?

401
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,689
We need a safe harbor
to keep your younger selves.

402
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:22,115
I've been waiting.

403
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:23,992
It's good to see you.

404
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:30,248
It is good to see you,
too, Mother.

405
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:38,882
Don't forget to take
your boots off

406
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,550
<i>before you come back in!</i>

407
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:42,886
Ah!

408
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,222
Oi!

409
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,391
Out you go.

410
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,395
So, this is where Rip plans on
keeping our baby selves.

411
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:52,747
If all goes according to plan,

412
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,231
we'll only be here
for a few minutes,

413
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,816
then, presumably,
never remember.

414
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,044
When's the last time
anything went according to plan?

415
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,070
I don't think
there was a last time.

416
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,197
I really would sit up
if I were you.

417
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,050
She'll kill you
if she catches you slouching.

418
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:05,450
Don't be fooled by appearances.

419
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,244
That woman is as tough as nails.

420
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,746
Funny how you never mentioned
having a mother.

421
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,081
Adoptive mother.

422
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,250
Now, can I interest any of you
in some more tea?

423
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,293
- Thank you.
- So, Michael...

424
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,922
- "Michael"?
- That's me. My birth name.

425
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:22,384
The Time Masters insist on
the adoption of new identities

426
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:23,552
for their protection.

427
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,559
How do you know so much
about the Time Masters?

428
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:26,638
I work for them.

429
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,557
<i>Oh, don't worry.</i>

430
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:31,435
My true loyalty
is to my children.

431
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,604
Thank you. The Time Masters
fill their ranks with children.

432
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,791
Orphans pulled from throughout
the course of history.

433
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,608
<i>When Michael arrived
at the refuge,</i>

434
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,253
<i>he had nothing
but the clothes on his back.</i>

435
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,070
There's a reason
it's called "the refuge."

436
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:45,115
And a reason that it exists
in a secret location in history.

437
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,301
The Time Masters will never
think to look for you here.

438
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:48,525
Thank you for your assistance.

439
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,203
Look, I know I make
a gorgeous baby,

440
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,371
but I should warn you,

441
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,898
you've got your hands full
with me.

442
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:53,957
<i>I assure you.</i>

443
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,294
You're not the first tough case
to arrive at my door.

444
00:22:58,503 --> 00:22:59,504
Hmm.

445
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:08,972
Where'd you find the match?

446
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,932
You can always find one.

447
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:12,434
<i>Beautiful, isn't it?</i>

448
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,145
Not as beautiful
as a whole house

449
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,314
<i>going up in flames, though.</i>

450
00:23:17,481 --> 00:23:19,483
- It was an accident.
- Sure, it was.

451
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,277
You don't know me.

452
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,071
You think I wanted
to kill my family?

453
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,657
I think you fell in love
with your dad's lighter fluid.

454
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:31,161
I think you fell in love with
the flames dancing around.

455
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,167
But then you realized
you couldn't control them,

456
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:38,001
and you ran,
without waking your family.

457
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:41,338
The only thing
you were concerned about

458
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:43,340
was your own skin.

459
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:48,011
Now, while I'm gone, there
better not be any accidents.

460
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,848
If there is,
I'm gonna come looking for you.

461
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,351
I'm gonna kill you.

462
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,686
You sound just like my dad.

463
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:08,031
Wait for me!

464
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,329
I couldn't quite bring myself
to leave this place just yet.

465
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:17,290
I've made you
something for your travels.

466
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:19,876
Some mince pies
for your friends.

467
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:22,212
My friends.

468
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,779
Yeah, the people
whose relationships

469
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,040
with their friends and family

470
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,842
I've put at risk
to save my family.

471
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,760
You think you've been selfish?

472
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:31,805
- I do, yes.
- What a load of old codswallop.

473
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:33,974
I've always known that you

474
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,892
were brought to me
for a reason, Michael.

475
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,936
That you were ready
for great things.

476
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:40,063
But you won't accomplish
anything by wallowing.

477
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,707
So, for goodness sake,
pull yourself out of it

478
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:42,732
and get the job done.

479
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,235
What about you?
I've put you in terrible danger.

480
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,921
You don't honestly think
I'd let you go away

481
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:47,946
with my best serving dish

482
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:51,074
if I didn't think
I'd see you again, do you?

483
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,326
I can manage quite happily

484
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:56,413
with a house full of
10-year-old Time Masters.

485
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,249
So, I think I can perfectly deal
with the adult version.

486
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,751
- Go on.
- Yes, yes, yes. Thank you.

487
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,895
<i>Jefferson?</i>

488
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,606
Hey. What's up, man? You good?

489
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:25,108
Please, we share
a psychic connection.

490
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,569
I know how you're feeling
and I'm sorry.

491
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,496
I thought affording you time
with your father

492
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:30,989
would lift your spirits.

493
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,033
Yeah. I...

494
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,118
I thought so, too.

495
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:36,870
I just...

496
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:38,947
I should have said something.

497
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,290
I should have told him about

498
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,125
what happens to him
in Mogadishu.

499
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,294
- I could have saved him.
- You don't know that.

500
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,354
It's highly unlikely
you could have said

501
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,144
anything that would have
changed his fate.

502
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:52,219
My whole life,
everything good I ever did,

503
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:54,512
every report card,
every touchdown,

504
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,973
in the back of my mind,
I always wondered,

505
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,643
"What would my dad
think about this?"

506
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,322
- Hey.
- Hey.

507
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,366
I was just on my way
to the bridge.

508
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,409
No, wait, wait, please.

509
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,037
I didn't mean to be a lurker,

510
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,289
but I heard you
and Sara talking.

511
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,291
And I get it.

512
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,918
You thought I was dying.

513
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,405
You told me
what I needed to hear.

514
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:27,837
And it worked.

515
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:32,092
So, if you need a reason,
a way to let me down easy...

516
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,844
Ray, no, I want to be with you.

517
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,976
It's just that
I know that we can't last.

518
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,852
Says who?

519
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,521
Me.

520
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:49,192
The woman I met in 1871

521
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,194
was me.

522
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:56,199
And she warned me
that it would end in heartbreak

523
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,118
if I ever tried to be
with someone...

524
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,911
Other than Carter.

525
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,248
God, this is just
too complicated.

526
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,834
No, it isn't, really.

527
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,796
I mean, if I make you happy,

528
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,548
if being with me
makes you happy,

529
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,675
then you can be happy.

530
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:17,721
Or you can choose to listen to
some former version of yourself

531
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,264
who believes in curses.

532
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,936
When you decide, let me know.

533
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:29,566
<i>Everyone, please report
to the main deck immediately.</i>

534
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:32,736
What's going on?

535
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,196
Gideon has intercepted
a transchronal beacon.

536
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:37,240
Gideon, show them.

537
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,535
<i>This message is for Rip Hunter.</i>

538
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:44,873
<i>I'm going to make this
very quick and very simple.</i>

539
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,253
<i>If I can't find you...</i>

540
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,548
<i>I can find those you love.</i>

541
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:58,553
Anna.

542
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,264
Dad!

543
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,059
<i>All of them will suffer and die
because of you.</i>

544
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:08,605
<i>Your family, friends,
anyone you've ever cared about.</i>

545
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,275
<i>Unless you surrender
your younger selves to me.</i>

546
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:15,111
So she can erase you all
from history.

547
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,239
<i>If it's of any comfort,
you won't feel a thing.</i>

548
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:19,699
<i>As for your loved ones,</i>

549
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,453
<i>I cannot promise the same thing.</i>

550
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,968
Gideon, I take it that
the Pilgrim's transmission

551
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:40,303
included a carrier frequency

552
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,739
<i>through which
she can be contacted.</i>

553
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:42,764
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

554
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,391
Hail her, please.

555
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,683
What are you planning to do?

556
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,621
<i>- Captain Hunter...</i>
- Look, I'm gonna make this easy.

557
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:49,813
<i>I already have.</i>

558
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,699
<i>The lives of your team's
nearest and dearest</i>

559
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:52,857
<i>for their younger selves.</i>

560
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:54,651
And I'm gonna counter
that demand

561
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:55,985
with an offer of my own.

562
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,071
I will surrender myself

563
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,949
if you spare the lives of
my crew and their loved ones.

564
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,326
<i>A noble gesture.</i>

565
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,078
<i>But worthless.</i>

566
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,747
<i>My directive is to eliminate
your entire team.</i>

567
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,124
<i>Not just you.</i>

568
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,335
Yes, well,
I'm not talking about me now.

569
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,922
I'm offering you me in the past.

570
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:21,010
Rip Hunter before he became
a Time Master.

571
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:24,222
Eliminate him,

572
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,434
and this team
will never have been.

573
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:29,591
<i>If this is some kind of trick...</i>

574
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,229
It's no trick.

575
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,191
Enough people
have died at my expense.

576
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:38,555
Gideon will send you
the location.

577
00:29:39,404 --> 00:29:41,906
And, Mr. Snart,
your wish is about to come true.

578
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,952
You're going to meet
my younger self.

579
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,125
- What is this place?
- Neutral ground.

580
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,335
It's a defunct
Time Masters outpost.

581
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,897
I thought we were supposed to be
picking up your younger self.

582
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,632
He's being brought
to us, actually.

583
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,262
That little boy
was at the refuge.

584
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,056
He's you.

585
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,059
You got my message.

586
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,896
I don't approve
of what you're planning.

587
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,981
Not that
it ever stopped you before.

588
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,442
Your younger selves
are all still safe and sound.

589
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:18,735
Thank you.

590
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:22,447
- You're a naughty one.
- That's right.

591
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,745
I think it's probably about time
that you left.

592
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,163
Give her hell.

593
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,917
Where's my dad?

594
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,544
Onboard my ship,
along with the rest.

595
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:39,005
All in perfect condition.

596
00:30:39,172 --> 00:30:41,424
As long as your captain honors
his end of our bargain.

597
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:42,592
You'd murder a child?

598
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,802
I'd murder as many children
as is necessary

599
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:45,970
to accomplish my mission.

600
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:47,781
Do you know what this will do
to the timeline?

601
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,182
<i>Killing a Time Master?</i>

602
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,268
In case you've forgotten, I am
sanctioned by the Time Masters

603
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,271
to do what my former colleague
Chronos, here, failed to do.

604
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:56,981
Enough of that!

605
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,985
Let's get down to business.

606
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:03,655
Where's the rest of your group?

607
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,114
They're around.

608
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,953
I'll be taking the boy.

609
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,496
Before you do that,

610
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:13,706
we don't believe for a second

611
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,959
their loved ones
are on your ship.

612
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:19,629
A show of good faith, then.
A prisoner exchange.

613
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,507
Send the boy,
and I'll send the father.

614
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,474
<i>Once I have the future
Captain Hunter</i>

615
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:27,971
in my possession,
then I'll release the rest.

616
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,327
- What the hell's going on?
- You don't need to understand.

617
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,311
Only walk.

618
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:40,567
You are going to be
absolutely fine. I promise.

619
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,160
As soon as my dad's in
the clear, let's light this up.

620
00:31:51,744 --> 00:31:53,746
Remember, we wait for Ray's cue.

621
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:03,006
I'm in position.

622
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,008
You wanted to see me?

623
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:06,801
Have I done
something wrong, miss?

624
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,595
Not yet.

625
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:09,762
Now!

626
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,603
Fool me once...

627
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,665
Now, Kendra!

628
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:28,424
I was willing to proceed
in good faith.

629
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,886
Now, you'll watch
those closest to you die.

630
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,683
Thought you could snuff me out?

631
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,102
You don't know me at all, miss.

632
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:00,415
Hey, are you okay?

633
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:02,208
Not really.

634
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,794
Yeah, let me explain.

635
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,676
You poor boy.

636
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,928
I'll take you. You all right?

637
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,681
That's you?

638
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:18,975
Yeah.

639
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:22,478
I was a cut-purse
from the age of five.

640
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,856
I starved more than I ate.

641
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,484
I knew what I'd do
if she tried to harm me.

642
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:31,571
Lucky for us
you didn't forget your roots.

643
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:35,324
Believe me, Mr. Snart,
I've tried.

644
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,046
There you are.

645
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,175
The Pilgrim
may have been dealt with,

646
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:54,260
but the Omega Protocol
is still in effect.

647
00:34:54,427 --> 00:34:56,220
I'll look after your friends,
don't worry.

648
00:34:56,387 --> 00:35:00,016
I know you will, Mom.
You did the same for me.

649
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:03,436
Must be strange for you
to see yourself as you were.

650
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:04,604
Hmm.

651
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:06,856
Do you remember
the first day you were here?

652
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:09,150
Yes, I think I tried
to steal your purse.

653
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:10,902
God, I was a mean
little bastard.

654
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,362
- You were tough.
- I was selfish.

655
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,198
You were surviving.

656
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,408
I was home.

657
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,579
Which is why I know
you'll be back.

658
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:34,550
Here to give me another

659
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,135
don't-burn-down-the-house
speech?

660
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:37,502
You think by hurting yourself,

661
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:39,931
it's gonna make you feel better
about the fire.

662
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,577
You don't know anything
about me, man.

663
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:43,226
Guess again, kid.

664
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:45,561
- I'm you.
<i>- What?</i>

665
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:47,563
<i>That's right.</i>

666
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,984
You're too young to understand.

667
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,653
But understand this.

668
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,947
It wasn't your fault.

669
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,411
I let that flame
get out of control.

670
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:04,205
<i>Like you said.</i>

671
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:08,835
I ran out, without waking
anybody, like you said.

672
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,088
I was just so afraid.

673
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,006
You were just a kid.

674
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:18,469
I spent my whole life
blaming you.

675
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:20,763
Hating you.

676
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:24,433
For something
you didn't mean to do.

677
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,519
Why are you telling me this?

678
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,607
You can't change
the things you did.

679
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:34,026
But you can change
what you become.

680
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:37,655
Don't be like me.

681
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:38,823
Be better.

682
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:45,288
Clarissa, it's me, Martin.

683
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,734
I'm sorry, you look so familiar,

684
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:48,040
but I just can't place you.

685
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,417
Spaceship.

686
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:52,545
- What next? Martians?
- No.

687
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:56,382
- Actually, amnesia pill.
- Oh, yeah.

688
00:36:56,549 --> 00:36:58,843
This will just wipe
your short-term memory.

689
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,303
Of course, it's up to you,

690
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:02,513
but we don't wanna mess
with time too much.

691
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:04,599
Hmmm.

692
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:09,854
I always knew that you'd end up
caring for people.

693
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:12,189
Protecting people.

694
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:15,818
Well, I learned it from my dad.

695
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:19,822
Proud of you, honey.

696
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:28,289
Is everything all right?

697
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:32,001
My wife doesn't seem
to remember me.

698
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:34,962
Because until we return your
younger selves to the timeline,

699
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:38,007
you, none of you,
will have ever existed.

700
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:40,718
But we will return you.

701
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,136
When we left 2016,

702
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:45,556
I just assumed I would return
to the exact moment I left.

703
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:47,725
That Clarissa wouldn't even know
I was gone.

704
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:49,518
So, I didn't say goodbye.

705
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,522
And, now, I fear
I will never have that chance.

706
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,858
You will.
Look, I've told you before

707
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:58,736
that I am not going
to risk your marriage

708
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,404
in order to save my wife.

709
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:02,865
I promise you, Martin.

710
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:04,533
Thank you.

711
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,620
Not even gonna pretend
to understand any of this.

712
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:09,038
Yes. Pretty crazy. Huh?

713
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:12,541
That was you.

714
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:16,253
In the hospital,
on the day you were born.

715
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:19,465
And, earlier, on fire.

716
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:21,676
Amazing.

717
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:23,594
Where'd you learn those moves?

718
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,179
From my dad.

719
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:30,559
You know, the day you were born,
in the hospital,

720
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,728
I've never been so scared.

721
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:34,438
I mean, even in combat.

722
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:38,567
But now, I know,

723
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,569
for you to be
the man I see standing here,

724
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,114
I must do something right.

725
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,574
I can't wait to be there
to watch it happen.

726
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,121
Dad, listen.

727
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,289
On September 26th,

728
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:54,250
you're gonna be deployed
along the K4 circle.

729
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:57,128
Keep your head on the swivel
for an IED.

730
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:58,295
You know this because...

731
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,633
You're from the future.

732
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,302
Please, promise me
you'll be careful.

733
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:14,603
I'll be back soon, okay?

734
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:21,569
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

735
00:39:22,945 --> 00:39:25,239
Hope you don't mind,
my fiance...

736
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:28,659
My other fiance is

737
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:31,495
- in our quarters, resting.
- Yeah, no, that's...

738
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:32,705
That's fine.

739
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:35,207
- Hey, I'm sorry...
- No, really, it's fine.

740
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,293
No, I mean,

741
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,920
being at death's door
is not the right time

742
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:41,881
to pop the question.

743
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:43,507
Look, when you proposed,

744
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:47,219
I was so afraid of losing you.

745
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,971
And then facing the Pilgrim,

746
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:54,060
I realized, there is never going
to be a right time for this.

747
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:57,772
So, we should stop waiting
for the right time.

748
00:39:58,814 --> 00:39:59,815
Uh...

749
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,108
I don't understand.

750
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,658
I wanna marry you, Ray.

751
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,204
I mean it.

752
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,712
How's your sister?

753
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:23,255
She's a tough kid.

754
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:24,548
How's your dad?

755
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:27,468
Sleeping off that amnesia pill
from Rip.

756
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:30,554
Hey.

757
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:33,825
I might have just stopped my dad

758
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,129
from getting killed
at Mogadishu.

759
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,812
I just thought
I should tell you in case

760
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:39,730
there's a time paradox,
or whatever.

761
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:41,524
Well, as I've been saying,
Mr. Jackson,

762
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,110
- time wants to happen.
- Yeah, I know, but...

763
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,237
- I had to try.
- And perhaps,

764
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:48,364
what time wants is to see

765
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:50,282
you and your father
back together.

766
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:56,539
Just pulled younger me's head
from out of his ass.

767
00:40:57,081 --> 00:40:59,875
- I'm not sure it stuck.
- Me either.

768
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,335
But I saw younger Rip change,

769
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:03,129
and I thought
why not give it a shot.

770
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:05,214
Surprised you didn't advise
your teenage self

771
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:06,882
to not get on a certain boat.

772
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:08,592
Yeah, me, too.

773
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:10,683
I thought
we were on a clock here.

774
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,263
Indeed, we are. Um...

775
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:16,767
Time, the history from which
your younger selves were removed

776
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:19,228
is beginning to set.

777
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,401
<i>As is evidenced by
the change in Clarissa's memory.</i>

778
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:27,688
Okay, so how long do we have
till these changes stick?

779
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:28,779
No one knows.

780
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:30,382
<i>Which is why
we need to move swiftly</i>

781
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:31,448
to locate Vandal Savage

782
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:34,076
if any of your lives
are to be restored to normal.

783
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,244
So how long will it take

784
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:36,638
to determine a new location
for Savage?

785
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:38,038
Longer than we have.

786
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:40,166
Fortunately,
there is one place in time

787
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,834
that we know Savage to be.

788
00:41:42,001 --> 00:41:44,211
You said he conquered
the world in 2166.

789
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:46,064
<i>You also said
it was too dangerous</i>

790
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,089
to strike at Savage

791
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:48,441
while he was at the height
of his powers.

792
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:49,466
That, it is.

793
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:53,095
But with your younger selves
removed from history,

794
00:41:53,262 --> 00:41:56,515
we have, quite literally,

795
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:58,684
run out of time.

796
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:28,714
English - SDH
