1
00:00:03,713 --> 00:00:06,174
Come on, Cap,
can't we just roll one more?

2
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:07,509
- No!
- No!

3
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:09,719
Sorry. We'll have a rematch
at our next date night.

4
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:13,097
I don't know about all of y'all,
but I'm done with space.

5
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:15,058
Get these shoes on solid ground.

6
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,768
Agreed, but not in those shoes.

7
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,353
We need to talk about your footwear.

8
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:20,748
Try to put a heel on me
and I'll show you where to stick it.

9
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,190
Oh, I'm with Miss Cruz on this one.

10
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,151
I think it's about time
that we all return to where we belong.

11
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,611
- Don't you think?
- Right.

12
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,154
Okay, message received.

13
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:31,908
You are correct.
It is time for us to swap back.

14
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,701
- It's not forever.
- I know.

15
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:35,203
- We got this.
- Yeah.

16
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:43,127
Okay, fancy Z, time to come out.

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,924
Oh, B, I...

18
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:51,386
- John, I missed your face so much.
- I missed you so much.

19
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:57,767
- Wait, are we in actual space?
- Yup.

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,103
- Uh... Do I wanna know why?
- Desperate times.

21
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:02,272
The world was at stake.
All that malarkey.

22
00:01:02,355 --> 00:01:05,525
Let me explain it to you
over a nice cuppa cha,

23
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:06,985
maybe a foot massage, yeah?

24
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:09,237
Talk later, Z. Boos before bros.

25
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,823
- Unless your other bro is a time bro.
- Time bro.

26
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:15,243
Hey, babe, something's wrong.

27
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,412
I can't set jump coordinates. Can you...

28
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,455
I'm afraid my jump drive
was damaged

29
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,083
when Mr. Constantine
magicked us across the universe.

30
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,270
Well, I guess we're going
to have to take the long way.

31
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:26,094
Calculating the most
efficient route.

32
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,549
Taking into consideration the
Waverider's fuel and energy reserves,

33
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:33,177
we should arrive safely in three weeks,
two days and 21 hours.

34
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:34,762
Stuck on the ship for three weeks?

35
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:36,139
I'll be in my room.

36
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,891
When we land on Earth, wake me up.

37
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:41,936
These damn eggs
are making my head itchy.

38
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,857
I'll bring you
some cocoa butter for that.

39
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,943
And I have a great way to pass the time.

40
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,862
It's this super fun role-playing game.

41
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,864
It's called <i>Beast/Slayers.</i>

42
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,700
A Gothic mystery adventure awaits.

43
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,910
Well, we have a wedding
we have to plan.

44
00:01:57,994 --> 00:01:59,996
Yeah, we've so much to plan.
We just...

45
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,789
We're very busy.

46
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:05,835
Okay. I'll just set it up
in case you guys change your mind.

47
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:28,483
Okay.

48
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,735
I have everything organized by category.

49
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,403
Hmm. Wow.

50
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,614
Yep. This is... This is thorough.

51
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:37,575
We've got group A,
those who need to come, obviously.

52
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:41,829
Group B, those who we would love
to come, but if they can't, it's okay.

53
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:43,247
And... Come on.

54
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,976
Group C are the people that we should
definitely send an invitation to

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,835
and pray that they RSVP "no."

56
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,631
What about Group D?

57
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,760
Yeah, well, those are the people
who it might be better that

58
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,513
they don't know we're getting married
until it's too late.

59
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,974
Why is Barry Allen on this list?
I love Barry.

60
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,434
I know you do, babe,

61
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,079
but you know that
if Barry and Iris show up,

62
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:06,479
there is a 100% chance

63
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,232
that our special day will be blown up
by a super-villain, so,

64
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:10,650
- Group D.
- Okay.

65
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,778
Hold on a second.

66
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,823
Gideon, why is our trip getting longer?

67
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:18,825
I've recalculated the duration

68
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:21,119
based on our current level
of power consumption.

69
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,579
Power consumption?

70
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,209
No, you will not survive this.

71
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,460
Oh, I'll survive.

72
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:31,587
- Deadly combo coming at you.
- No. No.

73
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:32,629
Ha!

74
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,026
Wait, wait. No, no, I'm not out.
I'm not out. I'm not...

75
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,342
Hey!

76
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:38,821
Sorry, kiddos. We gotta conserve power
or we're never gonna get home.

77
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,096
So no screen time?

78
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:42,514
Afraid so.

79
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,975
I got you, Captain.

80
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,643
No power, no problem.

81
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,895
Right, who's next?

82
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,399
Gideon, I would like a prime rib,

83
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,985
medium rare, with shoestring fries
and béarnaise and...

84
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,611
Ah, ah, ah. Gideon, scrap that order.

85
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:57,905
Sorry, you can't use
the food fabricator anymore.

86
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,741
How are we supposed to feed ourselves?

87
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,451
I don't know.

88
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:02,618
Oh, look.

89
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:04,662
Food.

90
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:08,291
Cook it the old-fashioned way. Yummy.

91
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,130
How does that robe fit you, love?

92
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,841
- Actually, it's a little bit big.
- Oh, right.

93
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,971
Oh.

94
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,556
Wow, it's perfect now.

95
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,664
You all right, man?

96
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:53,628
Aces all round, squire. Aces all round.

97
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,880
I feel magnificent.

98
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,381
How do you feel, good?

99
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,008
Oh...

100
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,136
- Mmm.
- Oh, wow.

101
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,971
- Yeah.
- Oh, hello, Brother.

102
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,681
John is taking me on a spa date.

103
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,350
Ah, on the ship?

104
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,935
Oh, ye of little faith.

105
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,687
You see, I've finally got my magic back
and no occasion to use it

106
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,232
save for doting on
that delightful deity.

107
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,985
Relaxation awaits.

108
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,498
Deep breaths as you fire up
that back leg.

109
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:33,334
Steel is not flexible.

110
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,294
Inhale, extend.

111
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,173
Exhale, goddess pose.

112
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,259
Oh, I missed this.

113
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:45,888
I'll take the positivity
into my energy sphere with gratitude.

114
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:48,391
Room for an English one?

115
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,911
- We're kind of in the middle of a...
- Of course.

116
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:53,354
Prepare yourself for total relaxation.

117
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,483
Yeah.

118
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,779
The atmosphere could do with
a bit of upgrade, though, couldn't it?

119
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,126
Wow. Now that is how you set the mood.

120
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:19,171
Whew! What, did you raise it 20 degrees
in here? I'm beginning to schvitz.

121
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,633
Guess we're doing hot yoga.

122
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:26,554
But in the interest of preserving
the sanctity of this practice,

123
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:27,948
I ask that you keep your pants on.

124
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:30,612
Well, in the interest of achieving
a higher state of consciousness,

125
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,852
I must bare myself to the elements.

126
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,186
Come on, B, you know how he is.

127
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,148
Sure, but I'd rather not know
all of him right now, okay?

128
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,902
I thought that you, of all people,
would, you know, go with the flow.

129
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:43,779
The flow was my flow
till you came and hijacked it.

130
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:45,948
Hijacked it? Improved it, you mean.

131
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,617
Do you know what? This is bollocks.

132
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,745
Well, I'm gonna go practice
somewhere more welcoming.

133
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:51,913
- Cheers.
- Behrad.

134
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:56,334
- Don't Mom voice me, Zari.
- Guys, guys, just take a breath.

135
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,795
You're right. This is a safe space.

136
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,048
- John, you can stay.
- No, no.

137
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,884
No, the mood's all wrong now, mate.

138
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:09,638
John?

139
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,559
Well, if that is the issue

140
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,829
then why did you put your fake
actor parents in Group A?

141
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:19,065
Whoa, whoa, I have very fond memories
of them that feel real and I...

142
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:21,609
Well, Black Siren
is my sister Laurel from another...

143
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:23,003
...a prick in
a dartboard, all right?

144
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:25,905
I know when I'm not wanted,
and I'm not going to outstay my welcome.

145
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,091
John, don't be so dramatic.
Go back there and make amends.

146
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,218
- He didn't mean what he said.
- Whoa, hold on.

147
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,242
What is the drama?

148
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:32,954
Tensions are very high.

149
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,538
People are feeling very prickly.

150
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,874
How is this already happening?
It's day three.

151
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,043
It is very stressful
being cooped up on a Timeship.

152
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,962
Worse. It's bloody boring.

153
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,481
Yeah. Without technology to distract us

154
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,385
it's only gonna get worse
before it gets better.

155
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,716
We need an activity.

156
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,302
Something to bring us together,

157
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:49,595
like a mission,

158
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,930
but not a mission.

159
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,849
Like a game.

160
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:03,401
Welcome to the world of <i>Beast/Slayers.</i>

161
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:06,946
In this Gothic adventure, you will
enter a mansion for a dinner party,

162
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:10,574
only to be hunted by a horrendous beast.

163
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:11,885
Oh, I see what's happening here.

164
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,286
It's like <i>Mafia.</i>
One of us is secretly the Beast,

165
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,307
and it's up to the rest of us to figure
it out before it's too late. Go ahead.

166
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,041
After each kill, you will deliberate

167
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,752
on who to accuse
of being the horrendous monster.

168
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:26,465
Accuse correctly,
the Beast dies and the humans win.

169
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,551
And if we accuse incorrectly?

170
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:33,681
Well, then the game continues
and it's the Beast's turn to strike!

171
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:39,854
I'll be the all-knowing narrator
who will usher the game along.

172
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:44,025
Meanwhile, you will each need
to select a character and a card.

173
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,234
Ooh, can I go first?

174
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,113
Mmm... Eccentric Detective.

175
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,284
Hmm. Black Widow.

176
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:57,496
Starving Artist.

177
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,498
Wealthy Foreigner.

178
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:04,003
"Reluctant Soothsayer."
Typecast much?

179
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,088
Big Game Hunter. I'll take it.

180
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,007
Hmm. Prima Donna. Obvious.

181
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,969
A Consumptive Doctor. Original.

182
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,095
Oh.

183
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:18,184
All right. Now, keep each
of these cards secret.

184
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:22,188
They either say "Human"
or they say "Beast."

185
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,315
Know who and what you are...

186
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,026
as we begin.

187
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:36,035
It's a dark and stormy night,

188
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:41,957
as a group of strangers are summoned
to the home of a rich and powerful Lord.

189
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:44,335
All right, enough of this.

190
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,296
All right, so everybody
wants to go on an adventure, right?

191
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,965
Well, let's go on a real adventure,
shall we?

192
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,397
Now that's more like it.

193
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,488
Game on. Let's hunt this Beast.

194
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:19,245
What?

195
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,998
You have got to teach me
the spell, John.

196
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:26,335
Yeah, well, it takes the bored
out of board game, doesn't it?

197
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,003
This is so incredibly realistic

198
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:31,841
- and I cannot wait to win...
- this entire game.

199
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:36,262
Well, I, for one, did not consent
to be magicked into a game.

200
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,849
Oh, come on. Would you really rather
play with Gary making sound effects?

201
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,019
Okay, I got to admit, John,
this is pretty impressive.

202
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:45,771
But why does it look like your house?

203
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:48,399
Well, the spell is linked
to the rules of the game,

204
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,569
but the rest of the gaps
are filled in by my imagination.

205
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,487
It's easy to make a place
I know so well.

206
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,740
Now, once we win and the game ends...

207
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,325
Poof!

208
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,703
...we'll all be back in the ship,
right as rain.

209
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:03,122
Hello?

210
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:05,875
Guys?

211
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,671
You all right in there?

212
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,092
All right, Gary,
they're counting on you to narrate.

213
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,475
Okay, everyone,

214
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:28,230
<i>dinner is served.</i>

215
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,735
Whew!

216
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:47,875
So, Detective,
could we figure out who this Beast is?

217
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:49,960
It's all about the first kill.

218
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,129
Once the Beast strikes,
there will be a clear line

219
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,173
from who's chosen to who's guilty.

220
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,926
I've already mapped out who it could be
based on who dies first.

221
00:11:58,469 --> 00:11:59,511
Hey, John.

222
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,388
This chicken smells delicious.

223
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,909
But seriously, babe,
do you think he'd cater at the wedding?

224
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,267
- There's no wedding talk.
- What?

225
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:09,521
I do not know
what you're talking about, Detective,

226
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:13,567
because I am just
a heartbroken, sad widow.

227
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,069
You know I don't drink.

228
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,280
Yeah, but this isn't real, mate.

229
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:19,925
This may be your
one and only opportunity

230
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:23,035
to try a truly exquisite Bordeaux.

231
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,679
I'll have some.

232
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,997
- No, she won't.
- Yes, she will. It's not real.

233
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,716
Don't be jealous, Gare.

234
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,386
You're a vital part of this adventure.

235
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,974
Gideon, what's that?

236
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:47,977
I'm receiving a distress beacon
from an approaching vessel.

237
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:57,736
Who the hell's making that racket?
I'm trying to concentrate on my puzzles.

238
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,155
We're being hailed by someone
who's lost out in space.

239
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:02,950
Oh, my God, your hair.

240
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,661
It grew overnight.

241
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,997
Well, don't tuck it in. It's beautiful.

242
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,766
It's a sign
you're in your fourth quadmester.

243
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,458
It means the babies are healthy.

244
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,085
I recognize that ship.

245
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,171
Bishop the psycho might be on board
and those damn lizard people.

246
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,048
Gideon, blast.

247
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:20,592
I'm under Captains' orders
not to use any systems

248
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,469
not vital for our transport to Earth.

249
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,763
- Where are the captains?
- They're in my game.

250
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,850
Well, if the captains aren't here,
it makes me captain.

251
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,977
Well, I don't think
that's how that works.

252
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,731
The ship is maneuvering into
docking position on our starboard side.

253
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,941
Damn it. We missed our shot.

254
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,653
Docking complete.

255
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:42,865
I urge you to reserve judgment until
we know exactly who's behind that door.

256
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,325
Shut up!

257
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,660
Whatever comes through that door,
I'm killing.

258
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,550
Kayla!

259
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,594
Hey, dummies.

260
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,220
You miss me?

261
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,398
What is happening?

262
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:20,069
Ooh, it's time.
The Beast will choose its first victim.

263
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:24,447
Ooh!

264
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:27,826
- No.
- Dead.

265
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,914
What?

266
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,249
The dead have no voice. How poetic.

267
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,502
Well, that was pretty tame.

268
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:40,172
Oh, well, Behrad, see? It's all pretend.

269
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,302
I'm sorry, babe, but you're out.
You got to go.

270
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,471
I know.

271
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,890
I will miss you
and mourn you.

272
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,559
So we lost the detective.

273
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,145
She was the only one
who could figure this whole thing out.

274
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,190
And now, well, she's gone.

275
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:06,490
All right, y'all, the Beast had
their fun, and now it's our turn.

276
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,884
All right, take it easy, Spooner.

277
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,576
Games like these, it's up to the group

278
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,703
to deliberate on
who we think the Beast is.

279
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:15,416
And then it's up to all of us
to vote on someone to accuse.

280
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:18,377
- Well, I accuse you!
- No.

281
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,589
I think that you were so impressed
with Ava's methodology

282
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:26,802
that you wanted to eliminate
the competition right from the start.

283
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,889
Or it's you and you're quick
to accuse others

284
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,558
to deflect any suspicion.

285
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,518
Just pick me.
I'll gladly go hang with Ava

286
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,162
and be exempt from decisions like these.

287
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,938
No, no, no. I agree with Sara.

288
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,416
- I think it's...
- Nate.

289
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,817
- Thank you.
- What? Guys, besides Gary,

290
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,611
who has been very quiet, by the way,

291
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,531
I'm the only one who has any idea
how to play this game.

292
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,783
Yeah, not exactly, mate.

293
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,994
We'll be fine without you,
don't you worry.

294
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,329
All right, so do we vote on Nate?

295
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,248
- All in favor?
- Mmm-hmm.

296
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,958
I abstain.

297
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,043
Doesn't matter. We don't need him.

298
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,337
You have been accused!

299
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,726
He's dead.

300
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:21,857
No, no, trust me, he is fine.
All right? Nate is fine.

301
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,860
Dude, he literally just got
stabbed in the back. He's not fine.

302
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,700
Oh, that is awful. Is that supposed
to happen? It's really graphic.

303
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,702
John, what has changed?

304
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,455
Why is Nate's death
so different from Ava's?

305
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,538
Why are you asking me?

306
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,935
If you got a problem with the game,
you go talk to that geek, Gary.

307
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,460
He's the one who picked it.

308
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,795
I just made it into a proper experience.

309
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,509
John.

310
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,055
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

311
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,265
No, he's becoming his character.

312
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,683
Consumptive doctor.

313
00:16:56,767 --> 00:17:01,063
What if the longer the game goes on,
the more realistic it becomes?

314
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:04,149
And is anyone else starting
to feel more like their character?

315
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,693
I feel like shooting something,
but that's normal.

316
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,338
Yeah, I wouldn't be able to tell either.

317
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,572
Prima Donna...

318
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:14,451
I do feel extra dramatic
and quite squeamish.

319
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,162
What about you?
Are you hungry, Starving Artist?

320
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:20,290
Turns out seeing my best friend's
dead body is an appetite killer, so...

321
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,542
I'm gonna be sick.

322
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:28,298
All right, well, I am definitely feeling
the loss of my beloved Ava...

323
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,718
If we all are becoming
more like our characters

324
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,512
and Ava was the first one to die, then...

325
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,557
Ava!

326
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,142
No, no, no.

327
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,270
Ava!

328
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,022
Ava? No, no, no. This is wrong.

329
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,108
This is... Damn it, John!

330
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:49,403
This has gone too far.
I'm putting an end to this.

331
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,737
Look, I'm the...

332
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,382
Was Sara about to confess?

333
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,443
- No. She was gonna take out her card.
- That's it.

334
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,677
Everyone, show your card.

335
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,888
- Blank.
- Blank.

336
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,932
- Blank.
- Blank.

337
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,683
Blank.

338
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,275
Is hers blank as well?

339
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,359
No.

340
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,152
It's worse.

341
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,451
I don't think that putting a Band-Aid
on my wound makes us even.

342
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,286
I'm just trying to help.

343
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,331
Oh, now you care
about my well-being.

344
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,041
- I'll be fine.
- You don't look fine.

345
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,335
I mean, you always look fine.

346
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,545
We have a machine that can fix that.

347
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,297
I'm just here for my ship.

348
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,757
Well, your ship's not here.

349
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,634
Then where is it?

350
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,345
I reverse-tracked my pod detector
and it led me here.

351
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,930
That tech should have been on my ship.

352
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,850
But I guess you guys are thieves
as well as deserters.

353
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,162
So what did you do
with the rest of my ship, huh?

354
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,186
It's on Earth.

355
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,481
And funny enough,
we're traveling there now.

356
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,815
We can give you a lift.

357
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,110
But in the meantime,
let us patch that up, hmm?

358
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,663
What happened to her tentacle?

359
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,500
Zaguron stung her.

360
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,461
She had to amputate
to prevent the poison from spreading.

361
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,507
Poor Lefty.

362
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,550
Lefty? The tentacle has a name?

363
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,010
Sure it does.

364
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:38,637
Our tentacles are regenerative,

365
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,040
so they're part of us
but they're also their own creatures.

366
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,642
Kind of like starfish arms
or earthworms.

367
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,979
Uh, she wants to know what you're doing.

368
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,608
Starting up the meat printer.

369
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,485
She'll have a new Lefty in no time.

370
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,122
Oh, that's the time to destination.

371
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,290
Because we printed you a new tentacle.

372
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,394
The jump drive is broken.

373
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:11,354
Why do you think we're
traveling the old-fashioned way?

374
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,184
All fixed. Time to go back to your ship.

375
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,145
Or you could show me
where your mainframe is

376
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,813
and I'll fix your jump drive.

377
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,774
And then we can all get what we want
a hell of a lot quicker.

378
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:33,859
Deal?

379
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,484
Deal.

380
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,158
How did you get off the planet?

381
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,034
I thought you were dead.

382
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,745
- If I...
- If what?

383
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,830
You thought I was alive?

384
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,832
You didn't stick around
long enough to find out.

385
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:52,085
In fact, you bolted
the second you got onto my ship.

386
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,963
Yes, you're right.

387
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,215
I'm sorry.

388
00:20:58,383 --> 00:20:59,384
Oh, wow.

389
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,552
An apology.

390
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,472
That sounded like that took some effort.

391
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,932
You know what else took some effort?

392
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,643
Battling my way through
a Zaguron-infested planet.

393
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,146
You know Zagurons are carrion creatures?

394
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:14,441
They will swarm a dying planet
and pick it to pieces like that.

395
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:16,942
They were relentless,

396
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,571
but I was stronger.

397
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,451
With some time, I finally got
Bishop's habitat airborne again.

398
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,078
Never imagined I'd run into you bozos.

399
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:30,457
As soon as I get my ship back,
I'll be a dozen galaxies away from here

400
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,334
and forget that any of you ever existed.

401
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:35,170
- Kayla, there's something I have to...
- Hey, Mick. Uh...

402
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,632
Can I please get your hand
over here with something?

403
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:44,762
What?

404
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,814
Don't tell Kayla
you're pregnant.

405
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,311
If she finds out, she may perform
the Necrian love grip.

406
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,394
What?

407
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,857
Males in my species
are subservient.

408
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,025
Of course they are.

409
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,903
If she finds that you're an
unfit parent, or she doesn't like you,

410
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:03,156
she could knock you out
and eat your eggy brains.

411
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,078
Please keep an eye on her and...

412
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,208
remember, do not trust her.

413
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,137
All right.

414
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,889
Hunt's on. One of you did this.

415
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,768
What are you gonna do, shoot us all
till one of us is the Beast?

416
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:34,354
How do you even know
one of us is the Beast?

417
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:35,981
What if it was Sara?

418
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,440
Then what killed her?

419
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,652
And if Sara was the Beast,
this game should be over.

420
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,529
What step are we even on anymore?

421
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,701
That's a Gary question, love.
The rules are all bloody rubbish to me.

422
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,828
Maybe you should have learned them
before trapping us in this nightmare.

423
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,206
You think I'm enjoying this, squire?

424
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:56,459
You know, if the Beast doesn't off me,
the bloody TB will.

425
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,355
But you know what? I'm the one that's
gonna get us all out of here, all right?

426
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,379
So, sit back.

427
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:03,507
Next.

428
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:05,635
Deadly nitrate.

429
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:07,679
In you go.

430
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,224
Pulverized whale bone.

431
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:12,683
Mmm.

432
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,979
And just a little booze
to make it all sing.

433
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,402
Bottoms up.

434
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:27,657
Ugh.

435
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,170
- John, are you okay?
- Yeah.

436
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,422
There you go.

437
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,635
I'm fine.

438
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,056
I guess the game won't allow us
to take a shortcut, so...

439
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,350
we just have to play.

440
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,727
- And win.
- And if we lose?

441
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,105
What do you mean "if we lose"?

442
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,107
There are two outcomes to this game.

443
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,569
And one, the humans win
by killing the Beast.

444
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,696
And the other,
the Beast kills all the humans

445
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,156
and the game keeps going.

446
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:11,952
Characters get redealt
and the game goes on and on and on.

447
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:15,830
You mean we could be
trapped in here forever.

448
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:21,962
Time to play offense.

449
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:25,340
If we're all becoming our characters,
then maybe I can use my powers

450
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,884
as a soothsayer
to figure out who the Beast is.

451
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,636
Everyone, circle up.

452
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:40,271
With my power as the oracle,
I demand to know.

453
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,234
Beast, where are you?

454
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,444
Speak through me.

455
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,205
I am here.

456
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,165
I am one of you.

457
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,668
I will win.

458
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:05,130
Your blood will smear the walls.

459
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:07,590
Your screams will fill the air.

460
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,593
Forever here,

461
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,554
forever mine.

462
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,639
Forever!

463
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,770
Oh, to hell with this!

464
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,864
I'm finding another way
out of this dumpster fire.

465
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:34,200
And if any of you all come after me,
I'll blow your head off.

466
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,578
Except you. I trust you.

467
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:39,080
Likewise. Let's go.

468
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:42,666
Wait.

469
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,169
Where are you going?

470
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:46,588
Splitting up is a cardinal
sin to survival.

471
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,381
And creativity!

472
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,054
Let's try this door.

473
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:03,563
Okay, so we're passing
the conservatory now.

474
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,901
- Into the dining room?
- This is exhausting.

475
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,070
All these doors circle back
into the house.

476
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:19,953
Ahem!

477
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,439
- What?
- I'm worried about Astra and Spooner.

478
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,774
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna bring them back here.

479
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:30,900
- Okay.
- Keep an eye on John.

480
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:31,840
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

481
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,261
I mean, keep an eye on him
in a defensive way.

482
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:37,514
- Here.
- You can't be serious.

483
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,766
I'm a starving artist.
I'm nothing but serious.

484
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,078
He can barely walk. I'm more
of a danger to him than he is to me.

485
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,102
Just take it!

486
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,402
Hey. Hey.

487
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,339
It's all right. It's gonna be okay.

488
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,281
I'm sorry I got you into this, love.

489
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,408
Hey, you didn't know
this was gonna happen.

490
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,203
I'm gonna get you some water, okay?

491
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,699
Behrad? Is that you?

492
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:02,849
A kitchen. That's new.

493
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,018
Yes, we could try the back door.

494
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:07,979
Come on, come on!

495
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,149
You've got to be kidding me.

496
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,568
No, no, no.
This cannot be happening!

497
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:15,445
Screw this.

498
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,879
- What happened?
- Don't go in there.

499
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:35,715
Spooner and Astra...

500
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,429
Oh!

501
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,021
Where's John?

502
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:57,946
Spooner and Astra are dead.

503
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,072
I know it was you.

504
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,782
Nice tactic, sunshine.

505
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,784
But I lost track of you
just before the attack.

506
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,953
So did Zari. Didn't you, love?

507
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:07,372
I actually saw Behrad find them.

508
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,749
You saw him find them?
Or you saw him

509
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,602
after he found them,
maybe after he killed them?

510
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:13,086
All of this is your fault.

511
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:15,171
There you go again,
blaming the bloody magic.

512
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:17,048
I'm not blaming the bloody magic,
John.

513
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,549
I'm blaming you for abusing it.

514
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:21,219
You just had to go and show off
your fancy new Fountain powers...

515
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:22,302
Jealous, are we?

516
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,515
Well, add that
to your petulant brattiness...

517
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:28,726
Stop acting like children.

518
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,271
I think he's the Beast.

519
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:33,540
I've been coughing my bloody lungs up
for the last two hours.

520
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,834
How can you still think that
I'm the one that killed our friends?

521
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,653
I'm not saying how you did it.
I'm saying I know you did it.

522
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:39,694
Okay, so let's vote.

523
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,948
- I vote that it's you.
- And I vote it's you.

524
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,159
Don't make me choose between you.

525
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,746
All right. Do you know what?
I will do you both a favor.

526
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,665
I'm gonna go
and lock myself in the attic

527
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:54,836
because clearly I am some unhinged,
egotistical bloody maniac!

528
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,213
John, just...

529
00:29:58,464 --> 00:29:59,464
Thanks.

530
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,906
Gideon, what's with
all the energy usage?

531
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:27,160
The device that Mr. Rory
refers to as the "meat printer"

532
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,579
is drawing a considerable
amount of power.

533
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:49,390
Lefty, no!

534
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,101
What are you printing?

535
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,188
Lefty.

536
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,023
Calm down, Lefty. Don't...

537
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,613
Gideon, is the ship ready to jump?

538
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,948
The jump drive
is fully operational, Mr. Rory.

539
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,158
But there is trouble.

540
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:09,369
Mr. Green is under attack
in the Med Bay.

541
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,245
Attack? By who?

542
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:19,253
Gotcha!

543
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:24,674
What are you doing?

544
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,178
Why are you doing this?

545
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,763
Because you left me.

546
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:30,639
And he got me out.

547
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,517
I owe him.

548
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:34,851
Him?

549
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:53,996
I'm pregnant.

550
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,442
Not the love grip!

551
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:37,415
I don't want to die in here.

552
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:39,500
<i>Maman</i> and <i>Baba</i> will never
know the truth about me.

553
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:40,877
About us.

554
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:42,420
If we get out of here,

555
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,297
- I'm coming clean with them.
- Oh, please.

556
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:47,592
Like you'd ever risk damaging
<i>Maman's</i> view of her...

557
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,636
Oh. Maybe I should tell her how your

558
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,597
magician boyfriend
got you to drink wine.

559
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
You would not.

560
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,933
You're right. I wouldn't.

561
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,561
But how can you not see
what John's doing here?

562
00:32:58,644 --> 00:32:59,562
He told us himself,

563
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:01,707
he filled in the gaps of this illusion
with his own imagination.

564
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:04,066
I mean, this is some
new level of a bad trip.

565
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,651
What is your problem with him?

566
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:08,196
My problem is that he's being a jerk
and you're not seeing it.

567
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,257
Ever since he came back
from the Fountain,

568
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:12,867
he's been acting
like an asshat jock on steroids.

569
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,244
Oh, working out your issues
from high school much?

570
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,872
If by that you mean worrying
about your choice in men,

571
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:18,998
then yeah, I am.

572
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,291
We need to call him out.

573
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,211
He's the Beast. If we vote
to accuse him, we can end this.

574
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:24,295
- I can't.
- Why not?

575
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:25,378
I love him.

576
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,511
I've never heard you say that
about anybody before.

577
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:36,766
Well, I've never felt it.

578
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,937
I can be myself with him,

579
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:43,940
you know, no games,
no pretense.

580
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,485
He makes me happy.

581
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,283
Have you told him how you feel?

582
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,245
No. No, that feels...

583
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:03,000
very scary to be vulnerable to...

584
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,836
to another person like that.

585
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,758
I mean, can it even last, you know?

586
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,009
You know how John is.

587
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:14,427
Yeah, but...

588
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:17,598
You gotta take that leap.

589
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,434
Okay, now you like him again?

590
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:21,936
I never disliked him.

591
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:25,314
I love the guy, but something
is definitely off about him.

592
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:46,502
You can end the game.

593
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:50,339
You know how. You just can't do it.

594
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,092
You won't do it.

595
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,428
I've tried it.

596
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:58,973
By shooting back
some magic potion No. 9?

597
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:00,600
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

598
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:05,605
With every sip, you make
this prison and me stronger.

599
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:09,734
You're not in control
of the magic, John.

600
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,987
It's in control of you.

601
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,823
Just do me a favor, eh, and...

602
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,118
You kill me or piss off,

603
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,661
because I am done playing games.

604
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:22,955
No, you're not.

605
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,167
You love this world.

606
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,544
You love the power.

607
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,339
You love me.

608
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:33,007
Like hell I do.

609
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:41,057
Oh, don't look so surprised, John.

610
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,517
I've always been here.

611
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:46,228
You just never looked me
in the eye before.

612
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,149
You never wanted
to confront the part of you

613
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,151
that sabotaged all your relationships.

614
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,529
Doomed your lovers.

615
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,074
The game made that possible.

616
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,285
It made me possible.

617
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:07,166
Gave me a playground to sow
destruction before your very eyes.

618
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:13,381
Here I am.

619
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:17,134
Fueled by your new addiction

620
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,598
and loving every moment of it.

621
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,059
It's all tricks, lies.

622
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:26,435
I'll kill you, you bastard!

623
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,690
John.

624
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:48,874
Look at me, John.

625
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,585
Or more like look at yourself.

626
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:57,466
This is who you really are.

627
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:16,026
- Sara's the Beast.
- No, there was an actual Beast

628
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,320
who was none of us, somehow...

629
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:21,699
Bloody Gary. You know you can't give
him a lick of responsibility

630
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,117
without him buggering it all up.

631
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,660
Okay, well, let's play again.

632
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:26,912
- No!
- Why?

633
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:28,372
Do you really want to die again?

634
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:30,833
I'm not gonna die this time
because this time I'm gonna win.

635
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,795
Wait. You guys, are we home?

636
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,757
Oh, good,
because I am bloody knackered.

637
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,508
How long were we in that game?

638
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,429
What is that?

639
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,018
Ew.

640
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:05,825
Look.

641
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:07,994
I got it.

642
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,473
So someone
shut down the entire ship?

643
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:11,373
Yeah, and we have to do
a complete reboot

644
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,809
in order to get Gideon back online

645
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,478
so we can figure out
what the hell happened.

646
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:16,128
Where are Mick and Gary?

647
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:17,379
John, have you seen them?

648
00:38:17,463 --> 00:38:18,672
No. No, I haven't.

649
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,443
No, that spell's left me
with the mother of all hangovers.

650
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:22,551
I'll see you guys later.

651
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:26,222
Hey, you want some company?

652
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:29,099
Oh, I'm just gonna chill
back at the house. I'll be all right.

653
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:34,313
Hmm. Well, then I will come over later
and bring you your favorite tea.

654
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:38,484
What's a busted up old codger like me
done to deserve a woman like you?

655
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:39,902
I don't know. Must be magic.

656
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:44,490
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

657
00:38:47,535 --> 00:38:48,815
Are you gonna tell him?

658
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:51,997
- Yeah.
- Good.

659
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,542
Look, Z, I'm sorry.

660
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,937
For everything I said before,
for pinning everything on John.

661
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:59,171
I went into overprotective brother mode.

662
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,465
Hey, I protect you.

663
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:02,789
Not the other way around, okay?

664
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:03,884
You don't worry about me.

665
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:06,303
Besides, have you ever met
someone I can't handle?

666
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,763
- Mom?
- Mmm.

667
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,849
I'd argue she can't handle me, but...

668
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,767
Speaking of Mom,
I'm gonna head back to 2044

669
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:13,185
- and visit her and <i>Baba.</i>
- Oh.

670
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,647
I think it's about time I let them know
what happened to this family heirloom.

671
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,065
You're gonna tell them the truth?

672
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,401
On second thought,

673
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,587
maybe I'll just take it easy
and enjoy <i>Maman's</i> cooking.

674
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:24,572
Yeah, that's a way better idea.

675
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:26,824
Mmm.

676
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,603
Come on.

677
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,273
Get rid of it. Get rid of him.

678
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,845
Ah. Gary, what are you doing?

679
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,432
Where are your glasses, bud?

680
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,729
- It's Mick.
<i>- Dios mio!</i>

681
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:46,861
He's alive.

682
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:48,572
And he has hair.

683
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:02,670
John, there's...

684
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:05,923
something I want to tell you.

685
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:22,106
Whoa.

686
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,274
Hey, there you are. Mick needs help.

687
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:52,512
<i>Space girl, a punk rock treasure</i>

688
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:57,433
<i>Space girl, goodbye forever</i>
