00:00:01,533 --> 00:00:05,971
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,839
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:08,840
by something impossible.

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:09,841
Run, Barry, run!

6
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,811
My father went to prison
for her murder.

7
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:16,748
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,451
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

9
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:22,254
but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

10
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,423
and find others like me.

11
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:27,025
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

12
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,060
Mom!

13
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,194
And get justice for my father.

14
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,496
I am The Flash.

15
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,699
Previously on<i> The Flash...</i>

16
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,335
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

17
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:38,704
Same.
Well, as fast as I can run.

18
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:42,174
Advanced Technology
Operating Mechanism... A.T.O.M.

19
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,442
What are you gonna
use it for?

20
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:44,743
To protect the people
of this city.

21
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:47,045
You think Dr. Wells
killed Barry's mom?

22
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,280
I don't know yet.

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,850
But I do know
that Wells keeps secrets.

24
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,417
The way that
he described running...

25
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,987
feeling the wind
and the power...

26
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,624
it's like he was talking
from experience.

27
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,159
Harrison Wells is
The Reverse-Flash.

28
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,764
Eddie, we need your help.

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,707
Pedal to the metal.

30
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,380
We've got a 10-31 in progress.

31
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:22,648
Shiny Diamond,
18th and Olive.

32
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,982
That's only a few blocks
from here.

33
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,385
Has every crook in Central City
gone crazy?

34
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,353
This is the third attempted
robbery tonight.

35
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,322
Barry.
We got another one.

36
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:36,128
Hello.

37
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,063
18th and Olive.

38
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:39,698
Got it.

39
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,766
Who's this?

40
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:44,469
Oh. Indecent exposure.
Powell Park.

41
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,738
That ain't something
you should be showing people.

42
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,278
They're getting away, guys.

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,746
They're not getting away,
Eddie.

44
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:56,315
Let's get these bozos
up ahead of us first,

45
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,717
and then we'll worry about
the idiots at the Shiny Diamond.

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,718
All right.

47
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,086
We're gonna run out
of room, though.

48
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,755
I'll take care of that.

49
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,258
What do you think
he meant by that?

50
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,397
Oh.
That's what he meant.

51
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,369
I think we lost them.

52
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,971
Oh, no, you didn't.

53
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,475
And by the way,
you're under arrest.

54
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,348
We need to go.
Now. Come on!

55
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,885
Uh-uh.
Freeze.

56
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,020
You guys missing these?

57
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,322
On the ground.
On the ground.

58
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:41,293
So, uh, I'm just curious, but...

59
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,395
have you guys not heard of me,
or what?

60
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,768
Nice work, detective.

61
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,407
- Good night, Dr. Kang.
- Good night.

62
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,962
Oh... ow!

63
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,440
Victim's name is Lindsay Kang,

64
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,343
engineering professor
at Hudson University.

65
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:33,178
- Just got tenure.
- Hey.

66
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,014
So, her whole body's covered in
these puncture wounds

67
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,082
you see on her face.

68
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,617
Bite marks maybe.

69
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,919
Whatever it was, she must have
gone into anaphylaxis.

70
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,387
- Damn.
- Yeah.

71
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,790
The blood sample should tell us
everything we need to know.

72
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,324
I'll run tests
back at my lab.

73
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,460
They can do it faster at
S.T.A.R. Labs.

74
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,329
Well, yeah, but,
I mean, it's just...

75
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,099
It's just what?

76
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:57,002
It's kind of weird being there
right now.

77
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,571
Barry, you know we have to
play it cool with Wells.

78
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,972
If he finds out
we suspect him...

79
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,073
I know.
I get it.

80
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,443
I just think that we should tell
Cisco and Caitlin.

81
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,811
They could help us.

82
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,512
The more people who know,
the more chance

83
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,947
Wells is gonna find out
we're on to him.

84
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,116
I mean, what if one of them
slips up?

85
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,617
Or panics?

86
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,619
- Or what if...
- What?

87
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,621
What if
they're not on our side?

88
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,256
No.
Absolutely not.

89
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,425
They're not involved in
whatever he's planning.

90
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,894
I mean, Wells is their boss,
their mentor.

91
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,463
They've been with him
for a long time.

92
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,531
I've seen plenty of people

93
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,633
make the wrong choice
for loyalty.

94
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:33,305
Please do not include them
until we can be sure.

95
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:34,506
All right.

96
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,516
Death by apitoxin.

97
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,551
Honeybee venom.

98
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:50,222
Bees.
Why did it have to be bees?

99
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,823
Y'all, I don't do bees.

100
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,525
Ain't nobody got time
for bees.

101
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:54,893
But when a honeybee stings,

102
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,162
the stingers are literally
torn from their abdomen,

103
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,563
and they die.

104
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,131
But there were no stingers
in the body

105
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,433
and no dead bees in the car.

106
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,269
A honeybee can only deposit
.1 milligrams of apitoxin

107
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,537
when it releases its stinger.

108
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,838
And yet, Ms. Kang was found

109
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,440
with enough venom in her system

110
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,108
to kill a herd of elephants.

111
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,977
It appears not only is
a meta-human

112
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,881
controlling these bees but also
increasing their toxicity.

113
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,682
Bees communicate
by releasing pheromones.

114
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,384
Maybe this meta's controlling
them through secretion?

115
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,887
Anyone want to join me
in getting a beekeeper suit?

116
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,955
I'm pretty sure
I can outrun a bee.

117
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,657
Just don't run into a lake.

118
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,893
Bees will wait for you
to come up for air

119
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,127
and then they'll sting you.

120
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,195
Discovery Channel.

121
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,498
Turns out there's a lot
to discover.

122
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,467
Felicity,
what are you doing here?

123
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,436
Can you guys come outside
for a sec?

124
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,081
What exactly
are we waiting for, Ms. Smoak?

125
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,184
Up there.

126
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,520
Is that a bird?

127
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,188
It's a plane.

128
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,028
It's my boyfriend.

129
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,166
Hi.

130
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,568
I'm Ray.

131
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:23,315
So he seems
a little tall for you.

132
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,483
Barry Allen, are you jealous?

133
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,786
Je... no.
No, I'm not jealous.

134
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:30,555
I just... I really wish
you would've called

135
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,556
before flying in.

136
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,124
Oh, no, he flew.
I drove.

137
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,861
I'm serious, all right?
Now is not the best time.

138
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:41,333
Why?
What's going on?

139
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:44,369
Ah, well, my ears popped,
so that's something.

140
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,071
You're lucky
you didn't break your neck.

141
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,773
What is it with billionaires
being superheroes?

142
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,209
So have you... picked a name yet?

143
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,379
I'm kind of partial to
The Atom.

144
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,814
Shoo.

145
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,716
You married to that, or...?

146
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:01,052
Your A.T.O.M. suit...

147
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,421
it's quite the technological
achievement, Mr. Palmer.

148
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,390
I'm impressed.

149
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,791
And he is never impressed.

150
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,159
Well, thank you,

151
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,629
but I can't quite seem to
keep it up.

152
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,465
He means the suit.

153
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,899
- Yeah, I mean the suit.
- Yeah.

154
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,568
I can attest that
everything else works just fine.

155
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,669
There's nothing
we need to fix in...

156
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,770
That area.

157
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,538
No, no, no.
The sex is great.

158
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,973
God, there's two of them.

159
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,608
I know from Felicity
that you have been

160
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,176
very helpful with Barry
and the Flash suit,

161
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,546
and I was hoping to get
another set of eyes on my...

162
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,482
- Problem.
- Problem.

163
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,751
Any friend of The Arrow's
is a friend...

164
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,285
- Hell, yes.
- Uh, guys.

165
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,690
We kind of have a lot
going on already.

166
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,492
There's the
meta-human killer

167
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,294
that can control
a whole swarm of bees?

168
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,696
Cool.

169
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,398
I mean, awful.

170
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,901
I'm sure Caitlin and I will
provide ample support, Barry.

171
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,437
And I will be happy to
sit this one out.

172
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,572
You...

173
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,275
Ray, why don't you stay here
and work on your suit

174
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,245
while Barry and I run to
Jitters for some java?

175
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,380
Sounds like a plan.

176
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:05,483
- Coffee?
- Sure.

177
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:18,863
- Hey, Detective.
- Iris.

178
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:19,998
What are you doing here?

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,833
I am following up on my story

180
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,334
about crime in Central City.

181
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,036
Or lack thereof.

182
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,707
Could someone be working
with The Flash?

183
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,341
No.
Of course not.

184
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,643
You caught a flasher,

185
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:32,877
armed robbers
in a getaway car,

186
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,580
and two jewelry thieves
last night.

187
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,016
I'm just that good.

188
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,085
What is going on with you
lately?

189
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,188
You've been acting
really weird and withdrawn.

190
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,923
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think that

191
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,458
you were hiding something
from me.

192
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,761
Iris, I'm... I'm not hiding
anything from you.

193
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,070
Do you ever go to work?

194
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,472
Oh, you're funny.

195
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,745
Okay, I can't keep lying to Iris
about The Flash.

196
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,580
You have to.

197
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:12,250
It's really starting
to affect our relationship.

198
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,320
We haven't had sex
in two weeks.

199
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,988
Which you didn't want
to know about.

200
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,792
Keeping her in the dark
keeps her safe.

201
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:21,993
I don't agree.

202
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:22,994
Well, I'm her father.

203
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,229
And I'm her boyfriend.

204
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,898
When does my vote
outweigh yours?

205
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,134
When you become her husband.

206
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,843
You know I left Starling City

207
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,311
to get away from
the mood and brood,

208
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,615
but it looks like
it followed me here.

209
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,849
I know.
I'm sorry.

210
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,818
It's like I said before,

211
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,987
now is not the best time.

212
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,489
Barry, I have been through
enough with you

213
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,858
to know when you're
holding something back.

214
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,360
Is this because I told Ray
your secret?

215
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,162
Because he is trustworthy,
Barry.

216
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,897
He wants to help people,
just like you.

217
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,698
I know, that's not what
I'm worried about.

218
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,433
It's...

219
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,337
I really don't want to
put anyone else in danger.

220
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,141
In danger of what?

221
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,342
Barry, hey.

222
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,744
Eddie, hey.

223
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,245
- You remember Felicity.
- Of course.

224
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,513
- Hey.
- Great to see you.

225
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,849
Yeah.

226
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,284
What is wrong with you?

227
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,386
Is everyone in Central City
in a bad mood?

228
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,721
I thought Central City was
supposed to be the fun one.

229
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:27,225
It's, um...

230
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,794
- It's not...
- Felicity knows.

231
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,995
- Wow.
- Yeah.

232
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,597
So everyone but Iris.

233
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,165
It feels that way.

234
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,100
How do you lie to
everyone you care about?

235
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,769
For starters,

236
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,137
don't think of it as lying.

237
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,673
Think of it as protecting her
from getting hurt...

238
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,074
with a fib.

239
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,643
But Iris can tell
I'm hiding something,

240
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,213
and it's putting
this distance between us.

241
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,948
I have an idea.

242
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,916
Why don't we all
go to dinner tonight?

243
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:55,286
A little wine and dine
is sure to bridge the gap.

244
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,988
Come on, we all had fun
last time.

245
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,058
Sure.
Why not?

246
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,293
Barry Allen, fifth wheel.

247
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,596
Well, I can't make
my 3:00 meeting this afternoon.

248
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:07,131
Also, confirm my dinner
reservation for tonight.

249
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,399
Last time,
they couldn't find it,

250
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,735
and that was unacceptable.
Thanks.

251
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,707
You see that bad man
over there?

252
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,878
Tell your sisters it's time.

253
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,648
So you put solid oxide
fuel cells into the belt?

254
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,516
Yeah, it's the only place
to hide the hardware.

255
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,987
Hmm, well, they should be
generating enough energy

256
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,488
to power the suit.

257
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,156
It could be
the operating temperature.

258
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,225
I mean, you're essentially...

259
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,427
Overheating the system, yeah.
I figured.

260
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:41,633
But if we insulate them
with a ceramic compound...

261
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:44,035
We may improve
the operating efficiency.

262
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,373
You really are quite clever,
Cisco.

263
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:52,477
Some would say I'm the reverse.

264
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,747
You're incredibly clever,
Cisco.

265
00:11:58,785 --> 00:11:59,984
How do you turn
this thing on?

266
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,224
Cisco?
You okay?

267
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,458
Yeah.

268
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,395
I haven't been getting
enough sleep, so...

269
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:12,997
Cisco, we need you up here.

270
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,172
Killer bees are at it again.

271
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,675
Get a hold of Barry.

272
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,577
Another bee attack.
Folston Tech.

273
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,879
I'll see where Joe is.

274
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,048
- <i>Bee</i> careful.
- For real?

275
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,052
Bad pun. Sorry.
Just don't die.

276
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,768
I'm too late.

277
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,370
Where are the bees?

278
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,472
I don't know.
There's no sign of them.

279
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,019
Found them.

280
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,856
How do I get out of here?

281
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,157
Take the northeast crossway.

282
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,560
It's the quickest way
out of the building.

283
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,732
Guys, they're everywhere.
I'm surrounded.

284
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,747
Barry!

285
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,086
Barry.

286
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,488
He's going into cardiac arrest.

287
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,425
Barry, stay with me.

288
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,637
Cisco!
Barry doesn't have a pulse.

289
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,706
- Step away from him.
- What? Why?

290
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,740
We need to jumpstart his heart.

291
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,575
There's a defibrillator
in the suit.

292
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,248
Charge it to 360 joules.

293
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,051
Charging in three, two, one.

294
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:19,323
Hit him again.
400 joules.

295
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,759
Charging in three, two, one.

296
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,698
Barry.

297
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:33,805
Joe.

298
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,912
That is it for
the defibrillator.

299
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,081
It is completely fried.

300
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,816
You're lucky to be alive,
Mr. Allen.

301
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:47,652
I was very specific
that you not die.

302
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,487
Yeah, that's a pretty big thing
for her.

303
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,923
Cisco, what happened out there?

304
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,724
I followed your directions
exactly.

305
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,861
I'm sorry.
I led you the wrong way.

306
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,831
The schematics that we had,
they... they weren't up to date.

307
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,732
What, they weren't up to date?

308
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,567
What do you mean?

309
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,235
That's never happened before.

310
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,237
What, you think Cisco
was trying to get you killed?

311
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,039
No.
Why would he do that?

312
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,240
That doesn't make any sense.

313
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,976
I know.
That's why I was joking.

314
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,579
Barry, it's our job
to protect you, and today,

315
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,414
we failed, but that'll just
serve as a warning

316
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,883
for all of us to be
more vigilant in the future.

317
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,252
Good news... the apitoxin
is out of your body.

318
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,887
Your levels are
back to normal.

319
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,889
Terrific.

320
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:27,692
Ray, Felicity.
We're gonna be late for dinner.

321
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,228
Are you sure that's wise,
Barry?

322
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,395
You just died.

323
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:33,297
Maybe you should
order in tonight.

324
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,499
Yeah, we could
totally cancel.

325
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:37,101
I'm fine.
Alive. Hungry.

326
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,470
All right?
Let's go.

327
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,542
- That was weird.
- Yeah.

328
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,177
Why didn't we get
invited to dinner?

329
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,255
Oh.
Thank you.

330
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,357
Hey, guys.

331
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,125
Wow, Iris.
Check you out.

332
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,326
Hi, Felicity.

333
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:03,594
- Hello.
- Hi.

334
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:06,097
Hey.
Guys, this is Ray Palmer.

335
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,465
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

336
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,533
- Lovely to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

337
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,834
- Nice to meet you.
- Barry.

338
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:11,636
<i>Bienvenue chez
Massimo Restaurant.</i>

339
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,771
Mr. Palmer,
your table is ready.

340
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:14,972
Great.
Shall we?

341
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,209
Yes.

342
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,444
Hey, how did he get
a reservation here?

343
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,046
We've been trying for months.

344
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,349
I don't know.

345
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,585
Here's your table, sir.

346
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,722
I thought it'd be nice
if it was quiet,

347
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:36,794
so I bought out
the entire restaurant.

348
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:37,929
Too much?

349
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,630
Just a tad, sweetie.

350
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,271
Joe.

351
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,941
Oh, Cisco.
Hey.

352
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,742
You just saved me a trip
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

353
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,378
I got some info
on our second victim.

354
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,846
Name's Bill Carlisle.

355
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,415
He was recently hired
at Folston Tech

356
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,750
to beef up
their robotics division.

357
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,452
Robotics?

358
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,921
That's just like
the first victim.

359
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:07,291
Wow.
That is weird.

360
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,596
That's not why
you stopped by.

361
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:15,766
No, I wanted to talk to you
about Barry.

362
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,301
Okay.

363
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,110
Is there something
going on with him?

364
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,278
Something he's not
telling us?

365
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,546
What do you mean?

366
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:33,451
He hasn't really been
himself lately.

367
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:34,919
Not that I'm aware of.

368
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:38,990
It's like something is just
really bothering him.

369
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:43,194
Well, I think he's got
his mind trained on

370
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,662
catching the bad guys, Cisco.

371
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:48,766
And he's probably worried about

372
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:52,069
when The Reverse-Flash is gonna
show his face again.

373
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,039
Oh, I'm not like The Flash
at all.

374
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,711
Some would say I'm the reverse.

375
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,716
Hey.
You okay?

376
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,918
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

377
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,222
It's just... I've got
this crazy headache.

378
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:13,958
Thank you for the file
and the talk.

379
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,435
- So how did you two meet?
- Work.

380
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,137
Well, actually,
I bought the company

381
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,539
where Felicity was employed,
and so she was forced

382
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,740
to join me at Palmer Tech.

383
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,376
It's not as creepy
as it sounds.

384
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:35,046
So you two work closely
together?

385
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,614
- Mm-hmm.
- Interesting.

386
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,382
I guess you guys share
all of your thoughts

387
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,485
and feelings and...

388
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,922
Yeah... I share everything
with Felicity.

389
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,993
It's nice that you guys have
that level of communication.

390
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,830
Oh, well, no,
not every-everything.

391
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:56,767
I mean, sometimes it's good
to just shut up.

392
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:58,903
I get that.

393
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,205
Some things are better left
unspoken.

394
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,406
Really?

395
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,842
I-I don't find that
to be true.

396
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,046
Oh, thank God.
It's the food.

397
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:10,715
Food's here.

398
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,417
Our first course
on the tasting menu

399
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,853
is a quail egg frittata.

400
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:16,821
Bon appetit.

401
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,089
Barry.

402
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:19,523
I got to admit, I envy you

403
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,858
spending so much time
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

404
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,461
Harrison Wells is, like,
a personal hero of mine.

405
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,829
I mean, it's amazing just
to actually

406
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,130
be in the same room with him.

407
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,039
I'll be right back.
Just excuse me.

408
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,040
Okay.

409
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:45,950
Well, I, um...

410
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,151
have to pee.

411
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,726
Okay, you've been acting
super strange

412
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,128
ever since Ray and I
got to Central City.

413
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,496
What is going on with you?

414
00:19:58,498 --> 00:19:59,897
And don't say
it's a bad time.

415
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,932
Oliver might be joining
the League of Assassins,

416
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,434
Laurel's the Black Canary, and
Thea's training with Malcolm,

417
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,736
so I know about bad times.

418
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,304
Okay.

419
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:18,382
Joe and I found out that
Wells isn't who he says he is.

420
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,619
He...

421
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:25,623
He is the man
that killed my mother.

422
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,758
Oh, my God.
But he's been helping you.

423
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,360
Get faster, stronger.
I know.

424
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,628
- Why?
- I don't know.

425
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,862
I don't know anything anymore,

426
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:34,565
especially who I can
and can't trust.

427
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,134
So you think Cisco and Caitlin
are helping him?

428
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,602
That's impossible.

429
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,970
- Is it?
- Yes.

430
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,605
They were trying to
save you today, Barry.

431
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,107
- They did save you.
- Wells has also saved me.

432
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,241
Many times.

433
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,378
I thought that Wells was
a great man,

434
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,548
and I was so wrong about him.

435
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,583
What if I'm wrong
about everything else too?

436
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,586
Hey, guys.

437
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,655
Uh, things are getting
a little intense in here.

438
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:03,127
Please can't we just have
a nice evening?

439
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:07,798
Okay, so it's my fault that
we're not having a nice evening?

440
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,034
I am your girlfriend.
Who you live with.

441
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:13,037
I shouldn't have to beg you
to talk to me.

442
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,973
If I could talk to you
about this, I would, believe me.

443
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,576
But I can't.

444
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:21,545
You know what?
I am not hungry anymore.

445
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,847
- Iris.
- You know what?

446
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,081
When you are ready
to act like

447
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,983
we are two people
who love each other,

448
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,117
call me.

449
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,419
I'll be at my dad's.

450
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,328
Thank you for dinner.
I've got to go.

451
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,433
Uh, emergency at
S.T.A.R. Labs.

452
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,269
- Go.
- Sorry.

453
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,608
Well, only 17 more courses
to go.

454
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:56,180
Containment breach.
Foreign object detected.

455
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,584
Did I get it?

456
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:02,219
I think I got it.

457
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,321
Where is he?

458
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,399
Thank you.

459
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,334
Let's see what makes this bee
so poisonous.

460
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:20,104
You saved my life.

461
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:28,412
That is one odd-looking bee.

462
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,948
That's 'cause it isn't a bee
at all.

463
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,318
It's a robot.

464
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,320
No way.

465
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,818
Unbelievable.

466
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,255
This bot's got a 360-degree
vision system.

467
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:14,258
I mean, we're talking
multiple micro-cameras

468
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,461
all coming from various angles
at the same time.

469
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:18,796
Which means...

470
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,230
It can see all around
the room at once.

471
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,231
That is...

472
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,666
Amazing.

473
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,635
Disturbing.

474
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:26,737
It's also next-gen hardware
that's nowhere near the market.

475
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,639
So we're not dealing with
a meta-human?

476
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:29,974
It's just a mad scientist.

477
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:31,675
Cisco, you said
the second victim,

478
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,177
Bill Carlisle,
was a robotics engineer.

479
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,279
Let's cross-reference
his previous employers

480
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:36,280
with those of Lindsay Kang.

481
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:37,781
Allow me.

482
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,284
Mama's been away from
a keyboard for far too long.

483
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:41,785
Okay.

484
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:47,124
They both worked
at Mercury Labs.

485
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,525
Let's call Joe.

486
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:51,261
I think it's time we paid
a visit to an old friend.

487
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,100
Twice in one year, Harrison.

488
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,570
You really are vying for
comeback scientist of the year.

489
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,305
Always a pleasure, Christina.

490
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,272
To what do I owe this visit?

491
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,341
Did you finally find
my tachyon prototype,

492
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,477
or are you here to
blackmail me for another one?

493
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:08,212
Do you have another one?

494
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,914
We came here for information.

495
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,117
Bill Carlisle and Lindsay Kang.

496
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,788
Former employees who were
recently murdered.

497
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,157
My God.
I wasn't aware.

498
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,895
Stung to death
by robotic bees.

499
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,730
You're looking
for Brie Larvan.

500
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,032
Brie Larvan?

501
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:30,000
A quite brilliant roboticist
who once developed

502
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:33,003
miniature mechanical bees
for agricultural use.

503
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,405
Kang and Carlisle warned me

504
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:36,807
that Brie was weaponizing
the bees for military use,

505
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,342
so I terminated her.

506
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:42,146
Well, it seems that you would be
on her hit list too, Doctor.

507
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,314
You've got to let us
keep you safe.

508
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:46,884
I'm all too familiar

509
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:49,753
with your inability
to protect things, Harrison.

510
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:52,423
I can take care of myself.

511
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:56,527
Good day, gentlemen.

512
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,062
Thank you.

513
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,771
Hey.

514
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:09,873
Okay, so we found
our queen bee.

515
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,909
Brie Larvan.
She's a roboticist.

516
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,777
Joe is running a trace
on her current location,

517
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:14,978
but so far nothing.

518
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,180
Good.

519
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,414
Where is Ray?

520
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,550
Oh, he's working on his suit
with Cisco.

521
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:20,784
I like Ray.

522
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,886
He seems like
he's a really good guy.

523
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,355
He is a good guy.

524
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,957
Just like Cisco.

525
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,560
And Caitlin.
Girl.

526
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:35,966
Is that why you called me here?

527
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:38,001
I know that you're in
a tricky situation,

528
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,770
but that's when you need
your friends to have your back.

529
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,139
And how can they
if you won't let them?

530
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,741
It's not that simple.

531
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:47,111
What if Joe is right, and
I tell them, and it backfires?

532
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,279
Wells isn't just their boss,
Felicity.

533
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,316
He is their mentor,
their hero.

534
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:55,652
My hero.

535
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,589
Look, it's...

536
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:01,225
I don't know what to do.

537
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,864
When I first met Oliver,

538
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,398
before I knew he was The Arrow,

539
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,668
he would... he would ask me
to do weird things for him

540
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,771
like decrypt
a bullet-ridden computer

541
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,106
or hack some company.

542
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,841
And when I would ask him why,

543
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:20,677
he would come up
these ridiculous excuses.

544
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,114
And I always knew he was lying,
but I would help him anyway.

545
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,749
- You know why?
- Hmm?

546
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:30,487
Because I knew Oliver was
a good person with a good heart.

547
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:33,657
And Cisco and Caitlin?

548
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,859
They're no different.

549
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,307
Hey.

550
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,009
Hey.

551
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,180
So you're really
staying here tonight?

552
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:58,048
Tonight.
Tomorrow night.

553
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,817
The night after that.

554
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:05,889
Do you think that
Eddie is cheating on me?

555
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,128
No.
Eddie's not that kind of guy.

556
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,563
Well, then
I don't know what else

557
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:14,031
he could be hiding from me.

558
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,368
Iris...

559
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:23,073
Remember when we were kids,

560
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:26,777
and Joe would come home
from work

561
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:30,480
with that blank expression
on his face?

562
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,382
Yeah.

563
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,051
The "Earth to Joe" look.

564
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,252
How could I forget?

565
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,887
I never understood that look

566
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:41,592
until I started
working for the CCPD.

567
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:45,796
Showing up at crime scenes and
seeing someone murdered...

568
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:49,333
it can be ugly work.

569
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:51,068
And I'm lucky.

570
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,003
I get to hide behind
the science of it

571
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,838
and just stay in my lab,

572
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,607
but Eddie,

573
00:27:56,609 --> 00:28:02,145
he's out there every day
in the darkness.

574
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,082
I just... I think that maybe

575
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,818
if he doesn't want to talk
to you about his work,

576
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,788
it's probably because he wants
to keep you in the light.

577
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,393
What?

578
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:22,900
I'm just surprised.

579
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,401
You going out of your way
like this

580
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,870
to help me see
Eddie's point of view.

581
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:30,240
I mean...

582
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:33,377
Eddie makes you happy.

583
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:37,547
All I ever want is
for you to be happy, Iris.

584
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,288
Welcome home.

585
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,731
It is so fun to watch
grown men play with their toys.

586
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,832
You're so lucky.

587
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,469
Ray is so nice and smart
and hot.

588
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,505
Yeah, it's kind of like
I'm dating Barry

589
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:04,074
but in Oliver's body.

590
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,743
A sentence you will
never repeat to anyone.

591
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,945
Your secret's safe with me.

592
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,381
It must have re-activated.

593
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,216
And if it's being
controlled wirelessly...

594
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,318
I can trace its signal
and figure out

595
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,953
where it's trying to go.

596
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:21,358
- Oh, no.
- Oh, boy.

597
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,359
What?

598
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:25,829
The swarm is headed for
Mercury Labs.

599
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,632
Brie Larvan's going after Tina.

600
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:42,479
Hello, Dr. McGee.

601
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:46,216
You gonna open the window,
or should I buzz myself in?

602
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,860
How do we stop them?

603
00:29:56,862 --> 00:29:58,729
She's got to be
remotely piloting

604
00:29:58,731 --> 00:29:59,997
those bees from somewhere.

605
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,566
We need to stop this bug-eyed
glasses woman.

606
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,735
And her mini bandits.

607
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:06,403
Bug-Eyed Bandit.

608
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:08,105
Got her. She's in
an abandoned greenhouse.

609
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:09,439
Barry, you have to
take out Brie.

610
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,907
It's the only way to stop
these nanodrones.

611
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,242
What about Dr. McGee?

612
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:14,077
The defibrillator
in your suit is broken.

613
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,848
You cannot risk going near
Mercury Labs.

614
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,051
Bees can't penetrate my suit.

615
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,320
- I'll go.
- Whoa.

616
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,555
We haven't tested out
the new power system yet.

617
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,257
We'll do it now.

618
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,459
- I'm following you.
- I'm driving.

619
00:30:29,461 --> 00:30:30,827
And I'm kissing you.

620
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,331
Dr. Wells...

621
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,567
Mr. Palmer will protect Tina.
Go.

622
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,219
You fired me,
destroyed years of my research.

623
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,255
You took everything from me.

624
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:00,557
What you were doing was wrong.

625
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,760
You wanted to harm people,
not help them.

626
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,629
I did what I had to do.

627
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:07,731
You mean ruin my life?

628
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,032
Sure.

629
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,101
Now I'm doing what I have to do.

630
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,143
Found her.

631
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,578
Felicity, can you jam
their frequency?

632
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,947
I already tried, but I might
be able to redirect them

633
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,248
onto a new target.

634
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,983
Ray, get ready for incoming.

635
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,752
We have the technology.

636
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:00,684
It's over, Brie.

637
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,886
I know you're trying to
kill Dr. McGee.

638
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,288
You think that she betrayed you.

639
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,791
I can imagine how that feels.

640
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:11,428
You think you understand
the sting of betrayal?

641
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,132
I'll show you what it means
to be stung.

642
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,745
Barry.

643
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,324
Barry, I hacked into
the bees' frequency.

644
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:44,661
I'm controlling them.

645
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,696
I'm the queen of this hive.

646
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,265
Oh, she's good.

647
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:49,900
She's like my nemesis.

648
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:52,302
I've never had a nemesis before.
I kind of like it.

649
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,507
Okay, Cisco.
Now what?

650
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,176
Ray, get to the ocean.

651
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:00,177
If the bots follow
you into the water,

652
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:01,745
their electronics will fry.

653
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,046
Got it.

654
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,915
Wait.
But so will my suit.

655
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,199
Cisco, I'm fried.
I'm losing propulsion control.

656
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,037
Can you see the van?

657
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,206
Yeah.

658
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,340
We'll catch you.

659
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,943
- You will?
- We will?

660
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:35,278
We will.

661
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,780
All right.

662
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:41,051
Keep it steady!

663
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:50,060
- Whoo!
- The Atom lives.

664
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:53,930
Oh.

665
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:57,567
Let's work on some softer gloves
for next time, okay?

666
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,536
Sorry.

667
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,906
Oh, you want to bring it?

668
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,774
It's been brought.

669
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:07,444
Rude.

670
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,312
Felicity, right now

671
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:12,549
would be a good time
to do something.

672
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,918
Stay away from Barry Allen.

673
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:20,156
- Felicity!
- Got it.

674
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,497
Boom.
Drop the mic.

675
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:28,698
It's metaphorical, of course,

676
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,668
because I don't have
a real mic.

677
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:36,940
Brie's restrained.

678
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,675
Call CCPD.

679
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,114
Ah.
Some kind of team you have here.

680
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:47,350
Helps to have friends
in your corner.

681
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:06,936
Are you okay?

682
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,638
Cisco!

683
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,176
Come on.
Please.

684
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,711
Wake up.

685
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,513
Cisco's been stung.
He's going into shock.

686
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:18,181
I'm on my way.

687
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:20,050
Come on, stay with me.

688
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,357
Hold on.
Back up.

689
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,992
I'm gonna try something.

690
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,104
Cisco.

691
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:50,447
Either my fear of bees is over
or it just got a lot worse.

692
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,382
Thank God you're okay.

693
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,684
I've never had anybody
take a bee for me.

694
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:57,420
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, bro.

695
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:00,924
Cisco, you're a hero, man.

696
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,439
- Dr. McGee.
- May I come in?

697
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,342
Yeah, of course.
What can I do for you?

698
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,411
I wanted to apologize.

699
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:24,047
I should have listened to you
when you warned me about Brie.

700
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:27,684
Perhaps next time I will take
the CCPD's offer of protection.

701
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,086
After we lost
your tachyon prototype,

702
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:35,058
I can understand why
you were hesitant to trust us.

703
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,626
Thank you.

704
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:40,163
Can I ask you something?

705
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:44,267
I couldn't help but notice
some tension

706
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:47,404
between you and Dr. Wells.

707
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:49,506
That's all in the past.

708
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:54,077
Do you mind if I ask
what happened between you two?

709
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,681
I ask myself that same question
all the time.

710
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,384
15 years ago, Harrison and I
were thick as thieves.

711
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,086
We were promising
young scientists

712
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,688
in Starling City.

713
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,891
He was such a kind man.

714
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,360
Then everything changed
after Tess died.

715
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:11,995
They were gonna get married?

716
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,297
I understand how grief
can affect someone,

717
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,532
but this was more than that.

718
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:18,802
It was like, after that day,

719
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:23,306
Harrison Wells became
a completely different person.

720
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:24,841
Good day.

721
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:27,911
Bye.

722
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,413
Doctor.

723
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,183
How's Cisco?

724
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:34,784
Happy to be alive.

725
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:38,755
And sad that Ray is leaving.

726
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:43,393
It was a really brave thing
he did, risking his life.

727
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:44,661
Selfless.

728
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:47,464
Yeah.
It definitely was.

729
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:57,006
And another end to
another exciting adventure

730
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,208
in Central City.

731
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,409
Ah, yes, thank you.

732
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:02,479
Ray, thank you
for all your help.

733
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:03,713
- Oh.
- And I hope you

734
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,114
figure out the problem
with your suit.

735
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,583
- I already have, actually.
- Oh.

736
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:08,017
All this time,
I've been looking at

737
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,419
the power source
the wrong way.

738
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,887
I kept thinking
we needed to go bigger.

739
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:13,423
But the solution, as always,

740
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:16,226
is simply to go smaller.

741
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:18,094
Oh.
Great.

742
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:21,731
You okay?

743
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,900
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna be.

744
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,602
Thank you for your advice.

745
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:30,273
I won't even charge you
the 5¢.

746
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:32,408
Bye, Felicity.

747
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,043
Bye, Barry.

748
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,590
Hey.

749
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:51,294
What's up?

750
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,196
I, um...

751
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:56,032
I spoke to Barry last night.

752
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,066
Oh, yeah?

753
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,434
He was trying to help me
understand

754
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,837
why you've been so off lately,

755
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,641
why you might be having trouble
connecting with me.

756
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,143
Really?

757
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,611
What did he say?

758
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:11,147
It was a good explanation.

759
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:13,983
Valid.

760
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:16,653
But the truth is,
it doesn't matter,

761
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,521
because when
you love someone,

762
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,157
you tell them everything.

763
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,725
So if you love me, Eddie,

764
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:26,162
you'll tell me what is going on
with you, or...

765
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:28,965
Or what?

766
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,300
You know what.

767
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:05,268
All right, all right,
who's ready for some...

768
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,071
♪ Karaoke ♪

769
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,408
We are not

770
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,211
going to karaoke, are we?

771
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:18,081
No.

772
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:22,418
This is everything we know
about my mother's murder

773
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,954
and The Reverse-Flash.

774
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:30,059
I've been gathering information
on him for a long time.

775
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:34,797
And this is everything we know
about Dr. Wells.

776
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,672
I don't understand.

777
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:45,441
What do Dr. Wells
and The Reverse-Flash

778
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,343
have to do with each other?

779
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:48,878
Um...

780
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,883
They're the same person.

781
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:56,085
That's impossible.

782
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,220
Look, Caitlin,

783
00:40:57,222 --> 00:41:01,491
it took me a long time
to believe it too,

784
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:03,626
but it's him.

785
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,596
Dr. Wells is a speedster?

786
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,164
He's paralyzed.

787
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:10,400
Is he, though?

788
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:14,137
And why would he kill
Barry's mother?

789
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:19,108
It doesn't make any sense.

790
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,111
Cisco.
Say something.

791
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:28,151
I've been having these dreams.

792
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:33,089
Mostly at night,
but sometimes during the day.

793
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,791
But they don't really feel
like dreams.

794
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:39,262
They... they feel real.

795
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,001
What happens in the dream?

796
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,704
Dr. Wells is The Reverse-Flash.

797
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:52,642
And...

798
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,844
he kills me.

799
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,736
Greg, move your head.
