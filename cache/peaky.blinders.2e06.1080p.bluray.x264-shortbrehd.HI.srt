All right?

156
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,726
Now, when I came in here, Mr Summons,

157
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,009
I stopped to tie my shoelace.
Isn't that a fact?

158
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,081
Ollie?

159
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,807
I stopped to tie my shoelace.

160
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,245
And while I was doing it,

161
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,721
I laid a hand grenade
on one of your barrels,

162
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,921
Mark 15, with wired trip.

163
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,403
And my friend upstairs...

164
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,247
Well, he's like one of those anarchists
that blew up Wall Street, you know?

165
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,651
He's a professional.

166
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,650
And he's in charge of the wire.

167
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,922
If I don't walk out that door
on the stroke of 7:00,

168
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,128
he's going to trigger the grenade and...

169
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,206
...your very combustible rum
will blow us all to hell.

170
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,724
And I don't care...

171
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,924
...'cause I'm already dead.

172
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,925
He tied his lace, Alfie.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,571
- And there is a kid at the door.
-From a good family, too.

174
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,085
Ollie, it's shocking what they become...

175
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,128
What were you doing when this happened?

176
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,210
He tied his lace, nothing else.

177
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,611
Yeah, but what were you doing?

178
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,805
I was marking the runners in the paper.

179
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,361
What are you doing?

180
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,921
Just checking the time. Carry on.

181
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,727
Right, Ollie, I want you to go outside,
yeah, and shoot that boy in the face

182
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,325
from the good family, all right?

183
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,722
Anyone walks through that door
except me, he blows the grenade.

184
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,926
- He tied his fucking lace...
-I did tie my lace.

185
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,286
I bet, 100 to 1,

186
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,487
you're fucking lying, mate.
That's my money.

187
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,801
Well, see, you've failed
to consider the form.

188
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,130
I did blow up me own pub...

189
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,483
...for the insurance.
-(SIGHS HEAVILY)

190
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,481
ALFIE: OK right...
Well, considering the form,

191
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,764
I would say 65 to 1. Very good odds.

192
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,968
And I would be more than happy
and agree

193
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,486
if you were to sign over
65% of your business to me.

194
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,530
- Thank you.
-Sixty-five? No deal.

195
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,409
- Ollie, what do you say?
- Jesus Christ, Alfie.

196
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,369
He tied his fucking lace, I saw him!

197
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,011
- Mmm-hmm.
-He planted a grenade, I know he did.

198

The chalk mark on the barrel,

It's a Hamilton Christmas.

209
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,642
I took out the pin
and put it on the wire.

-Oh, fuck off, Tommy.

That's far too little.

215
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,045
In France, Mr Solomons,
while I was a tunneller, a clay-kicker.

217
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,410
I blew up Schwaben Höhe.

Same kit I'm using today.

It's funny, that.

220
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,368
I do know the 179.

221
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,487
And I heard they all got buried.

222
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,644
Three of us dug ourselves out.

223
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,768

get me out of that?

I need you today, brother.

So Arthur's back in charge now?

He's in charge of you,

Well, the boys decided you're no longer
like a Sergeant Major.

and using those fancy words.

these days.

That's all right.
Today, you won't get lifted.

00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,286
Because today, there will be
no coppers around to lift you.

295
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,649
At exactly 3:00, there will be
an incident in the owners' enclosure

00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,326
and all the coppers on the track
will be diverted. All of them.

- So you will be free to operate at will.
-Looking for who?

Me. They will be looking for me.

you will make your move
on Sabini's pitches.

You will confiscate his takings,
you'll destroy his licences,

303
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,440
and you do it at gunpoint.

304
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,330
He usually has police protection,
so they won't be armed.

00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,086
We should aim to complete the takeover
without a shot being fired, understood?

00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,563
And remember, the licences are
more important than the takings.
