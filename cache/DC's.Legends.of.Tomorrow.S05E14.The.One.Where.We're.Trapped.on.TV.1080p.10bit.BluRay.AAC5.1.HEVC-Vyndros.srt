Man, some days, rewriting history

4
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,591
to eradicate any notion of rebellion
and free will is hard.

5
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,843
Yeah.

6
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,096
You ever wondered
if what we're doing is, like, wrong?

7
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,598
How could it be wrong?

8
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,852
The Fates give everyone food, shelter,
and television.

9

You don't want a world that looks like
these history books, do you?

Right. The Fates be praised.

Hey, Behrad. Did you remember
the grey mush like I asked?

00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:10,440
I got the green mush, the purple mush,
the sticky mush, the slimy mush...

Mmm. Sounds dumb.

why would I stop crime with this?

Please tell me you guys recognize him.

- No.
- Sorry, sis.

- You think this is another TV show?
-[Nate] Right.

155
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,651
We were from a hilarious
yet heartfelt sitcom,

156
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,488
but now, we're stuck on
some stuffy BBC period piece.

[sighs]

158
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,330
With no obvious way to escape.

159
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,962
Well, it seems like the TV show
is adapting to our presence.

160
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,840
So, I think we just have to play along
until I can get John to snap out of it.

161
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,010
Okay, it looks like
we're some kind of aristocrats.

Mmm. That must make you our servant.

164
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,223
[laughs]

165
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,190
Wouldn't you prefer wearing something
a tad more cheerful, dearest?

166
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,735
I would, if the prospect of your
matchmaking was worthy of cheer.

167
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,530
Lord Behrad is your father's
closest male heir.

168
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,575
A marriage to him keeps Highcastle Abbey
in our family.

169
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,371
Well.., how is he, Mr. Constantine?

170
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,833
Lord Behrad is, as advertised,
a foreigner.

171
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,711
- Not you, too.
- Hmm.

172
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,802
Lord and Lady Tarazi, may I present

173
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,764
Lady Natalie and her daughter,
Lady Astra.

174
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,479
I do beg your pardon, Lord Tarazi,

175
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,774
but is it customary where you come from
for the valet to sit?

176
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,859
[snaps fingers]
"Oh!

177
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,277
[clears throat] Oy!

178
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,572
[in British accent]
A thousand apologies.., bro.

179
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,659
Mr. Constantine, why don't you show

180
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,869
the Tarazis' valet
to the servant's hall?

181
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,704
Happily, my lady.

182
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,628
Please have a seat.
You must be exhausted from your travels.

183
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,924
I'm so glad we could find the time
to get to know one another.

184
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,050
Yes.

185
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,679
Before we marry
and you inherit our family's estate.

186
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,056
[chuckles awkwardly]

187
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,684
I'm sorry, did you say "marry"?

188
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,435
I have to go to the bathroom.

189
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,980
To the lavatory.

190
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,232
Don't leave me.

191
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,196
Do you enjoy hunting, Lord Behrad?

192
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:41,284
Oh... I like to play among the animals,
not slaughter them.

193
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,997
Well.., that is
an unconventional opinion.

194
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,502
In this household,
servants should be seen and not heard

195
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,379
in the company of their superiors.

196
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,423
Which means we should all be silent
around you.

197
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,632
Is that right, Mr. Constantine?

198
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,843
Mrs. Hutchins, trying to
hold your tongue would be as easy

199
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,137
as swimming through custard
in Wellington boots.

200
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,930
There you are, John.

201
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,893
I do beg your pardon, Lady Zari,
but this is most irregular.

202
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,936
Right, I need to talk to you.

203
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,313
Alone.

204
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,565
They got the blue mush. Fancy kind.

205
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,983
Yum.

206
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,401
[clears throat]

207
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,073
- How may I assist you, my lady?
- All right, listen to me.

208
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,368
You are not some buttoned-up butler.

209
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:28,414
You are a cynical, chain-smoking,
master of the occult.

210
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,667
You have an apprentice named Gary,
and you are capable of great--

211
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,502
[snarls]

212
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,632
Magic.

213
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,175
Did she just say "Gary" now?

214
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,512
Maybe that crazy guy
isn't so crazy after all.

215
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,226
Can I confide in you, Lord Behrad?

216
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,437
Confide away.

217
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,315
Sometimes, I wish I'd been born a man.

218
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,525
At least then,
I'd have a chance at adventure.

219
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:00,112
Your parents can't hold you here.
You're a diva.

220
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,031
What is a diva?

221
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,576
A diva is a female version of a hustler.

222
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,414
Okay, let me get this straight.

223
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,751
You don't remember me or the Legends,
but you can still cast spells?

224
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,381
To my great shame,
I am at war with myself.

225
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,384
Part of me is...

226
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,388
seduced by dark magic.

227
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,639
That's the real you.

228
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,600
Are you going to inform Lady Natalie?

229
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,726
Yeah, maybe we should.

230
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,855
Please, don't. I beg you.
You see, I'd be sacked.

231
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,900
You know what?

232
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,028
If you cast one of your spells
and help us escape this world,

233
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,905
we will keep quiet.

234
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,075
- Maybe.
- We will.

235
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,790
Gary, I think people are trapped
on the TV, and they know us.

236
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,167
- You sound crazy.
- You were onto something.

237
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,628
The world's all wrong
and the cracks are starting to show.

238

that you intend to go.</i>

241
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,640
Can you send us to someone?

242
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,308
We need to find our captain.

243
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,104
What is your captain's name?

244
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,606
Sara. Captain Sara Lance.

245
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,652
The Jack of Wands.

246
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,947
Daring exploits and dangerous challenges
lay ahead.

247
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,450
- Great.
- I do hope this works.

248
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,452
I shall be glad to be rid of you.

249
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,164
Actually, John,
we really need you to come with us.

250
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,792
Amusing joke, my lady,
but I will never desert my post.

251
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,086
I tried to stop her.

252
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,256
Mr. Constantine,
I have made the most wonderful decision.

253
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,674
I'm moving to London.

254
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,344
London? What about Highcastle?

255
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,679
And your mother?

256
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,557
I am a diva.

257
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,975
My bad.

258
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,521
Everyone who wants to leave, link up.

259
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,148
Where are we going?

260
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,067
Lady Astra, I beg you, please step away.

261
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,236
To live a life that I love, I must know
the world outside these walls.

262
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,280
Lady Astra, I must insist.

263
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,201
Where did they go?

264
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,036
Did she say "Captain Lance"?

Officer Maala, report.

268
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,470
It's a Gromulan Warship, Captains.

269

Hail them, Officer Maala.

270
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,267
Or wouldn't it be more logical

271
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,437
to attack the warship
before it attacks us?

272
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,524
By that logic, we would attack
every ship we encountered.

273
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,193
Is there something wrong with that?

274
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,488
Fine, Officer Maala.

275
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,865
- Hail the Gromulans.
- Yes, Captain.

You are our crew.

May I interest you

No. It makes perfect sense.

339
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,964
We encounter this sort of thing
all the time.

340
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,300
You're probably our crew
from an alternate timeline

341
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,802
and you've been trapped
in some sort of...

late and early 20th century
prison dimension,

344
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,768
which calls the question

345
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,937
if we ourselves are existing
in a prison dimension.

346
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,482
It's perfectly logical.

script-writing algorithm.

It sounds like being stuck

and suddenly remembering two different
timelines is very confusing.

Maybe I can try to help.

but why are you doing this, Clotho?

478
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:40,390

there are consequences to disobedience.

Mr. Parker, I know
you're trying to help, but you just--

489

<i>Than feel as awful as this</i>

490
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,183
Yeah, you're definitely not Mr. Parker.

491
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,278
Where did you send them?

492
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,406
I just pulled the plug
on this crossover, silly.

493
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,283
You all have to go home now.

I am so sorry.
I thought I was tackling Mr. Parker.

505
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,411
What kind of mush are we having tonight?

506
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,913
The "you gotta go" kind, come on.

[studio audience laughing]

After all that,
we're right back where we started.

the Buds break free!

511

John.

513
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,891
- We need to go back.
- Yeah, sure, love.

514
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,560
Why don't you really listen to her,

515
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,729
construction worker John?

516
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,983
I wanna see my mother.

517
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,993
You think your mother
will suddenly have all of her memories?

518
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,246
What if Natalie is just a character
on a TV show, love?

519
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,499

My love.

What's all this?

538
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,563
Do you remember anything?
About your life before Highcastle Abbey?

539

I...

540
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,863
London? Magic?

I love you, Mom.

Oh...

00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:41,506
I love you too, you goose.

547
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,718
You come upstairs and change for dinner.

548
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,269
Astra, listen to me.

549
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,812
I know what you're gonna say.

550
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,981
She's not real.

551
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,483
We can stay.

552
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,570
What?

553
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,405
What are you playing at?

554
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,865
It's no trick, love.

555
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,872
Astra, look at me.

556
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,709
What have I got to show for myself?

557
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,462
Thirty-eight crap years of pain
and broken promises.

558
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,840
You wanna know what my original sin was?

559
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,594
It was you.

560
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,929
Astra,

561
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,849
I rail against the angels and the demons
for being arrogant bastards,

562
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,894
but I'm worse than
the bloody lot of them.

563
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,855
And I thought that
I could use your innocent soul

564
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,690
as a bargaining chip
to save your mother.

565
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:41,733
Bollocks.

566
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,445
If you're happy here,

567
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,572
then I will spend an eternity

568
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:51,701
as ruddy Mr. Constantine
trying to make it up

569
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,495
to you and Natalie.

570
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:59,501
Is John Constantine really capable
of such a selfless act?

571
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,461
[chuckles softly]

572
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:11,596
Would it be acceptable to dine
at half past 7:00, Lady Astra?

573
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,557
Mrs. Hutchins is running a trifle late.

574
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,646
Perfectly acceptable, Mr. Constantine.

575
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,535
That's one show back on track.

576
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,703
My algorithm should take care
of the rest.

577
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,040
But I don't understand.

578
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,418
Why are real people trapped on TV?

579
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,756
The Legends, they're my friends.

580
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,300
And my sisters wanted them dead.

581
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,387
So... I made a deal.

582
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,557
Weave the Legends
into our streaming service,

583
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,810
where they help indoctrinate
the masses and...

584
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,854
they could live.

585
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,272
Huh.

586
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,732
I always thought of you
as the punk rock Fate.

587
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,986
- I didn't have a choice!
-[Mona] Nobody does here.

588
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,447
But that's how it starts,
and then you get used to it.

589
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,241
Obeying, I mean.

590
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,334
Come on, we have to escape.

591
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,170
What's our course, Captains?

592
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,672
Sara, wait. Let's think about this.

593
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,425
What's there to think about?
We have to get back to the real world.

594
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,719
I know, okay? Just...

595
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,387
In the real world, I saw you die.

596
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,847
Okay? And it...

597
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,391
It was awful.

598
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,977
And I just keep playing it
over and over again in my head, okay?

599
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,355
So... Look, out there, we lost.

600
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,192
But in here, we always win, Sara.

601
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,403
Look... You're right.

602
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,530
Okay? And that's why
Charlie did all this.

603
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:57,118
A crew that can't die,
us beating the bad guys every time,

604
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:59,329
it's what we asked for
back there in the pub.

605
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,667
But it doesn't exist.

606
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:10,256
Ava, life is beautiful and terrible

607
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,717
all at the same time.

608
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,470
But if we're only living part of it...

609
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,723
then we're not living at all.

610
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,648
Let's get the hell out of here.

611
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,901
Captains, I'm picking up
a strange transmission.

612
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,070
It's from your old enemy, Don.

613
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,073
<i>Captain Lance.</i>

614
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,407
<i>Captain Sharpe.</i>

615
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,035
<i>Old friends.</i>

616
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,246
- He looks kinda hot.
- Ugh. Mom.

617
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,748
- What? I'm not dead.
- That's gross.

618
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,417
So, that's where Rory's been?

619
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,005
<i>It was foolish to think
you could escape my wrath.</i>

620
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,676
Don's charging his torpedoes.
Should I raise the shields?

621
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,429
Hey... You said
that we always win, right?

622
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,808
What if the only way
to get Charlie to set us free is...

623
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,686
We have to lose.

624
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,355
What is she on about?

625
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,190
<i>You left me!</i>

626
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,735
<i>You left her at the center
of a dead planet!</i>

627
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,404
Yeah, just get to the revenge part.

628
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,905
<i>As you wish.</i>

629
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,534
[Dressing button]

630
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,997
Torpedoes incoming.
Should I take evasive maneuvers?

631
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,040
Negative, Officer Maala.

632
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,212
What if real people die
in the TV, Clotho?

633
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,922
You have to save them.

634
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,559
Torpedo impact in five,

635
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:50,315
four, three, two.., one!

636
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,657
No!

637
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,826
- What just happened?
- Did they die?

638
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,373
What did you do?

639
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,253
I canceled their show.

640
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,173
<i>[Mick] You idiots!</i>

641
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,841
Have you any idea what you've done?

642
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,760
I loved Star Trip and my hair.

643
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,846
- Wait, where are we?
- And where are the others?

644
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,436
Darling.

645
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,189
But before we go in for dinner,

646
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,858
just open one present.

647
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,655
What's this?

648
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,283
I overheard you talking
to Lord Behrad earlier.

649
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,202
It's a ticket to London.

650
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,038
I don't understand.

651
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:52,502
I couldn't bear it if you sacrificed
your happiness for my own.

652
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,424
But.., what about Highcastle Abbey?

653
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:02,178
Please... Don't make me do this.
I can't say goodbye to you.

654
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,304
Darling...

655
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,015
I'll always be here.

656
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,811
But you have your whole life
ahead of you.

657
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,188
Be courageous, my love.

658
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,816
Live it well.

659
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,906
Mr. Constantine.

660
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,991
Your ladyship.

661
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,040
Is Lady Astra really leaving Highcastle?

662
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,006
Do I have to say it?

663
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,467
Say what, my lady?

664
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,386
You smug bastard.

665
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,347
We can't stay here.

666
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,521
Nat would be proud.

667
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:58,734
Do it fast before I change my mind.

668
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,245
[speaking foreign language]

669
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,540
John, you made it.

670
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,043
Yeah, just about. What about the others?

671
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,753
Come on, Z.

672
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:21,424
You didn't live in a totem for a year
just to get stuck on a TV show.

673
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,886
I can't go back to eating mush again.

674
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,804
Not even blue mush.

675
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,014
[studio audience] Ooh!

676
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,352
Yeah, because no one should eat mush.

677
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,396
[studio audience] Ooh!

678
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,441
It's horrible.

679
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,986
And all the colors are deeply unnatural.

680
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:45,656
And it has the texture of wet cement.

681
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,202
<i>[Nate] But, Z,</i>

682
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,455
<i>the Fates said we all have to eat mush.</i>

683
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,831
<i>You know what, Nate?</i>

684
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,958
Screw the Fates.

685
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,752
[studio audience] Ooh!

686
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,674
Those imbeciles can't do this.

687
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,801
They'll inspire an insurrection.

688
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,971
- They're gonna get themselves canceled.
- They're gonna get themselves canceled.

689
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,266
For too long,
we've let the Fates rule our lives!

690
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,603
I happen to like mush,
but that's not the point!

691
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,815
Stop being so obedient.

692
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:23,444
Get off your couches
and take control of your lives.

693
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,283
[cheering]

694
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,037
So good to see you.

695
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,626
So nice to see you.

696
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,713
So, hey, that was
pretty crazy back there.

697
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,632
We were, like, engaged.

698
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,801
It's a good thing
we're not brainwashed anymore.

699
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,305
Great. Out of the TV show,
still in heels.

700
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,100
[Charlie over loudspeaker] You morons!

701
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,435
<i>You just couldn't leave it alone,
could you?</i>

702
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,521
I gave you everything that you wanted.

703
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,314
<i>You stuck us on TV!</i>

704
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,276
I brought Sara and Behrad back to life.

705
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,696
Mick, I made you a criminal again!
It's just like you wanted!

706
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:09,574
I even gave Astra
a happy childhood for you, John-o.

707
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,410
Yeah, bollocks. You just used us
to keep people under control.

708
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,328
<i>[Charlie]
It's better that, than you lot dead.</i>

709
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,832
I still have your life threads.

710
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,835
I can put the shows back on air,
I'll do rewrites.

711
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:26,007
Behrad, you want the old Zari back?
I can do that. Look.

712
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,855
Behrad, is that really you?

713
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,440
You're alive.

714
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,611
- What's happening?
- Yeah, it's like a Zari clone.

715
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,862
I totally get it.

716
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,866
Oh.

717
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,201
Wait, what? Two sisters?

718
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,872
Yeah, this is weird.

719
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,458
Good weird.

720
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,959
[speaking foreign language]

721
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:03,044
It's really you.

722
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,342
Charlie, you can't bribe us
into taking the blue pill.

723
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,553
I'm not bribing, I'm begging.
My sisters will kill you.

724
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:13,804
That's for sure.

725
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,681
Yeah, well, we'll take our chances.

726
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,434
Lita's out there somewhere.

727
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,727
I'm not staying here.

728
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:21,771
Let's get out of here.

729
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,564
Yeah, so long, Charlie.

730
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,650
Wait, just accept your fates.

731
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,235
Don't walk out that door.

732
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,238
On the other hand...

733
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,657
Why not?

734
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,795
They're free!

735
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,255
Then I can't help them anymore.

736
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,554
<i>They're the ultimate buds</i>

737
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,557
<i>They're Tarazis and Nate
Terrific mates</i>

738
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,643
<i>Keep watching because</i>

739
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,270
<i>They've got an ultimatum</i>

740
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,898
<i>And they'll follow it verbatim</i>

741
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,317
<i>They're the ultimate buds</i>

742
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,403
<i>And they're fated to have some fun</i>
