﻿1
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:54,167
The beginning is the end.

2
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:58,125
And the end is the beginning.

3
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:02,378
Everything is connected.

4
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:06,838
The future,

5
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:08,955
the past

6
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,210
and the present.

7
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:16,585
I couldn't tell her who her mother was.

8
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:25,713
Just as I can't tell you
what your provision is.

9
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:30,553
And what I have to do today.

10
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:36,255
I have thought about this
moment for many years.

11
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:40,378
My older self wanted
to tell me something.

12
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:42,963
But he couldn't.

13
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:52,418
If you knew what I know now,

14
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:56,289
you wouldn't do what you must,

15
00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:58,447
which enables me to get to this moment.

16
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,707
I can't exist in the here and now

17
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:06,167
if you don't go exactly
the same way that I did.

18
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,335
We're never free

19
00:03:13,838 --> 00:03:15,458
in what we do,

20
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:20,127
because our will isn't free either.

21
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,590
Everything is prepared.

22
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,053
You must go now.

23
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:36,133
June 27, 2020

24
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:40,093
The day of the Apocalypse

25
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,263
Federal Republic of Germany passport

26
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:09,052
My future self tried to shut the hole.

27
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:12,052
To reverse it all.

28
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:17,835
The passage was closed,
but the cycle wasn't broken.

29
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,532
But you said that

30
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:23,234
we could change one factor
of the equation so that he...

31
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,300
So I'd be successful the next time.

32
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,592
Then none of this sick
shit will ever happen.

33
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:35,013
Mikkel won't vanish.

34
00:06:36,338 --> 00:06:38,048
Michael won't hang himself.

35
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,295
Your father won't die.

36
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:59,632
The big things and the little
things don't follow the same rules.

37
00:06:59,713 --> 00:07:02,463
We won't be able to change
the grand scheme of things...

38
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:09,342
but the details.

39
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:15,458
We change a grain of sand,

40
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:20,337
and with that, the whole world.

41
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:30,342
What was Grandma like?

42
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:32,458
I mean, as a mother.

43
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:36,045
Why would that suddenly
be so interesting?

44
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,210
She isn't dead, you know?

45
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:43,877
Meaning what?

46
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:46,088
She was here.

47
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:48,088
Last fall.

48
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:51,463
After Mikkel disappeared.

49
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:55,295
She...

50
00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:58,383
She left this for you.

51
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:02,878
Here.

52
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:19,922
She said that she was sorry.

53
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:24,842
And that if she could turn back time...

54
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:29,383
she'd change the way things happened.

55
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,380
I'll come back.

56
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:52,625
I promise.

57
00:08:56,505 --> 00:08:58,335
Where are you going now?

58
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:21,922
Do you know what this is?

59
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:29,213
It's a search warrant
for the nuclear plant.

60
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:33,212
The plant has special conditions.

61
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:36,207
The judge issued
the warrant immediately.

62
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,090
I believe,

63
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:40,242
given the situation,

64
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:42,902
he may be interested in
what there is to find there.

65
00:09:43,755 --> 00:09:46,415
Because of the
investigation against you.

66
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:54,053
Warrant

67
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:59,212
I might not be able to prove
that my brother was murdered,

68
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:04,337
but I will get you for
what's happening here.

69
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,383
You must get me out.

70
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,053
There's no way.

71
00:10:16,797 --> 00:10:18,457
This is happening.

72
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:22,958
You cannot let him onto the site!

73
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:26,302
Maybe it's better this way.

74
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,050
Maybe it's good if
everything's out in the open.

75
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:53,795
Martha, I didn't want any
of this. Please believe me.

76
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,800
- But listen to me now.
- What are you doing here?

77
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,170
Come in.

78
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:01,383
Why are you here?

79
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:05,298
What do you want?

80
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,010
You have to come with me, please.

81
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:12,263
- It's my fault everyone here is doomed.
- What?

82
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,048
Everything here will
explode in a few hours.

83
00:11:15,672 --> 00:11:19,842
Everything will start over again.
The future will start, a new cycle.

84
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:21,382
What are you saying?

85
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,590
Believe me, please.

86
00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:32,803
You just have to trust me.

87
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:51,298
This isn't right.

88
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,422
We aren't right.

89
00:11:57,422 --> 00:11:58,962
Please leave.

90
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:03,263
No.

91
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:10,458
- I can't let you go this time.
- You're hurting me.

92
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:13,547
I saw you die once. I
won't let that happen again.

93
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:17,553
- Let me go.
- I can't do that.

94
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:25,835
I promised you I'd make it right.

95
00:12:25,922 --> 00:12:27,592
And I will.

96
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:36,802
Six hours to the Apocalypse

97
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:46,757
Where's the machine?

98
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,010
Where is the damn machine?

99
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:54,383
My mother has it.

100
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:59,168
That's not right.

101
00:13:00,838 --> 00:13:02,668
That's not how it should happen.

102
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,300
This is all my fault.

103
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:08,795
Why didn't he tell me what to do?

104
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:11,127
Why did he tell me all this?

105
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:15,755
He tells me how it works, then
he doesn't tell me what to do?

106
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,802
It could be you did exactly
what he wanted you to.

107
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:25,455
To show us how it works. That
could've been your only job.

108
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:28,547
Fuck.

109
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:31,295
Fuck.

110
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:35,302
- Where are you going?
- To find the fucking machine!

111
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:45,092
Hello?

112
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:53,757
Jonas?

113
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,010
Jonas?

114
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:06,415
Follow the signal

115
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:16,258
What is this?

116
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:17,838
The passage.

117
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:22,553
- We are reopening it.
- But you said you wanted to shut it.

118
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,547
In the future.

119
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:27,212
Or the past, your future.

120
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,673
It took me a long time to accept

121
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:35,915
that I had to help start the
disaster I wanted to avert.

122
00:15:36,713 --> 00:15:39,303
- How do you know all this?
- The past 12 months.

123
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:44,673
You taught me everything,
about the future and the past.

124
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:49,382
Everything that has happened.
Everything that will happen.

125
00:15:51,505 --> 00:15:52,875
There are two parties.

126
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:56,002
Adam and Sic Mundus want a new world.

127
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:58,029
You and I want to save this one.

128
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:01,757
Who is Adam?

129
00:16:57,297 --> 00:17:00,377
- What is this?
- This is the only area that's safe.

130
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:05,008
Please don't, Martha.

131
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,338
Please.

132
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:08,632
Why are you doing this?

133
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:12,167
Because I know what will happen today.

134
00:17:16,505 --> 00:17:18,045
About Mikkel...

135
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:21,548
Did you mean it?

136
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:32,915
That means...

137
00:17:35,797 --> 00:17:37,507
I didn't want any of this, Martha.

138
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,838
You kept me alive.

139
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:42,457
I'm still here 'cause of you.

140
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:47,417
Jonas will come back. Everything
will happen as it always has.

141
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:51,588
But I can't stop hoping that
I can still change things.

142
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:52,882
I have to try.

143
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:56,133
Jonas comes back.

144
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:01,755
Promise me you won't leave
this bunker for anything.

145
00:18:02,713 --> 00:18:04,263
No matter what.

146
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,668
I'm so sorry.

147
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:48,173
Police

148
00:18:54,255 --> 00:18:56,125
Missing

149
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:02,133
Charlotte. I thought
you were still sick.

150
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:04,383
- Is Clausen here?
- No.

151
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:05,926
Clausen had Aleksander arrested

152
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:08,237
and got a search warrant for the plant.

153
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:10,172
He's on his way there.

154
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:12,092
Charlotte.

155
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,508
I... have something to tell you.

156
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:35,843
At the... nuclear facility...

157
00:19:37,338 --> 00:19:39,918
Aleksander buried
something in the concrete.

158
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,843
Radioactive waste.

159
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:47,012
And I helped him.

160
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,960
I'm sorry.

161
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:52,915
That's the cause.

162
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:55,262
- What?
- It's all connected.

163
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:58,548
He said it has to do with
something in that facility.

164
00:19:59,172 --> 00:20:01,512
- Jonas knew that.
- Jonas was found?

165
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,588
No, he traveled here from the future.

166
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:06,505
We have to go!

167
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:10,168
Wöller!

168
00:20:11,088 --> 00:20:12,258
Come on!

169
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,375
For Charlotte

170
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:20,213
Damn it, Charlotte, where
are you? Is Franziska with you?

171
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:22,257
Call me when you get this.

172
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:44,337
We are leaving.

173
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:46,262
To go where?

174
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:49,045
I don't think I'm...

175
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,710
certain what to believe.

176
00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:52,837
But he said

177
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:55,512
only those in the...

178
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,008
the bunker...

179
00:20:58,338 --> 00:20:59,628
will survive.

180
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:06,085
What about Mom and Franziska?

181
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:12,838
It will all be okay.

182
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,920
Four hours until the Apocalypse

183
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:28,005
I don't quite
understand what you're hoping for.

184
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:29,798
The site is huge

185
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,550
and tomorrow there's
the controlled shut down.

186
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,170
My mother always said

187
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:36,363
just because a task is daunting

188
00:21:36,388 --> 00:21:38,779
doesn't mean you can't deal with it.

189
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:42,048
What's behind this door?

190
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,460
The, um...

191
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:45,957
the cooking bank of the old reactor.

192
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,012
It hasn't been used since the '90s.

193
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,008
I'm going to have a look.

194
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,170
You can't open the door
to have a look. Radiation.

195
00:21:56,963 --> 00:22:00,843
And, honestly, I don't think you'd
find anything in there anyway.

196
00:22:26,172 --> 00:22:28,802
Photo album Michael

197
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:13,795
Just after high school graduation

198
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:18,585
Katharina.

199
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:28,342
How do you work this machine?

200
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:36,415
Where did you get it?

201
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:41,463
How can Mikkel come back home?

202
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,512
Even if I told you, it can't happen.

203
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:48,716
You don't want him to come back.

204
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:51,116
Then you wouldn't even have been born.

205
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:53,092
I wish it was that simple.

206
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:57,303
But things in the past
just can't be changed.

207
00:23:57,922 --> 00:24:00,882
Mikkel can't come back
because I already exist.

208
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:04,087
Mikkel belongs here. You don't.

209
00:24:04,547 --> 00:24:06,547
You shouldn't exist at all.

210
00:24:07,963 --> 00:24:09,263
Yeah.

211
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:14,458
I'd give my life for
his if I only could.

212
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:18,263
But I can't, damn it! Because
my future already exists.

213
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:23,052
Just like you won't be
able to bring Mikkel back.

214
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,302
So why did you decide to come?

215
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:30,668
Well, I thought I could
prevent the origin.

216
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:33,592
It's beyond our control.

217
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:35,963
Adam is the endpoint.

218
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:39,755
I might not be able to prevent
myself from becoming what he is.

219
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:43,092
But what's become of me, I can stop.

220
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,758
I know that I've been lied to.

221
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:13,380
You never saved anyone.

222
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:15,513
None of them.

223
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:23,088
We can't escape our fate, none of us.

224
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Neither you nor I.

225
00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:34,125
You're not waging war against God.

226
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:38,128
You're waging it against humankind.

227
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,710
Here are the last pages.

228
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:47,665
You used me.

229
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:50,843
Had me do what you wanted.

230
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,923
But now I know what I have to do.

231
00:25:57,588 --> 00:25:59,128
Claudia was right.

232
00:26:00,088 --> 00:26:02,708
You still don't understand
how this game is played.

233
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:07,917
What are you waiting for?

234
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,920
It's time who plays this game with us.

235
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:20,045
You think it's your destiny to kill me,

236
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,040
but that's not your fate,

237
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:25,364
just as it isn't mine
to die here and now.

238
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,550
Only when we've freed ourselves
of emotion can we be truly free.

239
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,590
Only when you're willing to
sacrifice what you hold dearest.

240
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:45,303
Charlotte is your daughter.

241
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:48,085
She is Elisabeth's daughter

242
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:50,258
and her mother.

243
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:56,633
There is no man without guilt.

244
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,760
None of them have earned
a place in your paradise.

245
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,420
Agnes.

246
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:20,463
This knot

247
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:22,257
can only be undone

248
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:26,258
by destroying it completely.

249
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,420
We cannot

250
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:33,673
escape our fate.

251
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:52,383
- What's happening?
- This is time.

252
00:28:56,588 --> 00:28:58,918
We connect past and future.

253
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:52,205
What is that?

254
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,590
It's Jonas. He's reopened the passage.

255
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,418
It's that thing that
Mikkel went through?

256
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:00,213
Yes.

257
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,300
Martha.

258
00:30:21,838 --> 00:30:23,418
Is everything all right?

259
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,295
Who locked you in here?

260
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:29,418
Martha, wait, wait, wait! You
can't go out there! Martha!

261
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,760
- What was that?
- Fuck.

262
00:30:42,838 --> 00:30:45,918
It was the same noise. Like the cave.

263
00:30:46,005 --> 00:30:47,875
Fuck. You got the device?

264
00:30:48,922 --> 00:30:50,882
It's not up there now.

265
00:30:50,963 --> 00:30:53,303
And Mom's gone too. Martha as well.

266
00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:58,213
Do you think she's with him?

267
00:30:58,297 --> 00:30:59,457
With Jonas?

268
00:31:00,713 --> 00:31:03,513
Noah was right. He was
right about everything.

269
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:08,008
I'm telling you guys, Jonas
is the reason for this shit.

270
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,625
Where are we going?

271
00:31:34,797 --> 00:31:37,917
Bring the machine to the
bunker, near Helge's cabin.

272
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:40,917
You don't have much time.

273
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:43,505
And you?

274
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:49,553
I have my mother to find.

275
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:51,633
And Martha.

276
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:57,213
Jonas!

277
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:08,422
Two hours until the Apocalypse

278
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:11,455
Hey, Martha, call me back.

279
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,800
They're both not answering.

280
00:32:26,672 --> 00:32:29,012
My father. He's with
Elisabeth in the bunker.

281
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:32,508
- He wants me to go there.
- To the bunker?

282
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,260
Shit.

283
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:37,462
Something's going on.

284
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:40,338
I'm going.

285
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,010
If they're not home in half
an hour we'll go join your dad.

286
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,840
Where are Mom and Franziska?

287
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:03,798
I have no idea.

288
00:33:07,963 --> 00:33:10,923
So this Noah guy says he's your father

289
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:13,625
and he's from the
future... or, no, the past.

290
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:17,463
And he says the apocalypse
starts in Winden today?

291
00:33:17,547 --> 00:33:21,167
And you think this is all connected
to the containers in there?

292
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:52,545
- What is that?
- The cooling pool of the old reactor.

293
00:33:53,088 --> 00:33:56,508
Apparently it's been sealed off
and become part of the greenfield.

294
00:33:56,588 --> 00:33:57,668
When?

295
00:33:58,338 --> 00:33:59,758
That, um...

296
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:04,205
I don't exactly know, but
that's nothing unusual.

297
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:06,459
Sealing off the old reactor is a...

298
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:08,781
It's the start of the dismantling.

299
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,590
I want you to break it open.

300
00:34:13,005 --> 00:34:14,005
Really?

301
00:34:15,172 --> 00:34:16,172
Yes.

302
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:20,257
You can't keep him another night.

303
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:23,458
He hasn't done anything.
This is all nonsense.

304
00:34:29,255 --> 00:34:31,455
When can Aleksander be visited?

305
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,550
I understand.

306
00:34:42,172 --> 00:34:43,512
Regina.

307
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,260
Please don't be scared.

308
00:35:07,463 --> 00:35:08,963
It really is me.

309
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:22,092
I am so sorry.

310
00:35:24,338 --> 00:35:26,458
I didn't mean to just leave like that.

311
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:29,627
I'll explain.

312
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,920
But now you have to come with me.

313
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:46,628
Regina.

314
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:50,917
I'm so sorry.

315
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:22,128
Noah.

316
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,340
You look different now.

317
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:28,547
You know, I mean, since last time.

318
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,670
He sent you, didn't he?

319
00:36:32,672 --> 00:36:33,672
Adam.

320
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:37,457
I've always wondered
when you turn into him.

321
00:36:37,547 --> 00:36:39,207
I won't.

322
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,667
I will never do the things he did.

323
00:36:43,297 --> 00:36:45,417
He said you'd say that kind of thing.

324
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,958
He also said we'd be friends.

325
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,630
Before I'm betrayed.

326
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:58,797
Why do you follow him?

327
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:01,295
What made you follow her?

328
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:03,755
Claudia.

329
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,510
We both want to believe.

330
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:10,008
We fasten ourselves to the
salvation that's promised.

331
00:37:13,422 --> 00:37:14,712
If you kill him...

332
00:37:18,338 --> 00:37:20,628
you kill all hope of salvation.

333
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:24,133
He is the savior.

334
00:37:29,088 --> 00:37:30,628
You'll be the savior.

335
00:37:40,297 --> 00:37:41,957
What is that?

336
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:43,417
Read it.

337
00:37:44,213 --> 00:37:45,673
It's from Martha.

338
00:38:05,963 --> 00:38:07,843
This can't be real.

339
00:38:08,672 --> 00:38:10,512
You must save her.

340
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:13,212
Bartosz, Magnus

341
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:15,263
and Franziska.

342
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:18,087
And later, me and Agnes.

343
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:23,458
This circuit has to be finished
for the next cycle to begin.

344
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,710
Just as the prophecy foretells.

345
00:38:27,588 --> 00:38:29,508
And so that Martha can live.

346
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:36,763
No, this isn't right.

347
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,670
Martha.

348
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,130
Regina.

349
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:49,837
That's you.

350
00:40:53,672 --> 00:40:55,342
You are Claudia.

351
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:18,132
Follow the signal

352
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,880
Your colleague's in the old reactor.

353
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:25,633
Mom?

354
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:33,088
Jonas?

355
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:49,548
You're back.

356
00:42:53,047 --> 00:42:54,587
You're really back.

357
00:42:58,797 --> 00:43:00,457
I was looking for you.

358
00:43:03,338 --> 00:43:06,668
- I'm here to tell you...
- I know it... all.

359
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:11,085
When we were standing in the
rain, I know why you said that.

360
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,552
Mikkel...

361
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,260
I know everything.

362
00:43:16,713 --> 00:43:18,593
At the lake, that was you.

363
00:43:48,338 --> 00:43:50,548
You and I are perfect for each other.

364
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:52,705
Never believe anything else.

365
00:44:17,172 --> 00:44:19,512
And so the circle is closed.

366
00:44:22,172 --> 00:44:23,632
Jonas, who is that?

367
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,800
Tell her who I am.

368
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,755
I told you all the game's
pieces are in position already.

369
00:44:39,547 --> 00:44:41,797
All that's needed is a little push.

370
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,550
You keep lying!

371
00:44:45,005 --> 00:44:47,455
You wanted it all the exact same way.

372
00:44:47,547 --> 00:44:49,377
You're the trigger!

373
00:44:49,463 --> 00:44:51,423
The trigger is in us all.

374
00:44:52,297 --> 00:44:54,087
Each and every one of us.

375
00:44:55,047 --> 00:44:56,757
Why do you want this?

376
00:44:57,588 --> 00:45:00,508
Why do you want the
awful future repeated?

377
00:45:01,588 --> 00:45:03,958
What is created today

378
00:45:04,047 --> 00:45:05,667
will begin the end.

379
00:45:06,713 --> 00:45:09,513
The dark matter must be created

380
00:45:09,588 --> 00:45:13,048
so that I can lead it to
its destiny in the future.

381
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:15,382
The end of this world.

382
00:45:18,255 --> 00:45:20,005
And I am the trigger,

383
00:45:22,213 --> 00:45:24,463
just not for what you think.

384
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:30,710
I am the trigger for...

385
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:33,338
only what will make you

386
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:35,758
what I am today.

387
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:57,710
You'll be all right. You'll
be all right. You'll be all right.

388
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,842
Some pain you can't forget.

389
00:46:00,922 --> 00:46:02,842
Mar...

390
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,758
- You'll carry this pain all your life.
- Look at me! Look at me!

391
00:46:09,797 --> 00:46:12,417
Until you are finally ready

392
00:46:13,755 --> 00:46:15,125
to let go.

393
00:46:19,797 --> 00:46:20,797
Of her.

394
00:46:31,713 --> 00:46:33,093
You can stop me.

395
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:37,758
Or you can try to save her.

396
00:46:45,505 --> 00:46:47,415
You'll know what you have to do.

397
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:56,423
Please don't leave.

398
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,010
Martha.

399
00:47:00,047 --> 00:47:02,047
Please.

400
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:05,208
Please don't go.

401
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:20,585
Don't open that! Stop.

402
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,280
Don't open that!

403
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:24,145
This is a hazard.

404
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:27,008
No, Mrs. Doppler. This is our elephant.

405
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:29,798
You have no idea what
this all really is.

406
00:47:30,588 --> 00:47:33,918
- What is all this, then?
- It's not about the missing people.

407
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:37,045
This is about the future,
how it's connected,

408
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,010
connected to all of our pasts.

409
00:47:41,297 --> 00:47:42,507
- Open it.
- No!

410
00:47:42,532 --> 00:47:45,452
- Open it!
- Please don't. No! It's a mistake.

411
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,415
Magnus, open up!

412
00:47:58,088 --> 00:48:00,588
Magnus! Open up!

413
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:01,762
Fast!

414
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,665
Magnus!

415
00:48:05,255 --> 00:48:07,585
What the hell? Who are you? Hey!

416
00:48:10,963 --> 00:48:12,213
That's him.

417
00:48:12,297 --> 00:48:13,587
It's you.

418
00:48:14,422 --> 00:48:16,092
You are Jonas.

419
00:48:16,172 --> 00:48:19,632
- This is all your fault.
- Yeah, it's my fault. I know.

420
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:22,013
- But I'm here to save you all.
- From what?

421
00:48:22,922 --> 00:48:25,172
- From the apocalypse.
- Apocalypse?

422
00:48:26,255 --> 00:48:28,005
What about Martha?

423
00:48:29,755 --> 00:48:31,045
I said what about Martha?

424
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,510
For Charlotte

425
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,762
Mom.

426
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,840
Elisabeth.

427
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,300
It's beginning.

428
00:51:59,463 --> 00:52:01,173
Where are we going?

429
00:52:39,588 --> 00:52:41,548
I promise.

430
00:52:42,422 --> 00:52:44,212
I'll make it right.

431
00:53:17,255 --> 00:53:19,505
I'm not who you think I am.

432
00:53:24,922 --> 00:53:26,842
Wait. Martha, this isn't possible.

433
00:53:26,922 --> 00:53:29,302
- I don't understand...
- We don't have time now.

434
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:39,085
Later I'll explain, but
you have to come with me.

435
00:53:49,505 --> 00:53:51,005
What time did you come from?

436
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,380
The question isn't what time,

437
00:53:56,463 --> 00:53:57,883
the question is what world.
