The gods could have
punished you and Father, but they didn't.

- They showed mercy.
- And what about your brother?

What mercy did they show him?

Loras' only hope is to confess
his crimes and repent.

129

If he does, the Faith will allow him
to return to Highgarden.

130
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,641
He'll have to renounce his name and title...

- Have you lost your mind?
- ...and live his life as a penitent.

00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,980
He is the heir to Highgarden,
the future of House Tyrell.

133
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,524
He can begin again.

134
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,150
As a mindless fanatic.

135
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,944
As a free man.

136

You will leave for Highgarden today.

There is no law that says you must stay here.

It is my duty to serve my husband, the King.

when the time comes, and we meant it,

but this isn't what we agreed to.

153

These aren't White Walkers.

154
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,373
This isn't an army of the dead.

155
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,459
This isn't our fight.

TORMUND: If it weren't for him,
none of us would be here.

157
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,425
All of you would be meat
in the Night King's army.

158
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,595
And I'd be a pile of charred bones,
just like Mance.

159
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,097
Remember Mance's camp?

160
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,350
It stretched all the way to the horizon.

161
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,435
And look at us now.

162
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,520
Look what's left of us.

163
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,066
And if we lose this, we're gone.

164
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,028
Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations.

165
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,906
Be like we were never there at all.

166
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,824
We'll be the last of the free folk.

167
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,412
That's what'll happen to you if we lose.

168
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,000
The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers,

169
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,002
they know you're here.

170
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:17,047
They know that more than half of you
are women and children.

171
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,549
After they finish with me, they'll come for you.

172
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,344
You're right.

173
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,137
This isn't your fight.

174
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:26,682
You shouldn't have to come
to Winterfell with me.

175
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,475
I shouldn't be asking you.

176
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,102
It's not the deal we made.

177
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,231
I need you with me
if we're going to beat them,

178
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,317
and we need to beat them
if you're going to survive.

179
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:45,575
The crows killed him
because he spoke for the free folk

180
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,577
when no other Southerners would.

181
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,414
He died for us.

182
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:55,544
If we are not willing to do the same for him,
we're cowards.

183
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,880
And if that's what we are,

184
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,466
we deserve to be the last of the free folk.

187
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,613
Are you sure they'll come?

188
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,700
We're not clever like you Southerners.

189
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:11,828
When we say we'll do something, we do it.

190
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,431
I heard you were leaving King's Landing.

191
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,726
That is hardly your concern.

192
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,771
Your grandson is still a prisoner.

193
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,606
You'll leave him rotting in a cell?

194
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,984
Loras rots in a cell because of you.

195
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:46,530
The High Sparrow rules this city
because of you.

196
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,366
Our two ancient houses face collapse

197
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,828
because of you and your stupidity.

198
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,163
You're right.

199
00:15:57,499 --> 00:16:00,502
I made a terrible mistake.
I carry it with me every single day.

200
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,337
Good.

201
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,257
I delivered an army of fanatics
onto our doorstep.

202
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,176
And now we must fight them together.

203
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,055
We need each other.

204
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:17,853
I wonder if you're the worst person
I've ever met.

205
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,856
At a certain age, it's hard to recall.

206
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:25,569
But the truly vile do stand out
through the years.

207
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,821
Do you remember the way you smirked at me

208
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,741
when my grandson and granddaughter
were dragged off to their cells?

209
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,578
I do. I'll never forget it.

210
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,246
You love your granddaughter.

211
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,457
I love my son.

212
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,918
It's the only truth I know.

213
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,546
We must defend them.

214
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,592
I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can,

215
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,596
before that shoeless zealot
throws me into one of his cells.

216
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,349
If you're half as bright as you think you are,
you'll find a way out of here, too.

217
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,517
Never.

218
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,644
I'll never leave my son.

219
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,730
What'll you do, then?

220
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,858
You have no support. Not anymore.

221
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,944
Your brother's gone.
The High Sparrow saw to that.

222
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,947
The rest of your family have abandoned you.

223
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,033
The people despise you.

224
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,452
You're surrounded by enemies,
thousands of them.

225
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,454
You're going to kill them all by yourself?

226
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,665
You've lost, Cersei.

227
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,294
It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.

Keep it moving!

232
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,517
Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege.

233
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,145
Someone needs to teach those sad twats
how to dig trenches.

234
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,106
Someone certainly does.

235

No, no. Not me.

236
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,611
I'm just an upjumped sellsword.

237
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,322
You're an anointed knight.
There's quite a difference.

238
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:36,408
Aye, knights don't get paid.

239
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,577
You have better instincts than any officer
in the Lannister army.

240
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:44,249
That's like saying I have a bigger cock
than anyone in the Unsullied army.

I expect to command

You can be the right hand I lost.

You promise me a lordship and a castle

244

and a highborn beauty for a wife.

245

And you'll get all three. A Lannister always...

Welcome to Bear Island.

301
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,933
I remember when you were born, my lady.

302
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,685
You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.

303

It was said she was a great beauty.
I'm sure you will be, too.

I doubt it.

My mother wasn't a great beauty
or any other kind of beauty.

She was a great warrior, though.

307
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,612
She died fighting for your brother Robb.

308
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,786
I served under your uncle
at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.

309
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,914
He was also a great warrior
and an honorable man.

310
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,666
I was his steward. In fact...

I think we've had enough small talk.
Why are you here?

312
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,174
Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black

313
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,885
before he marched on Winterfell
and was killed.

314
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:50,597
He showed me the letter you wrote to him
when he petitioned for men.

now more than ever.

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,425
Or is she a Lannister?

324
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,719
I've heard conflicting reports.

325
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,139
I did what I had to do to survive, my lady.

326
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,975
But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.

327
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,185
If you say so.

328
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,313
In any case,
you don't just want my allegiance.

329
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,648
You want my fighting men.

330
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,567
Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed
to keep Winterfell, my lady.

331
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,527
It is our duty to stop him.

332
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:50,239
Even more so because he holds our brother,
Rickon Stark, as prisoner.

333
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,203
What you have to understand,
my lady, is that...

334
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:59,248
I understand that I'm responsible
for Bear Island and all who live here.

335
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:03,544
So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont
life for someone else's war?

336
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,219
If it please my lady,

337
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,389
I understand how you feel.

338
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,016
I don't know you, Ser...

339
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,143
Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

340
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,688
You needn't ask your maester
about my house.

341
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,231
It's rather new.

342
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,486
All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth.

343
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,446
How is it you understand how I feel?

344
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,534
You never thought
you'd find yourself in your position.

345
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,788
Being responsible for so many lives
at such a young age.

346
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,623
I never thought I'd be in my position.

347
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:43,793
I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler.

348
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,006
And now I find myself addressing the lady
of a great house in time of war.

349
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,678
But I'm here because
this isn't someone else's war.

350
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,431
It's our war.

351
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,892
Go on, Ser Davos.

352
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,521
Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,

353
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,441
made that man his steward.

354
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,234
He chose Jon to be his successor

355
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,653
because he knew
he had the courage to do what was right,

356
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,031
even if it meant giving his life.

357
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,411
Because Jeor Mormont
and Jon Snow both understood

358
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,664
that the real war isn't between
a few squabbling houses.

359
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,334
It's between the living and the dead.

360
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,921
And make no mistake, my lady,

361
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,007
the dead are coming.

362
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:34,844
Is this true?

363
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,724
Your uncle fought them
at the Fist of the First Men.

364
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,350
I fought them at Hardhome.

365
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:43,853
We both lost.

366
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:48,816
As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell,
the North is divided.

367
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,487
And a divided North won't stand a chance
against the Night King.

368
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,741
You want to protect your people, my lady.
I understand.

369
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:59,285
But there's no hiding from this.

370
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,245
We have to fight,

371
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,873
and we need to do it together.

372
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,887
House Mormont has kept faith
with House Stark for 1,000 years.

373
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,226
We will not break faith today.

374
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,316
Thank you, my lady.

375
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,361
How many fighting men can we expect?

376
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,452
Sixty-two.

377
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,708
- Sixty-two?
- We are not a large house,

378
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,210
but we're a proud one.

379
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:53,589
And every man from Bear Island
fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders.

380
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:58,594
If they're half as ferocious as their lady,
the Boltons are doomed.

- Pity.

You're trespassing.

393

In the name of King Tommen,
I order you to surrender or...

394
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,744
Or you'll kill Edmure?

395

It won't stop with Edmure.

398
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,420
You'll force me to storm the castle.

399

Hundreds will die.

400

Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours.

If you can breach the walls.

402
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:08,516
We'll breach them
and kill every last one of you.

403
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,644
But if you surrender,

404
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,939
I'll spare the lives of your men.

405
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,357
On my honor.

or try to starve us out.

You clearly have no intention
of saving your men's lives.

I've heard enough.

We've only just taken back this castle
from the ironborn.

The Boltons helped us do it.

430
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,027
Now you want me to fight against them?

431

cower like a beat dog.

as much as the Boltons did.

I wasn't. I mean, I never ran from a fight.

calling us animals,
as we dragged her son from their hut.

But we weren't animals.

I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.
