1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>In the little village where I was born,
life moved at a slower pace,</i>

2
00:00:07,548 --> 00:00:11,344
{\an8}<i>yet felt all the richer for it.</i>

3
00:00:11,552 --> 00:00:17,517
{\an8}<i>There, my two uncles were known far
and wide for their delicious cooking.</i>

4
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:19,686
<i>They seasoned their zesty chicken</i>

5
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:23,356
<i>using only the freshest herbs and spices.</i>

6
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:26,818
<i>People called them Los Pollos Hermanos</i>

7
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,611
<i>"The Chicken Brothers."</i>

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,531
<i>Today, we carry on their tradition</i>

9
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,742
<i>in a manner that would make
my uncles proud.</i>

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:38,705
<i>The finest ingredients are brought
together with loving care</i>

11
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:42,333
<i>then slow-cooked to perfection.</i>

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:47,839
<i>Yes, the old ways are still best
at Los Pollos Hermanos.</i>

13
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:53,469
<i>But don't take my word for it.
One taste and you'll know.</i>

14
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,957
Two-oh-one-point-six.

15
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,251
{\an8}Jesus, seriously.

16
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,711
{\an8}Better over than under.

17
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,005
{\an8}Over by a pound and a half.

18
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,800
{\an8}I thought you were all, like, precise.

19
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,303
{\an8}Whatever.
We'll just save it out till next week.

20
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,347
{\an8}We ship it as is.

21
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,601
{\an8}What, are we running a charity?
Come on, man. We're gonna take it out.

22
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,271
{\an8}Leave it. One batch, one ship.

23
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,065
{\an8}Stop complicating things.

24
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:20,324
{\an8}Why are you purposely giving him
free meth?

25
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,828
{\an8}These bitches are bleeding us
enough already.

26
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:26,497
{\an8}You are paid extraordinarily well.

27
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,543
{\an8}- Why can't you just appreciate that?
- Yeah. Hey, I been crunching numbers.

28
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:33,045
{\an8}- Oh, you've been crunching numbers?
- Yeah.

29
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,839
{\an8}And I don't gotta be a mathematician
to figure out

30
00:03:35,923 --> 00:03:37,925
{\an8}that this deal you made is bullshit.

31
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,636
{\an8}- We both earn...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

32
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,973
{\an8}A million and a half each.

33
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:48,144
{\an8}What's he getting, huh?

34
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,315
{\an8}Say he's wholesaling at 40 large a pound.

35
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,066
That's probably high.

36
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,737
{\an8}High. What, for our stuff?
That's what I was getting.

37
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:00,406
{\an8}All right, look,
say he's getting 40 a pound.

38
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,701
All right, 200 pounds a week
for three months.

39
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,747
And, like, what happens at the end
of the three months? Look, whatever.

40
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:11,918
Two hundred pounds a week
for three months. That's 2400 pounds.

41
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,086
Twenty-four hundred times 40,000 is...

42
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,340
And I swear to God,
I double-checked this like 10 times.

43
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,926
Ninety-six million dollars.

44
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,346
Ninety-six million dollars.

45
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,432
All right? Ninety-six million.

46
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,435
Ninety-six to our three.

47
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,437
That is messed up, yo.

48
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,606
That is so messed up.

49
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:36,400
{\an8}- Fairness-wise, I can't even...
- Jesse.

50
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:42,156
{\an8}You are now a millionaire
and you're complaining?

51
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,284
{\an8}What world do you live in?

52
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:50,373
One where the dudes who are actually
doing all the work ain't getting fisted.

53
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,458
{\an8}What is going on with you lately?

54
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,794
{\an8}What's happened to you?

55
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,505
{\an8}Hang on, can't we just...?

56
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,633
{\an8}Hey, we gotta hash this out.

57
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:05,054
{\an8}Hey, what's more important than money?

58
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,476
These things they laughingly call pillows

59
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,521
I would not give them to prison inmates.

60
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:15,648
You want me to go ask for another?

61
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:18,985
No, just remind me to bring his
from home.

62
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,698
They're not moving his legs enough.

63
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,032
Hey, everybody.

64
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:33,583
{\an8}Hi, Marie. Is it okay if I visit?

65
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,005
{\an8}Yeah.

66
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:51,601
{\an8}His color looks good.

67
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,856
Gomey, is that you?

68
00:05:57,064 --> 00:05:59,025
Buddy, yeah, it's me.

69
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,944
That's you, Gomey?

70
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,989
Yeah, Hank. I'm right here.

71
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:07,700
Come here. Closer.

72
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,872
- What is it?
- Closer.

73
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,918
Asshole.

74
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,298
Man, he got you good.

75
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:24,550
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,596
I'm glad to see you still have
your twisted sense of humor.

77
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:31,932
{\an8}God.

78
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,938
{\an8}Hey, check this out.

79
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,317
I got something
that'll make you feel better.

80
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:45,821
Been keeping an eye on that blue meth
of yours. Six, seven weeks, nothing.

81
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,824
Then all of a sudden, boom,
it's popping up everywhere.

82
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:54,705
Look at the new locations.
Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.

83
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,499
Even right here in town.

84
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:00,044
A teener here and there, you know,
strictly street-level amounts.

85
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:01,837
Man, it's crazy.

86
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,925
How exactly is that supposed
to make me feel better?

87
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,010
Because you were right.

88
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,346
You're the only one that saw this coming.

89
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:11,972
Well, three cheers for me.

90
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,895
This thing doesn't do a damn thing.

91
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,439
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.

92
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,149
It's been an hour, right?

93
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,778
I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.

94
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,614
{\an8}I'll go find somebody.

95
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,535
{\an8}Hey, no more shop talk.

96
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,328
Sorry.

97
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,793
{\an8}I didn't see it coming.

98
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:44,088
{\an8}What? Damn right, you did.

99
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,465
{\an8}No, I didn't see shit.

100
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:50,010
Day late and dollar short, as usual.

101
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:57,393
The only reason I'm even breathing

102
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:01,355
is I got a warning call.

103
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:05,693
A warning call? What do you mean?

104
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:10,322
One minute before they attacked me

105
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:14,660
somebody called my cell
and told me to expect it.

106
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,205
A voice scrambler.
Could have been anybody.

107
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:23,169
Marie's got my phone somewhere,
if you want to run the incoming.

108
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,298
Not that you're gonna learn anything
worth knowing.

109
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,925
I don't get it. Cartel hit?

110
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,888
- Who would have called to warn you?
- I don't know.

111
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,682
Oh, Jesus.

112
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:40,060
- Come on already.
- Okay.

113
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,772
Skyler, I had nothing to do...

114
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,112
Are we safe?

115
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,616
Yes.

116
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,003
Are you safe?

117
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:54,093
Absolutely.

118
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,330
Jesse?

119
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,750
Jesse?

120
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,461
What about you?

121
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,131
Face looks better.

122
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,509
How's it all going?
Anything you wanna tell us about?

123
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,180
What, like my interesting life?

124
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,810
One day pretty much bleeds into the next.

125
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,271
Been working a lot.

126
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,607
- Got a job.
- Job is good.

127
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,653
It's in a Laundromat.
It's totally corporate.

128
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:54,988
Corporate Laundromat.

129
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,616
It's, like, rigid. All kinds of red tape.
My boss is a dick.

130
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,369
The owner, super dick.

131
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,165
I'm not worthy to meet him,
but everybody's scared of the dude.

132
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,834
The place is full
of dead-eyed douche bags

133
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:12,172
the hours suck and nobody knows
what's going on, so...

134
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,175
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.

135
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,094
Yeah.

136
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,723
Totally Kafkaesque.

137
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,561
Majorly.

138
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,689
From the U.S. attorney in Santa Fe.

139
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,026
Very nice.

140
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,112
You've got all these nice tulips
and baby's breath.

141
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,698
Oh, and this is chrysanthemum.
That looks like chrysanthemum.

142
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,700
- Yeah.
- Look at these, Hank.

143
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,786
- Aren't they beautiful?
- Beautiful.

144
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:48,208
Wow, look at the size of this basket.
It's got so many goodies in it.

145
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,920
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels
and cheese sticks,

146
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,713
and some fancy designer olives.

147
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,623
You had me at cheese sticks. You're
gonna have to fight me for those, Hank.

148
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,221
"Get well and best wishes
from Ted Beneke,

149
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,015
and all the folks
at Beneke Fabricators."

150
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,310
Wow, he gives you all this time off
and now this.

151
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:10,355
- Get me a job there.
- I know. He's great.

152
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,732
Boss hall of fame. I don't see anything
here from Kleinman.

153
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,361
They're gonna have to get on the stick.

154
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,573
- How's everybody doing today?
- Good. We're good.

155
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,576
- How are you?
- I'm very good.

156
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,538
Hi, Hank. Just gonna do
a quick peripheral response, all right?

157
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,583
- See where we're at.
- Moment of truth?

158
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,751
Yeah, I wouldn't call it that.

159
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:36,172
All right, let's just take a look here.

160
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,926
All right.

161
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,471
All right, now I want you to tell me
if you can feel this.

162
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,602
All right.

163
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,813
How about this?

164
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,484
Okay.

165
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,612
How about now?

166
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,615
Do that one again, would you?

167
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:04,909
Right there?

168
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,956
- Yeah, yeah, I feel a tingle.
- Okay, on a scale of one to ten

169
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,814
ten being your normal level of feeling
and one being no feeling at all.

170
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,461
Oh, I don't know.

171
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,091
- Four?
- Okay, four. Okay.

172
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,762
And how about there?

173
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,890
Yeah. A six.

174
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:33,730
Okay, good. And here.

175
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,858
Yeah, still there. A little less.

176
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,319
- A three.
- Okay.

177
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,738
All right, good.

178
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,157
Thank you very much, Hank.
Did good.

179
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,952
So this is good news, right?

180
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,495
Oh, yeah, definitely.

181
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,039
Gosh.

182
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,792
It looks like some nerve function
is returning.

183
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,835
Oh, thank God.

184
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,715
All right, so when do we get him
walking again?

185
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:11,392
Marie, it's important
that we manage our expectations.

186
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,020
We're talking about months
of very hard work.

187
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,315
And even then,
the odds, they're not great.

188
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,525
But you can't know for sure.

189
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,362
- No.
- When does he start physical therapy?

190
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,697
We've sent the paperwork
to your insurance.

191
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,868
It's high-priority. We should have
pre-authorization in the next few days.

192
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,703
Certainly by early next week.

193
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,372
Next week?

194
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,957
No, that's not gonna do it.

195
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,584
I've looked into this.

196
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,546
And the sooner physical therapy
begins, the better his chances are.

197
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:44,008
He needs daily sessions.
Isn't that right?

198
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,259
- Well...
- Actually

199
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,554
your plan's treatment program
covers four sessions a week.

200
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:52,767
Actually, she asked the doctor.

201
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:58,231
Plan-wise, four treatments a week
is fairly typical.

202
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,484
And the therapists in your network
are mostly fine.

203
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,445
Mostly fine. Okay, well,
there's a ringing endorsement.

204
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:12,321
Look, if Hank had more physical
therapy with better therapists

205
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,248
wouldn't it be more likely he would walk?

206
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,253
It's very hard to say, Marie.

207
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,757
Is the health plan's way
medically justifiable? Sure.

208
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,218
Is it absolutely optimal?

209
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,346
You know, screw it.

210
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,047
I'll make sure he gets what he needs.
They can reimburse me.

211
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:37,395
Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration.
Really, I do.

212
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,774
But my best advice is stay
in the network. Don't go out of pocket.

213
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,943
Physical therapy is just the beginning.

214
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,780
We're talking nursing care,
modifications to your home

215
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,450
occupational therapy, medical equipment.

216
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,953
It could run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

217
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,746
So what?

218
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,249
We're just supposed to compromise
on his care?

219
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,669
Well, if you don't follow
the insurance company's procedures

220
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,463
they may never pay you back.

221
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,842
I've seen patients and their families
go bankrupt waiting to be reimbursed.

222
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,179
Who is the best physical therapist
that you know?

223
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,473
I can give you some names.

224
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,808
But they're not likely to be
on your plan.

225
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,310
To hell with the plan.

226
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,291
There he is. Finally.
I went ahead and started without you.

227
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,503
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.
He's in for the full treatment.

228
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,505
Hey, kick off your shoes. Lay back.

229
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,216
- Exfoliate.
- Maybe later.

230
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,624
Where's the maestro,
out parking the minivan?

231
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,178
Do I look like his shadow?

232
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,056
Who cares where he's at?
What am I doing here?

233
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,142
Well, I was gonna have you two
flip a coin.

234
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:03,606
But since the genius can't be bothered,
today's your lucky day.

235
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,192
Look around, kiddo. It's all yours.

236
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,902
What?

237
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,197
- This?
- Yeah.

238
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,700
You are now the owner
of this fine establishment.

239
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,494
- For free?
- Free?

240
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:21,123
Oh, ladies, cover your ears.
No, not free.

241
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,460
Look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean,
highly profitable...

242
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:25,962
At least potentially.

243
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,770
...local institution looked upon with
favor by the Chamber of Commerce...

244
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:34,011
...Better Business Bureau.
At $312,000, it's a steal.

245
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,556
Three-hundred-and-twelve thousand?

246
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,393
Don't you get it? On the outside,
it's a nail salon, right?

247
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:46,065
On the inside, it's the best money
laundry a growing boy could ask for.

248
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,528
Wait, wait, wait. Hey.

249
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,531
Ladies, thank you. Thank you.
Good job. Come back here.

250
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,201
Sit. Come on, come on.

251
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,912
Humor me here for a second.

252
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:03,749
Now, you know you need to launder
your money, right?

253
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,753
Do you understand the basics of it,
placement, layering, integration?

254
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,881
I ain't buying no damn nail salon,
so just forget it.

255
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,840
Don't you want to stay out of jail?

256
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,425
I mean, you wanna keep your money
and your freedom.

257
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,097
Because I got three little letters
for you: IRS.

258
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,766
If they can get Capone, they can get you.

259
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:25,229
Hey, look. Here's you, right?
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

260
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,106
Okay, here's your cash.

261
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:30,276
You're out on the town.
Yeah, you're partying hearty.

262
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,238
You're knocking boots
with the chicky babes. Oh, who's this?

263
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,074
It's the tax man.
And he's looking at you.

264
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,618
Now, what does he see?

265
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,454
He sees a young fellow
with a big fancy house

266
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,290
unlimited cash supply and no job.

267
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,793
Now, what is the conclusion
the tax man makes?

268
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:51,088
- I'm a drug dealer.
- Wrong.

269
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,634
Million times worse.
You're a tax cheat.

270
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,136
What do they do?
They take every penny,

271
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,556
and you go in the can
for felony tax evasion.

272
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,309
What was your mistake?

273
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,936
You didn't launder your money.

274
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,732
Now, you give me your money, okay?
That's called placement.

275
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,818
Hand me that little thing... Bin.

276
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,113
This is the nail salon, right?

277
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:22,244
I take your dirty money and I slip it
into the salon's nice clean cash flow.

278
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,163
That's called layering.

279
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,998
Final step, integration.

280
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,669
The revenues from the salon
go to the owner. That's you.

281
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,880
Your filthy drug money
has been transformed

282
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,758
into nice, clean, taxable income

283
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:40,054
brought to you by a savvy investment
in a thriving business.

284
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,518
So you want me to buy this place
so I can pay taxes.

285
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,186
I'm a criminal, yo.

286
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:52,858
Yeah, and if you wanna stay a criminal
and not become, say, a convict

287
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,717
maybe you should grow up
and listen to your lawyer.

288
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,906
Right, so you can get your 5 percent.

289
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,158
No, that's 17 percent.

290
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,537
I heard you say 5.
You said it right in front of me.

291
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,165
Yeah, that was for your partner.
It's privileges of seniority and all.

292
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,877
But for you, it's the usual,
17 percent and that's a bargain.

293
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,879
Hey, what? You... Hey, listen...

294
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,051
Come on, I'm talking to you about
your future here. Listen to reason.

295
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,136
How is your brother-in-law?

296
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,307
He'll live.

297
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:10,770
Good. I'm glad.

298
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,983
Walter, you seem troubled.

299
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,152
How can I help you?

300
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:26,660
I asked to see you in order
to clear the air.

301
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:35,162
There are some issues that could cause
a misunderstanding between us,

302
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:42,628
and I think it's in our best interests
to just lay the cards on the table.

303
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,431
That's the best way to do business.

304
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,813
My brother-in-law,
moments before he was attacked

305
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,524
someone called to warn him.

306
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:02,196
I believe that same person
was protecting me.

307
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,368
Those two men, the assassins

308
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,746
I believe I was their prime target.

309
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,544
But that somehow, they were steered
away from me to my brother-in-law.

310
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,884
Because of this intervention

311
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,554
I am alive.

312
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:31,725
And yet I think that this person

313
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,271
was playing a much deeper game.

314
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,026
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout

315
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:44,196
not a silent assassination.

316
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:49,243
In one stroke, he bloodied both sides

317
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:54,790
set the American and Mexican
governments against the cartel,

318
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,377
and cut off the supply
of methamphetamine to the Southwest.

319
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:07,761
If this man had his own source
of product on this side of the border...

320
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,267
he would have the market to himself.

321
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:20,524
The rewards would be enormous.

322
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,909
We're both adults.

323
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:34,288
I can't pretend I don't know
that person is you.

324
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:42,087
I want there to be no confusion.

325
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,467
I know I owe you my life.

326
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,474
And more than that

327
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,186
I respect the strategy.

328
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,439
In your position

329
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,069
I would have done the same.

330
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:16,288
One issue which troubles me...

331
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:23,837
I don't know what happens
when our three-month contract ends.

332
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,716
What would you like to happen?

333
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,804
You know why I do this.

334
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,683
I want security for my family.

335
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,184
Then you have it.

336
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:40,980
Three million for three months.
That was our agreement.

337
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:45,359
Extended annually, 12 million a year.

338
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,904
Call it 15.

339
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,990
Open-ended.

340
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,158
Would that be agreeable?

341
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:41,766
Part of the reason we talk about what
gets us riled up in our daily lives

342
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:46,812
is to help each other put a finger
on what our relapse triggers might be

343
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,858
head off our disease before
it comes back.

344
00:26:51,817 --> 00:26:55,029
So, anyone?

345
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,493
Free license to bitch and moan.
How often do you get that?

346
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,170
Jesse, last time, you seemed down
about your job at the Laundromat.

347
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:10,377
Let me ask something. If you had the
chance to do anything you wanted

348
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:12,213
what would you do?

349
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,174
Make more green, man. A lot more.

350
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:18,427
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

351
00:27:23,891 --> 00:27:25,810
I don't know.

352
00:27:26,393 --> 00:27:30,731
I guess I would make something.

353
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,817
Like what?

354
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,405
I don't know if it even matters,

355
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,493
but work with my hands, I guess.

356
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:48,374
Building things, like carpentry
or bricklaying or something?

357
00:27:48,582 --> 00:27:54,046
I took this vo-tech class in high school,
woodworking.

358
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:58,926
I took a lot of vo-tech classes,
because it was just a big jerk-off.

359
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:03,889
But this one time, I had this teacher
by the name of

360
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,935
Mr. Pike.

361
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:13,065
I guess he was like a Marine
or something before he got old.

362
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,441
He was hard of hearing.

363
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:18,904
My project for his class

364
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:23,033
was to make this wooden box.

365
00:28:23,242 --> 00:28:27,079
You know, like a small...

366
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:31,834
Just like a...
Like a box, you know, to put stuff in.

367
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:35,796
So I wanted to get the thing done
as fast as possible.

368
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,049
I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester,

369
00:28:39,258 --> 00:28:44,763
and he couldn't flunk me as long as I,
you know, made the thing.

370
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:47,808
So I finished it in a couple days.

371
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,229
And it looked pretty lame, but it worked

372
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:55,649
you know,
for putting stuff in or whatnot.

373
00:28:56,483 --> 00:29:00,779
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike,

374
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,199
for my grade

375
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:08,162
he looked at it and said:

376
00:29:08,662 --> 00:29:11,832
"Is that the best you can do?"

377
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,975
At first I thought to myself,
"Hell yeah, bitch.

378
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:20,841
Now give me a D and shut up
so I can go blaze one with my boys."

379
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:28,724
I don't know.
Maybe it was the way he said it, but...

380
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:32,275
It was like he wasn't exactly
saying it sucked.

381
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:37,858
He was just asking me honestly,
"Is that all you got?"

382
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:42,529
And for some reason, I thought to myself:

383
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,826
"Yeah, man, I can do better,"
so I started from scratch.

384
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:50,996
I made another, then another.

385
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:55,084
And by the end of the semester,
by like box number five

386
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:58,087
I had built this thing.

387
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:03,217
You should have seen it.
It was insane.

388
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:09,348
I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut
with inlaid zebrawood.

389
00:30:09,556 --> 00:30:11,306
It was fitted with pegs, no screws.

390
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:15,479
I sanded it for days
until it was smooth as glass.

391
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:21,527
Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil
so it was rich and dark.

392
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:23,279
It even smelled good.

393
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:27,741
You know, you put nose in it
and breathed in, it was...

394
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,997
It was perfect.

395
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,416
What happened to the box?

396
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:42,256
I gave it to my mom.

397
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:45,092
Nice.

398
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,554
You know what I'm gonna say, don't you?

399
00:30:48,762 --> 00:30:50,806
It's never too late.

400
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:55,269
They have art co-ops that offer classes

401
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:57,896
adult extension program
at the university.

402
00:30:58,105 --> 00:31:02,026
You know,
I didn't give the box to my mom.

403
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,656
I traded it for an ounce of weed.

404
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,048
He's a hero.
You don't deny coverage to a hero.

405
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,252
They'll say they're not denying coverage.

406
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,836
No, no, I'm agreeing with you.

407
00:31:21,962 --> 00:31:24,631
But I went through all this with Walt.

408
00:31:25,132 --> 00:31:27,843
You'll burn through your savings,
and then what?

409
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,054
Well, you two managed, right?

410
00:31:30,262 --> 00:31:31,388
You said yourself

411
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:34,975
that Elliot and Gretchen's money
didn't cover everything.

412
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:40,439
- Jesus, I gotta get back.
- What? No.

413
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:42,047
No, no, no, you should rest.

414
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:45,152
Look, why don't you go in
and take a long bath?

415
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:49,155
- I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
- I wanna be there in case he wakes up.

416
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:52,284
With all they're giving him,
he'll sleep till morning.

417
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,289
- Hey, Sky.
- Hey.

418
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:01,232
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd stop by

419
00:32:01,335 --> 00:32:03,885
to see how you're holding up.
Is this a bad time?

420
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:06,548
- Hi.
- Hi.

421
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:10,052
Marie, this is Ted, my boss.

422
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,595
Oh, you're Ted.

423
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:13,806
I've heard so much about you.

424
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:15,641
Thank you for your gift basket.

425
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:18,549
- That was really thoughtful.
- It was nice. Thank you.

426
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:20,479
- Cheese sticks.
- Cheese sticks.

427
00:32:20,687 --> 00:32:23,190
You're welcome.
We care about Skyler so much

428
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,193
that naturally that extends
to the whole family.

429
00:32:27,486 --> 00:32:29,405
Are you coming in?

430
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,074
Oh, yeah, you should.

431
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:35,369
- I'm sorry. Come on in, Ted.
- Thanks. Okay.

432
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:38,102
We were having some wine.
Would you like a glass?

433
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:40,999
No, no, thanks.
I'm just on my way home.

434
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:42,334
I just thought I'd...

435
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:47,172
You know, I am really beat.
I think I'm gonna take that bath.

436
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:49,842
It was nice to meet you, Ted,
and thank you again.

437
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:54,346
Nice to meet you, too, Marie.
Give my best wishes to your husband.

438
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,265
I will.

439
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,229
Thanks for stopping by,

440
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:06,900
but it's actually not the best time
for a visit, so...

441
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:10,654
Can we just talk for a minute?

442
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,863
I know you need to be with your family,

443
00:33:12,948 --> 00:33:16,076
but I haven't heard from you in days,

444
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,203
- and I left messages...
- I'm so sorry.

445
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,987
You gave me all that time off
and I really should've...

446
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:25,252
That's not my point.
I care about you. That's all.

447
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,046
Ted, I...
It's just this whole thing with Hank

448
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:32,509
has been one nonstop horror show,
you know, so...

449
00:33:32,718 --> 00:33:37,264
Well, I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

450
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:39,475
Thank you.

451
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:44,646
But I really do need you to...

452
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:46,982
- Okay.
- Okay?

453
00:33:50,944 --> 00:33:53,906
Skyler, I gotta say,
your sister seeing me here

454
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:59,161
I mean, so what? I'm divorced.
You're divorced. So what?

455
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:01,997
Okay, let's talk about it later, Ted,
okay?

456
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,083
- Is there some reason for secrecy?
- Later. Not now.

457
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:08,545
- Skyler, just tell me...
- You really wanna do this now?

458
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:11,215
Are you gonna make me do this right now?

459
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:19,306
Yeah, you're right.

460
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,017
Bad idea to come here.

461
00:34:23,977 --> 00:34:25,729
Ted, I'm...

462
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,650
I'll see you in a day or two.

463
00:34:30,484 --> 00:34:32,027
Back at the office.

464
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,656
Take as much time as you want.

465
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,500
I can't believe you had to crush the RV.

466
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,628
Must've been, like, depressing.

467
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:52,548
For real. That's a stone loss.

468
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:54,466
No one misses it more than me.

469
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,344
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

470
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,347
No quotas, no one to answer to.

471
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:04,977
What's the point of being an outlaw
when you got responsibilities?

472
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:10,232
Darth Vader had responsibilities.
He was responsible for the Death Star.

473
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,360
True that. Two of them bitches.

474
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,489
Just saying. Devil's advocate.

475
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:21,910
I gotta pay taxes? What's up with that?
That's messed up. That's Kafkaesque.

476
00:35:24,204 --> 00:35:26,415
- Church.
- Right.

477
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:32,170
Let's kick it back into gear.
All right? Let's start slinging again.

478
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,678
- Let's do it. Life's too short, I say.
- Hells yeah, bitches.

479
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:44,182
We don't need no RV. All we need is
a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles.

480
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:47,769
No, no. No shake-and-bake.
Where's your self-respect? Come on.

481
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:50,278
Ain't top-shelf,
but we could at least move it.

482
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:53,047
Still kind of dry out there.
It'll sell on the street.

483
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:55,277
And who says we sell on the street?

484
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:57,779
Maybe I know a whole new market.

485
00:35:57,988 --> 00:36:01,074
Maybe all we need is the meth.

486
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,653
What's the yield?

487
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:40,906
Hey.

488
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:43,992
The yield. Come on.

489
00:36:44,951 --> 00:36:47,496
Two-oh-one-point-eight.

490
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,726
I see a couple new faces.

491
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,854
Anybody wanna introduce themselves?

492
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:14,358
Don't all speak at once.

493
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:21,949
Yeah.

494
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,579
So my name's Brandon.

495
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:32,084
Okay, Brandon. You wanna tell us
something about yourself?

496
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,462
Well, why I'm here

497
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:39,091
it's just one thing.

498
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,635
It's meth.

499
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:45,472
It's bad.

500
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:49,476
Thought I had it kicked a couple times,
you know.

501
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:52,771
But then, Jesus

502
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:57,025
this new version of it hit the streets,

503
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:01,196
- and, wow.
- Not that blue stuff.

504
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:04,283
Oh, sorry. I didn't raise my hand.

505
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,451
No, go ahead. This is what we do.

506
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,329
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

507
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,749
- You had it too?
- Yeah, bro.

508
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,294
I wish I never even heard of it.

509
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,255
It was like lighting my whole head
on fire.

510
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,091
Yeah. That stuff will burn you down.

511
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,305
Only reason I have a hope in hell
is because it's long gone.

512
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,140
That's the shame of it.

513
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:31,143
No, no, man. Don't tell me that.

514
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,353
I hear it's back in town.

515
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,943
Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.

516
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:42,821
It's gonna be okay.

517
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:59,963
<i>I swear to God, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.</i>

518
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:04,259
I'll go to <i>48 Hours. </i>I'll go to <i>Nightline.</i>
Don't know if there's <i>Nightline </i>anymore.

519
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:07,593
Doesn't matter. They will all take it
and they will run with it

520
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:13,852
because he is a hero and he is not
going to be in a wheelchair at 43.

521
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,898
Jesus.

522
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,027
Listen, Marie.

523
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,864
I know Skyler's already told you this,

524
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:30,202
but if there's ever anything
that you need, anything at all...

525
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:33,247
It's good to have you here.

526
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:35,582
Both of you.

527
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:41,213
I just wish there was something more
that we could do.

528
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:49,888
Walt.

529
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:54,101
We can always pay their bills.

530
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,855
Please,
it's tens of thousands of dollars.

531
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:02,901
We have the money, more than enough.
Walt earned it.

532
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,154
- Skyler.
- I think Marie should know the truth.

533
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:10,284
Skyler, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

534
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,328
- I think that...
- He earned it gambling.

535
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,793
Walt and I

536
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:23,353
we've had our problems lately.
You know that.

537
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:31,096
And what it all came down to really

538
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:34,308
was money.

539
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,810
Pure and simple.

540
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,604
When Walt was diagnosed

541
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,358
it changed him.

542
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,821
And looking back, I don't think
I ever really understood

543
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,490
what it was that he was going through.

544
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:53,285
It was more than facing death.

545
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,705
It was knowing
that he was gonna leave behind...

546
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:00,542
nothing.

547
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:06,006
And so that's how this all started.
For better or worse

548
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,675
he wanted to provide.

549
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:15,884
And so he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.

550
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:21,188
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.

551
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:23,440
Yeah, I thought so too.

552
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,943
The truth is he never took their money.
Not a dime.

553
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:31,573
He was too proud to take
what he considered to be charity.

554
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:33,742
Isn't that right?

555
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:42,167
So he put his mind to it and...

556
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:48,382
Well, you know how Walt is.

557
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,550
He's a problem-solver.

558
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:55,680
And he read books and he did
a whole bunch of research,

559
00:41:55,889 --> 00:42:00,685
and he came up with this system.

560
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,771
A system?

561
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:07,025
A system for counting cards in blackjack.

562
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:10,487
What do you mean, like <i>Rain Man?</i>

563
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:15,242
Well, I don't pretend to understand,
you know, all the details,

564
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:20,580
but he was convinced that if he put
enough money into it, he'd have a...

565
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,666
God, what is it?

566
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,627
A statistical edge?

567
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:30,006
Yes, statistical...

568
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,925
- So...
- Yeah.

569
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:36,721
So he, every spare minute, Walt was at
some card table somewhere.

570
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,143
And at first he went to the casinos,
but then he realized that...

571
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:49,151
But then he realized that the casinos
report your winnings to the IRS.

572
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,909
And if it gets reported,
your family might find out.

573
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:56,241
If you do not want your family to find
out, you find another place to gamble.

574
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:00,829
Like an illegal backroom game.

575
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:06,251
You remember all those long walks
that Walt used to take

576
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,755
all that time he used to spend
away from home?

577
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,802
I guess for a couple months there

578
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:19,264
you were sort of
leading a double life, weren't you?

579
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,936
Oh, my God.

580
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:29,274
Oh, my God, your fugue state.

581
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:32,444
- Was that some sort of cover?
- No, no.

582
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,863
He did not fake that, Marie.

583
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,699
The night that Walt disappeared...

584
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:44,748
he lost $14,000.

585
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:50,212
It was his pension fund, our savings

586
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:55,759
basically every last dime
we had to our name, gone.

587
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:59,054
He couldn't live with it.

588
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,181
He was suicidal.

589
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:06,228
But you have to understand that
as soon as he got out of the hospital

590
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:12,150
he went right back to gambling.
I mean, that's how deep this went.

591
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:17,405
How could you do that to her, Walt?

592
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:21,576
Anyway, this system of his?

593
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,914
He finally got it to work.

594
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,336
So all this is to say we have the money.

595
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:34,548
No more gambling.

596
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:38,385
But we have the money.

597
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:44,683
How much money?

598
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,726
Walt?

599
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,233
Well...

600
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,365
it's into seven figures.

601
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:04,786
Holy Mary, mother of God.

602
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:07,497
What can I say?

603
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,750
I did very well.

604
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,628
Marie

605
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:18,090
you will take our money.

606
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:22,470
Use it to take care of Hank.

607
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,142
Please. Marie, let us help.

608
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:32,439
- Does Walt, Jr. know about this?
- Absolutely not.

609
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,691
And I need to keep it that way.

610
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,649
And Hank, okay? Hank's got enough
on his mind right now.

611
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:41,364
- Can we please keep this between us?
- Yeah. Yeah, I...

612
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:44,451
Yeah, I just... I need to...

613
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:47,829
Yeah, okay. We'll talk about it later.

614
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,541
How did you come up with that?

615
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:55,462
I mean, where did you possibly...?

616
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:59,507
I learned from the best.

617
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,223
Somehow

618
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:12,646
something tells me that Hank
is here because of you.

619
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:17,484
And I'm not forgetting that.
