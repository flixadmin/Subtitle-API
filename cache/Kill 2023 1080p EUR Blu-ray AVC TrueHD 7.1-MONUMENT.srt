1
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,375
Good work. See you soon, fucker.

2
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, sir!

3
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,375
Rathod!

4
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,750
Hurry up, man!

5
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,500
I haven't taken a peaceful dump
in 10 days.

6
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,958
You smell like shit.

7
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,458
As if you are smelling
like a bouquet of roses.

8
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,083
Captain Viresh Chatwal

9
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,292
I'll see you in the room.

10
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,167
Captain Amrit Rathod

11
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,667
Dude, don't wake me up until tomorrow.

12
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,042
Come on, bro.

13
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,292
Let's have a couple of drinks
and then drop dead.

14
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:19,917
Bro!

15
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:21,708
Tulika's trying to get in touch.

16
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,458
It's urgent. Call her.

17
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,333
[Text Message] Where are you Amrit?
Please call back?

18
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,542
Amrit, where are you?

19
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,542
I've been trying to reach you for days.

20
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,292
Dad has fixed my engagement with someone.

21
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,042
It's happening tomorrow.

22
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,250
Tomorrow!

23
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,542
I'm coming to Ranchi.

24
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,792
Why did you agree
to this engagement?

25
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:11,375
It doesn't matter who I get engaged to.

26
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,875
I will only marry Amrit.

27
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,000
Careful.

28
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,000
<i>Welcome! Bless you!</i>

29
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,458
-Congratulations, Mom.
-To you, too.

30
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,000
Do visit us.

31
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,542
You... are so dead!

32
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:24,042
Listen up, all is set.

33
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,333
<i>Meet me in the washroom
in five minutes.</i>

34
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,333
Nice thought! But, no.

35
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,167
Didn't I say
I can't run away from Ranchi.

36
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,917
- It's too risky.
- Trust me.

37
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,583
We'll be gone before anyone finds out.
Come on.

38
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:35,833
Impossible!

39
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,083
Did you hear the fireworks earlier?

40
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:43,667
They were real gunshots.

41
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,375
They can very well be aimed at us.

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,042
My dad...

43
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,500
is too powerful.

44
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:52,375
So... no, thank you.
Leave for now.

45
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,250
Aren't you dying to be with me?

46
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:58,167
Why do I need to die to be with you?

47
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,542
I want to live my life with you,
Captain Rathod.

48
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:14,875
Abort.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,875
What?

50
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,583
But I'm in position.

51
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,750
It's risky, bro. Abort mission.

52
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,542
She didn't elope fearing her dad.

53
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,333
What if she refuses to marry you because of him?
Then what will you do?

54
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,417
Bro,

55
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,958
our love is much more powerful
than her dad.

56
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,625
What a line, Captain!

57
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,708
The engagement was lovely.

58
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,833
We'll see you soon.

59
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,125
Bless you!

60
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,000
Put the bags inside.

61
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:05,208
I'll take her in. You come back.

62
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:19,167
Oh, man!

63
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,792
Bro, please drop me off.

64
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,208
Dad has started calling me.

65
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:32,292
I swear, once he's onto something,
he just doesn't stop.

66
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,667
Sorry.

67
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,417
Thank you.

68
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:21,792
Bloody hell!

69
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:23,750
Hello?

70
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:27,042
Why have a phone
if you're not going to bloody answer?

71
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,667
To watch YouTube videos!

72
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,625
Fani!

73
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,458
I was trying to make it to the train.
Don't think you'd want me to miss it.

74
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:36,875
Listen carefully.

75
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,583
We've reached the railway crossing.

76
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,375
You have 30 minutes for the job.

77
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,625
What's your coach number?

78
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:49,625
Fani?

79
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,708
Coach number?

80
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,083
Excuse me... what coach is this?

81
00:07:59,250 --> 00:07:59,833
A1.

82
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,458
A1. Thank you.

83
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,500
Fani, answer me!

84
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,625
Fani?

85
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,458
A1.

86
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,208
A1.

87
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,458
Remember, you just have 30--

88
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:19,333
If I die early it will be only
because of this moron.

89
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:20,958
Uncle, please...

90
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,083
You!

91
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:28,958
It's me!

92
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,292
Amrit, we were to meet in Delhi.

93
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:32,917
You're going to get me killed.

94
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,958
I have to go.
Dad will come looking for me.

95
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,167
Amrit!

96
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,542
Amrit?

97
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:52,708
What!

98
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,042
Amrit, what are you doing?

99
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,417
Tulika Singh...

100
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,042
will you please marry me?

101
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,000
You're totally mad.

102
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:17,542
Completely cuckoo!

103
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,500
Please say yes quickly,

104
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,542
this commode is a buffet of aromas.

105
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,625
Yes.

106
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes?

107
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,375
Yes!

108
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:34,417
Just a moment.

109
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,792
Why is your face glowing?

110
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,625
Are you from the army?

111
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:02,667
Yes.

112
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,375
In fact, both of us are.
We're Captains.

113
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,917
It's my childhood dream
to join the Army.

114
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,167
Yeah? Then you should.

115
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:15,125
It's an emotional conflict between
Mommy Dearest and Mother India.

116
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,667
Mom won't let me join.

117
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,750
Shut up!

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,500
You need an excuse to pick on me.

119
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,500
That's the truth!

120
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,125
Please move your leg out of the way.

121
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,125
- Sorry.
- Sorry!

122
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,833
Student?

123
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,125
Yes, sir.

124
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Where do you study?

125
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,750
Kanpur University.

126
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,333
Really?

127
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,958
My son just got accepted
into Kanpur University.

128
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,708
But I'm nervous to send him so far away.

129
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,708
Why is that?

130
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,417
- Mummy, I'm going to the washroom.
- Take Virat.

131
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,458
Please, I'll manage.

132
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:30,583
Coaching, hostel, tuition...
I'll guide him with everything. Don't worry.

133
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,083
That will be a huge help to him.

134
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,583
Take my number down.

135
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:39,042
22--

136
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,292
Sorry, kid.
It's occupied.

137
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:42,333
The other one as well?

138
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:43,292
Yes.

139
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,917
9822--

140
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,917
- 9822...

141
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,375
- 33...
- That's quite a phone number!

142
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:51,917
It's a VIP number.

143
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,917
Wait. I'm going to the other side.

144
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,542
Chicken chow mein is ready.

145
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:15,667
What's your name?

146
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:16,792
Gangadhar Mahto.

147
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,542
Gangadhar Mahto.

148
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:20,917
Why are they preparing to leave?

149
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,792
The next station is two hours away.

150
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:23,917
Is it?

151
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,000
I heard you.

152
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,250
I've boarded the evening train.
I'll be in Delhi by morning.

153
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,458
Hello? Hello?

154
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,625
Mother, we'll reach by 7:30.

155
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,000
No, baby...

156
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:05,250
our Amritsar tickets
need to be booked.

157
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,583
I wasn't even supposed to be here.
He begged and pleaded...

158
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,042
- Your voice isn't clear.
- Hello?

159
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:13,292
- Hello?

160
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,958
- Pinky, are you getting any reception?
- No, I'm not getting any reception.

161
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,917
Forget it, I'll call in the morning.

162
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,458
Sit tight!

163
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:48,542
Nobody moves!

164
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:53,667
Where are you running?
Stop him. Catch him!

165
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,042
Come on, take out the money!

166
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,625
Where's Ahaana?

167
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,667
- She went to the washroom.
- I'll check.

168
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,375
- Where are you going?
- Dad... Ahaana.

169
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:12,625
Hey!

170
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:13,792
- What's stopping you?

171
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,875
We know each other!

172
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,667
Don't you remember?
I asked you for the coach number?

173
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,875
<i>And you flashed a radiant smile
and said, A1!</I>

174
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,917
I even thanked you.

175
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,500
Now we are friends, right?

176
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,208
Give it to me.

177
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,500
Help!

178
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,958
Which face wash do you use?

179
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,708
He's blocking my view.

180
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,625
Look how her face is lighting up the night!

181
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,375
- Excuse me--
- Step back!

182
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,708
The entire State's police force
will be unleashed on you.

183
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,500
You have no idea
who you're messing with.

184
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,458
He's Baldeo Singh Thakur.

185
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,375
Owner of Shanti Transport.

186
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,333
Holy cow!

187
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:09,958
We've hit the jackpot!

188
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,833
Get out of here.

189
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:13,833
Virat!

190
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:22,333
Since we've found our gold mine,
let's stop the looting here.

191
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,083
How about we kidnap them?

192
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,583
- You're making a huge mistake.
- Is it?

193
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,792
- I'm warning you--

194
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,083
Baldeo!

195
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,208
- Nobody moves.
- Stay back!

196
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,958
What's with all this wailing?

197
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,208
My son!

198
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,458
Your baby boy is still alive.

199
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,458
That big guy is dead.

200
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,458
What's his--

201
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:47,708
Hey!

202
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:51,792
My child!

203
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:53,500
What was his name?

204
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,667
I'm waiting.

205
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,917
Virat.

206
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:03,542
Virat?

207
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:05,542
Dammit!

208
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,792
Had I known,
I wouldn't have killed him.

209
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,125
I'm a huge fan of Virat.

210
00:16:10,292 --> 00:16:11,167
Shit!

211
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,417
You still haven't told me
about your face wash.

212
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,917
Give me that watch!

213
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,167
Quick!

214
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,792
Mobile, wallet, all of it quick!
Give it here!

215
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,542
Give me your wallet!
Get it out!

216
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:33,667
What are you staring at?
Do you want me to stab you?

217
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:34,875
Quick, give it

218
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,125
We'll kill you.

219
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,250
Let's go.

220
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:49,750
I've never had sex in a moving train.

221
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,250
Let go of me!

222
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,333
Leave her, please!

223
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,125
- I'll kill her!

224
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,375
Uncle!

225
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:15,375
Papa!

226
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:16,917
- Move!
- Papa!

227
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,208
Leave, while you still can!

228
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,083
- Dad.
- Let's go.

229
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,208
Amrit!

230
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,583
Are you okay?

231
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,583
I'll check that side.

232
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,292
Dad...

233
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:48,958
- Get up.
- Have some water.

234
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:51,083
- He's bleeding!

235
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,292
They've disconnected the emergency brakes.

236
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:58,750
We can't stop the train.

237
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:01,625
- Ahaana.
- Ahaana! She'd gone to the washroom.

238
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:03,792
Look for her.

239
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,542
We'll go and check.

240
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:08,417
- But you all need to get out of here.
- I'll help you up.

241
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,792
Let's go.

242
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:11,917
Come on.

243
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,167
Mom...

244
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:26,417
Ahaana?

245
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,375
Ahaana?

246
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:30,583
I'll look that side.

247
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,708
Mom, she came this way.
I'll go ahead and check.

248
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,708
Let me look...

249
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,583
Mom, you go on with Papa.

250
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,583
- Come.
- Let's go!

251
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,542
Uncle!

252
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,667
Pick him up.

253
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,542
Hey, move!

254
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,625
Put him on the bed.

255
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:44,917
Be careful.

256
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,542
Amrit.

257
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,000
Go with them.
And don't sit together.

258
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:50,500
No--

259
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,292
No one's seen you
besides those two, Tuli.

260
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,292
Amrit, come with us.

261
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,417
I'll be fine. I promise.

262
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:57,917
- I'll be right there.
- Amrit...

263
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,042
Go!

264
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:00,667
Just go!

265
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,167
I'll be right there.

266
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,417
You shouldn't have killed him, bro.

267
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,667
We could've contained him.

268
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:20,625
It's a huge mess now.

269
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,750
It was a split-second decision.
He would have killed Tulika's mom.

270
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,125
They put a knife through him.

271
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:31,500
Dad.

272
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,208
Dad!

273
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,625
What will I tell Mom?

274
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:40,500
We have to inform Beni.

275
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,833
We get off in 10 minutes
and meet him.

276
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,208
How can we just leave, Uncle?

277
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,708
They will have to pay for this.

278
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,250
He was our uncle, after all.

279
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:54,375
We'll look this side,
you guys check that way.

280
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:56,333
We won't spare anyone!

281
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,958
He was Bent's brother!

282
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,625
No!

283
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,750
Not a word to Dad.

284
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,708
And no one will touch those bastards.

285
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,708
Only Ravi has the right to avenge
his dad's death.

286
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:15,667
Let's find Baldeo Singh Thakur
to pay for this sin.

287
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,583
I won't spare them.

288
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,542
Let's go!

289
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,250
Sarju!

290
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,042
Fuckers, stop!

291
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,917
Or else I'll slay the kid.

292
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:36,542
- Dad!
- Where's Thakur?

293
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:40,917
Where is Baldeo Singh Thakur?

294
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,625
Let the kid go.

295
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,875
Let's discuss this calmly--

296
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,417
Viresh!

297
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,500
Move your ass!

298
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,167
Bastard!

299
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,333
You killed my dad.

300
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,250
I won't spare you!

301
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:18,583
Amrit?

302
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,583
What happened?

303
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:24,583
Those bastards took Viresh.

304
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,083
What?

305
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:33,167
- Amrit, I can't find Ahaana...
- Tulika.

306
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,625
Let go of me. Untie me!

307
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:03,125
You won't get away with this.

308
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,292
Your partner's on his way to hell.

309
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,542
You're set to follow soon.

310
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,292
How many in your gang?

311
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,375
- And which coaches are they in?
- Fuck off!

312
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,250
You're still alive because
we're here.

313
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:21,750
If I'd met you on the battlefield,
I'd bury you alive.

314
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,458
If I let go for even a second,

315
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,500
you'll lose your legs.

316
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,875
You won't die.

317
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,000
Just no legs!

318
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,208
Tell me.

319
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:42,958
<i>B1, A1, A2, and A3.</i>

320
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,750
There are 36 bandits.

321
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,583
They've blocked all four coaches.

322
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,083
Ahaana isn't here.
She's not in A2 either.

323
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,250
Could she have gone the other way?

324
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,167
Sit down!

325
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:13,167
Move!

326
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:22,042
Where's Ravi?

327
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,458
Where the hell is he?

328
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,417
Yes?

329
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,458
What!

330
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:51,750
Siddhi!

331
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:07,542
The train's slowing down.

332
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:15,042
Let me go!

333
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,417
Brother-in-law...

334
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,958
Who did this?

335
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,542
Where's the gun? Give it to me!

336
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:53,042
It won't work.
I've fired from this already.

337
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,917
- I don't care.
- These country-made guns can backfire!

338
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:55,917
Brother!

339
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:57,917
Ravi isn't here. They've got him.

340
00:27:58,083 --> 00:27:59,667
That's why I brought him here.

341
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,167
We need Ravi back.

342
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:10,667
And the guy who did this to Babban.

343
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,042
Baldeo Singh Thakur.

344
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:16,542
Owner of Shanti Transport.

345
00:28:17,292 --> 00:28:18,542
What rubbish!

346
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:19,917
I'm telling the truth.

347
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,917
Your brother was my uncle.

348
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,500
Baldeo Singh Thakur is the reason he's dead.

349
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:28,667
You can ask Ravi.

350
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:37,125
This guy has a partner.

351
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,750
The way they've been fighting...

352
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:42,375
I'm sure they're from the army.

353
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:45,125
To catch them, think like Ali.

354
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,000
- Ali?
- Muhammad Ali.

355
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,625
Lower your guard.

356
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,250
The moment he charges to attack,
deliver your punch. Knockout!

357
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,833
- Careful there, brother!

358
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,833
- You go that way.
- Be careful!

359
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,833
- Careful!
- Move ahead.

360
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:20,833
Okay.

361
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,083
Let me go!

362
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,542
Just in case.

363
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,042
What do you mean?

364
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:54,042
Are you worried about me?

365
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,042
It's not safe, Tulika.

366
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,292
The only thing that should matter is,

367
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,917
starting tomorrow, I'll be your wife.

368
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:10,792
I'm warning you,

369
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,042
I'm very demanding.

370
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:31,250
Amrit, please bring Ahaana back.

371
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,000
She's my life.

372
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'll bring Ahaana back.

373
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,500
I promise.

374
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,625
Is he in the Army?

375
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,958
A National Security Guard Commando.

376
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,833
Why didn't you tell me about him?

377
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:11,833
What good would that do?

378
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:15,333
I got engaged with
whoever you chose, didn't 1?

379
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:19,333
If father-daughter are done
with suitor shopping,

380
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,583
then help me in.

381
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,833
My foot is slipping.

382
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,833
I'd rather throw you on the tracks.

383
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,708
Shut up and stay there!

384
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,125
Hold him.

385
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,375
Keep an eye on him.

386
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,958
- Sohail!
- Sohail!

387
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:17,958
Arif!

388
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:20,333
Arif!

389
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:23,958
Hey, let go!

390
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,083
Hold his hand.

391
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,292
Arif!

392
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,000
You stabbed him! Arif!

393
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:58,375
My child!

394
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:02,542
Catch him!

395
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:04,292
Nobody moves.

396
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:07,042
Someone help him.

397
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,042
Thrash him!

398
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:41,542
Arif, open your eyes.

399
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,417
Arif!

400
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,875
We meet again!

401
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,542
Are you okay?

402
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,167
Yeah. Shit!

403
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:43,667
It's looking bad, bro!

404
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:50,542
Come on. Get up. Up!

405
00:39:53,917 --> 00:39:55,792
You're not holding the weapon right.

406
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:02,292
You'll twist your delicate wrist.

407
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:05,292
A weapon is also called an arm for a reason.

408
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:07,667
Treat it as an extension of you.
Show it some love.

409
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,917
The arm stays flexible
and the wrist must be...

410
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:13,625
Firm!

411
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,875
One hit at the jugular and...

412
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,250
Game over!

413
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,500
I speak from experience.
I'll teach you.

414
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Take the key! Get out of here.

415
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,625
Hurry! Be careful!

416
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:37,000
Running away and leaving your Dad behind?

417
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,000
Why don't you call the cops now?

418
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,000
Where are your cops? Call them now!

419
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:11,958
Tulika!

420
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:29,083
Let me go!

421
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,458
Hey, pretty girl!

422
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:38,542
What's your problem?

423
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:44,042
You're no soldier, Miss.

424
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:49,417
He is, though!

425
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,917
But considering the situation...

426
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:55,667
it doesn't seem likely that
he'll be able to save you.

427
00:41:55,917 --> 00:41:57,667
That won't be necessary.

428
00:41:58,292 --> 00:41:59,667
<i>Bravo!</i>

429
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,417
Let's have some fun!

430
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:07,792
Didn't I tell you not to...

431
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,500
Tulika!

432
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,208
Tulika!

433
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,833
Tuli!

434
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:44,708
Amrit...

435
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:46,833
You've got some baits!

436
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,083
Amrit...

437
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:05,667
Amrit...

438
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:32,792
No! Tulika!

439
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:07,833
Where's dad?

440
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:08,917
In B1.

441
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:11,083
We're getting off in 5 minutes.
Get dad and pack everything.

442
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,208
- Alright.
- Uncle!

443
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,292
Bring his family.

444
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:19,917
Come on. Get moving!

445
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:22,583
Uncle? Hurry up!

446
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,542
There's no time to waste.

447
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:31,542
Get up.

448
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:33,167
And throw them off.

449
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:59,792
Happy fourth anniversary!

450
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:07,375
How do you remember every year?

451
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:09,250
That's because I love you more.

452
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:12,500
Shut up! Show me your hands.

453
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:14,000
My hands?

454
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,417
- Yes! Show them to me.
- Here you go.

455
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:17,667
All yours!

456
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:19,625
Amrit.

457
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,875
Look, you have a proper crescent moon.

458
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,583
Which means, I love you more.

459
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:33,458
But your lifeline seems longer.

460
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:34,458
See?

461
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:50,458
I am joining our lifelines together.

462
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:54,458
Now we share only one life.

463
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,792
Bechan!

464
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:00,792
Stay back!

465
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,750
Let me go Fani!

466
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:17,875
- Let's get out.

467
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:19,167
- I won't spare you.

468
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:04,458
Hold him up.

469
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,167
Stop him!

470
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:31,583
What are you waiting for?
Go!

471
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:50,292
Stop or I'll kill...

472
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:51,833
- Uncle!
- Uncle!

473
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:01,083
Get the other bags.
Quick! We have to get off.

474
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:03,083
Get everything.

475
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,083
- Uncle...

476
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:11,708
They killed Dad!

477
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,833
Fucking hell!

478
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:21,417
That Commando's love
has fallen on us like a bomb.

479
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:23,792
He's killing everyone.

480
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,417
What do you mean?

481
00:51:28,292 --> 00:51:29,542
They are family, Fani.

482
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:32,667
Exactly why I saved him
and brought him back.

483
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:37,667
Wonder why everyone
is a fountain of love today?

484
00:51:39,917 --> 00:51:42,292
Why the hell did you kill that girl?

485
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:43,792
Tell me!

486
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:47,042
I didn't want to dance around trees
with her.

487
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:49,417
I was going to ransom her.

488
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:51,417
She was challenging me.
Sliced my arm.

489
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:52,542
So, I killed her.

490
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:56,167
Do you have any idea what you've done?

491
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:58,458
Do you realise whose daughter she was?

492
00:51:58,917 --> 00:52:01,167
Uncle, these guys aren't regular soldiers.

493
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:02,417
They're commandos.

494
00:52:02,667 --> 00:52:04,167
We're not safe on the train.

495
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:05,875
You think we're safe outside?

496
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:08,625
You really think
Baldeo Singh Thakur will spare us?

497
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,875
He killed his daughter!

498
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:22,458
We can't leave any of them alive now.

499
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:25,083
We have to kill them all.
Got it...

500
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:27,333
No one will touch Baldeo Singh Thakur.

501
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,125
Screw your ideas!

502
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:32,375
At least listen to my golden words.

503
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:33,958
How much worse do you want it to be?

504
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:36,583
The Goddess of Wealth is shining
her golden light at us.

505
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,083
And you do not want to see it!

506
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:40,458
Kidnap his family.

507
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:41,958
Ask him for ransom.
And then kill them all.

508
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,917
How many of us will you get killed?

509
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:45,292
Exactly my point!

510
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:48,083
What will you give to the families
who've died today?

511
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:54,292
How will our own people survive, Dad?

512
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:02,833
Baldeo Singh Thakur is the root cause
of all this.

513
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:07,417
He must pay!

514
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:22,792
The commandos were in B1, right?

515
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,042
Yes.

516
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,625
Easy there.

517
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,000
I'll get the first aid box.

518
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,542
Did you find Ahaana?

519
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,875
Where is she?

520
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:51,875
What took you so long, Baldeo?

521
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:53,875
- What happened to Ahaana?
- Where are the kids?

522
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,625
Say something.

523
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Why are you crying?

524
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,750
Tulika was with you.
Where is she?

525
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,375
Why won't you say anything?

526
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:06,042
Where is Tulika?

527
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:08,958
They killed Tulika.

528
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:10,583
What!

529
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,583
Killed?

530
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,958
Who killed her?

531
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:19,500
- That can't be!
- I don't believe you!

532
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:22,500
They just...

533
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,208
They pushed her off the train!

534
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:40,208
She was in pink.

535
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:42,958
No! My child!

536
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:44,583
Everything turned red.

537
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,958
My baby!

538
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,458
Red!

539
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,208
Tulika.

540
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:31,292
Please find Ahaana and get her back.

541
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:33,792
She is my life.

542
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:38,250
I'll get Ahaana back.

543
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:41,917
I promise.

544
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:17,833
What are you doing?

545
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,208
I need to go.

546
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:22,208
We're greatly outnumbered here.

547
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,583
They're going to get off
at the next station anyway.

548
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,708
I promised her

549
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:31,833
that I'd bring Ahaana back.

550
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:34,708
If they find out she's Tulika's sister,

551
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,750
they won't spare her.

552
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:38,708
Let's go then.

553
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:40,708
- I'm coming along.
- Viresh!

554
00:56:40,958 --> 00:56:42,208
You're in no condition to fight.

555
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:44,458
- I don't care, I'm coming along.
- Listen to me!

556
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:46,458
They need you here.

557
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:48,333
- But...
- Viresh.

558
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,833
I've already lost Tuli.

559
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,167
I don't want to lose you.

560
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,542
They'll get off this train for sure

561
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:04,792
but only for their funeral.

562
00:57:08,833 --> 00:57:11,208
Speak! Where are the commandos?

563
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:12,667
Move it!

564
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:16,333
Bastard, who are they with?

565
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,542
How would I know?

566
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:25,708
You don't know?

567
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:32,542
Who's with them?
Mother? Father?

568
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,250
- Tell me!
- I don't know anything!

569
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:45,500
Fani!

570
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,875
We're wasting time.

571
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,417
Bastards...

572
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:39,333
Please!

573
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,333
We've managed to escape the bandits.

574
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,250
Please let us go.
They'll kill us otherwise.

575
00:58:44,583 --> 00:58:46,083
- Please let us go ahead.
- Please.

576
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,000
Where's dad?

577
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,500
He isn't back?

578
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,542
Hey! What are you hiding?

579
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:31,375
Get back.

580
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:51,958
No, please!

581
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:54,083
Tell that scrawny ass fucker of yours,

582
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:55,333
I'm coming for him.

583
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:05,083
Ranjan!

584
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,958
- Make space.
- Ranjan.

585
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:08,583
Ranjan. What happened?

586
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:10,083
Lay him down.

587
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,333
Get aside.

588
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,958
- Ranjan!
- Get some water.

589
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:13,958
Ranjan!

590
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:17,708
That Commando...

591
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:20,958
he's coming for you.

592
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:23,292
- It's okay, take it easy.
- You relax.

593
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:24,792
Ranjan!

594
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,917
Ranjan! No!

595
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:38,458
You started this mess.

596
01:00:39,667 --> 01:00:41,417
And we've to pay the price.

597
01:00:42,458 --> 01:00:44,042
We're not going to fight them.

598
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,000
We want to get off this train.

599
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:48,500
What the fuck did you say?
You want to get off?

600
01:00:48,917 --> 01:00:51,000
My father's still with them.

601
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:53,375
Are you blind? Ranjan returned alone.

602
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,625
He must be dead already.

603
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,083
- Because of you!
- Stop it!

604
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,583
Enough!

605
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,333
Let go of me.

606
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:21,083
What's this drama about?

607
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:23,625
Bunch of fucking cowards!

608
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:25,583
Cribbing away to glory.

609
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:28,583
If you don't have the balls to fight...

610
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:31,208
then sit at home and start your LonelyFans.

611
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:33,083
You don't deserve to be bandits.

612
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,958
We want to get off. That's it!

613
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:37,375
I'm with him.

614
01:01:37,583 --> 01:01:38,833
You want to leave?

615
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:40,125
Let's do it.

616
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:42,583
Let's get off!

617
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:45,625
Do you think you'll be safe?

618
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:49,583
Baldeo Singh Thakur is just another passenger
on the train.

619
01:01:50,042 --> 01:01:50,792
Helpless.

620
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:51,792
Vulnerable.

621
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:52,792
Powerless.

622
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,583
But if he gets off this train,

623
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:58,917
he'll make sure
to get every last one of us killed.

624
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:00,792
Still want to leave?

625
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,417
Let's move on.

626
01:02:06,792 --> 01:02:08,292
I won't walk in the front.

627
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:09,792
You lead.

628
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:32,208
Move it. Go!

629
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,583
Keep walking!

630
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:34,958
You stay back.

631
01:03:35,125 --> 01:03:36,083
Go on!

632
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,958
Keep moving.

633
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,958
Walk!

634
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:46,708
Ravi, what happened?

635
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:49,208
Badlu...

636
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:51,042
Uncle!

637
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:53,042
Uncle, come here!

638
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,792
- Badri!
- Fani!

639
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:56,167
Uncle!

640
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,542
Make way.

641
01:04:22,167 --> 01:04:23,042
Hey!

642
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:24,917
Bring him here!

643
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:26,292
Move it. Go!

644
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:31,417
Keep walking!

645
01:04:32,542 --> 01:04:33,250
Sarju!

646
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:35,750
Murari!

647
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,000
Bechan!

648
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:45,125
Badlu!

649
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:46,875
Get him down.

650
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:52,250
Get him down.

651
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:53,375
Murari!

652
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:58,750
Get him down.
Let's bring Bilas down.

653
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:02,500
Bechan! Badlu!

654
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,125
Bilas!

655
01:05:07,292 --> 01:05:08,625
Get him down.

656
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,708
- Get him down.

657
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,333
Dad!

658
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:28,083
Dad!

659
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:34,833
Dad!

660
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:40,208
Untie him.

661
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:43,333
Hold him up.

662
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:47,208
Dad!

663
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:49,208
Fani!

664
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:51,833
Pull yourself together.

665
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,208
They killed Dad.

666
01:08:29,917 --> 01:08:31,042
Siddhi!

667
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:33,042
Siddhi, don't.

668
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:34,792
- Move aside, Uncle.
- Don't.

669
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:36,917
Move aside, I'll...

670
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:41,667
I'll tear them apart!

671
01:08:42,042 --> 01:08:43,042
I know you can.

672
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:44,500
But understand this.

673
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:48,250
They've put up this display to rattle us.

674
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,375
They're lurking nearby for us
to fall into their trap.

675
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:56,500
Siddhi, we'll take our revenge.

676
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:57,875
Do you hear me?

677
01:08:58,625 --> 01:09:00,000
Get a grip.

678
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:03,875
- We will avenge him.
- Okay.

679
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:12,250
Bloody...

680
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:14,500
Listen.

681
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:17,625
No more of your stunts.
Got it?

682
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:19,625
No more nonsense.

683
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,750
Where is it?

684
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,375
Where is this maternal love
coming from?

685
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:27,333
Why don't you put me
back in a cradle?

686
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:30,208
You'll get everyone killed.

687
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:34,458
We've had differences
for the first time in 30 years.

688
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:37,333
You've pissed on all my principles.

689
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:44,833
Foster a dog or a cat,

690
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,458
but don't foster misconceptions, Dad.

691
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:52,833
You are not a Spider-man or Batman.
"With great power comes great responsibility.” Bullshit!

692
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,833
We are bandits.

693
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,458
Thieves.

694
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,083
Our entire extended family.

695
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:03,333
Sacrifice and principles, my ass.

696
01:10:30,417 --> 01:10:33,667
Have you seen a young girl here?
Around 15-16 years old?

697
01:10:43,542 --> 01:10:44,167
You're here.

698
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:45,792
Do you know where Sohail is?

699
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:47,292
Sohail's safe.

700
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:48,625
He's in A3 ahead.

701
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,750
Viresh is with him.

702
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,750
Don't worry.

703
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:02,250
I'm looking for a 15-16 years old girl.

704
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:04,250
Have any of you seen her?

705
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:05,375
Yes.

706
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:06,875
There was one.

707
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,750
But the bandits took her

708
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:12,625
along with a few others to another coach.

709
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,000
Get out of this coach. Hurry.

710
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,125
Clear out.

711
01:11:22,292 --> 01:11:23,000
Come on, get up.

712
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:26,875
- Move ahead.
- Let's go.

713
01:11:35,083 --> 01:11:36,833
Careful... hurry!

714
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:40,583
Leave the bag!

715
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:42,458
Sit down!

716
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:45,083
Didn't you hear me?

717
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:46,708
Where are you going?

718
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:17,167
We also want to come with you.

719
01:12:23,417 --> 01:12:24,917
It's too risky.

720
01:12:25,417 --> 01:12:26,667
They're capable of anything.

721
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:30,042
It may even get beyond me.
Please understand.

722
01:12:30,208 --> 01:12:31,417
It's okay.

723
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:34,667
We didn't do anything
thinking it wasn't our fight.

724
01:12:35,167 --> 01:12:38,417
If we'd all helped you from the start
then perhaps Arif...

725
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,542
I'll come too.

726
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:46,167
Don't go by my physique.

727
01:12:46,667 --> 01:12:48,292
I can be very helpful.

728
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:09,875
Fire!

729
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,250
Sir, the train is on fire.

730
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,000
Who the hell...

731
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:22,500
Hello?

732
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,750
Fire? On this train?

733
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,250
Who put the lock here?

734
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:42,167
Seems like the fire was here.

735
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:50,917
What a bummer!
No one saw the fire.

736
01:13:54,417 --> 01:13:56,167
The police are here!

737
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:58,708
Thank God!

738
01:14:05,667 --> 01:14:07,667
Those assholes locked it and ran away.

739
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:18,125
We're arriving at a station, Uncle.

740
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:24,500
Siddhi, check the coach.

741
01:14:24,667 --> 01:14:26,500
Get all our things

742
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,375
and make sure you gather all of our people.

743
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:36,500
Fani, check the other coach.

744
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:39,250
If you find Baldeo Singh Thakur, finish him off.

745
01:14:39,417 --> 01:14:41,000
- Thakur...
- No arguments!

746
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:45,250
Pull the emergency brakes. Do it!

747
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:57,125
Shut the doors.

748
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:06,708
Get off.

749
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:10,333
Worried about me, are you?

750
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:13,958
Your fatherly love
has finally blossomed today.

751
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:15,333
Hey!

752
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:23,583
Run! Run!

753
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:32,083
That guy in the light shirt.

754
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:33,333
He's their leader!

755
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:38,333
Police!

756
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:47,292
The police are here.

757
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:05,292
The train has picked up speed.

758
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:09,167
The police must've informed the authorities.

759
01:16:09,417 --> 01:16:11,292
Why are we getting involved
with the police?

760
01:16:11,542 --> 01:16:13,167
We won't.

761
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:17,167
Get here!

762
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,625
These guys will face the cops.

763
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:50,333
No! Natthu!

764
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:05,167
It'll come in handy.

765
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:10,792
Let's throw these two out.

766
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:55,208
Why?

767
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:58,583
Why did you kill my dad?

768
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:00,958
Why did you kill my dad?

769
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:38,917
Why?

770
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:41,292
Why did you kill my son?

771
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:43,458
Why?

772
01:19:52,458 --> 01:19:55,083
Why did you kill my child?

773
01:19:57,958 --> 01:19:59,208
Arif!

774
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:09,375
What's taking Siddhi so long?

775
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:11,000
I'll check.

776
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:14,375
Wait a minute.

777
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,375
Don't open the shutter yet.

778
01:20:18,417 --> 01:20:20,500
Uncle!

779
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:26,125
Uncle...

780
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:28,625
- What happened?
- My brother... Siddhi...

781
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:31,375
- Siddhi...
- What happened to him?

782
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:39,208
Come with me.

783
01:20:39,375 --> 01:20:40,458
Hold them here.

784
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:17,042
Uncle...

785
01:21:25,417 --> 01:21:26,292
Move!

786
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,417
Take the passengers and move forward.

787
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:40,667
We fucked up.

788
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:44,042
We should've gotten off with Fani.

789
01:21:48,167 --> 01:21:49,917
You ensured he's safe.

790
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:53,542
Uncle, let's get off.

791
01:21:58,875 --> 01:22:00,000
I agree.

792
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:05,000
Even I think so.

793
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:07,000
Please listen to us.

794
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,125
Let's get off.

795
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:18,375
Uncle, we should get off.

796
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:20,375
Uncle!

797
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:26,875
Come! Walk ahead.

798
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,375
Move!

799
01:22:29,542 --> 01:22:32,250
-All of you. Move!
-Keep walking!

800
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:47,667
Walk ahead.

801
01:22:48,792 --> 01:22:50,042
Come out!

802
01:22:50,542 --> 01:22:53,417
Or else we'll kill
every last one of them.

803
01:22:58,292 --> 01:22:59,417
Come out now.

804
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,708
Stay right there.

805
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,458
Not a step!

806
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:14,708
Or I'll carve him like a turkey.

807
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:35,292
Dad!

808
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:36,292
<i>Ahaana!</i>

809
01:23:40,042 --> 01:23:41,042
Bring him here.

810
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:43,417
Easy.

811
01:23:44,167 --> 01:23:44,917
Sit!

812
01:23:47,667 --> 01:23:49,667
You need to lie down.
Don't get up, please.

813
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:51,667
- You've lost a lot of blood.
- Amrit...

814
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:53,542
- Please lie down.
- The police are here.

815
01:23:53,708 --> 01:23:56,167
The police are with us.
Please don't get up.

816
01:23:57,917 --> 01:23:58,917
I'm back!

817
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,000
Drop your weapons!

818
01:24:10,917 --> 01:24:12,500
Stand back.

819
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,750
What a dumb fuck!
Asked me to drop my weapon.

820
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:17,375
And it dropped on his skull!

821
01:24:17,542 --> 01:24:18,750
How tragic?

822
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:25,000
Look! Happy days are here again.

823
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,625
Dad's other li'l princess, isn't it?

824
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:33,625
Kill one and another appears.

825
01:24:33,792 --> 01:24:34,500
Baldeo, you are a magician!

826
01:24:34,667 --> 01:24:35,750
Killed?

827
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:39,500
Dad?

828
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:43,458
Tuli?

829
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:47,958
No, no, no, no
Dad!

830
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,083
Yes, yes, yes, yes

831
01:25:06,458 --> 01:25:07,083
Run!

832
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:08,958
Uncle!

833
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:12,708
Come here.

834
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:14,833
Uncle!

835
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:17,083
I'm okay.

836
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:19,583
Stop!

837
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:25,917
Where did the prick go?

838
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:47,417
Come out you coward!

839
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:17,125
Please save me! Please save me!

840
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,250
Ravi!

841
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:31,750
Uncle.

842
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:37,000
Stop. Hold it!

843
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:41,500
Uncle, gunshots were fired
in the next coach.

844
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:43,250
It must be the police.

845
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:45,500
Let's not kill him.

846
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:47,958
We can use him as bait.

847
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:56,458
Move back.

848
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:07,333
Little soldier boy.
A broken soldier toy!

849
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:29,917
Don't let them escape.

850
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:35,958
Fucking hell!

851
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:36,958
Come on, walk!

852
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:40,708
We're arriving at a station.
Hurry up!

853
01:28:40,875 --> 01:28:41,708
Come on!

854
01:28:42,208 --> 01:28:45,708
Hold him tight!
You don't know him well.

855
01:28:46,208 --> 01:28:50,583
He was trying very hard to be a Rambo.

856
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:54,917
I sat him in my lap
and lovingly bled him to death.

857
01:28:55,792 --> 01:28:57,167
It was beautiful!

858
01:28:58,042 --> 01:29:01,417
Didn't ask his name, tell me yours
before you die.

859
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:03,417
Soldier?

860
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:05,292
Hear me, soldier?

861
01:29:05,917 --> 01:29:06,917
Fani!

862
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:09,792
You haven't killed him?

863
01:29:10,542 --> 01:29:11,792
Nope, I didn't.

864
01:29:12,167 --> 01:29:13,917
What's your name?

865
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:19,417
- What's the problem?
- Didn't I tell you to kill him?

866
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:21,917
Let go of me!
We can't keep him alive!

867
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:23,667
Sometimes you're stubborn like a child.

868
01:29:23,833 --> 01:29:24,667
We can't keep him alive!

869
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:26,542
Or we won't survive.

870
01:29:26,792 --> 01:29:28,417
- What do you need...
- What kind of father are you?

871
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:30,667
- You're making things worse.
- You never agree with me.

872
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:32,417
Baldeo will make our life hell.

873
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,125
Soldier, no!

874
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:01,750
Uncle!

875
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,500
Don't let them go!

876
01:30:05,875 --> 01:30:08,375
Uncle!

877
01:30:11,625 --> 01:30:13,625
Dad!

878
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:17,083
Dad!

879
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:20,958
Get water!

880
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,208
Dad! Dad!

881
01:30:29,458 --> 01:30:30,333
Dad!

882
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:32,708
How badly he's burnt!

883
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:34,458
Look at his face...

884
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:47,833
Bloody hell!

885
01:31:17,917 --> 01:31:19,042
Get up. Let's go!

886
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:12,875
Who kills like this?

887
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:17,792
I killed four of your people.

888
01:32:19,375 --> 01:32:22,083
You finished off 40 of my family!

889
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:26,417
You're not a protector.

890
01:32:29,042 --> 01:32:31,167
You're a monster.
A fucking monster!

891
01:32:44,958 --> 01:32:48,417
Commando! Are you still a trainee?

892
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:52,417
You can barely keep up with me.

893
01:32:52,583 --> 01:32:55,167
How will you protect the Nation?

894
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
No!

895
01:33:28,625 --> 01:33:30,250
Soldier boy!

896
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:38,125
This is exactly how
I killed your li'l Miss Sunshine.

897
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:45,708
She thought she could defy me.

898
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,625
Now you will meet the same fate as her.

899
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:55,750
Tulika's hero...

900
01:38:19,625 --> 01:38:22,708
Do I need to die to be with you?

901
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:29,875
I want to live my life with you,
Captain Rathod.
