1
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,329
- Mom.
- Cheong-san, no.

2
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,755
What the hell?

3
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,927
Damn it!

4
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,246
There's another zombie here!

5
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,647
Dae-su!

6
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:06,982
Stop it.

7
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,903
Dae-su! Get up!

8
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,617
I said stop that!

9
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,792
- Stop that!
- Hey!

10
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,836
Cheong-san! What the hell?

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,507
You son of a bitch!

12
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,434
Stop it!

13
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,066
Let go!

14
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,610
Get the fuck off me!

15
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,905
Mom!

16
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,036
Mom...

17
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,895
Hurry.

18
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,523
Run!

19
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,150
Hey, let's go.

20
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,359
Hurry up!

21
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,485
Let's go.

22
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,993
Let's go, Cheong-san.

23
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,788
Pull yourself together, man!

24
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,168
Where are the others?

25
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,586
What?

26
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,129
Where are they?

27
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,524
- What now?
- Did you see them coming?

28
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,469
Cheong-san, please.

29
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,597
- Come with us.
- Let's go.

30
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,090
Mom!

31
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,014
Mom!

32
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,215
Mom...

33
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,301
They're here. Hurry up!

34
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,030
- Wu-jin!
- Get up.

35
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,515
Come on. We have to go. Let's go!

36
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,790
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

37
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,458
Shut up. You're so heavy.

38
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,169
Mi-jin. Thank you so much.

39
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,798
- Will you go out with me?
- No.

40
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,049
Screw you.

41
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,801
Hold on.

42
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,347
- Why? What is it?
- Shh.

43
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,073
Hear that?

44
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,828
Those goddamn fucking zombies. Shit.

45
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,997
Let's go.

46
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,836
Let's run.

47
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,919
To the mountain.

48
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,676
Aah!

49
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,769
Ji-min. Help me.

50
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,238
Hyo-ryeong!

51
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,245
Get up!

52
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,846
Get up.

53
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,853
Sister.

54
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,812
- Wu-jin.
- What are you doing here?

55
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,895
Come on.

56
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
Get going.

57
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,862
- Hey!
- Hyo-ryeong. You go first.

58
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,115
- Come on! Let's go!
- Let's go.

59
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,843
What's wrong, Nam-ra?

60
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,305
Run.

61
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,850
Let's go.

62
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,314
Oh, shit.

63
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,064
Run!

64
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,818
I'm gonna die tonight!

65
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,987
- Run! Go!
- Just save yourselves!

66
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,865
Just go! You'll die! Believe me!

67
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,867
Whatever!

68
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,620
- Over here!
- This way! Hurry!

69
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,703
Come on!

70
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,632
Are you crazy? Let go!

71
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,597
Hey! No! No!

72
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,557
No!

73
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,642
What are you doing?

74
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,228
No! Let go of me, you assholes!

75
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,729
Let me go!

76
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,898
Let go off me! No!

77
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,900
Get out of here! Hurry!

78
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:50,905
No! Joon-seong! Joon-seong...

79
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,034
Joon-seong!

80
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,538
No! Let me go!

81
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,878
Shit.

82
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,679
Damn it.

83
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,904
Hey, Cheong-san, I'm...

84
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,201
so sorry.

85
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,496
I didn't know she was your mom.

86
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,918
I'm sorry.

87
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,368
I'm sorry.

88
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,385
Stop!

89
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,892
Don't do this.

90
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,023
No!

91
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,710
Mommy...

92
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,569
<i>A virus
must have a consistent pattern</i>

93
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,158
<i>for us to create a vaccine.</i>

94
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,327
<i>But the Jonas Virus...</i>

95
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,539
<i>transforms and evolves on its own.</i>

96
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,543
<i>It is an ever-changing monster.</i>

97
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,674
<i>It's impossible to create a vaccine.</i>

98
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,177
<i>There is only one solution.</i>

99
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,056
<i>Slaughter.</i>

100
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,311
<i>Completely burning and killing the host,</i>

101
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,730
<i>so not a single cell remains.</i>

102
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,027
<i>The moment we are consumed by arrogance
and think we can defeat the virus,</i>

103
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,030
<i>humankind will end.</i>

104
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,495
The file was massive,
so we couldn't analyze it all,

105
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,997
but a significant portion
of it is credible, sir.

106
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,416
And where is the proof for that?

107
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,379
Well, KDCA is creating a virus
using the exact method he described.

108
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,508
If they create the same virus,

109
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,344
then the KDCA will conclude it's credible.

110
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,513
Well...

111
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,017
Many soldiers are going insane
from this thing, but...

112
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,770
It's scarier when a scientist goes crazy.

113
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,772
Did you hear
they're expanding martial law?

114
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,065
Martial law?

115
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,944
Why would they do that
if we're handling it well?

116
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,488
My friend in the NIS analysis team

117
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,658
said they're discussing pulling back
the blockade to Yangdong

118
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,201
and expanding martial law.

119
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,706
What about Hyosan?

120
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,586
I think they're willing
to make sacrifices.

121
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,722
We may have ceased
our rescue operation for now, but...

122
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,060
there might not be another time
to rescue survivors.

123
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,773
Strengthen the blockade
on the outskirts of Hyosan.

124
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,236
The moment the blockade
is penetrated by the infected,

125
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,614
we'll have to step up and...

126
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,492
abandon Hyosan.

127
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,706
Take this.

128
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,338
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

129
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,220
Childish to think the party leader
came personally to save me.

130
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,389
You came to dump me.

131
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,516
My NIS source says

132
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,186
something is going to happen very soon
in Hyosan.

133
00:14:56,979 --> 00:15:00,774
In your district.
If something bad really does happen,

134
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:04,695
I'll say you even resigned from your post
thinking it would help prevent it.

135
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,114
No one would even think of blaming you.

136
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,532
Blame me for what?

137
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,869
Trust me, you're gonna sign it.

138
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,414
I'll protect your political career
until the end.

139
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,543
Do you need time to think it over?

140
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,420
You failed Hyosan.

141
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,634
They'll just abandon it?

142
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,178
Sign it within the day,

143
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,182
and hand it to the person in charge
of this place.

144
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,777
Hmm...

145
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,116
Sir, um, can you hear me?

146
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,786
- Let's go.
- Excuse me, sir!

147
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,120
Oh, damn.

148
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,998
Assemblywoman?
You're getting us out now, right?

149
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,585
The party leader came,
so it'll all be resolved very soon, right?

150
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,422
He says he'll save us, right?

151
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,048
Ma'am?

152
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,738
I thought about it all night long.

153
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,824
How do I live?

154
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,244
What do I do?

155
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,007
Why don't we talk about this later?

156
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,636
Tomorrow or the day after.

157
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,012
Or next week, maybe.

158
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,391
Let's get out of here and eat some food,

159
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,144
and shower first, okay?

160
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,395
We'll talk about it then.

161
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,271
Hmm?

162
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,322
We have a lot to talk about, you know?

163
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,243
Let's give it time.

164
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,466
Whatever happens...

165
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,511
please don't give up.

166
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,055
Okay?

167
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,727
Okay.

168
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,822
Never.

169
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:21,784
Mm-hmm.

170
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
You too.

171
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,373
Mm-hmm.

172
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,793
It'll be okay.

173
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,648
What is it?

174
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,776
Do you see something?

175
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,325
The smell is stronger.

176
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,837
I can't really smell anything.

177
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,258
I think they're all coming this way.

178
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,093
The smell is really strong.

179
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,306
Doesn't matter.
We're all trapped in here for good now.

180
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,642
And there's no way to get out.

181
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,728
Please don't say that.

182
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,980
So don't.

183
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,816
I think we're done.

184
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,068
Ah, damn it!

185
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,279
Let them kill us if they want.

186
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,164
Ha-ri.

187
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,085
You didn't fail
in the preliminaries, did you?

188
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,546
No.

189
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,674
I did really well.

190
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,218
Your tournament.

191
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,061
What happened?
Why did you come to the school?

192
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,978
- You're her brother?
- Yeah, I am.

193
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,856
She got a perfect score,
so she made it to nationals.

194
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,939
I saw her.

195
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,192
Really?

196
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,322
Mm-hmm. It's true.

197
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,867
No way. Really?
You're really in the nationals?

198
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,659
Mom and Dad don't know?

199
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,121
Bro, how could they now? Look around.

200
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,374
She jumped out of archery bus
and ran to the school to find you.

201
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,458
Kid.

202
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,252
You be good to her.

203
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,546
And to me too.

204
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,053
Who is she?

205
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,775
Why does she keep
talking for you?

206
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,393
She's my friend.

207
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,730
Yeah. We're freaking besties.

208
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,150
You scared me.

209
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,943
What's your deal?

210
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,530
I...

211
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,034
You?

212
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,621
I think you're the perfect girl.

213
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,498
What? You freak.

214
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,874
Hey.

215
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,919
What's wrong with you?

216
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,755
I watched you
when you were shooting your arrows,

217
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,965
I saw you train every morning.

218
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,094
I went to every tournament
and cheered for you.

219
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,679
Caught myself yelling "copper beauty"
a few times.

220
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,349
I really liked you for many years.

221
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,101
Now...

222
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,396
I wanna be a man, not just a fan.

223
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,777
I'm gonna die, anyway.
I just wanna say what I want first.

224
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,037
Cool.

225
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,332
You're Dae-su, right?

226
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,127
You call my brother "brother-in-law"?

227
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,419
Yeah.

228
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,548
So that means you knew.

229
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,842
Brother-in-law, you told her?

230
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,469
Yeah, I might have.

231
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,934
Must be nice to meet me.

232
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,394
Yes.

233
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,396
- Then you're okay with dying?
- Yes.

234
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,355
What? Today?

235
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,652
Good. I'm pissed off and needed to vent.

236
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,028
Wu-jin, stop her.

237
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,280
- Ha-ri, hey.
- Stop her.

238
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,116
- Come here. Get over here.
- I'm sorry. I was wrong.

239
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,245
- No. I'm glad you told me.
- Hey. No, that's not it.

240
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,973
- Yes, it is. Get over here now.
- No, I...

241
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,416
Why don't you understand?
I really like you.

242
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,561
- Get over here, dear husband.
- Wu-jin. Hey.

243
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,628
- Sorry.
- Stop her, Wu-jin.

244
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,838
- No!
- Beat him up, sis.

245
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,673
Get over here. You punk.

246
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,551
- He needs a good beating.
- Look at him dodging.

247
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,429
What's that?

248
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,057
That's not it!

249
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,727
Guys.

250
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,063
Come here. Gonna get you, asshole!

251
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,817
- Hey, hey, stop it. Stop it. Stop her.
- I don't want to come between you two.

252
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,320
- Right now.
- Okay. Only if you promise not to hit me.

253
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,133
Where did those shitheads run off to now?

254
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,901
What are you doing?

255
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,445
Can we move this?
Do you think it's possible?

256
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,793
We can tie all the carts in a circle,
then we can just use them as a shield.

257
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,551
This way.

258
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,346
We need strings or something
to tie them together.

259
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,015
Is this it?

260
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,684
This?

261
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,234
Cut as many as possible.

262
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,155
Hey. There's no way this is going to work.

263
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,450
We should flip it over completely,
so that we can hide underneath.

264
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,536
Uh... We should stand it up.

265
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,830
Yeah, zombies sure can't climb that?

266
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,331
That's enough.

267
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,917
Don't be stupid. Okay? Let's redo them.

268
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,753
It's too short if we close the lids.

269
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,130
Unless you want us crawling?

270
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,007
Pulling rank right now?

271
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,133
Hey.

272
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,385
Say it to my face!

273
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,012
If you don't like it, make your own.

274
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,059
There.

275
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,644
Oh, shit. Are you crazy?

276
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,687
What's wrong with you?

277
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,150
- Sis, stop her.
- Come on. Say that again.

278
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,277
Do everyone a favor
and stay out of our way.

279
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,487
Hey, you.

280
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,990
Shithead!

281
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,242
"Shithead"? Shithead. What the fuck?

282
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,326
Stop it.

283
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,662
Joon-yeong, you too.

284
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,748
Who the hell is she to tell us
we have to redo it?

285
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,500
"Who the hell is she?"
Your fucking nightmare.

286
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,587
- You're coming with us, right?
- You're the ones coming with me.

287
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,673
You won't just leave them here, right?

288
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,883
I wish, but no.

289
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,136
We're going together, anyway.
Why fight now, huh?

290
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,513
Just do as I say
unless you wanna die out there.

291
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,598
Which you might.

292
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,921
We're tryna make it that high,
so we don't die out there.

293
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,393
Enough already.

294
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,397
How many people have died on our way here?

295
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,461
We can't lose anyone else.

296
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,319
We shouldn't waste energy
fighting among ourselves.

297
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,820
I'm not fighting to die.

298
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,323
I'm fighting because I wanna live.

299
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,992
Then do as I fucking say, asshead.

300
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,912
Unless we split up.

301
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,205
Problem solved.

302
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,100
- Get back here. You hear me?
- Joon-yeong.

303
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,250
Get back here!

304
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,752
Let go of me, asshole!

305
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,670
You think I'm doing this,
because I wanna die?

306
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,010
We'll vote on it.

307
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,595
You are?

308
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:03,972
Class prez.

309
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,769
One. Split up.

310
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,691
Two. Stay together.

311
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:21,157
- Okay, we voted to stay together, then.
- Is it smart to vote

312
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,701
on life and death matters
and just follow the majority?

313
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,996
What if we collectively decide
to do the wrong thing?

314
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,457
You know, there's such a thing
as collective intelligence.

315
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,301
There are too many
unintelligent people here.

316
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,837
You can't make intelligence
with a bunch of idiots.

317
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,422
So then what do you suggest?

318
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,133
Do we vote about voting, huh?

319
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,261
Fuck! How the hell did
your kids survive up to now?

320
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,430
Sorry, but can you mind your own business?

321
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,765
You started the fight, now we're voting.

322
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,475
Give me an arrow, so I can stab him.

323
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,060
Anyway, let's move on now.

324
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,397
One. We make the outside higher.

325
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,657
Five votes.

326
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,075
Two.

327
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,455
We fold the lids, make a box.

328
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,128
So that's four.

329
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,630
What the hell? I thought you were with us?

330
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:19,882
I changed my mind.

331
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:24,304
Option one received the majority vote,
so make the walls high.

332
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,723
Wait. Your vote.

333
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,477
If you're for option two, it's a tie.

334
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,812
Option one.

335
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,272
Oh, shit.

336
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,567
Okay. Let's do it.

337
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,820
Okay, but don't resent me
when the zombies climb over

338
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,113
and kill us all.

339
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,908
Don't worry, I'll take the front
and any blame.

340
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,075
You hold back.

341
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,328
Oh, what an asshole. Fuck.

342
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,705
Why are kids so damn rude these days?

343
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,040
And you're not?

344
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,585
Don't say that in front
of the underclassmen.

345
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:00,673
This is the virus that was created
using Lee Byeong-chan's method precisely.

346
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,760
This is a sample from an infected.

347
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:07,222
The two viruses
are 98 percent match.

348
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,601
Are you saying everything he says
in the videos is true?

349
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,938
Yes. When someone gets infected,
their heart stops.

350
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,439
Only the virus survives.

351
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,942
It stimulates the brainstem
and moves the body.

352
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,777
They're like moving corpses.

353
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,614
We haven't found any way to save the dead.

354
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,494
You're telling me that he's dead?

355
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:34,290
Staff Sergeant Lee Jae-jun is dead
from a medical perspective.

356
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,960
But she's, ugh...

357
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,878
Difficult to explain.

358
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,674
She was found alive.

359
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,971
There has never been a virus with such
a fast rate of infection in history.

360
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,807
Our only solution
is getting rid of the host.

361
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,060
I'm not going to tolerate
the sign of indifference!

362
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,271
Your only job is to find me a cure.

363
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,651
Commander, sir.

364
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,319
They broke through the barricade.

365
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,463
It's spreading into Yangdong.

366
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,935
How bad is the spread?

367
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,870
They're taking route 643
into downtown Yangdong.

368
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,873
<i>We sent army reservists
in the area to the barricades.</i>

369
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,921
Send all the reservists to create
a lockdown zone in Yangdong

370
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,339
and evacuate the city.

371
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,133
- Call in all the advisers.
- Yes, sir.

372
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,803
You said you had a friend in the NIS?

373
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,096
Yes.

374
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,890
Ask him to meet officially.

375
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:32,973
Yes, sir.

376
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,732
You have to tie
the knots harder.

377
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,567
Here too?

378
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,131
- I hope we're not doing...
- Can you do it?

379
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,907
- ...anything stupid.
- My hands hurt.

380
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,051
- Just do it.
- Hey, that looks good.

381
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,635
Hand it to me. We're gonna die, anyway.

382
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,388
- Hey, come here.
- Me?

383
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,999
- I almost got killed confessing...
- Hey. Chocolate bar.

384
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,795
Let me see.

385
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,465
You think we can eat it, huh?

386
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,593
Oh, no, expired.

387
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,928
Okay, so what?

388
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,221
Okay, yeah, you're right.

389
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,691
Only take a tiny bite.

390
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,236
It needs to feed all of us. Okay?

391
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,410
Oh, shit. I said a tiny bite.

392
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,829
I only ate freaking this much.

393
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,207
Selfish bastard.

394
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,719
I'm full, so...

395
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,071
Mmm.

396
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,169
I really don't want that. Here.

397
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,218
- Hey.
- What?

398
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,678
Joon-yeong didn't have any.

399
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,098
How could you eat it all?

400
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,769
I...

401
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,273
I... I thought I was last. I'm really sorry.

402
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:50,236
I guess we just... armor up, right?

403
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:56,325
- That asshole.
- Joon-yeong, you put on the best armor.

404
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,088
Take off your shoes
and I'll do yours first.

405
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,300
Just hold on a sec.

406
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
Hold on tight.

407
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,780
Hey, Cheong-san.

408
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,947
What?

409
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,079
Do you really hate me?

410
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,330
Mm-mmm.

411
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,413
Why not?

412
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,456
Crazy.

413
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,876
I've never hated you at all.

414
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,378
That amazes me too.

415
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,482
This is it.

416
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,027
Here we go.

417
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,111
Hold on.

418
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,657
This will work?

419
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,367
It will work.

420
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,997
- Just stay next to me, okay?
- You stay next to me.

421
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,781
And don't get killed.

422
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,299
You don't want it, so we both can't move.

423
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,886
I'm scared.

424
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,357
I'm gonna take the lead.
You take the back.

425
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,406
Are you ready?

426
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,701
Shit.

427
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,328
You better be right with this.

428
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,455
We've seen so many zombies already.

429
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,626
They're not smart enough for this.

430
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,061
Push!

431
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,229
Hurry!

432
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,898
Let's go!

433
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:34,650
More!

434
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,734
Turn!

435
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,402
Turn!

436
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,740
Get in! Get in!

437
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,576
Close it!

438
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,581
Did you tie it?

439
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,666
Done! Push!

440
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,750
Push!

441
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,883
Push!

442
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,509
Damn it!

443
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,845
They're climbing over!

444
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,892
It won't budge!

445
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,684
Push harder!

446
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,312
We can do this!

447
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,317
- Push harder! Harder!
- It won't move!

448
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,104
Be careful!

449
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,274
On-jo!

450
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,362
What are you doing? Push!

451
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,936
Su-hyeok! Above you!

452
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,065
Fuck!

453
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,874
Hey, are you okay?

454
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,252
Oh, shit.

455
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,848
Shit. I said I'd take responsibility.

456
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,769
- Where are you going?
- Hey, wait!

457
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,896
- Joon-yeong!
- Hey! Hey!

458
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,147
Joon-yeong!

459
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,270
- Where are you going?
- Hey! Don't go!

460
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,240
Get off!

461
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,663
Push! Push!

462
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,167
Hurry up and push!

463
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,601
Go home! Make it home!

464
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,562
Go home!

465
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,524
Make it home!

466
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,610
No! Hey!

467
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,073
- Ugh! Joon-seong!
- Keep going!

468
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,283
Keep going!

469
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,412
Keep going! Keep going...

470
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,543
No! No, stop it!

471
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,212
No! Wait!

472
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,465
I'm sorry!

473
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,477
Push!

474
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,190
Push!

475
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,990
Push!

476
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,416
Damn it!

477
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,083
HYOSAN

478
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,627
Each of those red dots

479
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,671
is the location
of a random cell phone in Hyosan.

480
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:54,553
At first, they begin with erratic movement
and that gives us nothing to analyze.

481
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,266
But slowly, they move collectively.

482
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,438
If you look at them as a whole,
they're traveling outward.

483
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,610
Because there is nobody left
in the city to eat.

484
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,197
They're slowly beginning
to increase their territory.

485
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,242
Consider them like a dangerous animal
in the mountains

486
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,370
entering civilization
when they run out of food.

487
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,122
Let's just cut to the chase.

488
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,376
You predicted a spread, right?

489
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,546
That's why you proposed
expanding martial law

490
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,381
to the NSC when Yangdong's gone.

491
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,888
So it isn't entirely precise.

492
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,764
But look.

493
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:44,436
In one week, it reaches Seongnam,
Hanam, Gwacheon, Anyang,

494
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,520
and Gwangmyeong.

495
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,859
Coming right after, the city of Seoul.

496
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,070
Seems a bit of a stretch, if you ask me.

497
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,613
Just one person.

498
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,907
It's a simulation of what will happen

499
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,493
if just one infected person
gets out of Hyosan.

500
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,397
That's what will happen.

501
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,757
Her heart rate
is reaching 250.

502
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,303
Abnormal heart rate detected!

503
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:34,320
I'M HUNGRY

504
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:44,079
Tell Tactics to come up
with a strategy to bomb Hyosan.

505
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,082
To bomb the city, sir?

506
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,711
Do you really plan to blow up Hyosan?

507
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,089
Hyosan may fall, but Korea will remain.

508
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,467
Act like a damn soldier.

509
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,426
We can't.

510
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,261
The infected are one thing,

511
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,472
but what about the civilians
that we haven't rescued?

512
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,807
Don't think about the ones
we have to kill.

513
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,393
The ones we will save
will justify everything.

514
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,783
WARNING: NO TRESPASSING
PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNED BY THE SCHOOL

515
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,569
Just a little bit more!

516
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,280
Untie it! Untie it!

517
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,537
It's untied! Push!

518
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,372
Push!

519
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:20,926
The door won't open!

520
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:21,844
Fuck.

521
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,053
What are you talking about?

522
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,346
The door won't open!

523
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,199
Ha-ri!

524
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:54,084
Fuckers! Get lost! Get out!

525
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,211
Let go! Damn it!

526
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:52,893
Come on. Hurry up already!

527
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:56,396
It won't open.
It's locked from the outside.

528
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,692
Shit.

529
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:49,283
Dad, you...
