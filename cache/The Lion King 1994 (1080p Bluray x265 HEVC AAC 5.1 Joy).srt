00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:17,758

<i>The circle of life</i>

53
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,549
Life's not fair, is it?

54
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:08,011
You see, I... Well, I shall never be king.

55
00:05:09,596 --> 00:05:13,475
And you shall never see
the light of another day.

56
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:19,523
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with your food?

57
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:21,441
What do you want?

58
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:24,903
I'm here to announce that
King Mufasa's on his way,

59
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:28,574
so you'd better have a good excuse
for missing this morning's ceremony.

60
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:30,284
Oh, look, Zazu.

61
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:31,618
You've made me lose my lunch.

62
00:05:31,702 --> 00:05:34,621
You'll lose more than that
when the king gets through with you.

63
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:37,374
He's as mad as a hippo with a hernia.

64
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,919
I quiver with fear!

65
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:43,547
Now, Scar, don't look at me that way.

66
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:44,923
Help !

67
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:46,341
Scar?

68
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:48,552
Drop him.

69
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:51,889
lmpeccable timing, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:59,021
Why, if it isn't my big brother
descending from on high

71
00:05:59,104 --> 00:06:01,148
to mingle with the commoners.

72
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:04,359
Sarabi and I didn't see you
at the presentation of Simba.

73
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:06,570
That was today?

74
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,989
I feel simply awful !

75
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,951
Must've slipped my mind.

76
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:16,246
Yes, well, as slippery as your mind is,

77
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,249
as the king's brother,
you should've been first in line !

78
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:24,296
Well, I was first in line,
until the little hairball was born.

79
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:29,384
That hairball is my son
and your future king.

80
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:32,137
I shall practise my curtsy!

81
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:34,806
Don't turn your back on me, Scar.

82
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,225
Oh, no, Mufasa.

83
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:39,144
Perhaps you shouldn't
turn your back on me.

84
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:42,147
Is that a challenge?

85
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:43,732
Temper, temper.

86
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,985
I wouldn't dream of challenging you.

87
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:48,987
Pity. Why not?

88
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:52,407
Well, as far as brains go,
I got the lion's share.

89
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:55,827
But when it comes to brute strength,

90
00:06:55,911 --> 00:07:00,082
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end
of the gene pool.

91
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:05,462
There's one in every family, sire.

92
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:07,089
Two in mine, actually,

93
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:10,300
and they always manage to
ruin special occasions.

94
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:12,344
What am I going to do with him?

95
00:07:12,427 --> 00:07:14,179
He'd make a very handsome throw rug.

96
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:15,347
Zazu !

97
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,850
And just think, whenever he gets dirty,

98
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:20,018
you could take him out and beat him.

99
00:08:05,564 --> 00:08:07,232
Simba.

100
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:22,080
Dad ! Dad !

101
00:08:22,164 --> 00:08:24,583
Come on, dad, we gotta go ! Wake up !

102
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:27,085
Sorry.

103
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:30,380
Dad ! Dad !

104
00:08:30,464 --> 00:08:33,342
Your son is awake.

105
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:36,470
Before sunrise, he's your son.

106
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:38,680
Dad ! Come on, Dad.

107
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:45,103
You promised.

108
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:47,814
Okay, Okay. I'm up, I'm up.

109
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,024
Yeah !

110
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,375
Look, Simba.

111
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,546
Everything the light
touches is our kingdom.

112
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:12,339
Wow.

113
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:17,344
A king's time as ruler
rises and falls like the sun.

114
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:21,390
One day, Simba,
the sun will set on my time here

115
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:24,893
and will rise with you as the new king.

116
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:27,688
-  And this'll all be mine?
- Everything.

117
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:30,649
Everything the light touches.

118
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:32,901
What about that shadowy place?

119
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:35,112
That's beyond our borders.

120
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:36,572
You must never go there, Simba.

121
00:09:36,655 --> 00:09:38,740
But I thought a king
can do whatever he wants.

122
00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:42,160
Oh, there's more to being king
than getting your way all the time.

123
00:09:42,244 --> 00:09:44,580
- There's more?
- Simba...

124
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:52,754
Everything you see exists together
in a delicate balance.

125
00:09:52,838 --> 00:09:55,757
As king, you need to
understand that balance

126
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:57,593
and respect all the creatures,

127
00:09:57,676 --> 00:10:00,512
from the crawling ant
to the leaping antelope.

128
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:02,431
But, Dad, don't we eat the antelope?

129
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:05,100
Yes, Simba, but let me explain.

130
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,145
When we die, our bodies
become the grass,

131
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:10,898
and the antelope eat the grass.

132
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:16,236
And so we are all connected
in the great circle of life.

133
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,572
- Good morning, sire !
- Good morning, Zazu.

134
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:20,574
Checking in with the morning report.

135
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:21,742
Fire away.

136
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:23,410
Well ! The buzz from the bees

137
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:25,412
is that the leopards
are in a bit of a spot.

138
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:26,580
Really?

139
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:28,999
What are you doing, son?

140
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,667
Pouncing.

141
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:33,128
Let an old pro show you how it's done.

142
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:36,089
I told the elephants to forget it,
but they can't...

143
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:38,008
- Zazu, would you turn around?
- Yes, sire.

144
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:39,176
The cheetahs are hard up, but...

145
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:40,928
Stay low to the ground.

146
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:42,262
Cheetahs never prosper...

147
00:10:42,346 --> 00:10:44,431
Yeah, okay.
Stay low to the ground, right? Yeah.

148
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:45,682
- What going on?
- A pouncing lesson.

149
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:48,018
Very good. Pouncing.

150
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:51,522
Pouncing?
No, sire, you can't be serious...

151
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:54,274
This is so humiliating.

152
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:55,943
Try not to make a sound.

153
00:10:56,026 --> 00:10:58,320
What are you telling him, Mufasa?

154
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:01,657
Mufasa? Simba?

155
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:06,703
That's very good.

156
00:11:07,371 --> 00:11:08,622
- Zazu !
- Yes !

157
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:11,375
- News from the underground.
- Now, this time...

158
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,711
Sire ! Hyenas in the Pride Lands !

159
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:16,296
Zazu, take Simba home.

160
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,548
Dad, can't I come?

161
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,715
No, son.

162
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,969
I never get to go anywhere.

163
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:26,139
Young master,
one day, you will be king.

164
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:30,143
Then you can chase those
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers

165
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:32,229
from dawn until dusk.

166
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:41,655
Hey, U ncle Scar! Guess what?

167
00:11:41,738 --> 00:11:44,825
I despise guessing games.

168
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:46,994
I'm gonna be King of Pride Rock.

169
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:49,329
Oh, goody!

170
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:51,165
My dad just showed me
the whole kingdom,

171
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:54,251
and I'm gonna rule it all !

172
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:57,838
Yes. Well, forgive me
for not leaping for joy.

173
00:11:57,921 --> 00:12:00,257
Bad back, you know.

174
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:02,426
Hey, U ncle Scar.

175
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:04,845
When I'm king, what'll that make you?

176
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:07,181
A monkey's uncle.

177
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:11,101
- You're so weird.
- You have no idea.

178
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:14,354
So, your father showed you
the whole kingdom, did he?

179
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:15,522
Everything.

180
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:19,193
He didn't show you what's beyond
that rise at the northern border?

181
00:12:19,568 --> 00:12:22,696
Well, no. He said I can't go there.

182
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,781
And he's absolutely right.

183
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:26,200
It's far too dangerous.

184
00:12:26,283 --> 00:12:28,702
Only the bravest lions go there.

185
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:31,455
Well, I'm brave. What's out there?

186
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,957
I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you.

187
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,125
Why not?

188
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:39,630
I'm only looking out for the
well-being of my favourite nephew.

189
00:12:39,755 --> 00:12:42,549
Yeah, right! I'm your only nephew.

190
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:45,135
All the more reason
for me to be protective.

191
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:49,473
An elephant graveyard is no place
for a young prince. Oops !

192
00:12:49,765 --> 00:12:52,142
An elephant what? Whoa !

193
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:55,395
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

194
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:58,315
Well, I suppose you'd have
found out sooner or later,

195
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:01,401
you being so clever and all.

196
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:03,153
J ust do me one favour.

197
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,824
Promise me you'll never visit
that dreadful place.

198
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,326
No problem.

199
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:11,078
There's a good lad.

200
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,914
You run along now and have fun.

201
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:15,499
And remember,

202
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:18,085
it's our little secret.

203
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:27,177
- Hey, Nala.
- H i, Simba.

204
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:29,429
Come on. I just heard
about this great place.

205
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:32,015
Simba ! I'm kind of
in the middle of a bath.

206
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,184
And it's time for yours.

207
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,271
Mom !

208
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:40,274
Mom, you're messing up my mane !

209
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:44,111
Okay, okay, I'm clean.
Can we go now?

210
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:45,529
So, where are we going?

211
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:47,114
It better not be anyplace dumb.

212
00:13:47,197 --> 00:13:49,032
No, it's really cool.

213
00:13:49,157 --> 00:13:51,702
So, where is this really cool place?

214
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:55,873
-  Around the water hole.
- The water hole?

215
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:57,791
What's so great about the water hole?

216
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,043
I'll show you when we get there.

217
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:03,213
Mom, can I go with Simba?

218
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:05,549
What do you think, Sarabi?

219
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:06,717
Well...

220
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:08,135
- Please?
- Please?

221
00:14:08,218 --> 00:14:09,386
It's all right with me.

222
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:10,554
- Yeah !
- All right!

223
00:14:10,637 --> 00:14:12,556
As long as Zazu goes with you.

224
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,224
No, not Zazu.

225
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:15,809
Step lively.

226
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:19,897
The sooner we get to the water hole,
the sooner we can leave.

227
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,857
So, where are we really going?

228
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:23,358
An elephant graveyard.

229
00:14:23,483 --> 00:14:24,568
Wow!

230
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:25,986
Zazu.

231
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:28,822
Right. So, how are we
gonna ditch the dodo?

232
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:31,742
J ust look at you two.

233
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:34,912
Little seeds of romance
blossoming in the savanna.

234
00:14:35,037 --> 00:14:37,247
Your parents will be thrilled,

235
00:14:37,372 --> 00:14:39,708
what with your being betrothed and all.

236
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,918
Be-what?

237
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:42,669
Betrothed. lntended.

238
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:44,588
Affianced.

239
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:45,756
Meaning...

240
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:48,842
One day, you two are
going to be married.

241
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:50,010
Yuck!

242
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:52,221
I can't marry her. She's my friend.

243
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:54,515
Yeah, it'd be so weird.

244
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:56,558
Sorry to bust your bubble,

245
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:59,228
but you two turtle doves
have no choice.

246
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:01,772
It's a tradition going back generations.

247
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:04,399
When I'm king,
that'll be the first thing to go.

248
00:15:04,483 --> 00:15:07,319
- Not so long as I'm around.
- Well, in that case, you're fired.

249
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:09,821
N ice try, but only the king can do that.

250
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:11,490
Well, he's the future king.

251
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,951
Yeah, so you have to do what I tell you.

252
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,494
Not yet, I don't.

253
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:17,037
And with an attitude like that,

254
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,916
I'm afraid you're shaping up to be
a pretty pathetic king, indeed.

255
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,626
Not the way I see it.

256
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:25,754
<i>I'm gonna be a mighty king</i>

257
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:27,923
<i>So enemies beware</i>

258
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:30,592
<i>WeII, I've never seen</i>
<i>a king of beasts</i>

259
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,845
<i>With quite so little hair</i>

260
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,556
<i>I'm gonna be the main event</i>

261
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,683
<i>Like no king was before</i>

262
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:40,394
<i>I'm brushin' up on lookin' down</i>

263
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:42,604
<i>I'm workin' on my roar</i>

264
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:46,316
<i>Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing</i>

265
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:51,280
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

266
00:15:51,363 --> 00:15:54,533
You've rather a long way to go,
young master, if you think...

267
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:56,952
<i>-No one sayin', "Do this"</i>
<i>-Now, when I said that...</i>

268
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:59,454
<i>-No one saying, "Be there"</i>
<i>-What I meant was...</i>

269
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,874
<i>-No one sayin', "Stop that"</i>
<i>-You don't realise...</i>

270
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,793
<i>-No one sayin', "See here"</i>
<i>-Now, see here!</i>

271
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:08,213
<i>Free to run around all day</i>

272
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:09,882
Well, that's definitely out.

273
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:14,011
<i>Free to do it all my way</i>

274
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:19,308
<i>I think it's time that you and I</i>

275
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:21,476
<i>Arranged a heart-to-heart</i>

276
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,312
<i>Kings don't need advice</i>

277
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:25,981
<i>From little hornbills for a start</i>

278
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:29,526
<i>If this is where</i>
<i>the monarchy is headed</i>

279
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:30,819
<i>Count me out</i>

280
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:33,322
<i>Out of service, out of Africa</i>

281
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:35,991
<i>I wouldn't hang about</i>

282
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:40,370
<i>This child is getting</i>
<i>wildly out of wing</i>

283
00:16:40,496 --> 00:16:44,917
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

284
00:16:57,513 --> 00:16:59,223
<i>Everybody, look left</i>

285
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:02,100
<i>Everybody, look right</i>

286
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:04,686
<i>Everywhere you look, I'm</i>

287
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,396
<i>Standing in the spotlight</i>

288
00:17:06,522 --> 00:17:08,190
Not yet!

289
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:12,069
<i>Let every creature</i>
<i>go for broke and sing</i>

290
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,031
<i>Let's hear it in the herd</i>
<i>and on the wing</i>

291
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:21,703
<i>It's gonna be</i>
<i>King Simba's finest fling</i>

292
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:26,708
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

293
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:31,630
<i>Oh, I just can't wait to be king</i>

294
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:36,593
<i>Oh, I just can't wait</i>

295
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:39,930
<i>To be king</i>

296
00:17:46,144 --> 00:17:48,897
I beg your pardon, madam, but

297
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:50,941
get off!

298
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:52,609
Simba?

299
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,945
Nala !

300
00:17:57,322 --> 00:17:58,699
All right! It worked !

301
00:17:58,782 --> 00:18:01,285
- We lost him.
- I am a genius.

302
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,412
Hey, genius, it was my idea.

303
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:05,664
Yeah, but I pulled it off.

304
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,749
- With me !
- Yeah?

305
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,006
- Pinned ya.
- Hey, let me up !

306
00:18:18,802 --> 00:18:20,929
Pinned ya again.

307
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,652
This is it. We made it.

308
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:41,450
Whoa !

309
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:45,829
It's really creepy.

310
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:46,997
Yeah.

311
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:48,332
lsn't it great?

312
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:51,543
- We could get in big trouble.
- I know!

313
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:54,755
I wonder if its brains are still in there.

314
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:56,715
There's only one way to know.

315
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,634
Come on, let's go check it out.

316
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:02,346
Wrong ! The only checking out you
will do will be to check out of here.

317
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:03,680
Oh, man !

318
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:06,225
We're way beyond the boundary
of the Pride Lands.

319
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:07,935
Look, banana beak is scared.

320
00:19:08,018 --> 00:19:10,812
It's Mr banana beak to you, fuzzy,

321
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:14,316
and right now we are all
in very real danger.

322
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:15,817
Danger?

323
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:17,986
I walk on the wild side.

324
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,322
I laugh in the face of danger.

325
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:32,417
Well, well, well, Banzai,
what have we got here?

326
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:34,419
I don't know, Shenzi.

327
00:19:35,212 --> 00:19:36,922
What do you think, Ed?

328
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:40,884
J ust what I was thinking.

329
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:42,970
A trio of trespassers !

330
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:45,264
And quite by accident,
let me assure you.

331
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:47,182
A simple navigational error.

332
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,226
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

333
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:53,313
I know you.
You're Mufasa's little stooge.

334
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:55,691
I, madam, am the king's major-domo.

335
00:19:55,774 --> 00:19:57,359
And that would make you...

336
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:58,735
The future king.

337
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:02,447
Do you know what we do to kings
who step out of their kingdom?

338
00:20:03,407 --> 00:20:05,242
You can't do anything to me.

339
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:07,578
Technically, they can.
We are on their land.

340
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:11,874
But you told me they're nothing but
slobbering, mangy, stupid poachers.

341
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:13,500
lx-nay on the upid-stay.

342
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,712
- Who are you callin' upid-stay?
- My, my, my. Look at the sun !

343
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:18,964
- It's time to go !
- What's the hurry?

344
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,883
We'd love you to
stick around for dinner.

345
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:24,386
Yeah, we could have
whatever's lion around !

346
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:26,388
Wait, wait, wait, I got one, I got one !

347
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:29,600
Make mine a cub sandwich !
Whaddaya think?

348
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:33,770
What, Ed? What is it?

349
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:35,689
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

350
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:36,857
No, why?

351
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:39,109
'Cause there it goes !

352
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:48,035
- Did we lose 'em?
- I think so.

353
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,536
Where's Zazu?

354
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:51,747
The little major-domo bird
hippety-hopped

355
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,874
all the way to the birdie-boiler.

356
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,002
No ! Not the birdie-boiler!

357
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:03,634
Hey, why don't you pick
on somebody your own size?

358
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:06,136
- Like you?
- Oops.

359
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:10,307
Boo !

360
00:21:22,402 --> 00:21:24,321
Simba !

361
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:45,843
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

362
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:51,682
That was it?

363
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:54,059
Do it again. Come on.

364
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:08,532
- Please, please ! U ncle, uncle !
- Silence !

365
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:11,827
- We're gonna shut up right now!
- Calm down. We're really sorry.

366
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,038
If you ever come near my son again...

367
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:16,790
This is... This is your son?

368
00:22:16,874 --> 00:22:19,376
- Your son.
- Did you know that?

369
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:21,879
No. Me? I didn't know... No, did you?

370
00:22:21,962 --> 00:22:23,881
- No, of course not.
- No.

371
00:22:23,964 --> 00:22:25,048
Ed?

372
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:29,720
Toodles.

373
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:39,730
- Dad, I...
- You deliberately disobeyed me.

374
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:43,984
- Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.
- Let's go home.

375
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,615
I thought you were very brave.

376
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,841
Zazu.

377
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:11,094
Yes, sire?

378
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:15,474
Take Nala home.
I've got to teach my son a lesson.

379
00:23:19,686 --> 00:23:21,605
Come, Nala.

380
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:25,108
Simba, good luck.

381
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:32,783
Simba !

382
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:02,312
Simba, I'm very disappointed in you.

383
00:24:02,396 --> 00:24:04,815
- I know.
- You could've been killed.

384
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:06,859
You deliberately disobeyed me,

385
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:10,696
and what's worse,
you put Nala in danger.

386
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:13,365
I was just trying to be brave, like you.

387
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,827
I'm only brave when I have to be.

388
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,539
Simba, being brave

389
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:22,958
doesn't mean you go looking for trouble.

390
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,085
But you're not scared of anything.

391
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:27,379
I was today.

392
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:29,631
- You were?
- Yes.

393
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:31,842
I thought I might lose you.

394
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:35,929
I guess even kings get scared, huh?

395
00:24:37,264 --> 00:24:39,516
- But you know what?
- What?

396
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,144
I think those hyenas
were even scareder.

397
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,899
'Cause nobody messes with your dad.

398
00:24:46,982 --> 00:24:49,443
- Come here, you.
- No ! No !

399
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:54,615
Come here !

400
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:56,700
Gotcha !

401
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:03,499
Dad?

402
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:06,335
- We're pals, right?
- Right.

403
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,171
And we'll always be together, right?

404
00:25:10,464 --> 00:25:16,178
Simba, let me tell you something
that my father told me.

405
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:18,180
Look at the stars.

406
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:23,352
The great kings of the past
look down on us from those stars.

407
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,729
- Really?
- Yes.

408
00:25:25,812 --> 00:25:28,106
So whenever you feel alone,

409
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,945
just remember that those kings
will always be there to guide you.

410
00:25:34,404 --> 00:25:36,281
And so will I.

411
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,667
Man, that lousy Mufasa.
I won't be able to sit for a week.

412
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:51,505
It's not funny, Ed.

413
00:25:55,342 --> 00:25:57,511
Hey, shut up !

414
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:01,974
Will you knock it off?

415
00:26:03,183 --> 00:26:06,186
- Well, he started it.
- Look at you guys.

416
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:08,856
No wonder we're dangling
at the bottom of the food chain.

417
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:10,440
Man, I hate dangling.

418
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:14,361
Yeah? If it weren't for those lions,
we'd be runnin' the joint.

419
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:15,863
Man, I hate lions.

420
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:17,614
- So pushy.
- And hairy.

421
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:19,783
- And stinky.
- And, man, are they...

422
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:21,869
Ugly!

423
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:27,040
Surely we lions are not all that bad.

424
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:29,960
Scar. It's just you.

425
00:26:30,043 --> 00:26:32,129
We were afraid it was
somebody important.

426
00:26:32,212 --> 00:26:33,630
Yeah, you know, like Mufasa.

427
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:35,257
- Yeah.
- I see.

428
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,634
- Now that's power!
- Tell me about it.

429
00:26:37,718 --> 00:26:39,469
I just hear that name and I shudder.

430
00:26:39,553 --> 00:26:42,139
- Mufasa !
- Do it again.

431
00:26:42,222 --> 00:26:43,557
Mufasa !

432
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:46,226
Mufasa ! Mufasa ! Mufasa !

433
00:26:46,935 --> 00:26:48,103
It tingles me.

434
00:26:48,187 --> 00:26:51,064
I'm surrounded by idiots.

435
00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:54,234
Now, you, Scar, I mean, you're
one of us. I mean, you're our pal.

436
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,485
Charmed.

437
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:59,698
I like that. He's not king,
but he's still so proper.

438
00:26:59,781 --> 00:27:01,658
Yeah. Hey, did you
bring us anything to eat,

439
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:03,827
Scar, old buddy, old pal?
H uh? Did ya, did ya, did ya?

440
00:27:03,911 --> 00:27:06,246
I don't think you really deserve this.

441
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:09,416
I practically gift-wrapped
those cubs for you,

442
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:12,920
and you couldn't even dispose of them.

443
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:19,676
Well, you know, it wasn't exactly
like they was alone, Scar.

444
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,929
Yeah. What were we supposed to do?

445
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:23,931
Kill Mufasa?

446
00:27:25,682 --> 00:27:27,601
Precisely.

447
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:41,949
<i>I know that your powers of retention</i>

448
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:45,786
<i>Are as wet as a warthog's backside</i>

449
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:50,040
<i>But thick as you are, pay attention</i>

450
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:53,877
<i>My words are a matter of pride</i>

451
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:57,631
<i>It's clear from your vacant expressions</i>

452
00:27:57,756 --> 00:28:01,635
<i>The lights are not all on upstairs</i>

453
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,138
<i>But we're talking kings</i>
<i>and successions</i>

454
00:28:05,264 --> 00:28:07,975
<i>Even you can't be caught unawares</i>

455
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:12,980
<i>So prepare for the chance of a lifetime</i>

456
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:17,442
<i>Be prepared for sensational news</i>

457
00:28:17,526 --> 00:28:21,363
<i>A shiny new era is tiptoeing nearer</i>

458
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:23,031
<i>And where do we feature?</i>

459
00:28:23,115 --> 00:28:25,325
<i>Just listen to teacher</i>

460
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:27,286
<i>I know it sounds sordid</i>

461
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:29,246
<i>But you'll be rewarded</i>

462
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:32,875
<i>When at last I am given my dues</i>

463
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:36,503
<i>And injustice deliciously squared</i>

464
00:28:36,587 --> 00:28:39,798
<i>Be prepared</i>

465
00:28:39,882 --> 00:28:43,969
Yeah, be prepared.
We'll be prepared. For what?

466
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:45,345
For the death of the king.

467
00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:47,890
- Why, is he sick?
- No, fool, we're going to kill him.

468
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:51,310
- And Simba, too.
- Great idea. Who needs a king?

469
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:54,188
<i>No king, no king</i>

470
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:57,274
- ldiots ! There will be a king !
- Hey, but you said...

471
00:28:57,357 --> 00:28:59,359
I will be king !

472
00:28:59,443 --> 00:29:01,153
Stick with me,

473
00:29:01,236 --> 00:29:05,157
and you'll never go hungry again.

474
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,576
- Yeah ! All right!
- Long live the king !

475
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:11,079
Long live the king ! Long live the king !

476
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:16,251
<i>It's great that we'll soon be connected</i>

477
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:20,589
<i>With a king who'll be all-time adored</i>

478
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:24,176
<i>Of course, quid pro quo</i>
<i>you're expected</i>

479
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:28,263
<i>To take certain duties on board</i>

480
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:32,100
<i>The future is littered with prizes</i>

481
00:29:32,226 --> 00:29:36,605
<i>And though I'm the main addressee</i>

482
00:29:36,688 --> 00:29:40,025
<i>The point that I must emphasise is</i>

483
00:29:40,108 --> 00:29:43,028
<i>You won't get a sniff without me!</i>

484
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:47,533
<i>So prepare for the coup of the century</i>

485
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:51,954
<i>Be prepared for the murkiest scam</i>

486
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,705
<i>Meticulous planning</i>

487
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:55,707
<i>Tenacity spanning</i>

488
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:57,876
<i>Decades of denial</i>

489
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,630
<i>Is simply why I'll be king undisputed</i>

490
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:03,632
<i>Respected, saluted</i>

491
00:30:03,757 --> 00:30:07,135
<i>And seen for the wonder I am</i>

492
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:10,973
<i>Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared</i>

493
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:14,309
<i>Be prepared</i>

494
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:18,814
<i>Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared</i>

495
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:22,818
<i>Be prepared</i>

496
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:39,751
You wait here. Your father has
a marvellous surprise for you.

497
00:30:39,835 --> 00:30:41,086
What is it?

498
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,381
If I told you, it wouldn't be
a surprise now, would it?

499
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:46,466
If you tell me,
I'll still act surprised.

500
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:50,429
You are such a naughty boy.

501
00:30:50,512 --> 00:30:53,640
- Come on, U ncle Scar.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

502
00:30:53,724 --> 00:30:56,059
This is just for you and your daddy.

503
00:30:56,185 --> 00:31:00,814
You know, a sort of father-son thing.

504
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:03,692
Well, I'd better go get him.

505
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:05,611
- I'll go with you.
- No.

506
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,824
No. J ust stay on this rock.

507
00:31:10,908 --> 00:31:12,910
You wouldn't want to end up
in another mess

508
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:14,703
like you did with the hyenas.

509
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,707
- You know about that?
- Simba, everybody knows about that.

510
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,376
- Really?
- Yes.

511
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,172
Lucky daddy was there
to save you, eh?

512
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:27,966
And just between us,

513
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,428
you might want to work on
that little roar of yours, hmm?

514
00:31:32,596 --> 00:31:33,722
Okay.

515
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:39,728
Hey, U ncle Scar,
will I like this surprise?

516
00:31:40,103 --> 00:31:44,107
Simba, it's to die for.

517
00:32:05,462 --> 00:32:06,797
Shut up.

518
00:32:06,922 --> 00:32:10,300
I can't help it. I'm so hungry.
I got to have a wildebeest.

519
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:11,802
Stay put.

520
00:32:12,594 --> 00:32:14,137
Can't I just pick off
one of the little sick ones?

521
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:18,141
No. We wait for the signal from Scar.

522
00:32:20,143 --> 00:32:23,772
There he is. Let's go.

523
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:27,150
"Little roar."

524
00:33:28,504 --> 00:33:30,464
Look, sire, the herd is on the move.

525
00:33:30,547 --> 00:33:32,883
- Odd.
- Mufasa, quick.

526
00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:34,885
Stampede in the gorge.

527
00:33:34,968 --> 00:33:37,638
- Simba's down there !
- Simba?

528
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:01,161
Zazu, help me !

529
00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:03,247
Your father is on the way! Hold on !

530
00:34:03,372 --> 00:34:04,540
H urry!

531
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:10,671
There ! There on that tree !

532
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:12,089
Hold on, Simba !

533
00:34:13,507 --> 00:34:15,008
Dad !

534
00:34:19,054 --> 00:34:21,098
Scar, this is awful !

535
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:23,350
What'll we do? What'll we do?

536
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:26,103
I'll go back for help, that's what I'll do.

537
00:35:02,055 --> 00:35:03,098
Dad !

538
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:27,664
Scar!

539
00:35:28,332 --> 00:35:31,335
- Brother.
- Brother, help me !

540
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:42,846
Long live the king.

541
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:51,021
No !

542
00:36:03,867 --> 00:36:05,202
Dad !

543
00:36:17,548 --> 00:36:18,590
Dad?

544
00:36:56,086 --> 00:36:57,588
Dad?

545
00:36:58,463 --> 00:37:01,300
Dad, come on.

546
00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:04,261
You got to get up.

547
00:37:04,386 --> 00:37:06,346
Dad?

548
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,390
We got to go home.

549
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:20,777
Help !

550
00:37:23,614 --> 00:37:26,074
Somebody!

551
00:37:26,492 --> 00:37:27,951
Anybody.

552
00:37:29,661 --> 00:37:30,829
Help.

553
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,531
Simba. What have you done?

554
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:09,785
There were wildebeests,
and he tried to save me.

555
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:13,038
It was an accident.
I didn't mean for it to happen.

556
00:38:13,163 --> 00:38:17,334
Of course. Of course you didn't.

557
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:22,881
No one ever means for
these things to happen.

558
00:38:23,006 --> 00:38:25,050
But the king is dead.

559
00:38:26,677 --> 00:38:29,680
And if it weren't for you,
he'd still be alive.

560
00:38:35,352 --> 00:38:37,855
What will your mother think?

561
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:39,565
What am I going to do?

562
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,024
Run away, Simba.

563
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:47,406
Run. Run away and never return.

564
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:55,539
Kill him.

565
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:34,703
Whoa !

566
00:39:48,592 --> 00:39:50,594
Hey, there he goes. There he goes.

567
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:52,304
So go get him.

568
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:54,223
There ain't no way I'm going in there.

569
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:58,227
What, you want me to come out
looking like you, cactus butt?

570
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:00,604
But we got to finish the job.

571
00:40:00,729 --> 00:40:03,732
Well, he's as good as
dead out there anyway.

572
00:40:03,815 --> 00:40:06,109
And if he comes back, we'll kill him.

573
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,278
Yeah ! You hear that?

574
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:12,783
If you ever come back, we'll kill you !

575
00:40:20,749 --> 00:40:24,795
Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy.

576
00:40:25,462 --> 00:40:29,258
But to lose Simba,
who had barely begun to live...

577
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:35,055
For me, it is a deep, personal loss.

578
00:40:35,138 --> 00:40:39,101
So it is with a heavy heart
that I assume the throne.

579
00:40:39,184 --> 00:40:43,438
Yet out of the ashes of this tragedy
we shall rise

580
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:46,483
to greet the dawning of a new era

581
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:50,362
in which lion and hyena come together

582
00:40:50,487 --> 00:40:54,783
in a great and glorious future.

583
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:44,208
Get out! Get out! Get out of here !

584
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:46,668
I love this ! Bowling for buzzards.

585
00:41:47,544 --> 00:41:50,339
Gets 'em every time.

586
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:54,426
Hey, Timon, you better come look.

587
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:56,553
I think it's still alive.

588
00:41:58,222 --> 00:42:01,391
All righty, what have we got here?

589
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:10,609
Jeez, it's a lion ! Run, Pumbaa, move it!

590
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:14,029
Hey, Timon, it's just a little lion.

591
00:42:14,112 --> 00:42:18,742
Look at him. He's so cute and all alone.

592
00:42:19,076 --> 00:42:21,245
- Can we keep him?
- Pumbaa, are you nuts?

593
00:42:21,328 --> 00:42:24,581
You're talking about a lion.
Lions eat guys like us.

594
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:27,084
- But he's so little.
- He's going to get bigger.

595
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:29,336
Maybe he'll be on our side.

596
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:32,506
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard. Maybe he'll...

597
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:35,843
Hey, I've got it.
What if he's on our side?

598
00:42:35,926 --> 00:42:39,263
You know, having a lion around
might not be such a bad idea.

599
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:40,430
So we're keeping him?

600
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:42,766
Of course.
Who's the brains of this outfit?

601
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,434
My point exactly.

602
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:47,855
Jeez, I'm fried. Let's get out
of here and find some shade.

603
00:42:56,446 --> 00:42:58,615
- You okay, kid?
- I guess so.

604
00:42:58,782 --> 00:42:59,950
You nearly died.

605
00:43:00,117 --> 00:43:01,702
I saved you.

606
00:43:01,785 --> 00:43:03,954
Well, Pumbaa helped. A little.

607
00:43:04,037 --> 00:43:05,873
Thanks for your help.

608
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,292
Hey, where you going?

609
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,627
Nowhere.

610
00:43:10,711 --> 00:43:12,045
Gee, he looks blue.

611
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:16,425
- I'd say brownish gold.
- No, no, no. I mean he's depressed.

612
00:43:18,135 --> 00:43:19,136
Kid, what's eating you?

613
00:43:19,261 --> 00:43:22,306
Nothing.
He's at the top of the food chain.

614
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:26,143
The food chain !

615
00:43:30,314 --> 00:43:31,732
So, where you from?

616
00:43:31,815 --> 00:43:33,817
Who cares? I can't go back.

617
00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:37,321
You're an outcast.
That's great. So are we.

618
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:39,823
- What'd you do, kid?
- Something terrible.

619
00:43:39,907 --> 00:43:42,910
- But I don't want to talk about it.
- We don't want to hear about it.

620
00:43:42,993 --> 00:43:45,162
Come on, Timon. Anything we can do?

621
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:47,915
Not unless you can change the past.

622
00:43:47,998 --> 00:43:51,251
You know, kid, in times like this,
my buddy Timon here says,

623
00:43:51,335 --> 00:43:53,837
"You got to put your
behind in your past."

624
00:43:53,962 --> 00:43:55,506
No, no, no.

625
00:43:55,631 --> 00:43:56,924
- I mean...
-  Amateur.

626
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:59,176
Lie down before you hurt yourself.

627
00:43:59,676 --> 00:44:02,429
It's,
"You got to put your past behind you."

628
00:44:02,513 --> 00:44:06,517
Look, kid, bad things happen, and you
can't do anything about it, right?

629
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:07,684
- Right.
- Wrong !

630
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:10,354
When the world turns its back on you,

631
00:44:10,437 --> 00:44:13,106
you turn your back on the world.

632
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,108
Well, that's not what I was taught.

633
00:44:15,192 --> 00:44:17,361
Then maybe you need a new lesson.

634
00:44:17,528 --> 00:44:19,780
Repeat after me.

635
00:44:19,863 --> 00:44:21,698
<i>-Hakuna matata.</i>
- What?

636
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:24,701
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

637
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:26,036
It means "no worries".

638
00:44:26,537 --> 00:44:29,039
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

639
00:44:29,164 --> 00:44:32,292
What a wonderful phrase.

640
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:34,711
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

641
00:44:34,837 --> 00:44:38,048
<i>Ain't no passing craze</i>

642
00:44:38,173 --> 00:44:40,467

00:44:54,231 --> 00:44:56,817
- Yeah. It's our motto.
- What's a motto?

648
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,236
Nothin'. What's-a-motto with you?

649
00:45:00,362 --> 00:45:04,158
You know, kid, these two words
will solve all your problems.

650
00:45:04,241 --> 00:45:07,578
That's right.
Take Pumbaa, for example. Why...

651
00:45:07,703 --> 00:45:10,414
<i>When he was a young warthog</i>

652
00:45:10,747 --> 00:45:14,334
<i>When I was a young warthog</i>

653
00:45:14,418 --> 00:45:16,253
- Very nice.
- Thanks.

654
00:45:16,712 --> 00:45:19,256
<i>He found his aroma</i>

00:45:32,853 --> 00:45:36,440

660
00:45:36,523 --> 00:45:38,942

<i>-Oh, what's in a name?</i>

661
00:45:39,067 --> 00:45:40,611

662
00:45:40,694 --> 00:45:42,613

- You live here?
- We live wherever we want.

Yep. Home is where your rump rests.

677

It's beautiful.

678
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,987
I'm starved.

679
00:46:24,071 --> 00:46:26,323
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole zebra.

680
00:46:27,825 --> 00:46:29,159
We're fresh out of zebra.

681
00:46:29,243 --> 00:46:30,911
Any antelope?

- Nope.

683

Listen, kid, if you live with us,
you have to eat like us.

684
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:38,460
Hey, this looks like a good spot
to rustle up some grub.

685
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,004
What's that?

686
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:42,923
A grub. What's it look like?

687
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:44,967
Gross.

688
00:46:46,301 --> 00:46:47,678
Tastes like chicken.

689
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:51,348
Slimy yet satisfying.

690
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:54,101
These are rare delicacies.

691
00:46:54,935 --> 00:46:58,021
Piquant, with a very pleasant crunch.

692
00:46:58,188 --> 00:46:59,773
You'll learn to love them.

- Nothing.
- You know the law.

733
00:49:13,824 --> 00:49:18,245
Never, ever mention that name

Yes, sire, you are the king.

I... I only mentioned it

Scar, there's no food, no water.

It's the lionesses' job to do the hunting.

Yeah, but they won't go hunt.

- You wouldn't want me.

Zazu, don't be ridiculous.
All you need is a little garlic.

I thought things

- What did you say?
- I said Muf...

I said qu pasa ?

749
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:03,707
Good. Now get out.

- Man, I'm stuffed.
- Me, too.

754
00:50:22,392 --> 00:50:24,645

- Yeah?

758
00:50:42,746 --> 00:50:46,834
Ever wonder what those
sparkling dots are up there?

759
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:49,920
Pumbaa, I don't wonder, I know.

760
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:53,006
What are they?

761
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,842
They're fireflies.

762
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:59,346
Fireflies that got stuck
up in that big bluish-black thing.

763
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:01,431
Gee.

764
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,685
I always thought they were balls of gas

765
00:51:04,768 --> 00:51:08,272
burning billions of miles away.

766
00:51:08,939 --> 00:51:12,025
Pumbaa, with you, everything's gas.

767
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:14,111
Simba, what do you think?

768
00:51:14,528 --> 00:51:16,196
Well, I don't know.

769
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,282
Come on. Give, give, give, give.

Well...

772
00:51:23,453 --> 00:51:25,622

that the great kings of the past
are up there watching over us.

- Yeah, yeah.

- Yeah. Pretty dumb, huh?

- You're killing me.
- Yeah.

779

Don't worry, buddy. I'm here for you.
Everything's going to be okay.

Get her! Bite her head !

Is it really you?

804
00:55:21,275 --> 00:55:25,279
- Who are you?
- It's me. Simba.

805
00:55:26,238 --> 00:55:28,407
Simba?

806
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:33,203
Whoa ! How did you...

807
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,373
- Wow!
- Where did you come from?

808
00:55:36,456 --> 00:55:38,458
This is gr... It's great to see you !

809
00:55:38,584 --> 00:55:41,503
- Hey, what's goin' on here?
- What are you doing here?

810
00:55:41,587 --> 00:55:43,714
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

811
00:55:43,797 --> 00:55:47,092
Hey! What's goin' on here?

812
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:50,179
Timon, this is Nala.
She's my best friend.

813
00:55:50,262 --> 00:55:54,266
- Friend?
- Yeah. Hey, Pumbaa, come over here.

814
00:55:55,475 --> 00:55:57,811
Nala, this is Pumbaa. Pumbaa, Nala.

815
00:55:57,936 --> 00:56:00,564
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.
- The pleasure is all mine.

816
00:56:00,647 --> 00:56:04,776
How do you... Whoa, whoa !
Time out! Let me get this straight.

817
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:06,820
You know her, she knows you.

818
00:56:06,904 --> 00:56:11,492
But she wants to eat him,
and everybody's okay with this?

819
00:56:11,617 --> 00:56:14,203
- Did I miss something?
- Relax, Timon.

820
00:56:14,286 --> 00:56:17,289
Wait till everyone finds out
you've been here all this time.

821
00:56:17,915 --> 00:56:20,834
And your mother, what will she think?

822
00:56:20,918 --> 00:56:24,296
She doesn't have to know.
Nobody has to know.

823
00:56:24,379 --> 00:56:26,632
Of course they do.
Everyone thinks you're dead.

824
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:27,883
They do?

825
00:56:27,966 --> 00:56:31,178
Yeah. Scar told us about the stampede.

826
00:56:31,345 --> 00:56:34,806
He did? What else did he tell you?

827
00:56:34,932 --> 00:56:40,229
What else matters? You're alive.
And that means, you're the king.

828
00:56:40,354 --> 00:56:45,609
King? Lady, have you got
your lions crossed !

829
00:56:45,692 --> 00:56:46,860
King?

830
00:56:46,944 --> 00:56:51,031
Your Majesty, I gravel at your feet.

831
00:56:51,156 --> 00:56:54,034
- Stop it.
- It's not gravel, it's grovel.

832
00:56:54,117 --> 00:56:57,663
And don't! He's not the king. Are you?

833
00:56:57,746 --> 00:56:59,248
- No.
- Simba !

834
00:56:59,331 --> 00:57:01,875
No, I'm not the king.
Maybe I was gonna be,

835
00:57:01,959 --> 00:57:04,253
but that was a long time ago.

836
00:57:04,336 --> 00:57:08,090
Let me get this straight.
You're the king? And never told us?

837
00:57:08,173 --> 00:57:10,926
- Look, I'm still the same guy.
- But with power.

838
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:13,887
Could you guys excuse us
for a few minutes?

839
00:57:14,137 --> 00:57:15,848
Hey, whatever she has to say,

840
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:18,100
she can say in front of us, right, Simba?

841
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,895
Maybe you'd better go.

842
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:26,233
It starts. You think you know a guy.

843
00:57:29,528 --> 00:57:33,073
Timon and Pumbaa,
you learn to love 'em.

844
00:57:35,409 --> 00:57:36,827
What?

845
00:57:38,537 --> 00:57:39,621
What is it?

846
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:43,083
It's like you're back from the dead.

847
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:47,129
You don't know how much
this will mean to everyone.

848
00:57:47,504 --> 00:57:49,089
What it means to me.

849
00:57:49,173 --> 00:57:52,968
- Hey, it's okay.
- I've really missed you.

850
00:57:53,051 --> 00:57:55,554
I've missed you, too.

851
00:57:58,223 --> 00:58:00,976
I tell you, Pumbaa. This stinks.

852
00:58:01,727 --> 00:58:02,769
Sorry.

853
00:58:02,853 --> 00:58:05,022
Not you ! Them !

854
00:58:05,564 --> 00:58:08,817
H im, her, alone.

855
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:10,235
What's wrong with that?

856
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,738
<i>-I can see what's happening</i>
- What?

857
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:15,407
<i>-And they don't have a clue</i>
- Who?

858
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:18,994
<i>They'll fall in love</i>
<i>and here's the bottom line</i>

859

<i>Our trio's down to two</i>

860
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:25,209
<i>The sweet caress of twilight</i>

861
00:58:25,292 --> 00:58:28,253

<i>In perfect harmony</i>

<i>With all its living things</i>

869
00:59:08,001 --> 00:59:10,629
<i>So many things to tell her</i>

870
00:59:11,046 --> 00:59:14,174
<i>But how to make her see</i>

871
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:16,844
<i>The truth about my past?</i>

872
00:59:16,927 --> 00:59:20,556
<i>lmpossible, she'd turn away from me</i>

873

<i>He's holding back, he's hiding</i>

874
00:59:23,976 --> 00:59:27,146
<i>But what, I can't decide</i>

875
00:59:27,229 --> 00:59:30,524
<i>Why won't he be</i>

876
00:59:30,607 --> 00:59:34,361
<i>The king I see inside?</i>

877
00:59:35,362 --> 00:59:41,160

<i>You needn't look too far</i>

884
01:00:13,692 --> 01:00:16,028
<i>Stealing through</i>

885

888
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,591

01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:05,244
lsn't this a great place?

894
01:01:05,327 --> 01:01:07,329
It is beautiful.

895
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:10,290
But I don't understand something.

896
01:01:10,374 --> 01:01:12,751
You've been alive all this time.

897
01:01:13,085 --> 01:01:15,170
Why didn't you
come back to Pride Rock?

898
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:20,092
Well, I just needed to get out
on my own, live my own life.

899
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:22,052
And I did, and it's great.

900
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:24,221
We've really needed you at home.

901
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,517
- No one needs me.
- Yes, we do. You're the king.

902
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,645
Nala, we've been through this.
I'm not the king. Scar is.

903
01:01:32,354 --> 01:01:35,566
Simba, he let the hyenas
take over the Pride Lands.

904
01:01:35,649 --> 01:01:37,651
- What?
- Everything's destroyed.

905
01:01:37,776 --> 01:01:39,403
There's no food, no water.

906
01:01:39,486 --> 01:01:42,156
Simba, if you don't do something
soon, everyone will starve.

907
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,532
- I can't go back.
- Why?

908
01:01:43,615 --> 01:01:45,826
- You wouldn't understand.
- What?

909
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:48,495
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

910
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,289
- What?
<i>-Hakuna matata.</i>

911
01:01:50,455 --> 01:01:54,042
It's something I learned out here.
Sometimes bad things happen...

912
01:01:54,126 --> 01:01:55,210
Simba...

913
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:58,547
...and there's nothing you can do
about it. So why worry?

914
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:03,135
- Because it's your responsibility.
- Well, what about you? You left.

915
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:06,096
I left to find help, and I found you.

916
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:10,601
Don't you understand?
You're our only hope.

917
01:02:10,684 --> 01:02:13,520
- Sorry.
- What's happened to you?

918
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:17,566
- You're not the Simba I remember.
- You're right. I'm not.

919
01:02:17,649 --> 01:02:21,236
- Now are you satisfied?
- No. J ust disappointed.

920
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,114
You know, you're starting
to sound like my father.

921
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,158
Good. At least one of us does.

922
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:30,579
You think you can just show
up and tell me how to live my life?

923
01:02:30,662 --> 01:02:32,664
You don't even know
what I've been through.

924
01:02:32,748 --> 01:02:34,082
I would if you'd just tell me.

925
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:36,001
- Forget it!
- Fine !

926
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:42,674
She's wrong. I can't go back.

927
01:02:43,133 --> 01:02:46,845
What would it prove, anyway?
It won't change anything.

928
01:02:47,095 --> 01:02:48,931
You can't change the past.

929
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,145
You said you'd always be there for me !

930
01:02:55,729 --> 01:02:57,564
But you're not.

931
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,944
And it's because of me.

932
01:03:02,486 --> 01:03:05,030
It's my fault.

933
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,533
It's my fault.

942
01:03:53,912 --> 01:03:56,790
Can't cut it out. It'll grow right back!

943
01:03:56,915 --> 01:03:59,960
Creepy little monkey.
Will you stop following me?

944
01:04:00,085 --> 01:04:03,922
- Who are you?
- The question is, who are you?

945
01:04:06,925 --> 01:04:10,137
I thought I knew. Now I'm not so sure.

946

Enough !
What is that supposed to mean?

949
01:04:20,105 --> 01:04:23,442
It means you are a baboon, and I'm not.

950
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,362
I think you're a little confused.

951
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:30,324
Wrong ! I'm not the one who's confused.

952
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:33,869
- You don't even know who you are.
- And I suppose you know.

953
01:04:33,952 --> 01:04:36,955
Sure do. You're Mufasa's boy.

954

- Bye.
- Hey, wait!

955
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,261
You knew my father?

956
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:54,556
Correction, I know your father.

957
01:04:56,725 --> 01:04:58,560

but he died a long time ago.

959
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,149
Nope. Wrong again !

960
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:08,237
He's alive, and I'll show him to you.

961
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,323
You follow old Rafiki.
He knows the way. Come on !

962
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,418
Don't dawdle. H urry up !

963
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:26,964
- Hey, whoa, wait, wait.
- Come on. Come on !

964
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:30,843
Would you slow down?

965
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,189
Stop !

966
01:05:49,027 --> 01:05:50,529
Look down there.

967
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:18,682
That's not my father.
That's just my reflection.

968
01:06:18,765 --> 01:06:20,434
No.

969
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,396
Look harder.

970
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:31,945
You see?

971
01:06:33,238 --> 01:06:35,741
He lives in you.

972
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:42,581
Simba.

973
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:44,291
Father?

974
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:54,968
Simba, you have forgotten me.

975
01:06:55,093 --> 01:06:57,179
No. How could I?

976
01:06:57,262 --> 01:07:02,017
You have forgotten who you are,
and so have forgotten me.

977
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,353
Look inside yourself, Simba.

978
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:08,524
You are more than
what you have become.

979
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:11,944
You must take your place
in the circle of life.

980
01:07:12,027 --> 01:07:15,948
How can I go back?
I'm not who I used to be.

981
01:07:16,114 --> 01:07:19,952
Remember who you are.

982
01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:23,956
You are my son and the one true king.

983
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:29,461
Remember who you are.

984
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:32,381
No ! Please, don't leave me !

985
01:07:32,464 --> 01:07:33,632
Remember.

986
01:07:33,715 --> 01:07:35,300
- Father!
- Remember!

987
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,344
Don't leave me.

988
01:07:37,427 --> 01:07:39,346
Remember.

989
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:49,982
What was that?

990
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:51,775
The weather.

991
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:55,529
- Very peculiar, don't you think?
- Yeah.

992
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,614
Looks like the winds are changing.

993
01:07:57,698 --> 01:08:00,242
Change is good.

994
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,494
Yeah, but it's not easy.

995
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:07,583
I know what I have to do, but going
back means I'll have to face my past.

996
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:10,752
I've been running from it
for so long.

997
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,006
Jeez! What was that for?

998
01:08:14,089 --> 01:08:16,967
It doesn't matter. It's in the past.

999
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:19,052
Yeah, but it still hurts.

1000
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:21,430
Yes, the past can hurt.

1001
01:08:21,513 --> 01:08:25,100
But the way I see it
you can either run from it

1002
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:28,020
or learn from it.

1003
01:08:28,103 --> 01:08:30,898
You see? So what are you going to do?

1004
01:08:31,106 --> 01:08:33,567
First, I'm gonna take your stick.

1005
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:35,903
No, no, no, no ! Not the stick!

1006
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:39,573
- Hey! Where are you going?
- I'm going back!

1007
01:08:39,656 --> 01:08:42,576
Good ! Go on ! Get out of here !

1008
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:00,636
Grubs ! Grubs !

1009
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:08,143
Hey. Hey, wake up.

1010
01:09:12,147 --> 01:09:15,567
It's okay! Whoa, whoa !
It's okay! It's me !

1011
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,112
Don't ever do that again.

1012
01:09:19,404 --> 01:09:21,114
Carnivores !

1013
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,826
- Have you guys seen Simba?
- I thought he was with you.

1014
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,578
He was, but now I can't find him.
Where is he?

1015
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:28,997
You won't find him here !

1016
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:32,084
The king has returned.

1017
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:35,337
I can't believe it. He's gone back!

1018
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,256
Gone back? What do you mean?

1019
01:09:37,422 --> 01:09:40,342
Hey, what's goin' on here?

1020
01:09:40,425 --> 01:09:42,845
- Who's the monkey?
- Simba went back to challenge Scar.

1021
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,012
- Who?
- Scar.

1022
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:45,848
- Who's got a scar?
- No, it's his uncle.

1023
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,683
- The monkey's his uncle?
- No !

1024
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:51,353
Simba's gone back to challenge
his uncle to take his place as king.

1025
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:51,997
Simba, wait up !

1026
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:59,880
- It's awful, isn't it?
- I didn't want to believe you.

1027
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,882
What made you come back?

1028
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,843
I finally got some sense
knocked into me,

1029
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,221
and I've got the bump to prove it.

1030
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,015
Besides, this is my kingdom.

1031
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:13,143
If I don't fight for it, who will?

1032
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:16,230
- I will.
- It's gonna be dangerous.

1033
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:20,776
Danger? I laugh in the face of danger.

1034
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:22,611
I see nothing funny about this.

1035
01:11:22,694 --> 01:11:25,697
Timon ! Pumbaa !
What are you doing here?

1036
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,950
At your service, my liege.

1037
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:31,703
We're gonna fight your uncle for this?

1038
01:11:32,162 --> 01:11:35,499
Yes, Timon. This is my home.

1039
01:11:35,999 --> 01:11:37,876
Talk about your fixer-upper!

1040
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:42,464
Well, Simba, if it's important to
you, we're with you to the end.

1041
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:05,112
Hyenas. I hate hyenas.

1042
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:07,656
So what's your plan
for getting past those guys?

1043
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:11,118
- Live bait.
- Good idea. Hey!

1044
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:13,996
Come on, Timon. You guys
have to create a diversion.

1045
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:16,707
What do you want me to do,
dress in drag and do the hula?

1046
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:18,959
Luau !

1047
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:20,669
<i>If you're hungry for a hunk</i>
<i>of fat and juicy meat</i>

1048
01:12:20,752 --> 01:12:22,504
<i>Eat my buddy Pumbaa here</i>
<i>because he is a treat</i>

1049
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,548
<i>Come on down and dine</i>
<i>on this tasty swine</i>

1050
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:26,633
<i>All you have to do is get in line</i>

1051
01:12:26,758 --> 01:12:28,552
<i>-Are you achin'</i>
- Yep, yep, yep.

1052
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:30,512
<i>-For some bacon?</i>
- Yep, yep, yep.

1053
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,181
<i>-He's a big pig</i>
- Yep, yep.

1054
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:34,349
<i>You could be a big pig, too!</i>

1055
01:12:39,354 --> 01:12:42,691
Nala, you find my mother
and rally the lionesses.

1056
01:12:42,774 --> 01:12:45,694
I'll look for Scar.

1057
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:49,823
Sarabi !

1058
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:05,714
Yes, Scar?

1059
01:13:05,797 --> 01:13:09,259
Where is your hunting party?
They're not doing their job.

1060
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:12,221
Scar, there is no food.
The herds have moved on.

1061
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,973
No, you're just not
looking hard enough.

1062
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:19,061
It's over. There is nothing left.

1063
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:23,023
We have only one choice.
We must leave Pride Rock.

1064
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:26,568
- We're not going anywhere.
- You have sentenced us to death.

1065
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,821
- Then so be it.
- You can't do that.

1066
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,198
I am the king. I can do whatever I want.

1067
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:33,700
If you were half the king Mufasa was...

1068
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:36,370
I'm ten times the king Mufasa was !

1069
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,792
Mufasa? No, you're dead.

1070
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,717
Mufasa?

1071
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:54,138
No. It's me.

1072
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:59,893
Simba ! You're alive? How can that be?

1073
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:03,772
It doesn't matter. I'm home.

1074
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,190
Simba?

1075
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:09,862
Simba ! I'm a little surprised to see you

1076
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,405
alive.

1077
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:16,577
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't rip you apart.

1078
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,620
Simba, you must understand.

1079
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:21,081
The pressures of ruling a kingdom...

1080
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:24,418
Are no longer yours. Step down, Scar.

1081
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,920
Well, I would, naturally.

1082
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:29,965
However, there is one little problem.

1083
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,842
You see them?

1084
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,846
They think I'm king.

1085
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:39,683
Well, we don't.
Simba's the rightful king.

1086
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:41,685
The choice is yours, Scar.

1087
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,271
Either step down or fight.

1088
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:46,773
Must this all end in violence?

1089
01:14:47,274 --> 01:14:51,069
I'd hate to be responsible
for the death of a family member.

1090
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,406
- Wouldn't you agree, Simba?
- That's not gonna work, Scar.

1091
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,033
I've put it behind me.

1092
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:57,951
But what about your faithful subjects?

1093
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,995
Have they put it behind them?

1094
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:02,164
Simba, what is he talking about?

1095
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:06,502
So you haven't told them
your little secret.

1096
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,963
Well, Simba,
now's your chance to tell them.

1097
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:14,218
Tell them who is responsible
for Mufasa's death.

1098
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:18,430
I am.

1099
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:25,354
It's not true.

1100
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:28,106
Tell me it's not true.

1101
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,820
- It's true.
- You see? He admits it!

1102
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:35,906
- Murderer!
- No ! It was an accident.

1103
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:39,701
If it weren't for you, Mufasa would
be alive. It's your fault he's dead !

1104
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,370
- Do you deny it?
- No.

1105
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:45,582
- Then you're guilty.
- No, I'm not a murderer!

1106
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:48,001
Simba, you're in trouble again,

1107
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:51,088
but this time
daddy isn't here to save you,

1108
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:54,466
and now everyone knows why!

1109
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,635
Simba !

1110
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,060
Now, this looks familiar.

1111
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,858
Where have I seen this before?
Let me think.

1112
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,569
Yes. I remember.

1113
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:17,823
This is just the way
your father looked before he died.

1114
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:23,412
And here's my little secret.

1115
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,999
I killed Mufasa.

1116
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,712
No ! Murderer!

1117
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:34,965
- No, Simba, please.
- Tell them the truth.

1118
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:38,760
Truth? But truth is in
the eye of the behold...

1119
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:40,262
All right.

1120
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:42,347
All right.

1121
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,100
I did it.

1122
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:47,102
So they can hear you.

1123
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:51,315
I killed Mufasa !

1124
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:06,413
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Comin' through. Hot stuff.

1125
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:38,529
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Let me in ! Let me in !

1126
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:42,241
Please, don't eat me.

1127
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:43,909
Drop 'em !

1128
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:46,328
- Hey, who's the pig?
- Are you talkin' to me?

1129
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:48,372
- He called him a pig.
- To me?

1130
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,290
- Shouldn't have done that.
- To me?

1131
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:56,088
- Now they're in for it.
- They call me Mr Pig !

1132
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,010
Take that, you stupid...

1133
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:04,096
Take that and that!

1134
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,726
Run, you yellow-belly!

1135
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:32,624
- Murderer.
- Simba. Simba, please.

1136
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:36,628
- Please, have mercy. I beg you.
- You don't deserve to live.

1137
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:42,134
But Simba, I am family.

1138
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:45,679
It's the hyenas who are the real enemy.

1139
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:48,390
It was their fault. It was their idea.

1140
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:50,517
Why should I believe you?

1141
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:53,687
Everything you ever told me was a lie.

1142
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:55,731
What are you going to do?

1143
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:59,401
You wouldn't kill your own uncle.

1144
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,945
No, Scar.

1145
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:03,822
I'm not like you.

1146
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:07,159
Simba, thank you. You are truly noble.

1147
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:11,038
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
And how can I prove myself to you?

1148
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:12,748
Tell me. I mean, anything.

1149
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,333
Run.

1150
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,960
Run away, Scar,

1151
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,296
and never return.

1152
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:22,216
Yes.

1153
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:24,426
Of course.

1154
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:27,179
As you wish,

1155
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,348
your Majesty!

1156
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,071
My friends !

1157
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:29,992
Friends? I thought he said
we were the enemy.

1158
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,828
Yeah. That's what I heard.

1159
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,413
Ed?

1160
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:43,005
No. Let me explain.
No, you don't understand !

1161
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,507
No, I didn't mean... No ! No !

1162
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,575
It is time.
