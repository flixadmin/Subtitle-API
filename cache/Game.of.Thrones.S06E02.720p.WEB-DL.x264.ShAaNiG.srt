1
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:44,768
Give him another go, Ned.

2
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:46,770
That's my father.

3
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:49,105
And my Uncle Benjen.

4
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:52,275
Keep your shield up
or I'll ring your head like a bell.

5
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:02,786
They were all so happy.

6
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,872
So were you once.

7
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:14,431
Stop showing off.

8
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:16,099
Lyanna!

9
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:17,884
My Aunt Lyanna.

10
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,387
I've seen her statue
in the crypt.

11
00:03:20,472 --> 00:03:23,890
My father never
talked about her.

12
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:32,482
Would you get out of here?
We're sparring.

13
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:36,736
Who are you gonna spar with
when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

14
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:37,904
I don't know.

15
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,572
What about him?

16
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:43,209
Wylis, come here.

17
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,467
Hodor?

18
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:52,552
But he's got giant's blood.

19
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:56,172
And you've got training.
Sounds like a fair match to me.

20
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:58,892
Benjen always lifts his chin
when he's about to charge.

21
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,761
And lowers it when he's going
to dodge, my lady.

22
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:03,930
Hodor talks?

23
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:12,155
You leave the fighting
to the little lords, Wylis.

24
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,691
Come along, now.
It's no place for you.

25
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:17,327
Oh, Nan, look at
the size of him.

26
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:19,696
If he ever learned to fight,
he'd be unstoppable.

27
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:22,782
Well, he's never going to learn to fight
because he's a stable boy.

28
00:04:22,868 --> 00:04:24,701
So leave him be.

29
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:27,087
It is time to go.

30
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:29,205
Please, a little longer.

31
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,971
You finally show me
something I care about

32
00:04:45,056 --> 00:04:46,556
and then you drag me away.

33
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:50,360
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

34
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:52,729
but if you stay too long,
you'll drown.

35
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:56,900
I wasn't drowning.
I was home.

36
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,248
Wylis.

37
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,000
Hodor.

38
00:05:14,085 --> 00:05:15,802
I saw you as a boy.

39
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:18,755
You could talk.

40
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,424
What happened?

41
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,393
Hodor.

42
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,349
Where's Meera?

43
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:33,486
Hodor.

44
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:01,297
You shouldn't be here.

45
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:04,100
It's not safe outside the cave.

46
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:05,885
It's not safe anywhere.

47
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:11,608
I saw that Hodor
wasn't always Hodor.

48
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:13,810
- Hodor.
- His real name is Wylis.

49
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:18,031
And he could talk and fight and...
And then...

50
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,366
What's wrong?

51
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:26,489
The Three-Eyed Raven
says there's a war coming.

52
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,791
And we're going
to fight it in there?

53
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:00,356
Brandon Stark needs you.

54
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:05,411
For what?
I sit in there

55
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,830
and I watch him have his visions
and nothing ever happens.

56
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,500
He isn't going
to stay here forever.

57
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:14,037
And out there he needs you.

58
00:07:39,781 --> 00:07:42,699
It's time, Ser Davos.

59
00:07:42,784 --> 00:07:45,118
Open the door and the men inside

60
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:47,487
can rejoin
their brothers in peace.

61
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:57,547
We'll even set the wolf free
north of the Wall where it belongs.

62
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,169
Nobody needs to die tonight.

63
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:09,225
I've never been
much of a fighter.

64
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,568
Apologies for what
you're about to see.

65
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,577
Come on.

66
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:15,825
Attack!

67
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:25,885
Fight, you cowards!

68
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,203
You fucking traitor.

69
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:02,371
The only traitors
here are the ones

70
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:05,458
who shoved their knives into
their Lord Commander's heart.

71
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:09,045
For thousands of years
the Night's Watch

72
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,764
has held Castle Black
against the wildlings.

73
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:13,883
Until you.

74
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:26,896
Throw them into the cells
where they belong.

75
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,014
Took a lot of knives.

76
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:07,770
I'll have my men
get the wood for a fire.

77
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:10,573
Bodies to burn.

78
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:21,584
Shh, hey.

79
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:25,204
Right, so there she is,
high and mighty Queen Cersei,

80
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,456
tits and ass
jiggling in the breeze.

81
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:30,543
All of a sudden
she looks my way.

82
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:33,513
Gives me a little smile
like, "Well?"

83
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:36,048
So, all right, you know,
I've never been shy

84
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:38,801
and I'm blessed down south,
so I put it right out.

85
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:41,804
She's never seen anything like it.

86
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,273
I mean, she's used to her brother
and from what I hear,

87
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,559
Jaime Lannister's
half an inch shy of an inch.

88
00:11:46,644 --> 00:11:48,394
Ooh!

89
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:52,448
She sees it and I swear to the gods
she licks her lips.

90
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,151
Well, you all know me.

91
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:57,286
You know I wouldn't
lie about this.

92
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:16,616
Get out of my way.

93
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:18,701
King's orders, Your Grace.

94
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,539
What are the king's orders?

95
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,409
He would like you to remain
in the Red Keep, Your Grace,

96
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:27,793
for your own protection.

97
00:13:29,747 --> 00:13:32,415
You're barring me from attending
my own daughter's funeral?

98
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,007
Forgive me, Your Grace,
by the king's command,

99
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,030
I cannot let you pass.

100
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,222
I would like to speak to my son.

101
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:42,758
He has left the Red Keep,
Your Grace.

102
00:14:12,874 --> 00:14:15,207
She grew up.

103
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:17,293
Almost.

104
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:20,046
Have we caught
Prince Trystane's killers?

105
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,550
I expect it was Mother.

106
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:26,635
Your mother wouldn't do that.

107
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:28,054
Yes, she would.

108
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:33,225
Are you angry with her?

109
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:36,228
- Of course not.
- Then why didn't you let her come?

110
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:39,031
She has every right to be here.

111
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,652
They told me she wouldn't
be allowed in the Sept.

112
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:45,256
If she had tried...

113
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,572
They're not putting your
mother in a cell ever again.

114
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:50,042
Not while I'm here.

115
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,047
Why haven't you gone to see her?

116
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:01,087
Everything she endured,
she did it for you.

117
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:03,556
Don't you think I know that?

118
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,311
I'm sorry.

119
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:13,149
But I can't.

120
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:14,600
Why not?

121
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,605
When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,

122
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,574
what did I do?

123
00:15:23,111 --> 00:15:26,862
When they paraded her
through the streets like a whore,

124
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:28,748
what did I do?

125
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,201
We all fail sometimes.

126
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:35,704
The king is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

127
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,258
If I can't even protect my own wife
or my own mother,

128
00:15:39,377 --> 00:15:41,043
what good am I?

129
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:44,213
Go and see your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

130
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,884
Your Grace.

131
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,686
Lord Commander.

132
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:53,522
I want to see my wife.

133
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:55,941
The gods wait for Queen Margaery

134
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,445
to confess her crimes
and seek their mercy.

135
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:02,481
The king must wait as well.

136
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:05,034
Go and see your mother, Tommen.

137
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:17,413
You're a bold man.

138
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,633
On the contrary.

139
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,335
I fear a great deal.

140
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:26,589
The Father, the Mother,

141
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:28,841
the Warrior.

142
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,987
Do you know why
we use these stones?

143
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:46,575
To remind us not to fear death.

144
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:49,945
We close our eyes on this world and
open them on the next.

145
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:52,281
You must long for the next life.

146
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:55,784
In truth, I fear that, too.

147
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,838
You imprisoned
and humiliated my sister.

148
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:01,590
Your sister sought
the gods' mercy

149
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:03,459
and atoned for her sin.

150
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:05,761
What about my sins?

151
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:11,550
I broke a sacred oath
and stabbed my king in the back.

152
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:15,855
I killed my own cousin.

153
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:17,890
When the gods judged
my brother guilty,

154
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:20,309
I helped him escape
their justice.

155
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:24,563
What atonement do I deserve?

156
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:29,201
You would spill blood
in this holy place?

157
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,737
Oh, the gods won't mind.

158
00:17:31,822 --> 00:17:34,290
They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.

159
00:17:36,244 --> 00:17:38,410
Go on, then.

160
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:42,131
I deserve it.
We all do.

161
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:44,833
We are weak, vain creatures.

162
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:47,803
We live only by
the Mother's mercy.

163
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:06,105
They should be closer
if you mean for them to save you.

164
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,073
I don't.

165
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:11,076
They'd never reach me
before you struck.

166
00:18:11,195 --> 00:18:12,861
I've fought against worse odds.

167
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:15,915
No doubt many of us would fall.

168
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:19,034
But who are we, hmm?

169
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,837
We have no names, no family.

170
00:18:21,923 --> 00:18:25,841
Every one of us
is poor and powerless.

171
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:28,344
And yet together,

172
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:31,096
we can overthrow an empire.

173
00:19:01,412 --> 00:19:02,995
Mother.

174
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:17,393
Did they put her
in the red gown or the gold?

175
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:20,596
Gold.

176
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:23,182
Good.
It was always her color.

177
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,737
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

178
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:33,492
I shouldn't have, but I was...

179
00:19:36,113 --> 00:19:39,331
I didn't want to lose you again.

180
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,250
I understand.

181
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:45,254
I'm glad to see you.

182
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:50,959
I know I should
have come sooner.

183
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:54,430
I wanted to.
I was wrong.

184
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,716
It's all right.

185
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:02,721
No, it isn't.

186
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:07,142
I should have executed
all of them.

187
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:09,061
I should have
pulled down the Sept

188
00:20:09,146 --> 00:20:13,232
onto the High Sparrow's head
before I let them do that to you,

189
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:15,651
as you would have for me.

190
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:19,321
You raised me to be strong...

191
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:23,075
and I wasn't.

192
00:20:24,462 --> 00:20:26,545
But I want to be.

193
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,966
Help me.

194
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:37,005
Always.

195
00:21:05,252 --> 00:21:07,920
If I lost my cock,
I'd drink all the time.

196
00:21:12,042 --> 00:21:14,376
Meaning no offense.

197
00:21:14,512 --> 00:21:17,296
He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.

198
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:18,680
I do not make dwarf jokes.

199
00:21:18,766 --> 00:21:20,883
You think them.

200
00:21:20,968 --> 00:21:25,387
So, the fleet.
It's been burned.

201
00:21:25,523 --> 00:21:27,666
We are searching for
the men who burned the ships,

202
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,392
but nobody saw anything.

203
00:21:29,393 --> 00:21:31,860
Surely there's some good news
lurking somewhere.

204
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:35,030
Astapor and Yunkai
have stopped asking us for aid.

205
00:21:35,116 --> 00:21:37,733
Perhaps they can
tell us their secret.

206
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:40,319
The Masters
have retaken both cities.

207
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:45,073
Outside of Meereen, the whole of
Slaver's Bay has returned to the slavers.

208
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,187
What about the dragons?

209
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:50,883
We have two of them here
beneath the pyramid.

210
00:21:51,248 --> 00:21:52,965
They are not eating.

211
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,834
They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.

212
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,637
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

213
00:21:58,756 --> 00:22:01,590
Can't very well let
the dragons starve, that's obvious.

214
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:05,010
If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?

215
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:07,396
Dragons do not do well
in captivity.

216
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,848
- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.

217
00:22:09,934 --> 00:22:12,901
I drink and I know things.

218
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:18,106
The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros

219
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:20,692
ranged over hundreds of miles.

220
00:22:20,778 --> 00:22:22,578
Then Daenerys's ancestors

221
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:25,497
started chaining
them up in pens.

222
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:27,583
A few generations later,

223
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:31,336
the last dragons
were no larger than cats.

224
00:22:31,455 --> 00:22:34,373
They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.

225
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,926
Missandei,

226
00:22:38,012 --> 00:22:41,547
how many times were you in the company
of these dragons?

227
00:22:41,632 --> 00:22:45,300
- Many times.
- And did they ever harm you?

228
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:47,436
Never.

229
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:49,688
Dragons are intelligent.

230
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:52,641
More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.

231
00:22:52,726 --> 00:22:55,060
They have affection
for their friends

232
00:22:55,145 --> 00:22:56,979
and fury for their enemies.

233
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:01,149
- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?

234
00:23:01,285 --> 00:23:04,319
They will.
It's time they had their supper.

235
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:37,629
I'm friends with your mother.

236
00:24:44,471 --> 00:24:47,089
I'm here to help.

237
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:49,257
Don't eat the help.

238
00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:55,430
When I was a child,

239
00:24:55,566 --> 00:24:59,184
an uncle asked what gift
I wanted for my name day.

240
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:01,903
I begged him for one of you.

241
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:05,490
"It wouldn't even have
to be a big dragon," I told him.

242
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:09,578
"It could be little
like me."

243
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:17,735
Everyone laughed

244
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:19,758
like it was the funniest
thing they had ever heard.

245
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,959
Then my father told me

246
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:27,963
the last dragon had died
a century ago.

247
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:31,183
I cried myself
to sleep that night.

248
00:25:40,227 --> 00:25:42,194
But here you are.

249
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:52,347
Next time I have
an idea like that,

250
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:54,216
punch me in the face.

251
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:10,065
What's your name?

252
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,573
What's your name?

253
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:22,077
- No one.
- I don't believe that.

254
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:24,913
You don't believe that.

255
00:27:55,946 --> 00:27:58,330
Who are you?

256
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,950
No one.

257
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:03,451
If a girl says her name,

258
00:28:03,587 --> 00:28:06,588
a man will let her sleep
under a roof tonight.

259
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:08,957
A girl has no name.

260
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:11,293
If a girl says her name,

261
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:13,461
a man will feed her tonight.

262
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:16,014
A girl has no name.

263
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:19,100
If a girl says her name,

264
00:28:19,186 --> 00:28:21,520
a man will give her eyes back.

265
00:28:23,273 --> 00:28:25,524
A girl has no name.

266
00:28:33,116 --> 00:28:35,233
Come.

267
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:45,493
Leave it.

268
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:48,663
A girl is not a beggar anymore.

269
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,925
We came upon the bodies
on our way here.

270
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:04,512
Half a dozen men?
Your best hunters?

271
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:06,314
They obviously had help.

272
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,317
I didn't think Lady Sansa
killed them all by herself.

273
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:12,854
Thank you for this report,
Lord Karstark.

274
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,357
We know where she's going.

275
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:17,192
Her brother's at Castle Black.

276
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,994
Ned Stark's last surviving son?

277
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:21,162
Jon Snow is a bastard,
not a Stark.

278
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:24,332
So was I, Father.

279
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:26,501
Your hold on the North
will never be secure

280
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:28,870
as long as a Stark
can walk through that door.

281
00:29:28,956 --> 00:29:31,539
Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

282
00:29:31,675 --> 00:29:35,543
And the few men left are barely
men at all. Farm boys and thieves.

283
00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:38,178
With a small force,
we could storm the castle,

284
00:29:38,202 --> 00:29:39,681
kill Jon Snow...

285
00:29:39,683 --> 00:29:42,601
Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

286
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:45,387
You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

287
00:29:47,107 --> 00:29:49,140
We don't need
every house in the North.

288
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:51,860
The Umbers, the Manderlys,
and the Karstarks

289
00:29:51,945 --> 00:29:55,814
command more soldiers
than all the other houses combined.

290
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:58,867
With their support,
none could challenge us.

291
00:29:58,952 --> 00:30:00,339
The Starks lost my house

292
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:02,554
the day King Robb cut off
my father's head.

293
00:30:03,073 --> 00:30:06,041
It's time for new blood
in the North.

294
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:17,836
If you acquire a reputation
as a mad dog,

295
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:19,754
you'll be treated as a mad dog.

296
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,724
Taken out back
and slaughtered for pig feed.

297
00:30:24,094 --> 00:30:25,977
My lords.

298
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:28,430
Lady Walda has given birth.

299
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:30,515
A boy.

300
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,101
Red-cheeked
and healthy.

301
00:30:33,236 --> 00:30:36,438
My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

302
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:47,532
Congratulations, Father.

303
00:30:49,036 --> 00:30:51,786
I look forward to meeting
my new brother.

304
00:30:56,209 --> 00:30:58,677
You'll always be my firstborn.

305
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,430
Thank you for saying that.

306
00:31:02,516 --> 00:31:04,766
It means a great deal to me.

307
00:31:41,254 --> 00:31:43,505
Maester Wolkan,

308
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,475
send ravens to all the northern houses.
Roose Bolton is dead.

309
00:31:49,146 --> 00:31:51,312
Poisoned by our enemies.

310
00:31:57,687 --> 00:31:59,687
How did he die?

311
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,027
Poisoned by his enemies.

312
00:32:06,163 --> 00:32:09,030
You're talking to your lord.
Use respect.

313
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:12,283
Forgive me, my lord.

314
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,505
Send for Lady Walda
and the baby.

315
00:32:19,092 --> 00:32:21,092
She's resting, my lord.

316
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:26,514
At once, my lord.

317
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:53,374
There he is.

318
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,410
Isn't he wonderful?

319
00:32:59,082 --> 00:33:00,882
May I hold him?

320
00:33:02,219 --> 00:33:04,302
Of... of course.

321
00:33:14,347 --> 00:33:16,314
Little brother.

322
00:33:17,434 --> 00:33:19,350
Lord Bolton sent for us.

323
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:21,102
Have you seen him?

324
00:33:29,663 --> 00:33:32,864
Of course.
Follow me, Mother.

325
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,300
Where is Lord Bolton?

326
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:04,312
Down!

327
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:07,217
It's all right.
Come on, shh.

328
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:10,869
It's cold out here, Ramsay.
I need to feed him.

329
00:34:16,993 --> 00:34:20,128
Ramsay, where is your father?

330
00:34:21,464 --> 00:34:23,131
Ramsay.

331
00:34:30,924 --> 00:34:33,141
Where is Lord Bolton?

332
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:41,733
I am Lord Bolton.

333
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:53,745
Ramsay.

334
00:34:53,863 --> 00:34:55,530
Ramsay, please.

335
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:58,249
I'll leave Winterfell.
I'll go back to the Riverlands.

336
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:05,623
Please.

337
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:07,709
Ramsay.

338
00:35:09,596 --> 00:35:11,429
He's your brother.

339
00:35:14,384 --> 00:35:16,884
I prefer being an only child.

340
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:40,074
I saw her with a man.

341
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,043
I don't think he hurt her.

342
00:35:42,128 --> 00:35:45,246
She didn't want to leave him,
he didn't want to leave her.

343
00:35:47,384 --> 00:35:49,217
You don't know
which way she went?

344
00:35:49,302 --> 00:35:51,586
I spent three days
looking for her.

345
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:53,137
She disappeared.

346
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:56,975
How'd she look?

347
00:35:57,093 --> 00:35:59,260
She looked good.

348
00:35:59,346 --> 00:36:02,313
She wasn't exactly
dressed like a lady.

349
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:05,350
No, she wouldn't be.

350
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,437
What happened at Winterfell?

351
00:36:21,117 --> 00:36:24,702
I should have gone with you while
I had the chance.

352
00:36:24,788 --> 00:36:27,755
It was a difficult
choice, my lady.

353
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:35,513
We've all had to make
difficult choices.

354
00:36:55,068 --> 00:36:57,285
We shouldn't be lighting fires.

355
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,453
It's not safe.

356
00:36:58,538 --> 00:36:59,871
He won't stop hunting us.

357
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:01,656
We just have to make it
to Castle Black.

358
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:04,208
Once we're with Jon,
Ramsay won't be able to touch us.

359
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:07,161
Jon will have me killed the moment
I step through the gate.

360
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:08,913
I won't let him.

361
00:37:08,998 --> 00:37:10,998
I'll tell him the truth
about Bran and Rickon.

362
00:37:12,802 --> 00:37:16,003
And the truth about the farm boys
I killed in their place.

363
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:19,807
And the truth about
Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

364
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:24,812
And the truth about Robb,
who I betrayed.

365
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:29,267
When you take the black,
all your crimes are forgiven.

366
00:37:29,352 --> 00:37:31,185
I don't want to be forgiven.

367
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,690
I can never make
amends to your family

368
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:37,275
for the things I've done.

369
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:41,662
They'll keep you safer
than I ever could.

370
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:49,003
You're not coming with us?

371
00:37:51,174 --> 00:37:54,459
I would have taken you
all the way to the Wall.

372
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:57,545
I would have died
to get you there.

373
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:16,781
May I take one of the horses?

374
00:38:20,236 --> 00:38:22,537
Where will you go?

375
00:38:25,241 --> 00:38:27,208
Home.

376
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:39,921
The Glovers have retaken
Deepwood Motte.

377
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:42,256
And the ironborn who held it?

378
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:45,593
They died fighting to a man.

379
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,397
What is dead may never die.

380
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:51,682
What is dead may never die.

381
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:53,768
But they did

382
00:38:53,903 --> 00:38:56,571
and our invasion died with them.

383
00:38:56,656 --> 00:38:59,774
Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold
on the mainland.

384
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:01,526
Then we will take more.

385
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:04,862
Why?
For more pinecones and rocks?

386
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:09,450
Because I order it.

387
00:39:09,586 --> 00:39:11,586
We can defeat anyone at sea,

388
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:13,871
but we'll never hold
lands and castles

389
00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:15,456
against mainland armies.

390
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:17,792
Not if our captains
defy my orders,

391
00:39:17,927 --> 00:39:22,346
abandon their posts,
and sacrifice our men on foolish missions.

392
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:24,432
I won't apologize
for trying to rescue Theon.

393
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:25,633
Then where is he?

394
00:39:25,718 --> 00:39:28,186
Where is your kingdom?

395
00:39:28,304 --> 00:39:30,007
We took those castles

396
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:32,103
because the northerners
marched off to war.

397
00:39:32,392 --> 00:39:34,475
That war is over.

398
00:39:34,561 --> 00:39:36,310
The last time
we provoked them too far,

399
00:39:36,446 --> 00:39:39,113
I watched from that window
as they breached our walls

400
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:41,148
and knocked down our towers.

401
00:39:41,284 --> 00:39:43,067
I lost two brothers that day.

402
00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:45,786
And I lost three sons.

403
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:49,073
The War of the Five Kings,
they call it.

404
00:39:49,158 --> 00:39:51,075
Well, the other four are dead.

405
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,412
When you rule the Iron Islands, you can
wage all the peace you want.

406
00:39:54,497 --> 00:39:56,330
But for now,
shut your mouth and obey

407
00:39:56,466 --> 00:39:59,133
or I will make
another heir who will.

408
00:40:37,924 --> 00:40:39,757
Let me pass.

409
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:45,546
You fool, move aside
for your king.

410
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,516
Haven't I always, brother?

411
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:02,730
I thought you'd be rotting under
some foreign sea by now.

412
00:41:02,815 --> 00:41:06,200
What is dead may never die.

413
00:41:08,404 --> 00:41:11,372
Has the custom changed
since I've been gone?

414
00:41:11,457 --> 00:41:13,708
Aren't you supposed
to repeat the words?

415
00:41:13,793 --> 00:41:16,877
You can mock our god
without my help.

416
00:41:16,963 --> 00:41:19,747
I don't mock the Drowned God.

417
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:22,717
I am the Drowned God.

418
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:24,669
From Oldtown to Qarth,

419
00:41:24,754 --> 00:41:28,339
when men see my sails,
they pray.

420
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:40,651
You're old, brother.

421
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,603
You've had your time.

422
00:41:42,689 --> 00:41:44,989
Now let another rule.

423
00:41:45,108 --> 00:41:48,275
I heard you lost your mind

424
00:41:48,361 --> 00:41:51,445
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

425
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:56,917
They tied you to the mast to keep you
from jumping overboard.

426
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:58,536
They did.

427
00:41:58,621 --> 00:42:03,207
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

428
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:05,209
I needed silence.

429
00:42:06,512 --> 00:42:08,763
What kind of an ironborn

430
00:42:08,848 --> 00:42:12,767
loses his senses during a storm?

431
00:42:12,852 --> 00:42:16,721
I am the storm, brother.

432
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:19,106
The first storm and the last.

433
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,643
And you're in my way.

434
00:43:00,683 --> 00:43:05,152
Lord, take your servant Balon back
beneath the waves.

435
00:43:05,238 --> 00:43:08,572
Feed the creatures of your
kingdom on his flesh.

436
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:10,691
Pull his bones down
to your depths

437
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:13,577
to rest beside his ancestors
and his children.

438
00:43:13,696 --> 00:43:15,996
What is dead may never die.

439
00:43:25,174 --> 00:43:27,708
I'm going to find out
who did this.

440
00:43:27,794 --> 00:43:30,878
I'm going to feed them to the sharks
while they live.

441
00:43:32,548 --> 00:43:35,349
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

442
00:43:35,435 --> 00:43:38,269
The Salt Throne is not
yours to swear upon,

443
00:43:38,387 --> 00:43:40,438
not unless the kingsmoot
chooses you.

444
00:43:40,556 --> 00:43:42,389
My father would have
wanted me to rule.

445
00:43:42,525 --> 00:43:45,776
Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

446
00:43:48,064 --> 00:43:50,231
Perhaps you'll win.

447
00:43:50,316 --> 00:43:53,534
Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the ironborn.

448
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:56,570
And perhaps not.

449
00:44:13,422 --> 00:44:15,172
Come in.

450
00:44:21,264 --> 00:44:24,932
I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

451
00:44:25,067 --> 00:44:27,151
You interrupt nothing.

452
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:41,999
I assume you know why I'm here.

453
00:44:43,286 --> 00:44:44,785
I will after you tell me.

454
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:47,121
It's about the Lord Commander.

455
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:49,373
The former Lord Commander.

456
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:52,510
Does he have to be?

457
00:44:55,965 --> 00:44:58,215
What are you asking?

458
00:45:02,138 --> 00:45:05,940
Do you know of any magic...

459
00:45:07,643 --> 00:45:09,276
that could help him?

460
00:45:09,362 --> 00:45:10,728
Bring him back?

461
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:13,447
If you want to help him,
leave him be.

462
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:15,699
Can it be done?

463
00:45:15,818 --> 00:45:18,369
There are some with this power.

464
00:45:18,487 --> 00:45:21,038
- How?
- I don't know.

465
00:45:21,157 --> 00:45:22,206
Have you seen it done?

466
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:27,912
I met a man who came
back from the dead,

467
00:45:27,997 --> 00:45:31,131
but the priest who did it...

468
00:45:31,217 --> 00:45:33,133
It shouldn't have been possible.

469
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:36,387
But it was.
It could be now.

470
00:45:36,505 --> 00:45:38,806
Not for me.

471
00:45:42,979 --> 00:45:45,012
Not for you?

472
00:45:48,684 --> 00:45:52,353
I saw you drink poison
that should have killed you.

473
00:45:52,438 --> 00:45:55,522
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

474
00:45:55,658 --> 00:45:58,242
Everything I believed,

475
00:45:58,361 --> 00:46:01,779
the great victory
I saw in the flames,

476
00:46:01,864 --> 00:46:03,447
all of it was a lie.

477
00:46:07,837 --> 00:46:09,787
You were right all along.

478
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:12,623
The Lord never spoke to me.

479
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:14,675
Fuck him, then.

480
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,677
Fuck all of them.

481
00:46:18,431 --> 00:46:22,099
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

482
00:46:22,218 --> 00:46:25,552
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

483
00:46:28,641 --> 00:46:31,392
I'm not asking
the Lord of Light for help.

484
00:46:31,527 --> 00:46:36,030
I'm asking the woman who showed me
that miracles exist.

485
00:46:37,984 --> 00:46:40,200
I never had this gift.

486
00:46:40,286 --> 00:46:42,236
Have you ever tried?

487
00:50:25,261 --> 00:50:27,761
Please.
