You're clearly not the killer
that your brother is, Thea.

Yeah, I wish that were true.

-She's lost, your sister.
-No, she's not.

You can see it in her eyes.

She's been touched by darkness.

Was it Merlyn?

477
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,382
He's an interesting man to do that
to his own daughter.

00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,344
So now you've lost your father...

...your mother and now your little sister.

...before there is no more Oliver Queen?

485

Thanks for the trip home.
Have a nice flight back to Hong Kong.

486
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,516
I'm afraid it's not that simple, Mr. Queen.

487

The hell it's not. You have the Omega.

You have Chien Na Wei. It's over.

You've done your country
quite a service today, Mr. Queen.

That said, I've got some news
you're not gonna wanna hear.

Well, general, I'm used to that by now.

Are you stalking me?

00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,880
Just checking on you.

506
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,550
Things with your father seemed, uh...
They seemed tense.

507
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:23,431
Your roommate told me you were taking
a job here. I said that couldn't be true.

That you were going to work
for a white-shoe firm.

You remember what you said?

You were mad because I wasn't choosing a life
where I was going to help people.

It's like you knew...

...already, even then.

You knew that my life was always headed
towards that mask.

Because we were the ones who were alike.

And we had a trust, we had a bond,
and you broke it.

And why is that?

Because she loves you like a sister,

No.

564
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,491
No, that would complicate things...

565
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,829
...and despite everything that he has done...

566
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:16,915

-To challenge you, see if you both could work...

How could you make me kill a friend?

573
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,148
He should not have told you that.

574
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,691
I trusted you.

575
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:48,154
I let you into my life.

How could you have done this to me?

577
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,619
Because you are my daughter
and I care about you.

578

God, that's sick.

579
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,872
And not even remotely true.

580
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,542
You do not understand the danger we face
from Ra's al Ghul.

-Just stop.

I will work with you to stop Ra's.

Because that's what my brother says
we need to do.

So I will be your student.

I'll be your partner.

Even if I have to, I will be your soldier.

But never again will I be your daughter.
