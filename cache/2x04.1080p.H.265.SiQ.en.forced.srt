1
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:10,492
Tata.

2
00:01:24,673 --> 00:01:27,384
Tata. Where is everyone?

3
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:44,568
Pablo.

4
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:50,490
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

5
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:52,868
I'm all right.

6
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:56,496
Go back to bed.

7
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:54,030
<i>Do you know
why they took you there?</i>

8
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:58,577
<i>He said he wanted to send
a message to other kids.</i>

9
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:02,539
<i>Who is "he"?
Do you remember his name?</i>

10
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:05,250
<i>Colonel Carrillo.</i>

11
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:09,296
<i>I know this is difficult...</i>

12
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:12,841
<i>but tell me What happened
when they took you there.</i>

13
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,262
<i>They killed my friend.</i>

14
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:19,556
<i>- I'm very sorry...</i>
- This is a farce.

15
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:23,185
- Escobar trained this kid very well.
- I'll speak with Carrillo.

16
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,812
Whether he did it or not
is beside the point.

17
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:28,398
Colombia is tired of Escobar.

18
00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:31,026
Besides, Valeria Velez?

19
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,445
My God, she has no credibility
in this country.

20
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,947
I need to know if Carrillo
killed that boy.

21
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:42,204
If we say that she's doing this
to discredit Carrillo, they'll believe us.

22
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:46,792
But if the press finds out
that you spoke to Carrillo here...

23
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:48,752
They'll assume it's the truth.

24
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:50,837
Exactly.

25
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:00,764
What do you propose?

26
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,517
That we don't play Escobar's game.

27
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:05,894
And that we leave things as they are...

28
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,062
For now.

29
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:13,985
I think we're going to need
more than an interview.

30
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,114
- No. No violence.
- That's not what I mean. I suggest...

31
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,534
Now we need to have the people
on our side.

32
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:26,206
Yes, of course. It's just the president
has denied it on TV,

33
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:29,209
and the American media
hasn't even picked up the story.

34
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:30,794
Of course.

35
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,757
If David were the son
of an important politician, but...

36
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:41,346
the men of always aren't interested
in the children of never.

37
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,099
- Of course.
- Right?

38
00:05:57,112 --> 00:06:00,824
I'm writing a letter to the editors
of the most important newspapers

39
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:05,412
to tell them how that boy came to me,
scared to death.

40
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:10,166
The world has to know what sort of
monster that bastard Carrillo is.

41
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,545
Don Pablo, that's excellent.

42
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:17,549
Give me that pencil.

43
00:06:39,154 --> 00:06:40,614
Burn everything.

44
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:55,086
Don't move! Felix, take this one.

45
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:57,547
Don't even think about it.
Up against the wall.

46
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:06,973
We don't know yet.
We're working on it.

47
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:36,187
Are we having a good time?

48
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,488
That's a very pretty girl.

49
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:48,575
But you're paying for those lines,
asshole.

50
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:56,708
Clean this shit up!

51
00:08:58,126 --> 00:09:01,421
Who taught you to live like this?
Not from our mother!

52
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:06,926
And wake up, asshole!

53
00:09:07,052 --> 00:09:08,636
And you, Edgar!

54
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:14,225
Call Pablo and ask him where the fuck
he wants us to take his half.

55
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,311
All right. All right.

56
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:19,773
What are you doing calling
from that phone? Use the pay phone!

57
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:23,068
- Relax, brother.
- Edgar...

58
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:24,527
What?

59
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:27,572
- You've been calling from this phone?
- No.

60
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:30,158
Son of a bitch!

61
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:58,978
Move it, faggot!

62
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:25,672
Hey.

63
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:57,138
Dad?

64
00:11:57,931 --> 00:12:00,850
- Quickly, inside!
- Friend.

65
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,353
Calm down, friend.

66
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,942
Everything is all right.

67
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,112
I can't believe it. Son of a bitch.

68
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:56,281
It's carbon rock.

69
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:59,909
The cocaine is dissolved and mixed in.

70
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:04,872
Did you think I buy labs
because I loved Chemistry in school?

71
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:07,500
You're going to put chemists
out of business.

72
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,503
I'm more interested
in putting Pablo out of business.

73
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:14,382
Now's the time to move in on Miami.

74
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:19,220
It won't be hard for us
to take that business.

75
00:13:20,763 --> 00:13:24,225
- But don't you think it's too early?
- Pablo's hiding.

76
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,146
The Search Bloc is killing his men.
Soon they'll catch him,

77
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:31,566
and I want us to be in an advantageous
position when that happens.

78
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:33,651
Could you take care of that?

79
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:36,696
Yes, of course.

80
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:40,658
But don't make it too obvious.

81
00:13:41,284 --> 00:13:45,580
I don't want Judy Moncada asking
questions and negotiating for a piece.

82
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:49,208
Then you should call Pablo

83
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:54,714
and tell him we'd be happy
to turn Judy over to him.

84
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,633
We'll dump her in the same ditch
we'll be dumping him in.

85
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:14,901
Guys.

86
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:20,490
The Search Bloc took
another Moncada lab.

87
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:23,284
The sons of bitches killed
three of the Prisco brothers.

88
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:24,869
Ricardo got away.

89
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,788
- When was this?
- Last night.

90
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:31,834
It's that son of a bitch, Don Berna.
He's telling the cops everything.

91
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:34,462
Let's hide out on the coast.
I'll convince Don Pablo.

92
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:37,131
Since when do we hide, brother?

93
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,843
Let's trust the boss.

94
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:44,305
Yes. Don Pablo always finds a solution.

95
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:52,480
- Hello?
- <i>Get me Don Pablo.</i>

96
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,148
- Who is this?
<i>- Fernando Duque.</i>

97
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:55,483
- Fernando.
<i>- Get him!</i>

98
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:58,986
Yes, sir, right away. Limón, please.

99
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:08,121
Boss?

100
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:10,957
Your lawyer, Mr Duque.

101
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:17,171
- How many were published?
<i>- Don Pablo,</i>

102
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:20,925
we sent all of them to the newspapers.

103
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:26,764
How many of my letters
were published, Fernando?

104
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:29,225
Yes. None.

105
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,811
<i>They're very well written.</i>

106
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:35,356
It's not about how well-written
they were, Fernando.

107
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:38,234
It was the fucking truth!

108
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:18,608
This is why we saw ourselves forced

109
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:21,736
to take up arms and defend ourselves...

110
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:10,326
Move it, you sons of bitches!

111
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,943
All right. Very good.

112
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:46,190
Guys.

113
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:48,859
Ms Judy.

114
00:19:52,822 --> 00:19:57,702
All right, now... I'd like to know
the reason for this meeting.

115
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:01,539
- You don't see this every day.
- Look, Pacho, it's simple.

116
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,708
We need to get rid of Pablo Escobar.

117
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,921
We know you all joined forces
against him.

118
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:12,925
And we want to know if it's possible
for my brother and I to join the cause.

119
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,927
Why?

120
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:17,596
What do you want out of this?

121
00:20:17,722 --> 00:20:20,725
- We want what's best for Colombia.
- That's it?

122
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,186
Pablo Escobar,
aside from being a terrorist,

123
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:29,692
is also allied with the guerrillas,
who he has helped on many occasions.

124
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:33,779
Putting an end to Pablo Escobar
is an act of patriotism.

125
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:37,825
Imagine, Pacho,
your financial resources

126
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,330
combined with all of the information
you have on Pablo Escobar's operation

127
00:20:43,456 --> 00:20:48,210
- with our military experience...
- We'd make one hell of a death squad.

128
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:52,465
No, Mrs Moncada. No.
A death squad? No.

129
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,467
An army.

130
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:56,719
And when this army gets to Medellin,

131
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:59,680
Pablo Escobar's death
won't be a matter of months.

132
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,640
It'll be a matter of weeks.

133
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:04,685
What do you say, Mr Pacho?

134
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,272
Can we count on the support
of you and your partners?

135
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:19,116
All of this sounds... interesting.

136
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:22,161
With all due respect, gentlemen,

137
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:27,458
our organisation already
has a strategy in place, and it's working.

138
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,252
It doesn't seem to me like it's working.

139
00:21:30,377 --> 00:21:33,631
Because, to this day,
Pablo Escobar is still alive.

140
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:37,301
- That's right.
- At this rate, not for long.

141
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:46,018
I'll share this conversation
with my partners.

142
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:49,814
But I think that, for now,
the answer is no.

143
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:54,151
Excuse me.

144
00:22:13,754 --> 00:22:17,091
- Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.
- How did you find me?

145
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,510
I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.

146
00:22:21,762 --> 00:22:23,472
- And La Quica?
- He's not here.

147
00:22:23,597 --> 00:22:25,766
He's back there, looking for you.

148
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:30,312
If he finds out I'm here,
he'll want to kill me too.

149
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:32,022
Let's talk. Relax.

150
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:37,528
Because of you,
I'll never be able to go back to Medellin.

151
00:22:37,653 --> 00:22:38,946
- Maritza!
- Because of you,

152
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:41,949
- my daughter and I have to hide!
- Relax!

153
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:47,955
I really am sorry, and I'm here
because I want to help you.

154
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,708
Like you helped the girls
you used to drive around?

155
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,878
- I had nothing to do with that.
- And why would I believe you?

156
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:57,089
Because you know me,
and I wouldn't do something like that.

157
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:00,259
You killed me, Jhon.

158
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:03,345
You killed me by putting me
in your fucking taxi.

159
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,015
You knew how badly
I needed the money

160
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,975
and you took advantage of that.

161
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:10,603
I really am sorry, Maritza.

162
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:13,689
And believe me, I have an idea
to get us both out of this.

163
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:14,899
What is it?

164
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:18,652
We'll give them what they want.
We'll give them Escobar.

165
00:23:23,824 --> 00:23:27,202
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Believe me, Maritza.

166
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:31,123
I'm the one who drives Escobar.
I know when he's without his sicarios.

167
00:23:31,248 --> 00:23:34,001
- You can call the police.
- Maritza, what's going on?

168
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:36,879
Mum, go inside. Go inside.

169
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:41,842
Doña Liliana.

170
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:45,054
- I don't trust the police.
- Listen to me.

171
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,599
This is your chance
to get a visa from the Americans,

172
00:23:48,724 --> 00:23:50,684
so you can leave with your daughter.

173
00:23:56,982 --> 00:24:00,110
And you? What do you get out of this?

174
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:04,073
Working for Escobar isn't what it seems.
They're killing all of his men.

175
00:24:04,198 --> 00:24:06,033
I'm afraid.

176
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:11,956
I need to get out.
We both need to get out, Maritza.

177
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:58,919
All right. My turn.

178
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,507
You both look beautiful.

179
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:13,100
All right, my love, go to your room
so I can talk with your dad, all right?

180
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:33,078
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

181
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:38,125
Velasco told me.

182
00:26:04,651 --> 00:26:07,029
There are 20 men out there, Tata.

183
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:12,284
Yes, Pablo... 20 strangers.

184
00:26:14,578 --> 00:26:15,788
Let's see.

185
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:18,832
How do you hold it?

186
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:33,347
What?

187
00:26:33,472 --> 00:26:36,433
Are you sure you want to laugh
at your wife while she's holding a gun?

188
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:39,686
It's not a joke, Pablo.

189
00:26:41,522 --> 00:26:45,025
Those 20 men out there
don't care what happens to us.

190
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:49,822
When the time comes,
it will just be you and me.

191
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:55,077
And I will be a part of this, Pablo.

192
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:06,171
All right.

193
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:12,010
But I think you need
more practise with that.

194
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:37,161
- Javi, it's Gabriela.
- <i>What's</i> up?

195
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:39,788
- It's been a while and I want to see you.
- <i>Now?</i>

196
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:43,041
I can't right now. I'm working.

197
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:45,919
Don't be like that.

198
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,681
All right. Give me... 20 minutes.

199
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:27,920
Hello.

200
00:28:29,963 --> 00:28:31,506
- I've got half an hour.
- Wait.

201
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:35,636
- Javi...
- Come here. What's wrong?

202
00:28:38,972 --> 00:28:40,057
Hello.

203
00:28:40,182 --> 00:28:42,100
Hello.

204
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:44,019
She's a friend of a friend.

205
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,314
Maritza, meet Javier.

206
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:54,863
Why are you introducing me
to a friend of a friend?

207
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,699
She's in trouble.

208
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,410
Just hear her out.

209
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:03,705
Goddammit, Gabby.
You could've told me over the phone.

210
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,832
- You wouldn't come.
- Well, I'm leaving.

211
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:10,671
- Bye!
- No. Wait. It's important.

212
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:13,048
Please.

213
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:15,467
Hear her out.

214
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:26,395
What's your name? Maritza?

215
00:29:32,985 --> 00:29:35,487
What kind of trouble are you in?

216
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:38,532
Who are you in trouble with?

217
00:29:39,616 --> 00:29:41,743
- La Quica.
- La Quica.

218
00:29:42,661 --> 00:29:44,538
You know La Quica?

219
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,335
- He wants to kill me.
- Well...

220
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,713
La Quica wants to kill a lot of people.

221
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:56,675
Why does he want to kill you?

222
00:29:58,635 --> 00:30:01,555
Because I can tell you
where Pablo Escobar is.

223
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,773
And how are you going to do that?

224
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:16,069
I know exactly when and where
he'll be tomorrow.

225
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:09,164
If this is true, Colonel,

226
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:12,667
she can tell us when
Limón and Escobar go somewhere.

227
00:31:37,234 --> 00:31:38,402
Let's go.

228
00:31:50,414 --> 00:31:51,748
Can you explain this?

229
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,878
A subpoena.

230
00:31:57,003 --> 00:32:00,966
You're going to answer the questions
I have regarding La Catedral.

231
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,136
You mean your witch hunt.

232
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:08,849
Tell me, how did Pablo Escobar
get out of that prison

233
00:32:08,974 --> 00:32:13,520
while being surrounded by 400 soldiers?

234
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:18,275
How many times do I have to tell you
I don't know how Escobar escaped?

235
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:21,570
He must have paid someone off.

236
00:32:21,695 --> 00:32:25,657
I would say that's
almost certainly the case.

237
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:33,290
This is about transparency.
The truth. The law.

238
00:32:33,874 --> 00:32:38,670
And I sense from your reluctance
to talk to me

239
00:32:38,795 --> 00:32:43,675
that the truth won't be pleasant for you
or for our dear president.

240
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:51,683
Look, sir, what happened that night
was complicated and, yes,

241
00:32:51,808 --> 00:32:55,395
I must confess we lost control
of the situation, we made mistakes,

242
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,732
but we're talking about a national crisis.

243
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:05,322
So what? Does that mean
that we should just trust you?

244
00:33:06,072 --> 00:33:11,161
Look, sir... I'm asking you to trust me.

245
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:16,458
All you're doing by making
this investigation public

246
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,503
is destroying the life
of a very good human being.

247
00:33:19,628 --> 00:33:22,172
Our president.

248
00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:27,260
Well... let's hope it doesn't come to that.

249
00:33:41,775 --> 00:33:43,109
Hello?

250
00:33:43,235 --> 00:33:44,569
Hello, Maritza. It's me.

251
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:47,322
I spoke with Peña.

252
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:48,949
Pay attention.

253
00:33:50,116 --> 00:33:53,495
In one hour, I will take Pablo
to his accountant in the south.

254
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:59,918
I need you to give the Americans
the address. Understand?

255
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:04,214
Are we really going to turn in
Pablo Escobar?

256
00:34:05,674 --> 00:34:09,803
Yes, Maritza.
We're going to do this together.

257
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:13,223
But I need you to trust me.

258
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:16,851
Give me the address.

259
00:34:16,977 --> 00:34:18,770
Write it down.

260
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,109
9th street with 98-3. Got it?

261
00:34:27,654 --> 00:34:28,905
Got it.

262
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:43,795
...my love. Do it again.

263
00:34:45,547 --> 00:34:48,049
I'm sorry, boss.
It's getting late.

264
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:50,176
Thank you, Limón. A kiss.

265
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:53,054
Come on. Ice cream. Ice cream.
One, two, and...

266
00:36:07,003 --> 00:36:08,588
Everything all right, boss?

267
00:36:26,523 --> 00:36:30,318
9th Street. 98-3.

268
00:36:30,443 --> 00:36:32,612
OK. Got it.

269
00:37:13,737 --> 00:37:16,698
<i>All right.
Now turn off the satellite phones.</i>

270
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:53,193
We'll be out in 20 minutes.
So be on alert.

271
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:54,652
Yes, Colonel.

272
00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:57,989
Attention! We're headed out!

273
00:38:26,893 --> 00:38:28,353
We're on San Juan.

274
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,404
<i>Everything's calm. Murphy,
you're buying the drinks tonight.</i>

275
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,330
Of course, blondie.

276
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:54,045
It's burning!

277
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:02,762
Reverse!

278
00:39:07,308 --> 00:39:08,476
It's an ambush!

279
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:14,274
Sabada!

280
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:17,277
Carrillo, respond!
Carrillo! Trujillo! Do you copy?

281
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:24,450
Son of a bitch!

282
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:25,637
Look at me.

283
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,059
I said look at me!

284
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:47,241
You asked a child to give me this.

285
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:01,923
You can have it back.

286
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:10,598
And this...

287
00:41:10,723 --> 00:41:13,977
This is for my cousin, Gustavo.

288
00:41:15,812 --> 00:41:17,605
Coward.

289
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:19,232
Son of a bitch.

290
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,599
Don't worry. It's going to heal well.

291
00:46:05,726 --> 00:46:08,312
They're saying that Pablo himself
killed Carrillo.

292
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:10,398
Next, he'll come after the two of you.

293
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:15,987
Or me, or you, Pacho.

294
00:46:16,112 --> 00:46:19,073
We've got to come up
with another plan, now.

295
00:46:19,198 --> 00:46:22,493
Another approach.
Another way to do things.

296
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:27,748
Pacho, we need to call the Castaños.

297
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:32,670
Soon we'll know what's in it for them.

298
00:47:03,993 --> 00:47:07,621
Carrillo hasn't been buried yet...

299
00:47:07,747 --> 00:47:09,957
and they're already asking for my head.

300
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:13,836
They want a scapegoat.

301
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:17,340
And we have to give them one.

302
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:30,478
That's why we're saying you were
poorly advised by your vice minister.

303
00:47:33,689 --> 00:47:36,859
- We can find another way.
- Let me finish.

304
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:38,611
We're going to say

305
00:47:38,736 --> 00:47:42,073
that I acted alone and without
authorisation when I entered La Catedral.

306
00:47:43,824 --> 00:47:47,953
And that it was I who insisted
that Carrillo return.

307
00:47:55,378 --> 00:47:57,254
I don't accept your resignation.

308
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,174
The country needs you more
than ever, Eduardo.

309
00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:01,425
I need you.

310
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:04,053
We have to do it, César.

311
00:48:05,513 --> 00:48:10,768
You know it. The attorney general,
the press, the opposition, the citizens,

312
00:48:10,893 --> 00:48:13,854
everyone's looking
for someone to blame. All of them.

313
00:48:14,814 --> 00:48:16,482
And it's not going to be you.

314
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:28,160
It's been my honour serving you
and the people of Colombia.

315
00:48:45,261 --> 00:48:46,554
Good luck.

316
00:49:58,918 --> 00:50:01,670
Limón told me you have a daughter.

317
00:50:04,465 --> 00:50:05,633
How old?

318
00:50:09,345 --> 00:50:12,348
- Two.
- And what's her name?

319
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,187
- Salome.
- What a beautiful name.

320
00:50:25,861 --> 00:50:29,573
This is the second time
that I've felt indebted to you.

321
00:50:33,994 --> 00:50:39,375
Now, Maritza...
our daughters will be safe.

322
00:50:41,335 --> 00:50:42,628
Thank you.

323
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,590
Know that...

324
00:50:46,715 --> 00:50:49,468
I'm your friend.

325
00:51:05,818 --> 00:51:06,902
What did you do?

326
00:51:08,988 --> 00:51:10,531
I took care of it.

327
00:51:11,865 --> 00:51:13,534
You're safe now.

328
00:53:17,533 --> 00:53:19,034
What now?

329
00:53:19,785 --> 00:53:21,495
What the fuck do you want?

330
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:24,039
I want to help you.

331
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:27,209
Oh, yeah?

332
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:31,505
Come with me and I'll show you.

333
00:54:23,891 --> 00:54:26,101
Make yourself at home.

334
00:54:54,296 --> 00:54:55,881
Agent Peña.

335
00:54:57,007 --> 00:54:58,717
Welcome to Montecasino.
