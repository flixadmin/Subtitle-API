1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,020
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,210
The guys call him The Ogre.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,950
He's a serial killer.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,640
Whoever did this, he's a monster.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,250
The blood of his next victim is on my hands!

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,990
If you don't drop it, that blood could be Lee's.

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,430
Because The Ogre retaliates against any cop who investigates

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,470
and kills the people they love.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,230
The man who stabbed Alfred, he's in Gotham.

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,810
And you need my help to find him.

11
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,820
Who sent you?

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,880
You want me to tell Bunderslaw that you're onto him?

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,260
You look far from home.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,070
Get away from him.

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,150
Or what?

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,610
Whatever.

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,630
Come on.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,150
Did you go back?

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,860
Yeah. The cops are there.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,580
And?

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,280
And?

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,780
What do you think?

23
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,570
He fell out of a five-story window. He's dead.

24
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,890
Why'd you do it?

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,540
He told us what we wanted. He told us about Bunderslaw.

26
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,140
You didn't have to go and kill the guy!

27
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,790
Yes, I did! 'Cause the moment we'd left,

28
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,300
he was gonna go tell his boss!

29
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,590
Who works for you, by the way.

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,640
He's the one who tried to kill me,

31
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,380
who tried to kill your butler...

32
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,850
who probably killed your parents.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,610
I saved your life.

34
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,090
Besides... you wanted to do it, too.

35
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,710
You just didn't have the guts.

36
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,160
- Wait...! - Just go home.

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,540
We still have to find out who Bunderslaw is and what he wants.

38
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,480
You mean you do.

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,170
You really think this is over?

40
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,780
He's gonna come after us.

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,720
So what's next?

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,870
His safe.

43
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,040
What?

44
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,870
Every senior executive at Wayne Enterprises

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,470
has a safe in their office.

46
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,140
A-Any secrets Bunderslaw has, that's where they'll be.

47
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,800
Key or combination?

48
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,300
Key. My dad had one.

49
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,970
He'll probably keep it on him, then.

50
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,010
Figure out a way to get me close, and I'll steal it.

51
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,700
Can you do that?

52
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,850
I think so.

53
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,580
And what happened tonight,

54
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,890
you tell no one.

55
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,650
Not your buddy Detective Gordon,

56
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,010
not your butler.

57
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,360
No one.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,110
Punctures on test subject are consistent with those on the victim,

59
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,130
indicating the killer was right-handed.

60
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,720
Yum.

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,230
Where's Thompkins?

62
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,510
Detective Gordon, Dr. Thompkins said I was free

63
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,790
to use this room. She's very nice.

64
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,950
She's not like the old medical examiner.

65
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,840
Ed, just tell me where she is.

66
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,500
No riddles.

67
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,440
Home. She went home.

68
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,790
Hope you find her.

69
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,930
Jim?

70
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,990
Jim, is that you?

72
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,650
You're lucky I don't skin you.

73
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,090
Go on.

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,090
- I... slow down. - Lee, please.

75
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,210
Start over.

76
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,510
This case you caught, the dead woman,

77
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,100
she was murdered by a serial killer?

78
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,190
Yes. Who's killed a dozen women, maybe more.

79
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,780
And Loeb gave you this on purpose?

80
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,130
He wants to hurt me.

81
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,470
And how am I in danger?

82
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,310
He murders the loved ones of any cop

83
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,780
who investigates him.

84
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,920
It's how he's been able to get away with it so far.

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,880
Anyone who comes after him,

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,950
he's killed someone they love

87
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,010
and the investigation's been buried.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,590
Bullock knows a cop--

89
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,870
came home and found his wife.

90
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,170
Her throat had been cut.

91
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,800
That's why Loeb gave me the case.

92
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,980
Either I give up, like everyone else...

93
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,960
and live, knowing I let a killer go free...

94
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,710
or I keep on,

95
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,540
and someone I love is killed.

96
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,060
You're not giving up, are you?

97
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,950
I can't.

98
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,150
That's why I need you to get out of Gotham right now.

99
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,480
Tonight.

100
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,710
No.

101
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,420
You want to protect me? Find him.

102
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,480
I'm gonna stay here and do my job.

103
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,820
But I do like that you think of me as a loved one.

104
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,810
I do.

105
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,940
Love you.

106
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,760
And it only took a serial killer to get you to say that.

107
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,540
- Thanks. - Yeah.

108
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,660
This is it.

109
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,350
Home sweet, you know.

110
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,020
This is a great space.

111
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,530
Selina?

112
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,370
Sort of a roommate.

113
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,840
She comes and goes.

114
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,810
Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball. 

115
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,620
Didn't you know I'm a member of society?

116
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,920
I go every year.

117
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,630
Get my picture taken in a pretty dress.

118
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,050
Smile.

119
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,610
Aren't you scared of my being here?

120
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,320
Should I be?

121
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,970
Are you dangerous?

122
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,400
I don't know -- is your boyfriend gonna come home?

123
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,300
I never said I had a boyfriend.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,480
I assumed a woman as beautiful as you...

125
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,040
You assumed I had a boyfriend

126
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,510
and you assumed I would be the kind of woman

127
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,100
who would cheat on him.

128
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,520
Well, I'm not.

129
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,960
And I don't have a boyfriend.

130
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,840
And if a bus hit me tomorrow,

131
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,740
no one would care.

132
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,780
That change things?

133
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,460
Yes, actually, it does.

134
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,850
Make it more illicit?

135
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,410
Or would there be less chance of us getting attached--

136
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,880
one night and done.

137
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,850
Only that would happen anyway.

138
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,600
Because once you saw the real me,

139
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,250
you would run screaming, like everyone else.

140
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,870
I have to say, you're not who I imagined you'd be.

141
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,610
Surprise.

142
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,140
You can let yourself out.

143
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,750
*Love, love*

144
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,560
*Love...*

145
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,380
*Love, love*

146
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,600
*Love...*

147
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,860
But you promised to dance with me.

148
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,200
And I will.

149
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,020
But first I have to finish with that gentleman.

150
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,020
Who knew running a nightclub was so much work?

151
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,070
My poor darling.

152
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,210
As I was saying,

153
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,680
you and your crew are the best gun and knife men in the city.

154
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,070
Your hit on Councilman Klein--

155
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,310
a thing of beauty.

156
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,130
- And I'm a fan, so... - Cheers.

157
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,630
What do you want?

158
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,910
For you to help me kill Don Maroni

159
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,060
and all of his lieutenants.

160
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,750
You're having a laugh.

161
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,790
I'm fairly certain I'm not.

162
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,620
And Falcone's good with this?

163
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,160
He will be.

164
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,550
When it's done.

165
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,870
Thank you.

166
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,810
No, thank you.

167
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,710
So you like being number two.

168
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,830
Falcone gives Victor Zsasz first dibs on every new contract.

169
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,690
You bring him the bullet-riddled corpse of his enemy

170
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,590
and all of that will change.

171
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,560
This is your chance to move up.

172
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,550
You're a mad fella, aren't ya?

173
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,730
Fair enough.

174
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,800
Come by the bar tomorrow.

175
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,180
We'll talk details.

176
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,210
What's this about, Harvey?

177
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,160
Have a seat.

178
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,090
This is my partner Jim Gordon.

179
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,710
Detective.

180
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,360
Eight years ago, you investigated the murder

181
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,250
of a woman named Julie Kemble.

182
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,480
- That was a long time ago. - It was the Ogre.

183
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,020
Julie Kemble was his first victim.

184
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,810
But you dropped the investigation,

185
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,750
and because of that,

186
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,890
11 more women have been murdered.

187
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,240
Seriously, guys, you know...

188
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,100
Stop.

189
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,310
We also know the Ogre

190
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,140
kills the loved ones of the cops that hunt him down.

191
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,670
That pattern started with you.

192
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,590
We think you found something that spooked him.

193
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,420
Your notes from the investigation.

194
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,920
The last page,

195
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,490
something's been scratched out.

196
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,680
I want to know what.

197
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,750
He killed my wife.

198
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,590
I still got a daughter, Harvey.

199
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,680
Beth Tudor.

200
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,710
Katherine Wood.

201
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,080
Jessica Parker.

202
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,940
11 women.

203
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,550
Each one was someone's daughter.

204
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,090
It has to stop.

205
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,320
Yeah. I was doing background on the dead girl. 

206
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,040
Someone told me she was a nurse

207
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,270
for a private medical clinic uptown.

208
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,930
It was on Grant and 80th.

209
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:58,540
Some cosmetic place.

210
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,110
We'll put cops on your daughter until this is done.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,330
So you forgive me?

212
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,500
I'll see you tonight.

213
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,900
How's it hanging, Riddle Man?

214
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,420
Uh, it's hanging...

215
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,250
fine.

216
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,730
Mr. Nygma,

217
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,130
did you need something?

218
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,720
Oh. Yes. Uh...

219
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,360
Detective Gordon wanted me to go through the forensic evidence

220
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,210
of these old murders.

221
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,190
Okay.

222
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,440
Are those bruises?

223
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,040
Did Officer Dougherty do that?

224
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,630
Um, he was... upset, and he didn't mean to.

225
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,310
I-I said some things I shouldn't have, and...

226
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,620
Miss Kringle, this is not right.

227
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,250
He can't just...

228
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,440
Mr. Nygma,

229
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,440
it is none of your concern.

230
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,650
Now, I-I need to get started on these files, so...

232
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,550
Alfred.

233
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,220
Should you be up?

234
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,120
Oh, thank you, Master Bruce. I feel...

235
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,150
I feel much better.

236
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,390
Can I get you anything?

237
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,570
Yes, actually. 

238
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,960
I've decided to attend the Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball tonight.

239
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,710
All the senior management will be there,

240
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,620
and I think people should see

241
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,640
that a Wayne is still at the head of the company.

242
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,930
I shall set your tux out for you.

243
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,630
Alfred...

244
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,910
Yes, Master Bruce.

245
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,410
Wh-When you were in the army...

246
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,110
you had to kill people, right?

247
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,850
Yes.

248
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,680
Yes, I did.

249
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,890
And it was necessary?

250
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,070
Oh, I see-- so you overheard the conversation

251
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,610
that Reggie and I had that was best left unsaid.

252
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,200
But in answer to your question, yes.

253
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,650
Yes, it was necessary.

254
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,970
Now, if you'll excuse me,

255
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,570
I better go and find my good cufflinks,

256
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,770
if we're stepping out.

257
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,490
No, but, uh, you're-you're still recovering.

258
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,810
What, I'm supposed to let you walk into that nest

259
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,030
of vipers on your tod?

260
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,050
There'll be hundreds of people there, Alfred.

261
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,240
I won't be in any danger.

262
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,070
So you say. But you're not gonna go alone.

263
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,530
I won't be alone.

264
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,580
I've invited Selina Kyle.

265
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,690
Selina Kyle?

266
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,500
To the Wayne Enterprises Ball?

267
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,150
I see.

268
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,530
What do you see?

269
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,770
Nothing. I mean, you know... I mean, you're...

270
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,480
a healthy young lad and she's a very pretty young girl

271
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,670
with a penchant of wearing, well, a little too much leather.

272
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,950
Alfred, it's not like that.

273
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
Then what's it like?

274
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,300
Well...

275
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,420
well, what if it is, huh?

276
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,940
What's wrong with that?

277
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,050
Absolutely nothing.

278
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,590
So, I will wait in the car outside,

279
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,000
so you don't feel my watchful eye,

280
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,180
but I will be close by, if there needs be.

281
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,840
That is the deal.

282
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,270
Fine.

283
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,170
Could you call around and send

284
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,060
some dresses and shoes to where she's staying?

285
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,460
This is the address.

286
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,320
It's a charity ball, Alfred.

287
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,720
I'll be fine.

288
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,210
Freaky, huh?

289
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,760
You wonder how they recognize themselves after.

290
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,320
Doc Thompkins is fine.

291
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,650
No one's gonna touch her at the precinct. Relax.

292
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,520
You do understand it's because of me that she's in danger.

293
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,540
Anything that happens is my fault.

294
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,890
You can't hold yourself responsible

295
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,780
for the actions of a psychopath.

296
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,160
Sure, I can.

297
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,180
Detectives... I'm Dr. Cushman.

298
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,330
How can I help you?

299
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,270
We're looking into the murder

300
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,910
of a woman named Julie Kemble.

301
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,620
She worked here about eight years ago.

302
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,830
Of course. Terrible thing.

303
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,030
Julie was a talented nurse.

304
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,810
But she'd only just started here when it happened.

305
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,180
She'd been recommended by one of our patients.

306
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,220
The patient's name? 

307
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,680
Well, I'm afraid I can't give you that.

308
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,240
Confidentiality.

309
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,010
Really?

310
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,470
You're gonna make us get a warrant?

311
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,250
Yes.

312
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,860
"I specialize in fake boobs, but I got ethics.

313
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,920
I need a warrant."

314
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,930
We'll talk to Judge Harkness. I'm sure...

315
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,510
That car was in front of the precinct.

316
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,200
Jim, wait up.

317
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,460
You sure about this?

318
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,380
It was him.

319
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,830
You saw his face?

320
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,940
No. I should've been looking for a tail.

321
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,980
It's obvious he tracks our investigations.

322
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,020
Called in a description of the car and a partial plate,

323
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,400
but I'm not too hopeful.

324
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,930
So what's the next move?

325
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,040
Gordon, you got a call.

326
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,990
Says it's urgent.

327
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,040
Gordon.

328
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,960
Detective.

329
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,520
I didn't get a chance to say hello properly in the alley.

330
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,140
- Listen to me... - Don't bother tracing this. I won't be long.

331
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,640
I'm giving you one chance to turn yourself in.

332
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,930
You make me come after you, and I will put you down.

333
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,310
Something tells me you've begun to buy your own press, Detective.

334
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,270
The hero cop who's gonna clean up Gotham.

335
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,270
The rising star of the GCPD.

336
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,060
I'll stop you, that's for damn sure.

337
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,590
No, Detective, you won't.

338
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,690
But keep on your present course,

339
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,310
and I will kill someone you love.

340
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,180
This is your only warning.

341
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,840
Oh, no.

342
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,070
Tell me that wasn't him.

343
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,650
He's used to intimidating cops.

344
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,100
We have to show him we're not afraid.

345
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,020
And how do we do that?

346
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,010
You're okay with this? You're sure?

347
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,100
Yes.

348
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,890
It's the right thing to do.

349
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,020
I called you here today...

350
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,260
because the people of Gotham deserve to know

351
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,740
that there's a serial killer in their midst.

352
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,380
For years, he's killed with impunity,

353
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,020
aided by a culture of silence and fear among the police.

354
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,930
That ends now.

355
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:02,270
We'll be providing the names and photos of all of the victims.

356
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,230
Please call with any information.

357
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,140
And to the man who committed these horrific crimes,

358
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,140
your days of hiding are over.

359
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm coming after you.

360
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,440
And I'm not gonna stop.

361
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,360
What are those for?

362
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,200
The Wayne Charity Ball.

363
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,050
It's boring but good for the gallery's business.

364
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,100
Well, I'll probably see you there.

365
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,240
What?

366
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,160
I'm going with Bruce Wayne.

367
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,170
Wait, what?

368
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,750
Delivery for Selina Kyle.

369
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,770
Uh, over there.

370
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,620
Thank you. Enjoy.

371
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,230
Am I really supposed to wear these?

372
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,370
Okay...

373
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,190
we have a lot of work to do.

374
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,520
Got it.

375
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,140
That was the doctor.

376
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,360
Harkness sent over the warrant.

377
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,440
The dead girl came to the clinic

378
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,330
by way of a Miss Constance van Groot.

379
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,030
Van Groot-- that's one of Gotham's oldest families.

380
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,110
- Shipping. - Yeah.

381
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,390
We thought the Ogre might be rich.

382
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,810
Could be the old lady had a son.

383
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,300
You got an address?

384
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,130
Right here.

385
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:37,070
Well, Butch, Connor and his crew are on board.

386
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,560
They hate Maroni even more than I...

387
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,750
Shut up. Maroni and his crew are here.

388
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,440
I couldn't turn 'em away.

389
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,380
- No, of course. No matter. - No.

390
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,670
She was already here.

391
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,410
Is that my buddy Oswald?

392
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,000
Come here.

393
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,460
Oh, Oswald.

394
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,120
There he is.

395
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,700
Mother, what are you doing?

396
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,880
I'm having a drink with Mr. Mar...

397
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,420
I told you-- Sal.

398
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,360
With Sal.

399
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,400
But we shouldn't impose any longer...

400
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,320
No, you're not taking my Gertrud.

401
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,380
Oh, his Gertrud.

402
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,020
Sit. Join us.

403
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,090
Oswald, sit.

404
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,270
Sit, Oswald.

405
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,310
Hello.

406
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,340
I'm Bruce Wayne.

407
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,410
Barbara Kean.

408
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,700
Selina never said you're who she's staying with.

409
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,630
Detective Gordon spoke of you.

410
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,640
Well, Selina can be a little guarded.

411
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,290
Yes, I know.

412
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,210
Stop talking about me.

413
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,860
Selina.

414
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,870
You look very nice.

415
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,580
The shoes hurt.

416
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,250
Have fun.

417
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,790
Look for me at the ball.

418
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,410
It was nice meeting you.

419
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,310
Think she's here?

420
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,160
Miss Van Groot!

421
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,850
GCPD!

422
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,660
I need to say this is not exactly legal.

423
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,050
We're running out of time.

424
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,140
Over here.

425
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,090
He's good.

426
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,200
Call it in. I'm gonna go check the rest of the house.

427
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,710
He told me...

428
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,440
but I was too slow.

429
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,130
Hello?

430
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,340
Miss Van Groot?

431
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,500
I'm a police officer.

432
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,520
Miss Van Groot?

433
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,650
Gordon!

434
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,420
Jim!

435
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,020
Jim Gordon,

436
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,610
Constance Van Groot.

437
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,190
Everyone's staring at us.

438
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,560
Well, I am Bruce Wayne.

439
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,320
Well, I am.

440
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,320
Anyway, I don't see Bunderslaw anywhere.

441
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,040
He's probably not coming.

442
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,660
But he's on the guest list.

443
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,050
Just keep dancing.

444
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,610
And smile, maybe?

445
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,750
Name's Jacob Skolimski.

446
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,470
He's not talking, but near as we can tell

447
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,900
he was the old lady's butler.

448
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,660
And you're thinking the Ogre's this guy's son,

449
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,790
not the dead woman's?

450
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,400
Yeah, yeah. Coroner said the old bird's been dead for years.

451
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,380
My guess, Ogre killed her, daddy pretends she's still alive,

452
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,390
so crazy serial killer son can keep living off her money.

453
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,910
He tried to kill himself.

454
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,140
He knew you were closing in.

455
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,600
- He has to be in contact with his son. - Yeah.

456
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,870
Listen, Gordon's running pretty hot on this one, Cap.

457
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,780
Can you blame him?

458
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,770
Thinks Thompkins is the next victim.

459
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,890
Still, watch him.

460
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,690
Alvarez called.

461
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,870
Nothing on the son in the system.

462
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,750
We have to make him talk.

463
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,740
Make this simple.

464
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,770
Give us your son's name and address.

465
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,300
Or what?

466
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,340
I'm not afraid of you.

467
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,720
Only because you don't know me.

468
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,750
Listen, I get wanting to protect your son,

469
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,330
but how many more women is he gonna have to kill

470
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,050
before you realize he needs to be locked up?

471
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,670
What are you talking about?

472
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,620
Don't play dumb with me. You were hiding

473
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,460
a rotting corpse upstairs for years,

474
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,370
but no, no, my son's an angel,

475
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,540
he didn't murder close to

476
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,170
a dozen women that we know of. 

477
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,320
My son--

478
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,220
he made one mistake.

479
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,380
One.

480
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,900
Anything else is lies.

481
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,600
So tell us the truth.

482
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,620
Selina, what happened last night--

483
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,380
that can never happen again.

484
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,930
I told you I didn't have a choice.

485
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,150
I don't accept that.

486
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,930
I knew you wouldn't be able to handle it.

487
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,790
You're right. I did want to kill him.

488
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,970
Keep your voice down.

489
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,680
But there's a line, Selina.

490
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,650
And you can say I don't have guts, but the fact is

491
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,430
I will never cross it.

492
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,570
I guess that's where we're different, then.

493
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,640
'Cause if I had to do it again, I would.

494
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,590
And it wouldn't bother me one bit.

495
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,350
That's Bunderslaw.

496
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,690
Riddle Man.

497
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,350
Officer Dougherty, a word.

498
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,030
I can start a war or end one.

499
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,320
I can give you the strength of heroes

500
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,840
or leave you powerless.

501
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,110
I might be snared with a glance,

502
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,190
but no force can compel me to stay.

503
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,010
What am I?

504
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,390
Got me.

505
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,840
Love.

506
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,380
Miss Kringle has given hers to you.

507
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,150
And in return, you hurt her.

508
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,090
I saw the bruises.

509
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,160
And?

510
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,300
And you cannot do that.

511
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,680
The next time you do that, I'll...

512
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,910
Calm down.

513
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,300
You'll give yourself a girly fit.

514
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,300
Have you ever been with a woman?

515
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,970
Didn't think so.

516
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,380
They need a firm hand.

517
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,730
That goes double for Kringle.

518
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,090
Girl's got a tongue.

519
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,160
I won't let you hurt her.

520
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,210
Oh, yeah?

521
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,510
What are you gonna do?

522
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,230
That's what I thought.

523
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,540
Later, Riddle Man.

524
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,350
Care to dance?

525
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,520
- You. - Me.

526
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,750
It was not a place for a boy to grow up.

527
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,530
Miss van Groot kept herself sealed off from the world, 

528
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,760
but she doted on my son.

529
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,490
Treated him as her own.

530
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,320
Still, I...

531
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,660
I didn't realize how deep it went.

532
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,150
This kid's own mom was out of the picture, 

533
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,140
so it seems he started thinking 

534
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,460
he was this van Groot woman's secret son.

535
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,060
I tried to tell him it wasn't true, 

536
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,390
but he had built this fantasy, and...

537
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,260
Miss van Groot led him on.

538
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,500
She was deranged.

539
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,580
Cruel, even.

540
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,620
So, about ten years ago, he confronts her, 

541
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,400
he demands that she acknowledge him,

542
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,050
give him her last name, put him in the will.

543
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,150
She laughs at him,

544
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,640
said it was all just a big joke.

545
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,080
So he kills her.

546
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,530
His dad feels guilty, helps him cover it up.

547
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,290
So the old woman rejects him,

548
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,240
he kills her-- bang, you got a serial killer

549
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,150
with a "mommy didn't love me" complex.

550
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,250
But there's a wrinkle.

551
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,530
I don't know where my son is.

552
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,090
He called me today, told me the police would be coming.

553
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,050
But I haven't seen him

554
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,620
since the day he killed Miss van Groot.

555
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,090
My son is not a bad man.

556
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,410
Your son has been seducing and killing women

557
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,860
for almost a decade.

558
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,310
Why is he laughing?

559
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,980
My son...

560
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,810
seducing women?

561
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,860
Oh, let me show you my son-- two pictures.

562
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,660
It's all I managed to save.

563
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,970
You've heard "a face only a mother could love"?

564
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,720
Well... his mother couldn't.

565
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,600
She left us after he was born.

566
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,110
Oh, yes... my son, the seducer.

567
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,130
Now you can see why it makes sense

568
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,280
he scratched his face out of those pictures.

569
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,620
But that means this can't be the Ogre.

570
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,130
We're chasing the wrong guy.

571
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,340
Jim had an idea.

572
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,970
Judge Harkness's warrant was very specific.

573
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,320
I don't have to say anything.

574
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,580
Then nod.

575
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,020
Did you operate on this man?

576
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,430
I need to know what he looks like now.

577
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,960
Or the next woman he kills will be on your head.

578
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,820
Never, never,

579
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,180
would he play with the other children.

580
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,260
You know, even then,

581
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,260
he was too good for them.

582
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:30,240
And now, he is a respectable man of business--

583
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,300
my Oswald.

584
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,120
Well...

585
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,830
this has been a delight.

586
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,000
But it's late.

587
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,480
One thing...

588
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,780
Gertrud, my love.

589
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,970
A question that's been bothering me.

590
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,730
Oh, no. Oh... no, no.

591
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,200
Is this an act?

592
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,510
Are you pretending that he's just a nightclub owner?

593
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,750
Or are you really that stupid?

594
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,610
Stop!

595
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,340
I don't understand. I...

596
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,630
- Your son... - Don Maroni, I am warning you!

597
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,510
is a cold-blooded psychopath.

598
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,200
No, no, no, no, no...

599
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,750
I can't count how many men he's killed.

600
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,150
My own friend, Frankie Carbone,

601
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,950
he stabbed him a dozen times.

602
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,340
What kind of person plunges a knife

603
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,420
into someone over and over?

604
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,550
He is a filthy liar, Mother!

605
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,580
He's just angry because I played him for a fool!

606
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,930
Oswald...

607
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,630
You know, don't you?

608
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,140
Oh, I can see it.

609
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,510
Let go of her!

610
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,660
Did you catch him, one night,

611
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,440
washing the blood from his hands?

612
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,850
When did you realize that you had given birth to a monster?

613
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,810
You are going to pay for this!

614
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,260
Maybe.

615
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,900
Or maybe this ends with me

616
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,130
dumping your lifeless body into the river.

617
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,050
Either way, you and Momma Gertrud can stop pretending.

618
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,170
Place is looking good.

619
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,400
The other night, when you saw my invitation,

620
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,180
why didn't you tell me you were coming?

621
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,140
I wasn't.

622
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,080
I didn't get invited.

623
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,970
Oh, so you're crashing.

624
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,400
Oh, no, I'm... on the list.

625
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:25,240
It's amazing what a $10,000 donation will do.

626
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,570
You donated $10,000 to this?

627
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,490
Why?

628
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,230
I was hoping that would be apparent.

629
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,840
And what if I decided not to come?

630
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,920
Well, then, I'd have been making a generous donation to charity,

631
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,860
and I would've been very... disappointed.

632
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,660
The way things ended last night,

633
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,530
it was my fault.

634
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,140
But I felt something.

635
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,280
I couldn't let it slip away.

636
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,840
Well, that's very sweet, but...

637
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:27,150
You said that when people see the real you,

638
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,500
they run screaming.

639
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,800
Someone said the same thing to me once,

640
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,420
that no one would ever love me.

641
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,330
Who?

642
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,050
The woman I thought was my mother.

643
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,570
Barbara...

644
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,100
I know what it's like...

645
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,830
to be one person on the inside,

646
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,460
and have the world see another.

647
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,160
I lived like that.

648
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,290
And it almost destroyed me.

649
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,010
I can see it destroying you.

650
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,340
I don't want to dance anymore.

651
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,370
The person that I am now, I created.

652
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,810
I brought him into being.

653
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,700
I can do the same for you.

654
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,190
Aren't you tired of playing games?

655
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,770
Of hiding?

656
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,490
Yes.

657
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,770
- Good-bye. - See you soon.

658
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,560
Hello. I'm Bruce Wayne.

659
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,720
Sid Bunderslaw.

660
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,730
I'm going around,

661
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,090
trying to get to know everybody who works for the company.

662
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,640
You do work for Wayne Enterprises, don't you?

663
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,720
I do.

664
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,080
I'm the Director of Physical Operations.

665
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,740
Which, I'm afraid, is a bit dull.

666
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,680
There are many much more interesting people here.

667
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,970
Ah, yes, well, I'm sure I'll get to meet everyone, eventually.

668
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,860
If you'll forgive me, Bruce,

669
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,160
I have an early flight tomorrow.

670
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,230
It's been a pleasure.

671
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,610
It was, um...

672
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,270
it was nice meeting you.

673
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,750
Sorry.

674
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,750
See?

675
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,880
Nothin' to it.

676
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,210
What is it?

677
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,180
Nothing.

678
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,690
Stop right there, buster!

679
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,640
Riddle Man?

680
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,380
What the hell are you doing, creeping around here?

681
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,950
You need to leave Miss Kringle alone.

682
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:53,950
What?!

683
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,860
I'm not gonna let you hurt her.

684
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,210
Ever again.

685
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,510
I think you need to leave Gotham...

686
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,220
tonight.

687
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,820
I get it now.

688
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,800
You got a thing for my girl.

689
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,810
That's too funny.

690
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,740
Don't take this personal.

691
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,870
You want some more?

692
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,710
Upsi-daisy...

693
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,560
Oh, dear.

694
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,380
Riddle Man...

695
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,280
Oh, dear.

696
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,600
Oh, dear.

697
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,930
Oh, no.

698
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,040
Oh, dear.

699
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,640
Oh, dear.

700
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,850
Oh, dear...

701
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,880
Oswald.

702
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,860
Feeling better?

703
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,520
I made tea.

704
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,180
I'm afraid you had...

705
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,340
well...

706
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,700
a little too much to drink.

707
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,770
Mr. Maroni, he...

708
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,660
he has a strange sense of humor...

709
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,880
Oswald...

710
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,350
I am not some bumpkin from the country,

711
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,680
with hay in my brains!

712
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,470
No...

713
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,870
I am your mother...

714
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,000
and I will love you, no matter what.

715
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,620
But lie to me now...

716
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,080
you will break my heart.

717
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,800
Oswald...

718
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,290
have you done things...

719
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,950
you should not?

720
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,480
I...

721
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,750
Mother...

722
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,510
I'm a nightclub owner.

723
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,110
That's all.

724
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,860
I'm tired now.

725
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,520
I'm tired.

726
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,000
Yeah, I got a delivery for Gertrud, from Sal.

727
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,310
Tip's not included.

728
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,170
You tell Sal it's over.

729
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,520
The guns are bought.

730
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,640
The killing room is waiting.

731
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,730
He doesn't know it, but he's a dead man.

732
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,050
On second thought...

733
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,770
I'll tell him myself.

734
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,540
O-Oswald?

735
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,500
Who was that?

736
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,210
It's Mr. Yatsko, from next door.

737
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,230
He needs help taking out some trash.

738
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,060
You, you... please, you help him, then.

739
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,980
Jason van Groot?

740
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,030
His real name is Jason Skolimski.

741
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,900
He used the old woman's name when he went to the clinic.

742
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,460
But there's no Jason van Groot or Skolimski in Gotham.

743
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,690
The guy's a ghost.

744
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,540
So, the old woman rejects him, he goes to the doctor,

745
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,990
gets himself a pretty new face.

746
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,830
That's where he runs into the nurse.

747
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,560
And we're off to the races.

748
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,120
I don't suppose you got a picture.

749
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,780
Missing from the file. No surprise there.

750
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:26,490
But the good doctor was kind enough to do a sketch.

751
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,550
It's been ten years since he last saw him,

752
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,830
but at least it's a start.

753
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:30,970
So we have his real name,

754
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,500
but not what alias he's using,

755
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,560
or what he looks like beyond a decade-old sketch.

756
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,440
Did he say anything else on the phone today?

757
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,430
Anything we might've missed?

758
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,740
Nah, just warned me to back off.

759
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,270
Told me not to believe my own press

760
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,690
as the rising star of the GCPD.

761
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,070
What is it?

762
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,970
The paper that said that--

763
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,450
they ran an old photo of me, from a charity gala.

764
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,310
I wasn't alone.

765
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:11,730
Barbara!

766
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,420
Is Barbara here?

767
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,490
No. Why?

768
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,190
Where is she?

769
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,020
When's the last time you saw her? 

770
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,970
At the Wayne Ball. She left with some guy.

771
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,820
Was this the guy?

772
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,830
It's kind of a crappy drawing.

773
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,000
Was this the guy?

774
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,290
Yeah, I think so.

775
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,280
Why? Who is he?

776
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,450
What's through there?

777
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,010
See for yourself.
