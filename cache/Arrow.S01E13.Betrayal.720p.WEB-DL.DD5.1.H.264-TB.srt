1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,210
My name is Oliver Queen.
For five years,

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:08,010
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,850
survive.

4
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,730
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,190
Now I will
fulfill my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,440
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,640
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,580
To do this,

9
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,650
I must become someone else.

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,050
I must become
something else.

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,950
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,820
Next time your daughter
calls the Vigilante,

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,290
we'll be able
to listen to every word.

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,910
I know you swore to bring
this guy down, detective,

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,740
but using your own
daughter as bait,

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,080
that's stone cold.

17
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,780
Where'd you get it?
From your stepfather.

18
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,720
And where
did he get it?

19
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,570
Belongs to your mother.

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,160
Mmm.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,250
Hi, George.

22
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,340
Vanch...
Surprised to see me?

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,790
I imagine you would be, seeing
as how you botched my trial,

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,290
and from what Viv here tells me,
protecting my interests.

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,800
There were contingencies
that couldn't be anticipated.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,770
Yes, Vivian told me.

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,770
The head of the Triad
getting ventilated,

28
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,850
Bertinelli getting collared,

29
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,110
and, uh, this archer.

30
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,860
Exactly.

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,940
What am I supposed to do in
the face of something like that?

32
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,280
Absolutely nothing, Georgie.
Tell you what.

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,180
All is forgiven.
Give us a hug.

34
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,490
Come on.

35
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,240
You know, I could use
a place to stay

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,330
while I'm getting my sea legs
back under me, George.

37
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,800
And you got a nice place here.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,000
What do you say? George?

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,370
George?

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,510
Ahem.

41
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,380
I hope George
has been food shopping.

42
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,180
I'm famished.

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,070
So this book contains
a list of the names

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,860
of the guys you've been hunting.

45
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,080
And this book,
your mother's,

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,560
has the same list of names.

47
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,450
It's identical.

48
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,670
So where'd your mother
get her copy, Oliver?

49
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,570
For that matter,
who gave it to you?

50
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,370
Felicity Smoak.

51
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,010
She said that Walter found it
in their bedroom.

52
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,960
And now he's missing.

53
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,850
She's my mother,
Diggle.

54
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,710
She's not the kind
of person who would--

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,520
Have her husband disappeared?

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,600
Because that's really
the question, isn't it, Oliver?

57
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,350
I understand why you would believe
your mother over your stepfather,

58
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,220
but I tend to believe the innocent
party is whoever's missing--

59
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,390
and presumed dead.

60
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,810
Twitch, and I will
open your throat.

61
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,100
How many more with you?

62
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,510
What?!

63
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,270
You have ten seconds
to tell me something I believe

64
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,140
before I cut out
your voice box.

65
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,020
Wait, wait, wait.
Yao Fei sent me here,

66
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,440
and I'm pretty sure
it wasn't so you could kill me.

67
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,110
What?

68
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,120
Yao Fei.

69
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,340
He gave me
directions to your...

70
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,150
plane.

71
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,160
Frank, you got be
kidding me.

72
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,960
You can't throw me
another assignment now.

73
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,720
It's Lieutenant,
and I'm pretty sure

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,300
that's what gives me
the authority.

75
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,100
I'm drawing in
on the Hood investigation.

76
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,850
I am going
to get this bastard.

77
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,170
Have you considered
the possibility no one wants you to?

78
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,610
What?

79
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,230
He saved the Christmas hostages.

80
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,530
He took down an arsonist
and armored car thieves,

81
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,120
and just last week, he busted
the Vertigo drug ring when we couldn't.

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,450
What was urban legend's
becoming heroic.

83
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,520
If this man's a hero,

84
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,370
I don't know what my life
in this city as a cop means.

85
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,210
Let me suggest you find meaning
in following orders.

86
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,630
Frank, listen!

87
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,080
I'm close.

88
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,830
If my lead comes
to something more...

89
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,300
Come to me with something real,
Quentin, and we'll talk.

90
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,340
In the meantime,
I'm assigning you another case.

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,640
Hey.

92
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,150
Heading out?

93
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,980
Oh, yeah,
it's a meeting

94
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,720
with the financial
planners.

95
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,740
Are you all right?

96
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,360
There was something
that I wanted to talk to you about.

97
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,160
I want to talk
to you about Walter.

98
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,230
Right around Christmas,
when he...disappeared,

99
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,830
he gave me this.

100
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,670
This is your
father's notebook.

101
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,140
He kept a list

102
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,240
of all the people in Starling City
who owed him favors.

103
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,580
I had...no idea

104
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,930
there was
so many of them.

105
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,720
I've just been researching

106
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,220
some of those names
online, and, um,

107
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,890
they're not good people.

108
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,890
Oliver, I have no idea
what your father

109
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,190
was involved in
or with whom.

110
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,730
And you and your sister
both now know

111
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,650
that he wasn't exactly
honest with me.

112
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,900
Then we need to find out--
no.

113
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,270
If what you say
is true

114
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,390
and this list is filled
with bad people

115
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,710
and Walter was looking
into it, and now he--

116
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,080
the only way to keep
this family safe

117
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,700
is for everyone in it to stop
asking questions,

118
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,760
including you,
Oliver.

119
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Promise me.

120
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,350
So this is really happening.

121
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,600
498 hours
of community service to go.

122
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,360
499. This orientation
doesn't count.

123
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,190
Tell me how this is not
cruel and unusual punishment.

124
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,030
Anastasia, I'd like you
to meet our new intern,

125
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,080
Thea Queen.
Interns get school credit.

126
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm more like
a court-ordered slave.

127
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,730
Oh. I can relate.

128
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,090
Anastasia is on
a one year pro-bono

129
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,870
sabbatical
from her law firm.

130
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,460
And apparently
from my six figure salary.

131
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,090
The experience of helping others
is its own reward.

132
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,660
I have yet to see
any evidence of that.

133
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,330
And speaking a lack of evidence,

134
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,060
Cyrus Vanch was released
from Iron Heights.

135
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,100
We represent a victim's
advocacy group

136
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,300
who's trying
to keep Vanch locked up.

137
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,970
I'm calling Kate Spencer.
I already did.

138
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,840
She said there's nothing
the D.A.'s office can do

139
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,140
without further evidence.

140
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,680
Well, then I'm going
to her office.

141
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,510
And then she also said
not to show up at her office.

142
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,480
Vanch is connected
to human trafficking,

143
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,970
drug running,
racketeering,

144
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,150
and at least 52
different homicides.

145
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,620
Ok, so what's the play?
Because unless you have access

146
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,300
to some private police force,

147
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,160
Vanch will stay free
to roam the streets.

148
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,210
I have to get this.

149
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,580
Hello?

150
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,330
How does a night with me
and a dozen famous chefs sound?

151
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,590
Like an episode
of "The Bachelor".

152
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,470
I'm auditioning potential chefs
for the club tomorrow night.

153
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,810
I've arranged a tasting,

154
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,140
and I could use
an extra set of taste buds.

155
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,710
I'm trying
to figure out how to get

156
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,510
a vicious criminal
back in jail. I can't.

157
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,180
It's perfect.
It sounds like hungry work.

158
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,820
Tomorrow night?

159
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,550
Maybe, if we could
do it early.

160
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,850
Look, I got to go.

161
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,990
There's someone
I have to call.

162
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,070
I'll see you later. Bye.

163
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,190
You don't find that
a little convenient,

164
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,750
her just so happening
to have burned the book?

165
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,560
She did it out of concern for
my safety, Diggle.

166
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,580
Or her own.
Oliver, you said it yourself.

167
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,740
Whoever compiled that list is
involved in something very dangerous.

168
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,670
And if your mother
is lying to you...

169
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,920
And she didn't know
any of the names on the list.

170
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,210
She said she didn't.

171
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,580
You don't have to take
her word for it.

172
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,850
Oliver, if this were anybody else,
you'd be hooded up right now

173
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,210
on your way to having
an arrow-side chat with them.

174
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,250
This isn't anybody else.
This is my mother.

175
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,890
And I know her.

176
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,640
What's that?

177
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,360
That is the phone
that I gave to Lance

178
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,810
so that he could
contact the Hood.

179
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,810
Is he asking
to turn yourself in?

180
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,980
He gave it
to Laurel. Hello?

181
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,070
I need your help.
That's why you have the phone.

182
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,190
Cyrus Vanch was just released
from prison on a technicality.

183
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,910
Living large
in his lawyer's house.

184
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,830
Who is now missing.

185
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,250
There's no evidence
of foul play.

186
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,500
But I know he's just
Vanch's first victim,

187
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,950
and he won't be
his last.

188
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,470
What
about the police?

189
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,120
They can't move on him
without evidence

190
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,220
of new criminal
activity.

191
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,790
Laurel, obtaining evidence
isn't what I do.

192
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,060
Vanch is dangerous.

193
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,480
Hold on to the phone,
I'll call.

194
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,570
Laurel needs my help.

195
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,810
Oliver, are you running
to help her...

196
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,220
or away from the truth
about your mother?

197
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,950
I have work to do.

198
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,450
Hey, Detective?

199
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,370
I'm busy, Kelton.

200
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,340
I'm pretty sure you're going to
want to hear this.

201
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,840
The bug I put in that phone
from the Vigilante just lit up.

202
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,460
Your daughter's playing
Maid Marion to Robin Hood again.

203
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,540
Where you going?

204
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,880
Lieutenant Pike's
office.

205
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,630
If she's meeting
with the Hood,

206
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,350
there's going to be
a task force there when she does.

207
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,170
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

208
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,110
See, we got to look at all this
as an opportunity.

209
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,030
The Triad and the Bertinelli
organization are leaderless.

210
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,670
The giant sucking
sound you're hearing

211
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,370
is the current power vacuum
in Starling City,

212
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,650
the one that
I plan on filling.

213
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,430
How are you going to convince
the Triad and Bertinelli's crew

214
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,520
that they should
sign up with you?

215
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,810
Well...

216
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,780
that's an excellent
question.

217
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,700
I need to do something.

218
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,900
Something spectacular.

219
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,450
To get their attention
and earn their respect.

220
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,870
You know what
I learned in prison?

221
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,480
If you want to be
respected,

222
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,520
you find the biggest guy
and you put him down permanent.

223
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,190
I think I just found
the biggest guy.

224
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,280
This is going to be fun.

225
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,870
I even wore
my fat pants.

226
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,330
I don't want to know
what those are, do I?

227
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,670
Nope.

228
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,240
Ohh.

229
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,840
This is work.

230
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,930
It'll just
be a second, okay?

231
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,050
Hello?

232
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,410
It's me. I have something.

233
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,080
Can you meet?

234
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,750
Yeah, where?

235
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,270
Rooftop, Winick building.
30 minutes.

236
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,390
Good work, Kelton.

237
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,480
Okay, everybody.

238
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,030
Rubber bullets.
This is my daughter here.

239
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,900
She cannot come
to any harm.

240
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,560
But outside of that,

241
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,580
you do whatever
needs doing

242
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,040
to bring that
archer down.

243
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,960
You sure about this?

244
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,820
Look, she knows I'd do anything
to catch this bastard.

245
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,040
And this is the best--
it's the only option I've got.

246
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,380
Look, I want to get this guy
just as badly as you do.

247
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,580
I just don't want to see
anything come between you two.

248
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,080
I warned her. I said stay away
from this lunatic.

249
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,720
She didn't.

250
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,790
You don't think that turns
a knife in my back?

251
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,460
I hope she sees it that way.

252
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,070
Mmm, put those
puppy dog eyes away.

253
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,580
Something's
come up at work.

254
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,470
That can't wait
until tomorrow?

255
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,320
It'll only be an hour.
I can meet you at the club.

256
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,110
One hour.

257
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,280
An hour and a half.

258
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,250
Tops.

259
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,150
Ricky has been driving me

260
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,370
for six years now.

261
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,130
I can't remember
the last time he missed a day.

262
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,010
Thank you for offering
to fill in, Mr. Diggle.

263
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,050
It's my pleasure, Mrs. Queen.
Believe me.

264
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,670
Are you sure my son
won't miss you?

265
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,610
He said he was staying
in for the evening.

266
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,140
And you believed him?

267
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,560
It's been my experience

268
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,730
when your son wants
some alone time,

269
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,450
there's not much I
can do to stop him.

270
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,040
Hmm. Much to my chagrin.

271
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,860
You can stop just up ahead.

272
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,680
No need to escort me inside.

273
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,560
I'm fine on my own,
Mr. Diggle.

274
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,230
Of course, Mrs. Queen.

275
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,010
Mr. Diggle.
Mrs. Queen.

276
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,680
I was just, uh,
looking for the restroom.

277
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,380
Excuse me, ladies.
Happy Birthday.

278
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,090
Hello, Laurel.

279
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,620
Thank you
for helping.

280
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,230
I couldn't do much.

281
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,270
Vanch's position
is too heavily fortified.

282
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,440
But I did get this.

283
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Evidence he's trying
to take over the positions

284
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,210
vacated by Frank Bertinelli

285
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,610
and...

286
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,750
and the Triad.

287
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,670
What's wrong?

288
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,220
We're not alone.
What?!

289
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,120
SCPD!

290
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,610
Get down! Hands
where we can see 'em!

291
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,890
Dad!
Do it now!

292
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,810
You so much as leave
a bruise on her,

293
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,310
and I swear I will
drag you down to hell myself.

294
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,300
Laurel, I'm sorry.

295
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,820
Quentin, don't!

296
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,810
I don't know what's worse--
the fact that you lied to me

297
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,880
or nearly got me killed!

298
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,710
You were
completely safe.

299
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,250
I was on a rooftop

300
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,300
with an army of men pointing
their guns in my face!

301
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,170
Well, you shouldn't have been
on that roof in the first place.

302
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,790
No! You wanted me
on that roof.

303
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,010
Wasn't that the whole point
of your little trap?

304
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,740
I'm trying
to catch a killer.

305
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,430
You manipulated me.

306
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,850
Manipulated?
You practically ran to this guy.

307
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,710
I told you, I said stay away from him
and you did not.

308
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,570
That was before you gave me the phone!
What?!

309
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,500
That's before you realized
that you could use me as bait.

310
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,400
Your own daughter.

311
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,940
Yeah, but you wouldn't
listen to me!

312
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,690
You are so blinded
by your hate for him

313
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,080
that you don't
realize the damage

314
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,610
that it's doing
in your own life.

315
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,650
To your family.

316
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,170
So what happens
when you catch him?

317
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,120
What happens then, Dad?

318
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,250
You're going to find
another criminal;

319
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,820
somebody else to blame
for mom leaving?

320
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,490
For Sarah dying,
for your drinking?

321
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,510
That's enough,
Laurel.

322
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,660
Yeah, you're damn right, it is.

323
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,800
Laurel!

324
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,360
The phone.

325
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,310
Give me the phone.

326
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,490
Laurel could have
been hurt, or worse.

327
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,360
And I suppose
that was Lance's fault.

328
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,460
What's your point, Dig?

329
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,560
Just that you don't really see
straight when it comes to Laurel.

330
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,000
Or your mother.

331
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is not the time

332
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,520
to bring
this up again.

333
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,470
Ok. Ok.

334
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,170
But there's something
I should tell you

335
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,040
and it's better
I tell you now than later.

336
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,460
I'll be driving your mother
around for a few days.

337
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,290
You're spying on her?!
Just doing my due diligence,

338
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:59,550
Oliver. See if she meets with
anyone we might be interested in.

339
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,060
She's not a suspect.

340
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,600
She's my mother.

341
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,820
Which is exactly
why someone needs to take

342
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,650
a close, objective
look at her.

343
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,110
Oliver, something's going on
in this city. You know it.

344
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,390
That doesn't mean
she's involved.

345
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,470
Then there's no harm
in me driving her around

346
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,140
for a few days, is there?

347
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,750
I still can't believe it.
He used me as bait!

348
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,970
Who?
My father.

349
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,140
He was trying
to catch the Vigilante.

350
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,850
He eavesdropped on my phone
conversation with him

351
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,760
and then lied in wait
with his jack boots.

352
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
This was tonight?
Yes.

353
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,610
While you were working.

354
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,150
This was work.

355
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,780
So you met up with the Hood guy?
Knowingly?

356
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,480
He's contacted me before.

357
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,240
He helped me
with the Declan case

358
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,320
and Joanna's arson
investigation.

359
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,540
The Declan case
was months ago.

360
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,490
I know, Tommy, I've been
wanting to tell you.

361
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,790
Laurel,
he's a murderer!

362
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,960
God.

363
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,910
You sound like my father.

364
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,050
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but he's right.

365
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,450
Are you seriously
taking his side?

366
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,170
He's been lying
to me for weeks!

367
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,640
Yeah, it feels like
crap, doesn't it?

368
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,930
Tommy!

369
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,900
A sting operation to catch
the notorious Starling City vigilante

370
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,520
wreaked havoc last night.

371
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,440
Despite the police's
failed attempt

372
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,990
to apprehend the Vigilante,

373
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,610
police have continued to insist

374
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,440
that their warnings remain.

375
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,440
This archer is to be
considered armed and dangerous.

376
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,080
Should you find yourself in
harm's way, always always,

377
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,110
call 9-1-1.

378
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,530
Interesting.

379
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,790
Using deception
and intimidation

380
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,590
to make a name
for himself.

381
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,680
This guy
stole my move.

382
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,830
I have news.

383
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,100
From my friend
in the police department.

384
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,520
I think I've figured out a way to
get the Hood out and into the open.

385
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,020
Huh.

386
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,940
Astonish me.

387
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,610
Remember that attorney?

388
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,030
Laurel Lance?

389
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,350
Now what's wrong
with this picture?

390
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,410
You look like
you're...working.

391
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,660
I'm going
over résumes

392
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,160
for the Chef's position
at the nightclub.

393
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,530
This guy looks pretty good.
He won "Top Chef" Season Six.

394
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,080
At this point,
it is basically

395
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,200
a culinary prerequisite
to be on that show.

396
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,330
Ohh.

397
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,550
Can I talk to you
about something?

398
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,720
Tommy...

399
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,320
Every time you want
to talk to me about something

400
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,010
and that something is Laurel,
you look like you're about

401
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,640
to tell me you have
a terminal disease.

402
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,350
She's been working
with the Hood guy.

403
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,820
What?

404
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,850
You're letting her work
with that crazy person?

405
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,110
She could get hurt, Tommy.

406
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,220
I'm not "letting"
her do anything, okay?

407
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,860
I only just
found out about it

408
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,690
because she accidentally
slipped up

409
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,900
on one
of her many lies.

410
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,250
She's lying to you?
That doesn't sound like Laurel.

411
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,870
Lying, keeping secrets
about who she's spending time with--

412
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,070
does that remind you
of anybody we know?

413
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,020
Me, in every relationship
that I've been in.

414
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,180
Me, too.
Except this one.

415
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,180
There's some sort of infatuation
thing going on here.

416
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,420
I...

417
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,640
We both know
that she has

418
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,560
a pretty strong
track record

419
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,420
of being attracted to
guys who are dangerous,

420
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,140
who break the rules.

421
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,430
Show me a more dangerous
rule breaker than the Hood.

422
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,730
I just think you need to have
an honest chat with her.

423
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,600
Find out the real reason
she's keeping secrets.

424
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,740
I just can't
believe that Laurel,

425
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,870
of all people,
would lie to my face.

426
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,710
I guess that's
the way that it is

427
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,780
with the people
that you're closest to.

428
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,100
I know.

429
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,120
But talk to her anyway,
and fix this.

430
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,440
Before it becomes
something that's unfixable.

431
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,700
Shéngcun.

432
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,170
It's Chinese.
It means sur--

433
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,090
Survive.

434
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:20,360
What do you think he meant,
besides not getting killed?

435
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,810
There's an airfield
10 clicks from here.

436
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,080
It's key off this island.

437
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,980
Yao Fei and I had been
observing it for months,

438
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,250
familiarizing ourselves
with their operations.

439
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,750
We were supposed to get off
this island together.

440
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,940
But then Yao Fei
was compromised,

441
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,260
and we were separated.

442
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,630
What's this for?

443
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,380
I think Yao Fei sent you

444
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,000
because he knows
I cannot take the airstrip alone.

445
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,620
Sounds like Yao Fei.

446
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,890
He is a softer judge
of character than I am.

447
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,180
If you're going
to have my back,

448
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,010
I need to know
you can cover it.

449
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,040
What are you doing?

450
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,860
Fight back.

451
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,790
Keep your blade up.
Always stay

452
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,030
behind your sword.

453
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,820
You have no skill.
No strength.

454
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,840
No training.

455
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,480
To say you fight like a girl
would be a compliment.

456
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,930
I told you--
I'm not a soldier.

457
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,510
I was shipwrecked here.
I killed the guy

458
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,150
that was wearing
this uniform by accident.

459
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,550
Where was Yao Fei?

460
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,740
He told me to run.

461
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,230
And I did.

462
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,670
Hey, it's Tommy,
hit me on the beep.

463
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,400
Hey, it's me again.

464
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,040
Please call me back.

465
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,240
I think
we should talk.

466
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,880
I was just
leaving you a message.

467
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,110
I love a girl who can take
care of herself.

468
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,970
But can't block a taser.

469
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,510
Oh, no need to get out
of the car, Mr. Diggle.

470
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,080
It's just my accountant.

471
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,750
The only threat is boredom.

472
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,130
Well, it's no
problem at all,

473
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,720
Mrs. Queen.
It's my job.

474
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,190
Yes. Well, then,
take the night off.

475
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,570
I'm quite all right.

476
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,330
It's taken care of.

477
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,930
I've taken care of it.

478
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,580
Carl Ballard will not be
a problem anymore.

479
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,380
Given your propensity
for squeamishness,

480
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,840
I'm assuming that Mr. Ballard
remains in good health.

481
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,740
I made it clear
to him persuasively

482
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,670
that his plans endangered
the undertaking.

483
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,990
I didn't have to make
the usual threats.

484
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,230
Excellent.

485
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,310
Now, one more matter
to attend to.

486
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,990
I need you to have
to contents of this address

487
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:53,120
removed and disposed of
thoroughly.

488
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,920
The warehouse where
you're storing the remains

489
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,940
of "the Queen's Gambit".

490
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,960
I already told you, I knew
Robert's yacht was sabotaged.

491
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,640
And I don't think it serves for
anyone to find evidence of that.

492
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,970
Do you?

493
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,220
What the hell
are you doing?

494
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,540
Nothin'. Just hangin'.

495
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,500
I work for Mrs. Queen.

496
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,770
And I work security for
the man she's meeting with.

497
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,420
I guess that means
we're on the same team.

498
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,940
I don't think so.
And I'm going to need to see

499
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,860
what you put
in your pocket just then.

500
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,070
What are you, man,
the police?

501
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,640
Show it to me.

502
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,760
Do it now.

503
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,560
Right.

504
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,750
Just thought I could come in
here and ruin my lungs a little bit.

505
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,780
I know,
it's a filthy habit.

506
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,880
Laurel, it's me.
Can we talk?

507
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,940
Laurel?

508
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,280
Laurel?

509
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,280
Make sure this message
finds its way to the Vigilante.

510
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,160
Do it fast,
because at sunrise,

511
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,280
I'm going to leave pieces
of this girl all over Starling City

512
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,000
unless he pays me
a little visit.

513
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,590
You know, gives us a chance
to get to know each other better.

514
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,960
What do we do?

515
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,060
Can your CSIs,
I don't know,

516
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,580
can they track this
or trace it or something?

517
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,820
How did he know
about Laurel?

518
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,400
What?

519
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,800
How does this guy know

520
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,410
Laurel is connected
to the Hood?

521
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,910
I have no idea.

522
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,140
I only found out about it
myself last night.

523
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,160
She--she said you knew.

524
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,480
Well, just me and...

525
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,130
Mr. Lance,
this maniac has got Laurel!

526
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,490
You got to call in
posse or something,

527
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,000
I don't know, SWAT teams.
I can't.

528
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,000
Detective Lance...

529
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,860
I got to go
make a call.

530
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,340
Thanks for coming.

531
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,740
It didn't seem like a good idea
to talk about this at your house.

532
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,510
Yeah, it would have been
a little awkward

533
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,710
for you to explain to my mother
that you're spying on her.

534
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,250
No, man.

535
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,910
Awkward part's
coming up.

536
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,930
You bugged
my mother?

537
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,080
Just listen.

538
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,920
It's taken care of.

539
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,640
I've taken care of it.

540
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,880
Carl Ballard will not be
a problem anymore.

541
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,980
Given your propensity
for squeamishness,

542
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,320
I'm assuming that Mr. Ballard
remains in good health.

543
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,600
I made it clear
to him persuasively

544
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,940
that his plans endangered
the undertaking.

545
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,940
I didn't have to make
the usual threats.

546
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,330
Excellent.

547
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,740
Now, one more matter
to attend to.

548
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,080
I need you to have
to contents of this address

549
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,630
removed and disposed of
thoroughly.

550
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,920
The warehouse where
you're storing the remains

551
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,640
of "the Queen's Gambit".

552
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,430
I already told you, I knew
Robert's yacht was sabotaged.

553
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,210
I'm sorry, man.

554
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,910
The yacht was sabotaged.

555
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,850
Somebody tried
to kill my father.

556
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,400
And your mother
was involved somehow.

557
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,410
You do not know
that she was involved, Diggle!

558
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,620
What I do know Oliver,
and so do you,

559
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,440
is that she kept this a secret.

560
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,280
Why would she do that if she
didn't have something to hide?

561
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,830
Is that...?
Yeah!

562
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,370
You have three seconds
before I have this line

563
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,160
permanently disconnected.

564
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,820
It's Laurel.
She's been kidnapped.

565
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,680
Listen, whoever this is,

566
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,930
he's going to kill my daughter.

567
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,260
Please believe me.

568
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,510
Sorry.

569
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,110
It's nothing personal.

570
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,950
The airfield was a very
heavily fortified position.

571
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,850
I've been there.

572
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,120
And I cannot
take it on my own.

573
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,910
So--so what?!

574
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,870
Huh? You're just
going to kill me?

575
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,660
Like I said...

576
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,690
It's nothing personal.

577
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,250
But if you're alive,
they will find you.

578
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,500
And if they find you,
they will torture you

579
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,340
until you give up my location,

580
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,920
and I cannot allow
for that to happen.

581
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,760
Hey, don't leave! No, please don't
do this, all right?!

582
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,510
I'm not going to say
anything to that--

583
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,510
Don't make it
more difficult upon yourself.

584
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,350
I can do this
in a way

585
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,570
that you will not
feel it at all.

586
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,080
Ahhh!

587
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,740
Steve Wilson.
Oliver Queen.

588
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,290
Well, Oliver Queen...

589
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,740
There might be a fighter
inside of you after all.

590
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,610
Detective.

591
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,400
If this is another trick,

592
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,730
you will not like
the consequences.

593
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,620
I'm not particularly
happy right now.

594
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,160
I hate you.
I hate everything you stand for.

595
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,490
But this lunatic
has my little girl.

596
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,540
He left this behind
as some kind of ransom note.

597
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,630
His name is Cyrus Vanch.

598
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,450
Jeez...

599
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,780
He'll kill her if he
doesn't get to you.

600
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,470
He'll kill her anyway.

601
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,550
So why come to me?

602
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,840
It's a pretty tight
circle that knows

603
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,060
about you and my daughter
working together.

604
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,060
If Vanch knows, it's because someone
at the precinct talked.

605
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,850
There isn't anybody else
I could trust.

606
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,430
Vanch is holed up
in a mansion.

607
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,100
It's a heavily
fortified position.

608
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,840
I was there. I can't
take it by myself.

609
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,160
I need your help.

610
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,980
Then I need yours.

611
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,520
Time's running out.

612
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,690
And still no visit
from your friend.

613
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:53,360
I might have overestimated his
fondness for you.

614
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,680
Assault with intent.

615
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,030
And kidnapping.

616
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,520
You're going to rot in prison
for life this time.

617
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,350
That's assuming

618
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,820
your hooded BFF
saves you.

619
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,930
And his chances
of survival are not so great.

620
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,360
He's going up
against trained men

621
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,860
with their fingers
on the trigger

622
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:22,030
of guns that fire up to
600 rounds per minute.

623
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,250
Now, I'm no Einstein,

624
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,050
but that is a lot
of bullets.

625
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,690
And even if he were
to take them out,

626
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,490
I have two sharpshooters
on the roof.

627
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,950
And even if he were
to get by them,

628
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,150
what's he going to do against
the veritable army

629
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,740
of sons of bitches
I've got waiting for him?

630
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,600
Now, as I said,

631
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,090
I'm no Einstein.

632
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,360
But I can count to 24.

633
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,030
And in case
you're wondering--

634
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,810
I was so I studied up
on my news footage--

635
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,700
24 is the exact number
of arrows he carries in his quiver

636
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,950
and flechettes
around his forearm.

637
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,280
Lose the bow,
Merida.

638
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,920
Ventilate him.

639
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:52,620
My daughter!
My little girl!

640
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:00,300
I'm the Vigilante.
You're the cop.

641
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,820
That doesn't mean I have to read
the bastard his rights, though.

642
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,140
Laurel, are you ok?

643
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,810
Yeah.

644
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,450
I'm ok.

645
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,960
All right,
you're good to go.

646
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,680
I'll, uh, I'll take you
home now.

647
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,720
I can take a cab.

648
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,270
Laurel, you had a trauma.
I'll drive you home.

649
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,590
No.
What?

650
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,520
I'm going to need you to keep
your distance for a while.

651
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,310
Laurel...

652
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,200
Dad, I love you.

653
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,120
I'll always love you.

654
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,450
But what I can't do right now
is trust you.

655
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,790
I was just doing my job.

656
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,660
I thought you'd understand
at least that.

657
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,290
That part I do understand.

658
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:04,300
But lying to me,
using me...

659
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,000
It's going to take longer.

660
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,000
Are you all right?

661
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,760
What would you think if I said
I didn't know?

662
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:35,620
That you were being honest.

663
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,470
My father
has the phone now.

664
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,970
And I don't think he'll be
giving it back any time soon.

665
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,610
Maybe that's good.

666
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,980
I didn't see how
it would put you in danger.

667
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,730
I'm a big girl.

668
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,330
I knew the risks.

669
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,550
Now I know them.

670
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,770
And I'm not willing
to take them with you.

671
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,390
What does that mean?

672
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,910
It means good-bye.

673
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,780
Laurel!

674
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,660
Laurel.

675
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,030
Oh, my God, Laurel.

676
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,090
Laurel, tell me
you are okay, please.

677
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,460
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm so sorry.

678
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,040
No, no,
it doesn't matter,

679
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,840
just as long
as you're okay.

680
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:28,000
You know, this does not
change anything

681
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,670
between you and I.

682
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,660
It takes two men
to take the air field.

683
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,940
And if you compromise
my getting off this island,

684
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,650
I will kill you.

685
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,680
You've had
your second chance.

686
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,850
You need me
just as much as I need you.

687
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:46,140
So what's our next step?

688
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,870
Turning you into something
that won't get us both killed.

689
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,510
Choose a weapon.

690
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,460
We're starting now?

691
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,720
That's mine.

692
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,070
You are the lunatic
who tortured me?!

693
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,520
No, that was another guy.
Bull!

694
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:25,840
This mask, it's my
operational equivalent

695
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,330
to a balaclava.

696
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,950
My partner
and I wore them

697
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,900
to keep our identities
classified during our missions.

698
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,620
You're lying.

699
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:40,760
Fyers told me this nutcase
is a prisoner on the island.

700
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,040
He lied to you.

701
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,080
My partner and I came
here to free Yao Fei

702
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,430
and get him
off this island.

703
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,970
We're A.S.I.S.

704
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,750
Australian
intelligence.

705
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,920
Now.

706
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,930
You are going to find
your silver weapon.

707
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,760
Have you considered
a sword?

708
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,930
I like swords.

709
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,200
I made it clear
to him persuasively

710
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,740
that his plans endangered
the undertaking.

711
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,260
I didn't have to make
the usual threats.

712
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,710
I've listened
to this 15 times.

713
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,880
It's definitely her
voice, Diggle. I just...

714
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,670
I can't believe
it's her.

715
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,440
We all have blind spots
when it comes to family.

716
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,090
Yeah. Laurel's almost
got her killed tonight.

717
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,260
Vanch never would have known
about her connection to me

718
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,210
if Lance hadn't
have lied to her.

719
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,600
I guess the lesson here
is blind trust can be dangerous.

720
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,750
I made it clear
to him persuasively

721
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,310
that his plans endangered
the undertaking.

722
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,910
I didn't have to make
the usual threats.

723
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,910
What's the undertaking?

724
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,380
I don't know.

725
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,150
But with all this
talk about threats,

726
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,250
it can't be good.

727
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,620
You warned me that
if she was lying

728
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,420
would be to cover up her
involvement in something dangerous.

729
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,280
I need to know what
The Undertaking is.

730
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,800
What are you going to do?

731
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,560
I need to have another
chat with my mom.

732
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,230
I'll need the Unidac merger
finalized by the end of the week.

733
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,100
We're on something
of a clock here.

734
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,920
Moira Queen,

735
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,250
you have failed this city.

736
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,280
