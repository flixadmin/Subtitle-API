Not even, I think, to God.

Well, think about what did happen.

I didn'<i>t</i> kill those men,
if that's what they think.

00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,202
If that's what you're saying.

00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,872
No, I'm saying
I want to understand what happened.

I'm saying thank you for saving my life.

I'm saying there's a cost.

235
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,555
I just don'<i>t</i> know if it's possible.

236
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,224
Don'<i>t</i> know if what's possible?

237
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,480
For you to love me and be you.

[Bruce] You still working?

You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

243

Comes to us all, Master Wayne.

244
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,850
Even you got too old to die young.

245
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,895
And not for lack of trying.

Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry...</i>

There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

248
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,781
It's this new layer of armor.

249
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,242
I'll just have to rewire.

250
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,706
So, last night was productive?

251
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,043
No. He's too low-level. He knew nothing.

252
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,421
This is the man who knows things.

253
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,550
Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian.

254
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,468
Contracts all over the globe,

255
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,012
but he's based out of
the port of Gotham.

256
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,722
Weapons and human trafficking.

257
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,017
[Alfred] So the White Portuguese
is a Russian. That's the theory.

258
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:10,147
No. The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.

259
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,358
If he is, indeed, a "him."

260
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,529
You don'<i>t</i> even know if he exists.
Could be a phantasm.

261
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,865
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

262
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,659
Ah, high-stakes round.

263
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:26,663
New rules.

264
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,169
[Bruce] We're criminals, Alfred.

265
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,504
We've always been criminals.
Nothing's changed.

266
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,924
Oh, yes, it has, sir.

267
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,178
Everything's changed.

268
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,018
Men fall from the sky.

269
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,355
The gods hurl thunderbolts.

270
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,066
Innocents die.

271
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,402
That's how it starts, sir.

272
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,239
The fever. The rage.

273
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,283
The feeling of powerlessness.

274
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:09,206
It turns good men cruel.

275
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,969
[player] John, get D.

276
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,889
Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, ahoy!
I did not know you were here.

277
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,933
- Man on the marquee.
- Yeah, don'<i>t</i> believe it.

278
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,518
My father named the company
after himself.

279
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,353
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.
How you doin'?

280
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,813
Really great.

281
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,607
Really great? Good. Good. Uh, follow me.

282
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,819
No, uh, Dad started saying
that he named the company

283
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,445
after his kid at investor pitches.

284
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,781
Rich old ladies.
They thought it was very cute, you know?

285
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,408
"Write checks for Lex."

286
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,619
You know, Dad was born in East Germany.

287
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,038
He grew up eating stale crackers.

288
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,457
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

289
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,376
and wave flowers at tyrants.

290
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:58,547
So, I think it was providence
that his son, me,

291
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,840
would end up with this.

292
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,259
One of my Rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.

293
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,845
Little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.

294
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,222
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?

295
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,807
Homeland security? Hmm.

296
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,643
No, no, no, ma'am, planetary security.

297
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,479
[scientist] The fragment
is of a radioactive xenomineral.

298
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,857
We suspected it might
have bio-interactions,

299
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,109
so we took the sample to AMRIID,

300
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,447
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

301
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,992
And, when we exposed
General Zod to the mineral,

302
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,535
this happened.

303
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,498
Profound biodegradation.
Decaying Kryptonian cells.

304
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,208
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

305
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,668
if a large enough sample was found.

306
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,921
And then, among the fishes, a whale.

307
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,673
Ah!

308
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,592
Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.

309
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,386
Emerald City. [breathes deeply]

310
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:47,929
Beautiful.

311
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,848
Now, Rocky is radioactive,

312
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,143
but what he needs from you
is an import license.

313
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,854
And why would we want to
weaponize this material?

314
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,938
[Lex] As a deterrent.

315
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,608
A silver bullet to keep in reserve,
to use against the Kryptonians,

316
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,109
so the day does not come, madam,

317
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,528
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

318
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,823
Last I looked, the only one of those
flying around up here was Superman.

319
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:10,035
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are...

320
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,286
There are more of them.

321
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,579
The metahuman thesis.

322
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,039
[Lex] Yes, the metahuman thesis.

323

The word "philanthropist"

Meaning a lover of humanity.

I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.

588

The <i>Daily Planet</i> criticizing
those who think they're above the law

589
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,706
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn'<i>t</i> you say?

590
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,168
Considering every time
your hero saves a cat out of a tree,

we project ourselves onto him.</i>

some sort of devil or Jesus character.</i>

[Neil deGrasse Tyson] <i>We're talking

646
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:52,664
<i>And you go back to Copernicus,</i>

647
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,584
<i>where he restored the Sun
in the center of the known universe,</i>

648

<i>displacing Earth.</i>

649
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,129
<i>And you get to Darwinian evolution,</i>

650
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,256
<i>and you find out we're not

<i>we're just one among other lifeforms.</i>

652
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,636
And now we learn that we're not even

653
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,598
special in the entire universe
because there is Superman.

I'm not saying he shouldn'<i>t</i> act.

661
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,373
I'm saying
he shouldn'<i>t</i> act unilaterally.

662
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,500
<i>What are we talking about here, then?</i>

Nothing was ever simple.

[Jenet] An odd little duck.

Hmm!

684

I've never seen a metal like this.

685
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,208
Could be DARPA black box.

00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,295
Nobody who'd want to.

688
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,715
Maybe they gave them
out to the rebels to test in theater.

689
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,009
Using live soldiers as guinea pigs?

690
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,346
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.

Yeah? Well, what the fuck do you want?

[Lois] Secretary Swanwick,

you haven'<i>t</i> been

725
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:13,026
Miss Lane, if you'd like an interview,
Major Farris is just outside that door.

726
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,028
You're treating me like a stranger?

727
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,198
I'm treating you like a reporter.

728
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:22,202
All right. Is the US providing
experimental military arms

729
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,662
to rebels in Africa?

730
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,914
You know, with balls like yours,

731
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:27,958
you belong in here.

732
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,253
What's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

733
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:33,797
No, not tin. But it's metal.

734
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,632
Fired in the Superman incident.

735
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,344
Experts at the Pentagon can'<i>t</i> ID it.
We haven'<i>t</i> been told the truth.

736
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,428
Here's the truth.

737
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:43,265
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she shouldn'<i>t</i> have.

738
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:47,394
Superman acted like some rogue combatant
to rescue her, and people died.

739
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,106
Don'<i>t</i> invent a conspiracy theory
to put back his halo.

740
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:53,650
Or yours.

741
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:56,027
- Major.
- [Farris] Sir.

742
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:58,280
[Perry] <i>So-</i>

01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,617
There's copy all right.

745
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:06,496
But nothing about football.

746
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,833
Nothing about the friends
of the Metropolis Library,

747
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:15,547
just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing
I told you not to pursue.

748
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,757
If the police won'<i>t</i> help,
the press has to do the right thing.

749
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,509
You don'<i>t</i> get to decide
what the right thing is.

750
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,012
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

751
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:25,891
And so could you if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

752
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:29,102
WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don'<i>t</i> cost a nickel.

753
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:32,230
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!

754
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,611
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

755
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,448
[Jon Stewart] <i>So apparently Superman</i>

756
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,742
<i>doesn't want us to think of him

757
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:47,120
<i>And really, why would we?
Aside from the red and blue costume.</i>

758

761

<i>the Declaration of Independence

762
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,464
<i>He thinks it's too on-the-nose.</i>

763
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,299
- [manager] What is going on back here?
- No.

764
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,800
Guys, come on. Let's go.

765
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:02,260
Get yourselves together
and get out there.

766
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,679
Get those glasses on those trays.
We got thirsty people out there.

767
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,649
I wonder, would you excuse us?

768
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,609
- There's something I'd like to show you.
- I'm sorry.

769
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,905
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

770
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,949
But I believe it's the action

771
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:28,161
perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.

772
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:32,707
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

773
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,919
And I can'<i>t</i> believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

774
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,089
It's the Sword of Alexander.

775
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:43,468
It's the blade
that cut the Gordian knot.

776
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,138
It's a triumph.

777
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:48,556
[Diana] Yes.

778
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,350
- [James Harmon] Enjoy.
- [Diana] Thank you.

779
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,359
It's a fake.

780
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,112
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

781
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,446
And now it hangs...

782
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,532
Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

783
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,495
Excuse me.

784
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,665
Excuse me, miss.

785
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,876
The other night, you took something
that doesn'<i>t</i> belong to you.

786
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,628
Stealing's not polite.

787
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:22,007
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

788
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,176
Who are you?

789
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:28,054
Someone interested
in the same man you are.

790
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,432
Is that right?

791
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,852
I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph
that belongs to me.

792
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:35,312
Did you get it?

793
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,147
As it happens, no, I didn't.

794
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:40,984
The data you copied

Master Wayne, since the age of seven
you have been to the art of deception

847
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,642
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

It's a rock.

a 1 % chance that he is our enemy,

867
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,287
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.

And we have to destroy him.

869

But he was a father. He was that, too.

[Kahina] I have to speak
to the senator today.

961
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,433
[receptionist] You cannot see
the senator today.

962
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,185
[Kahina] I need to speak to her
before the hearing.

963
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:45,145
Do you understand how important this is?

964
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:46,480
[receptionist] I cannot let you
see the senator.

965

[Kahina] Please, I need to speak to her.

966
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:51,193
Please, madam. I beg of you!
Please don'<i>t</i> do this!

967
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:52,778
This is so important!

968

- [Kahina] Don'<i>t</i> touch me!

969

- Please!
- I'm sorry. She wouldn'<i>t</i> leave.

970
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:00,994
I didn'<i>t</i> tell you the truth.

971

C.I. thinks the desert was a setup.

972
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:06,917
Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.

973
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,337
[sighs] The bullet?

974
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:20,055
The metal was developed
by a private company.

975
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,223
What company?

976
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:22,599
LexCorp.

977
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:25,185
Lex Luthor?

978
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:28,105
He also had private security contractors
at the desert compound.

979
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:33,986
Go on record.

980
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,030
Not a chance. It's classified.

981
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:38,949
I happen to like my job.

982
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,200
It doesn'<i>t</i> make sense.

983
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:42,327
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,

984
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:45,080
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the... [gasps]

985
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,755

The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.

988
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,098
And of course
the big unknown in all of this is

989
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:04,391
will Superman show up?

990
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:05,601
That is what
they're really waiting to see.

991
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,312
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.
Soledad O'Brien, In the Moment.

992
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:09,730
Quick question for you.

993
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,356
You're heading in
to meet with the senators.

994
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,608
What will you tell them?

995
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,819
[Wallace] <i>I've come here to tell them
to wake up.</i>

996
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,698
<i>This is flesh and blood.
He has delivered a war here.</i>

997
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,949
<i>And this...</i>

998
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,786
<i>This is what war looks like.
I have nothing.</i>

999
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,873
<i>There are plenty of people,
sir, who would say he's their hero.</i>

1000
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,499
<i>He is not a hero.</i>

1001
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,294
Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?

1002
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:33,837
Right now.

1003
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,673
An anonymous source
can verify everything

1004
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,550
I told you about what
happened in Nairomi.

1005
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:41,094
- An anonymous source?
<i>- Run it.</i>

1006
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:45,015
Luthor engineered the desert.
It was an ambush for Superman.

1007
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:47,100
Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.

1008
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:48,769
<i>Yeah, and you need to think litigate.</i>

1009
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:51,271
<i>If you're wrong, Luthor will
sue the paper out of existence.</i>

1010
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:52,898
<i>You need proof.</i>

1011
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,358
No. It needs to run now.

1012
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:55,651
<i>Before the hearing.</i>

1013
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:57,569
<i>If Superman knows,
it might change what he says.</i>

1014
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,780
I am not going to risk the paper

1015
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:02,866
so that you can pass notes in class
to the man that rescued you.

1016
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,242
[McGraw] <i>He paid her?</i>

1017
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,828
[stutters] Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

1018
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:08,789
Gave her a script to learn.

1019
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:11,416
Her parents are alive back home.

1020
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:14,086
But the girl's got a conscience.

1021
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,254
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater.

1022
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:17,172
Senator!

1023
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,049
Hi, you.

1024
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:21,009
Don'<i>t</i> go anywhere.
I want to talk to you.

1025
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:21,927
Uh, you know what?

1026
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,429
Mercy, you go in and make sure
no one takes my seat.

1027
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,056
So what you been up to?

1028
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:27,224
[Lex] I'm just here to tell my story.

1029
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,434
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

1030
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:32,813
but a certain junior senator
from Kentucky decided to block it.

1031
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:36,900
Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.

1032
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:38,694
Greg, why hasn'<i>t</i> he been
getting our checks?

1033
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:39,778
He is, Mr. Wayne.

1034
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,571
He gets a check from
the Victims Fund every month.

1035
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:43,281
He returns them.

1036
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:48,662
[Dana Bash] <i>... who lost both his legs
in those horrific events in Metropolis</i>

[Bruce] Jesus.

1039
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:54,918
Why haven'<i>t</i> I seen this?

1040
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:57,003
[Greg] I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

1041
01:26:57,587 --> 01:27:00,173
[Bash] <i>And there he is.
Superman is here.</i>

1042
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,342
<i>He is actually
at the United States Capitol.</i>

1043
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,511
<i>This is really a historic moment.</i>

1044
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:08,890
<i>Now we expect that Superman will give
some kind of a statement to the Senate,</i>

1045
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:11,601
<i>to the American people,
and, of course, to the world.</i>

1046
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:15,105
He's here. He came.
He's above the Capitol.

1047
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,398
[Lex] Ah.

1048
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:19,109
You are gonna be on the hot seat
in there, Junebug.

1049
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:22,404
I grew up on a farm.
I know how to wrestle a pig.

1050
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:24,740
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

1051
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,201
It's that power can be innocent.

1052
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:31,705
Good luck.

Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful to our witness

1063
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:19,563
for coming before us today.

1064

This is how a democracy works.

We talk to each other.

We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.

I have sat here before

1068
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:37,622
will not be tolerated by this committee.

1069

Neither will lies.

1070
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:45,380
Because today is a day for truth.

1071

[sighs] Lois Lane.

1278

[sniffles] Mmm.

01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:17,940
Um... [sniffles] Mmm-mm.

1281
01:52:18,023 --> 01:52:22,194
Now the secret to the height
is the building material.

1282
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:26,114
It's light metals
which sway a bit in the wind.

1283
01:52:27,115 --> 01:52:28,158
Hmm.

1284
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:32,120
And you know something
about LexCorp metals,

1285
01:52:32,204 --> 01:52:33,497
don't you, Miss Lane?

1286
01:52:33,914 --> 01:52:35,832
I've proven what you've done.

1287
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:37,209
Wow, you're feisty.

1288
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:41,755
Unfortunately, that will blow away.
Like sand in the desert.

1289
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:43,590
You're psychotic.

1290
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:47,386
That is a three-syllable word for
any thought too big for little minds.

1291
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:49,930
Hmm. Next category: circles.

1292
01:52:50,347 --> 01:52:55,018
Round and round
and round they go to find Superman.

1293
01:52:55,143 --> 01:52:57,229
[grunts] Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.

1294
01:52:57,312 --> 01:52:58,855
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.

1295
01:52:58,939 --> 01:53:02,776
The shortest distance between
any <i>two</i> points is a straight path.

1296
01:53:02,985 --> 01:53:05,737
And I believe
the straightest path to Superman

1297
01:53:05,946 --> 01:53:07,531
is a pretty little road...

1298
01:53:07,656 --> 01:53:09,741
[sniffs] Mmm. Called Lois Lane.

The problem of... Of evil in the world.

1308
01:54:04,338 --> 01:54:06,465
Uh, the problem of absolute virtue.

1309
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:10,552
I'll take you in without breaking you.
Which is more than you deserve.

1310
01:54:10,635 --> 01:54:12,888
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

1311
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:14,056
You above all.

1312
01:54:15,015 --> 01:54:16,308
Ah, because that's what God is.

1313
01:54:17,142 --> 01:54:21,229
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.

1314
01:54:22,522 --> 01:54:25,859
Clark Joseph Kent.

1315
01:54:27,277 --> 01:54:30,822
See, what we call God
depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1316
01:54:31,531 --> 01:54:34,493
Because God is tribal. God takes sides.

1317
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:36,620
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

1318
01:54:36,703 --> 01:54:38,955
to deliver me from
Daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.

1319
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,583
I figured out way back,

1320
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:45,170
if God is all-powerful,
he cannot be all-good.

1321
01:54:46,671 --> 01:54:49,841
And if he is all-good,
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1322
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:52,427
And neither can you be.

1323
01:54:52,928 --> 01:54:55,305
They need to see the fraud you are.

1324
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,599
With their eyes.

1325
01:54:58,558 --> 01:55:00,811
The blood on your hands.

1326
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:02,562
What have you done?

1327
01:55:02,646 --> 01:55:04,523
Hmm. And tonight, they will.

1328
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:08,610
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date. Hmm.

1329
01:55:08,693 --> 01:55:10,195
Across the bay.

1330
01:55:10,278 --> 01:55:12,781
Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.

1331
01:55:12,864 --> 01:55:14,783
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

1332
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:16,368
Little red notes, big bang.

1333
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:17,911
"You let your family die!"

1334
01:55:19,204 --> 01:55:24,334
And now you will fly to him.
And you will battle him.

1335
01:55:24,876 --> 01:55:26,253
To the death.

1336
01:55:27,587 --> 01:55:30,465
Black and blue. Fight Night!

1337
01:55:31,425 --> 01:55:34,177
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

1338
01:55:34,469 --> 01:55:37,013
- God versus man.

Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.

1341
01:55:43,061 --> 01:55:45,105
You think I'll fight him for you?

1342
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:46,606
Hmm, yes, I do.

1343
01:55:46,815 --> 01:55:49,317
I think you will fight-fight-fight
for that special lady in your life.

1344
01:55:50,068 --> 01:55:52,279
She's safe on the ground. How about you?

1345
01:55:52,571 --> 01:55:54,948
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.

1346
01:55:55,907 --> 01:56:00,078
No. Every boy's special lady
is his mother.

Hmm.

1350
01:56:10,213 --> 01:56:13,633
Why, the mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.

1351
01:56:14,342 --> 01:56:16,595
The punishment for witches,
what is that?

1352
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:19,139
That's right. Death by fire.

1353
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:24,060
Mmm. [chuckles]

I don'<i>t</i> know!
I would not let them tell me!

1356
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:35,363
Uh-uh-uh! If you kill me, Martha dies.

1357
01:56:35,447 --> 01:56:37,574
And if you fly away, mmm,
Martha also dies.

1358
01:56:37,657 --> 01:56:39,618
But if you kill the Bat...

1359
01:56:40,202 --> 01:56:42,078
Martha lives.

1360
01:56:46,875 --> 01:56:50,253
There we go. There we go. Hmm.

1361
01:56:52,672 --> 01:56:56,218
And now God bends to my will.

For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

Yes, the Almighty comes clean
about how dirty he is when it counts.

1366
01:57:10,232 --> 01:57:13,777
To save Martha,
bring me the head of the Bat.

1367
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,114
Ah.

1368
01:57:18,198 --> 01:57:21,201
Mother of God,
would you look at the time?

1369
01:57:21,284 --> 01:57:23,620
When you came here, you had an hour.
