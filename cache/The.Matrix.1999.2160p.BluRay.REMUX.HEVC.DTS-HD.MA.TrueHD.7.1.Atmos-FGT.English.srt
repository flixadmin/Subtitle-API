00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,822
<i>Go. Now.</i>

163
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,756
<i>Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.</i>

164
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,803
- How do you know this?
<i>- We don't have time.</i>

165
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,889
<i>To your left there's a window.
Go to it.</i>

166
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,685
<i>Open it.</i>

167
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,312
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

168
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,149
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

169
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,776
<i>There are two ways
out of this building.</i>

170
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,822
<i>One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.</i>

171
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,284
<i>You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.</i>

172
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,622
This is insane!

173
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,667
Why is this happening to me?

174
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,586
What'd I do?

175
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,714
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

176
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,757
I'm gonna die.

177
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,602
Shit!

178
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,998
Oh, shit!

179
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,755
I can't do this.

180
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,435
Shit.

181
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:53,531
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

182
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,493
It seems that you've been living...

183
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,870
...two lives.

184
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,791
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

185
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,378
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

186
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,716
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

187
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,426
And you...

188
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,639
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

189
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,270
The other life is lived in computers...

190
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,523
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

191
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:32,570
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

192
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,823
One of these lives...

193
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,908
...has a future.

194
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,244
And one of them does not.

195
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,793
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

196
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,129
You're here...

197
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,715
...because we need your help.

198
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,347
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

199
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,390
...individual.

200
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,354
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

201
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:11,359
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

202
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,028
He is considered by many authorities...

203
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,323
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

204
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,243
My colleagues...

205
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,622
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

206
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,334
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

207
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,129
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

208
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,632
...give you a fresh start.

209
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,052
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

210
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,806
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

211
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,433
Yeah.

212
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,812
That sounds like a really good deal.

213
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,190
But I got a better one.

214
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,942
How about...

215
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,361
...I give you the finger...

216
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,949
...and you give me my phone call.

217
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,994
Mr. Anderson...

218
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,208
...you disappoint me.

219
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,086
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

220
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,713
I know my rights.

221
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,464
I want my phone call.

222
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,217
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

223
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,511
...what good is a phone call...

224
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,348
...if you're unable to speak?

225
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,342
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

226
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,012
...whether you want to or not.

227
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,726
[PHONE RINGS]

228
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,698
MORPHEUS: <i>This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.</i>

229
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:09,245
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

230
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,330
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

231
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,582
<i>...you would probably be dead.</i>

232
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,295
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

233
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:23,384
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...</i>

234
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,595
<i>...looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...</i>

235
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,347
<i>...looking for you.</i>

236
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,059
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

237
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,896
- Yes.
<i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

238
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,324
Get in.

239
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,421
What's this?

240
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:03,215
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

241
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,634
- From what?
- From you.

242
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,637
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

243
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,972
Stop the car.

244
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,728
Listen, coppertop.

245
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,980
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

246
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,858
Right now, there's only one rule:

247
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,484
Our way...

248
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,903
...or the highway.

249
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,535
Fine.

250
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,873
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

251
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,084
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

252
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,045
You know that road.

253
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,672
You know exactly where it ends.

254
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,135
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

255
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,859
Apoc, lights.

256
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,530
TRINITY: Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

257
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,701
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

258
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,919
Try and relax.

259
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,385
Come on.

260
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,470
Come on.

261
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,223
It's on the move.

262
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,226
Come on, you shit.

263
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,313
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

264
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,564
Clear!

265
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,283
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

266
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,360
This is it.

267
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,158
Let me give you one piece of advice.

268
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,785
Be honest.

269
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,581
He knows more than you can imagine.

270
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,632
At last.

271
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,260
Welcome, Neo.

272
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,388
As you no doubt have guessed...

273
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,890
...I am Morpheus.

274
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,517
It's an honor to meet you.

275
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,019
No...

276
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,896
...the honor is mine.

277
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,316
Please, come. Sit.

278
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,041
I imagine...

279
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,211
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

280
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,340
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

281
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,258
You could say that.

282
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,804
I can see it in your eyes.

283
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,682
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

284
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,185
...because he's expecting to wake up.

285
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,189
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

286
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,275
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

287
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,527
No.

288
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:52,986
Why not?

289
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,031
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

290
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,452
I know exactly what you mean.

291
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,126
Let me tell you why you're here.

292
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,711
You know something.

293
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,880
What you know,
you can't explain.

294
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,966
But you feel it.

295
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,468
You felt it your entire life:

296
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:21,223
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

297
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,934
Like a splinter in your mind...

298
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,061
...driving you mad.

299
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,731
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

300
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,111
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

301
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,281
The Matrix?

302
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,451
Do you want to know...

303
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,912
...what it is?

304
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,167
The Matrix is everywhere.

305
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,127
It is all around us.

306
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,337
Even now, in this very room.

307
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,382
You can see it when you
look out your window...

308
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,968
...or when you turn on your television.

309
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,929
You can feel it when you go to work...

310
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,141
...when you go to church...

311
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,643
...when you pay your taxes.

312
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,689
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

313
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,524
...to blind you from the truth.

314
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,986
What truth?

315
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,783
That you are a slave.

316
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,579
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

317
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:30,500
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

318
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,085
A prison...

319
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,462
...for your mind.

320
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,804
Unfortunately, no one can be...

321
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,515
...told what the Matrix is.

322
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,854
You have to see it for yourself.

323
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,658
This is your last chance.

324
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,244
After this, there is no turning back.

325
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,162
You take the blue pill...

326
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:10,540
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

327
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,584
...whatever you want to believe.

328
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,169
You take the red pill...

329
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,380
...you stay in Wonderland...

330
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,591
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

331
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,686
Remember...

332
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,564
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

333
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,205
Follow me.

334
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,418
Apoc, are we on-line?

335
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,044
APOC:
Almost.

336
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,425
MORPHEUS:
Time is always against us.

337
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,302
Please take a seat there.

338
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,196
-You did all this?
TRINITY: Mm-hm.

339
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,328
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

340
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:34,708
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

341
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,293
What does that mean?

342
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,046
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

343
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,714
...because Kansas...

344
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,007
...is going bye-bye.

345
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,296
Did you...?

346
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:36,395
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

347
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,440
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

348
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,193
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

349
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,237
...and the real world?

350
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,031
NEO:
This can't be.

351
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,241
MORPHEUS:
Be what?

352
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,451
Be real?

353
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,832
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

354
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,041
Still nothing.

355
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,835
NEO:
It's cold.

356
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,461
It's cold!

357
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,008
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

358
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,179
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

359
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,889
APOC:
Targeting almost there.

360
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,602
He's going into arrest.

361
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,355
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

362
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,700
Welcome...

363
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,952
...to the real world.

364
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,205
MORPHEUS:
We've done it, Trinity.

365
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,999
We found him.

366
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,044
-I hope you're right.
MORPHEUS: I don't have to hope.

367
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,212
I know it.

368
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,427
Am I dead?

369
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,096
Far from it.

370
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,487
He still needs a lot of work.

371
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,114
What are you doing?

372
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,575
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

373
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,702
Why do my eyes hurt?

374
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,288
You've never used them before.

375
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,085
Rest, Neo.

376
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,003
The answers are coming.

377
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,242
[DOOR OPENS]

378
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,163
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

379
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,873
What is this place?

380
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,792
More important than "what" is "when."

381
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,335
"When"?

382
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,588
You believe it's the year 1999...

383
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,090
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

384
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,969
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

385
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,846
...because we honestly don't know.

386
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,183
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

387
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,186
Come with me.
See for yourself.

388
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,480
MORPHEUS:
This is my ship.

389
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,691
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
It's a hovercraft.

390
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,279
This is the main deck.

391
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,286
This is the core...

392
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:14,542
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

393
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:21,090
Most of my crew you already know.

394
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,514
This is Apoc...

395
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,641
...Switch...

396
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,393
- ...and Cypher.
- Hi.

397
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,356
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

398
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,651
The little one behind you is Mouse.

399
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,242
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

400
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,494
Trinity.

401
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,100
Try to relax.

402
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,815
This will feel a little weird.

403
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,161
This...

404
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,038
...is the Construct.

405
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,583
It's our loading program.

406
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,294
We can load anything, from clothing...

407
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,920
...to equipment...

408
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,547
...weapons...

409
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,008
...training simulations...

410
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,927
...anything we need.

411
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,141
NEO: Right now we're inside
a computer program?

412
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,351
Is it really so hard to believe?

413
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:58,479
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

414
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,774
Your hair has changed.

415
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,486
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

416
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,823
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

417
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:15,830
This isn't real?

418
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,624
What is "real"?

419
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,251
How do you define "real"?

420
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,462
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

421
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,131
...what you can smell, taste and see...

422
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,260
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

423
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,850
This is the world that you know.

424
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,313
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

425
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,028
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

426
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,529
...that we call the Matrix.

427
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,870
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

428
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,997
This is the world...

429
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,041
...as it exists today.

430
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:16,057
Welcome to "the desert...

431
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,518
...of the real."

432
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,273
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

433
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:28,319
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century...

434
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,823
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

435
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:36,828
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

436
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,746
AI.

437
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,165
You mean artificial intelligence.

438
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:45,837
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

439
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,133
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

440
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,761
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

441
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,598
They were dependent on solar power...

442
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,185
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

443
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,023
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

444
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:10,153
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

445
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:15,825
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

446
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:23,458
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

447
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,837
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

448
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,924
Combined with a form of fusion...

449
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:37,096
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

450
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,896
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

451
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,399
...where human beings
are no longer born.

452
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,943
We are grown.

453
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,577
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

454
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,497
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

455
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,458
...watched them liquefy the dead...

456
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,045
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

457
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,841
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

458
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:17,011
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

459
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,432
What is the Matrix?

460
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:23,684
Control.

461
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:28,439
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

462
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:32,318
...built to keep us under control...

463
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:36,656
...in order to change a human being...

464
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,449
...into this.

465
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:40,952
No.

466
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,163
I don't believe it.

467
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,748
It's not possible.

468
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,920
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

469
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,463
Stop!

470
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,215
Let me out!

471
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,843
Let me out! I want out!

472
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,472
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

473
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,391
Get this thing out of me!

474
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,686
Don't touch me!

475
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,563
Stay away from me!

476
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,481
I don't believe it.

477
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,400
I don't believe it.

478
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,152
I don't believe it.

479
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,445
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

480
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:17,905
Just breathe.

481
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,092
I can't go back, can I?

482
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,344
No.

483
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,388
But if you could...

484
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,724
...would you really want to?

485
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,603
I owe you an apology.

486
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,563
We have a rule.

487
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,275
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

488
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,526
It's dangerous.

489
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,945
The mind has trouble letting go.

490
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,489
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

491
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,618
I did what I did because...

492
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,786
...I had to.

493
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:18,299
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

494
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,595
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

495
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,890
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

496
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,103
It was he who freed the first of us...

497
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,606
...taught us the truth.

498
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,152
As long as the Matrix exists...

499
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,571
...the human race will never be free.

500
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,327
After he died...

501
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,789
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

502
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,542
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

503
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,461
...end the war...

504
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,046
...bring freedom to our people.

505
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:03,010
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

506
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:04,929
...looking for him.

507
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,433
I did what I did because...

508
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,187
...I believe that search is over.

509
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,694
Get some rest.

510
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,113
You're going to need it.

511
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:25,866
For what?

512
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,121
Your training.

513
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,141
Morning. Did you sleep?

514
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:52,226
You will tonight.

515
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,145
I guarantee it.

516
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,565
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

517
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,443
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.

518
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,073
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

519
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,533
Born free right here...

520
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,410
...in the real world.

521
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,329
Genuine child of Zion.

522
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,623
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

523
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,375
...Zion's where the party would be.

524
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,085
It's a city?

525
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:21,505
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

526
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,342
Where is it?

527
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,513
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

528
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,017
You live long enough,
you might see it.

529
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:40,107
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

530
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,109
...if Morpheus is right and all.

531
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,363
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

532
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,031
...if you are...

533
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,117
...it's a very exciting time.

534
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,871
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

535
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,711
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

536
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,174
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

537
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:06,967
How about...

538
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,304
...combat training?

539
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:17,812
"Jujitsu"?

540
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,356
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

541
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,910
Holy shit!

542
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,496
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

543
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,123
How about some more?

544
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,666
Hell, yes.

545
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,794
Hell, yeah.

546
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,057
How is he?

547
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,476
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

548
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,072
I know kung fu.

549
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,741
Show me.

550
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,287
This is a sparring program...

551
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,331
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

552
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,917
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

553
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:25,629
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

554
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,673
Some of them can be bent.

555
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,342
Others can be broken.

556
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:31,969
Understand?

557
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,096
Then hit me...

558
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,806
...if you can.

559
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:15,846
Good!

560
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:17,765
Adaptation.

561
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,266
Improvisation.

562
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,893
But your weakness...

563
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,520
...is not your technique.

564
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,570
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

565
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,019
How did I beat you?

566
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,693
You're too fast.

567
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,570
Do you believe that...

568
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,448
...my being stronger or faster...

569
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:01,368
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

570
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,207
You think you're breathing air?

571
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:21,930
Again!

572
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,819
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

573
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,280
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

574
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,204
What are you waiting for?

575
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,414
You're faster than this.

576
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,835
Don't think you are.

577
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,754
Know you are.

578
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,934
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

579
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,612
I don't believe it.

580
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,282
I know what you're trying to do.

581
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,120
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

582
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,539
But I can only show you the door.

583
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,958
You have to walk through it.

584
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,462
Tank, load the jump program.

585
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,768
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

586
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,479
...doubt and disbelief.

587
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,358
Free your mind.

588
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,743
Whoa.

589
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,251
Okey-dokey.

590
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,504
Free my mind.

591
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,089
What if he makes it?

592
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,050
-No one's ever made their first jump.
MOUSE: I know.

593
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,846
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

594
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,514
Come on.

595
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:28,932
All right.

596
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,435
No problem. Free my mind.

597
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,022
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

598
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,084
What does that mean?

599
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,295
It doesn't mean anything.

600
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,465
Everybody falls the first time.

601
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,217
Right, Trin?

602
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,532
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

603
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:32,037
If you're killed in the Matrix...

604
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,247
...you die here?

605
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,333
The body cannot live without the mind.

606
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:10,200
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

607
00:56:13,287 --> 00:56:16,123
There is something about him,
isn't there?

608
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,375
You're a believer now?

609
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,586
I keep wondering...

610
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:24,506
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

611
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,343
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

612
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:39,688
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

613
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,733
That system is our enemy.

614
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,694
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

615
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:49,740
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

616
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,784
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

617
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:55,996
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

618
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,165
...and that makes them our enemy.

619
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,541
You have to understand...

620
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:03,128
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

621
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,963
And many of them are so inert...

622
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,633
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

623
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:10,594
...that they will fight to protect it.

624
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,849
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

625
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,768
- I was...
- Look again.

626
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,103
Freeze it.

627
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,362
NEO: This isn't the Matrix?
MORPHEUS: No.

628
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:33,992
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

629
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:37,037
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

630
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,374
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

631
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:45,420
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

632
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:49,174
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

633
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:50,842
...is potentially an agent.

634
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,637
Inside the Matrix...

635
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,931
...they are everyone...

636
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,975
...and they are no one.

637
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:01,353
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

638
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,230
...but they are the gatekeepers.

639
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,441
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

640
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:09,528
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

641
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:10,904
Someone?

642
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,656
MORPHEUS:
I won't lie to you, Neo.

643
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:17,953
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

644
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,580
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

645
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:21,832
Why?

646
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,376
MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

647
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:28,213
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

648
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:33,093
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

649
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,469

show you the door.

816

You have to walk through it.

817

Hello, Neo.

818
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:44,949
You're right on time.

819
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:56,669
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

820
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,926
These are the other Potentials.

821

You can wait here.

822
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:49,096
BOY:
Do not try and bend the spoon.

823
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,599
That's impossible.

824
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:56,437
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

825
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,356
What truth?

826
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:00,274
There is no spoon.

827
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,195
There is no spoon?

828
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:08,908
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

your noodle later on is...

brought you to see me.

It's Latin.

Means, "Know thyself."

I'll let you in on a little secret.

860

Being the One is just
like being in love.

861

No one can tell you you're in love.

...I'd better have a look at you.

866
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,143
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

867
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,201
Okay...

868
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:02,790
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

869
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:04,417
Then you say:

But what?

01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:10,506

...can convince him otherwise.

888

He believes it so blindly...

his life to save yours.

01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:26,804
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1138
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:28,473
What choice?

1139
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,978
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1140
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:36,648
TRINITY: No, you're not.
- I have to.

1141
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:40,485
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1142
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,654
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1143
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:46,491
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1144
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:49,035
What?

1145
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:51,371
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1146
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,707
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1147
01:35:54,958 --> 01:35:57,627
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1148
01:35:58,294 --> 01:35:59,545
No, Neo, that's not true.

1149
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:02,757
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1150
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:10,515
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1151
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:15,144
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1152
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:20,358
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1153
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,193
That's what it looks like...

1154
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,403
...but it's not.

1155
01:36:23,653 --> 01:36:26,030
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1156
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:30,827
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1157
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:34,080
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1158
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:36,874
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1159
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,668
What?

1160
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:41,087
I believe I can bring him back.

1161
01:36:58,062 --> 01:36:59,981
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1162
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,275
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1163
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,570
Let me tell you what I believe.

1164
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,448
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1165
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:13,077
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1166
01:37:13,328 --> 01:37:15,371
And since I am the ranking officer...

1167
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:18,499
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1168
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,669
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1169
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:23,629
Tank...

1170
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:24,922
...load us up.

1171
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,852
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1172
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,812
...during my time here.

1173
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:44,067
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1174
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:46,569
...and I realized...

1175
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:49,113
...that you're not actually mammals.

1176
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:53,785
Every mammal on this planet...

1177
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:59,040
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1178
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,125
But you humans do not.

1179
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:05,213
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1180
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:09,967
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1181
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:12,387
The only way you can survive...

1182
01:38:12,678 --> 01:38:15,640
...is to spread to another area.

1183
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:23,940
There is another organism
on this planet...

1184
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,150
...that follows the same pattern.

1185
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:28,444
Do you know what it is?

1186
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:30,655
A virus.

1187
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:35,034
Human beings are a disease.

1188
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:36,953
A cancer of this planet.

1189
01:38:37,203 --> 01:38:39,330
You are a plague.

1190
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,290
And we...

1191
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:42,834
...are the cure.

1192
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:45,253
Okay, so what do you need?

1193
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,004
Besides a miracle.

1194
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:48,798
Guns.

1195
01:38:49,632 --> 01:38:50,842
Lots of guns.

1196
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:01,936
Neo...

1197
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:06,232
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1198
01:39:07,442 --> 01:39:09,360
That's why it's going to work.

1199
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:15,366
Why isn't the serum working?

1200
01:39:15,992 --> 01:39:18,286
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1201
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,622
Leave me with him.

1202
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:25,334
Now.

1203
01:39:36,554 --> 01:39:38,139
TANK:
Hold on, Morpheus.

1204
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:41,100
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1205
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:45,605
SMITH:
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1206
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:48,524
I'm going to be honest...

1207
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,109
...with you.

1208
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:55,907
I...

1209
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:57,909
...hate...

1210
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:00,119
...this place...

1211
01:40:00,453 --> 01:40:02,747
...this zoo...

1212
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,123
...this prison...

1213
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:07,543
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1214
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:10,087
I can't stand it any longer.

1215
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:12,715
It's the smell.

1216
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,968
If there is such a thing.

1217
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:19,597
I feel saturated by it.

1218
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:22,391
I can...

1219
01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:24,185
...taste...

1220
01:40:24,352 --> 01:40:26,395
...your stink.

1221
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:30,274
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1222
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:31,442
It's repulsive.

1223
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:33,819
Isn't it?

1224
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:38,282
I must get out of here.

1225
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:40,910
I must get free.

1226
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:44,038
And in this mind is the key.

1227
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:45,957
My key.

1228
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:49,085
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1229
01:40:49,335 --> 01:40:50,962
Do you understand?

1230
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:52,630
I need the codes.

1231
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,216
I have to get inside Zion...

1232
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:58,052
...and you have to tell me how.

1233
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:00,346
You're going to tell me...

1234
01:41:00,596 --> 01:41:02,765
...or you're going to die.

1235
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:26,080
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1236
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,043
Holy shit!

1237
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:45,850
Backup. Send backup.

1238
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:10,791
Freeze!

1239
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:26,844
What were you doing?

1240
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:29,972
He doesn't know.

1241
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:31,724
Know what?

1242
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:02,296
I think they're trying to save him.

1243
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:18,896
There is no spoon.

1244
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:50,678
Find them and destroy them!

1245
01:45:52,304 --> 01:45:54,139
We're under attack!

1246
01:46:26,255 --> 01:46:27,423
Trinity!

1247
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:29,008
Help!

1248
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:52,239
Only human.

1249
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:54,283
Dodge this.

1250
01:47:07,504 --> 01:47:09,006
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1251
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:13,344
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1252
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:15,846
It wasn't fast enough.

1253
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:19,892
Can you fly that thing?

1254
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:22,019
Not yet.

1255
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:26,357
Operator.

1256

TRINITY: <i>I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.</i>

1258
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:41,038
Let's go.

1259
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:57,221
No.

1260
01:48:48,814 --> 01:48:51,442
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1261
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:30,522
He's not going to make it.

1262
01:49:40,324 --> 01:49:41,366
Got you.

1263
01:50:47,432 --> 01:50:48,600
Trinity!

1264
01:51:30,267 --> 01:51:31,685
I knew it.

1265
01:51:32,311 --> 01:51:33,520
He's the One.

1266
01:51:49,494 --> 01:51:51,705
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1267
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:55,751
Morpheus...

1268
01:51:57,419 --> 01:51:58,503
The Oracle.

1269
01:51:59,755 --> 01:52:02,132
- She told me...
- She told you...

1270
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:04,092
...what you needed to hear.

1271
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:05,719
That's all.

1272
01:52:06,762 --> 01:52:09,723
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

1273
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:12,351
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1274
01:52:13,101 --> 01:52:14,394
...and walking the path.

Got one ready. Subway station,

- Damn it!
- The trace was completed.

1279
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:44,466
- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

1280
01:52:46,176 --> 01:52:47,678
Order the strike.

1281
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:56,228
They're not out yet.

You first, Morpheus.

Neo, I want to tell you something...

1285
01:53:34,975 --> 01:53:38,937
...but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.

Everything but this.

1289
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,659
But what?

1290
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:18,727
Neo!

-What happened?
TRINITY: An agent.

1292

- Send me back.
- I can't.
