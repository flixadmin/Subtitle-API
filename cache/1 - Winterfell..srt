1
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,897
You should consider yourself lucky.

2
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,151
At least your balls won't freeze off.

3
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,070
You take great offense at dwarf jokes,
but love telling eunuch jokes.

4
00:04:38,154 --> 00:04:39,155
Why is that?

5
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,326
Because I have balls, and you don't.

6
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,438
I warned you.

7
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:15,066
Northerners don't much trust
outsiders.

8
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,701
May the gods protect us!

9
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Episode 1 - Winterfell.

10
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:37,982
Look at you.

11
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:40,693
You're a man.

12
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:42,695
Almost.

13
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:05,009
- Where's Arya?
- Lurking somewhere.

14
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,393
Queen Daenerys
of House Targaryen.

15
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:19,732
My sister, Sansa Stark,
the Lady of Winterfell.

16
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,193
Thank you for inviting us
into your home, Lady Stark.

17
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:25,404
The North is as beautiful
as your brother claimed,

18
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,031
as are you.

19
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,703
Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.

20
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,791
We don't have time for all this.

21
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,336
The Night King has your dragon.
He's one of them now.

22
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:45,216
The Wall has fallen,
the dead march south.

23
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,640
As soon as we heard
about the Wall,

24
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,685
I called all our banners
to retreat to Winterfell.

25
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:57,937
Lord Umber...

26
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,649
when can we expect
your people to arrive?

27
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:10,032
We need more horses and wagons,
if it please my lady.

28
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,453
And my lord.

29
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:17,873
And my queen.

30
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,376
Sorry.

31
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,378
You'll have
as many as we can spare.

32
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,089
Hurry back to Last Hearth
and bring your people here.

33
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,803
We need to send ravens
to the Night's Watch as well.

34
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,281
There's no sense
in manning the castles anymore.

35
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,807
We make our stand here.

36
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,100
At once, Your Grace.

37
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,144
"Your Grace."

38
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,110
But you're not. Are you?

39
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,780
You left Winterfell a king
and came back a...

40
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,035
I'm not sure what you are now.

41
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,328
A lord?

42
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,748
Nothing at all?

43
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,997
- It's not important.
- Not important?

44
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,171
We named you King in the North.

45
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,632
King in the North!

46
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:15,306
You did, my lady.

47
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,642
It was the honour of my life.

48
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:21,145
I'll always be grateful
for your faith.

49
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:27,777
But when I left Winterfell, I told you
we need allies or we will die.

50
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:32,490
I have brought those allies home
to fight alongside us.

51
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,034
I had a choice,

52
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,871
keep my crown or protect the North.

53
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,499
I chose the North.

54
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:58,265
If anyone survives the war to come,
we'll have Jon Snow to thank.

55
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:01,936
He risked his life
to show us the threat is real.

56
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,979
Thanks to his courage,

57
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:07,149
we have brought with us the greatest
army the world has ever seen.

58
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:10,319
We have brought
two full-grown dragons.

59
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:16,158
And soon, the Lannister army
will ride north to join our cause.

60
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:24,708
I know, I know, our people
haven't been friends in the past.

61
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,963
But we must fight together now...

62
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,881
or die.

63
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,928
May I ask, how are we meant to feed

64
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,930
the greatest army
the world has ever seen?

65
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,408
While I ensured our stores
would last through winter,

66
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:45,688
I didn't account for Dothraki,
Unsullied and two full-grown dragons.

67
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,441
What do dragons eat, anyway?

68
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:52,945
Whatever they want.

69
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:15,342
Hey, careful, lads.
We need every last bit of it.

70
00:11:15,426 --> 00:11:16,552
Sorry 'bout that.

71
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,808
Are these the last of the wagons?

72
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:23,976
Aye.

73
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,061
All right,
let's get it all to the forges.

74
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:35,738
My lord.

75
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:38,866
My lady.

76
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:46,498
My lady.

77
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,970
The Lady of Winterfell.

78
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,224
Has a nice ring to it.

79
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,434
So does Hand of the Queen.

80
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,021
Depending on the queen, I suppose.

81
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:14,235
Last time we spoke
was at Joffrey's wedding.

82
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,530
- Miserable affair.
- It had its moments.

83
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,622
Apologies for leaving like that.

84
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,374
Yes, it was a bit hard to explain

85
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:31,001
why my wife fled
moments after the king's murder.

86
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,797
We both survived.

87
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,468
Many underestimated you.

88
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,304
Most of them are dead now.

89
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,857
I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear
the Lannister army's marching north.

90
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,821
You have every right
to be fearful of my sister.

91
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,675
No one fears her more than I do.
But I promise, you'll be safe...

92
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:06,620
Cersei told you her army
was coming north to fight for you?

93
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:07,705
She did.

94
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:10,708
And you believed her?

95
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:16,588
She has something to live for now.
I believe she wants to survive.

96
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,677
I used to think
you were the cleverest man alive.

97
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,044
You used to be taller.

98
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,840
How did you sneak up on me?

99
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,967
How did you survive
a knife through the heart?

100
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:03,677
I didn't.

101
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,822
You still have it.

102
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,160
Needle.

103
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,413
Have you ever used it?

104
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,083
Once or twice.

105
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,350
Valyrian steel.

106
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,270
Jealous?

107
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,064
Too heavy for me.

108
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,282
Where were you before?

109
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,369
I could've used your help with Sansa.

110
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,915
She doesn't like your queen,
does she?

111
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,751
Sansa thinks
she's smarter than everyone.

112
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,046
She's the smartest person
I've ever met.

113
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,174
Now you're defending her?

114
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,259
You?

115
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,970
I'm defending our family.

116
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:30,806
So is she.

117
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,057
Yeah.

118
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,477
I'm her family too.

119
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,609
Don't forget that.

120
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,964
Your Grace,
I'm afraid I bring terrible news.

121
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,092
The dead have
broken through the Wall.

122
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,305
Good.

123
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,675
Why don't you just get it over with
and kill me?

124
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,720
But we're family.

125
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,641
The last Greyjoys left in the world.

126
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,897
The last ones with balls anyway.

127
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,069
If I kill you...

128
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,863
who can I talk to?

129
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:11,740
Hmm?

130
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,162
I've got a crew full of mutes.

131
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,209
It gets lonely at sea.

132
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,463
Are we in King's Landing?

133
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:28,131
Mmm.

134
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,263
You picked the losing side.

135
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,727
Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet
somewhere else.

136
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,988
But first I'm gonna the queen.

137
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:06,336
Twenty-thousand men, is it?

138
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,381
Yes, Your Grace.
A few died in transit.

139
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,135
They cheated at dice.

140
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,388
Or maybe I cheated.

141
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,265
Someone cheated.

142
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,728
They weren't good fighters.
You won't miss them.

143
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,896
- Horses?
- Two thousand.

144
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,315
And elephants?

145
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,734
Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.

146
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,820
That's disappointing.

147
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,240
I was told
the Golden Company had elephants.

148
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:37,576
They are excellent beasts,
Your Grace,

149
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:40,537
but not well-suited
to long sea voyages.

150
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,706
In any event, you are most welcome

151
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,083
here in King's Landing,
Captain Strickland.

152
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:48,337
We look forward to fighting
on your behalf, Your Grace.

153
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,932
Am I most welcome here?

154
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:07,064
You are a true friend of the crown
and an honoured guest.

155
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,398
Good.

156
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:11,526
As a true friend
and an honoured guest...

157
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,580
I was hoping
we could talk in private.

158
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,833
After the war.
That was our agreement.

159
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,671
Wars sometimes last years.

160
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,799
You want buy one.

161
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,678
You want a queen...

162
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:39,805
earn her.

163
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,351
How?

164
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,731
I've given her justice, an army
and the Iron Fleet,

165
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,943
yet she gives me
no sign of affection.

166
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,904
My heart is nearly broken.

167
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,408
You're insolent.

168
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:05,497
- I've executed men for less.
- They were lesser men.

169
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,414
I hear the dragon burnt up
a thousand Lannister men.

170
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,166
Burnt up
some of my favourite boys.

171
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,209
- Archie, was it?
- And William.

172
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:54,504
- Tall handsome William?
- Yeah, tall handsome William.

173
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,748
They said what's left of him
could fit in a wine glass.

174
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,926
I am the only man you ever met
who shot a dragon.

175
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,179
- Did you?
- Nearly killed it.

176
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,263
That's brave.

177
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:16,234
- That boy Eddie...
- The ginger?

178
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:19,321
That's him. Came back
with his face burnt right off.

179
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,822
He's got no eyelids now.

180
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,657
How does he sleep with no eyelids?

181
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,141
All right, can we stop talking
about the dragons now?

182
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,642
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

183
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,332
You're kidding me.

184
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,460
Apologies for the interruption,
but the queen did urge me to hurry.

185
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:37,756
Sorry, ladies.

186
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,384
Another time perhaps.

187
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,521
You ever get lonely,
I am partial to older gentlemen.

188
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:59,110
Poor girl. The pox will take her
within the year.

189
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,007
- Which girl?
- The queen's brothers

190
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,991
made promises to you and broke them.

191
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,828
Her Grace wants to rectify
their mistake.

192
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:13,750
She once gave me a castle and a wife,
then rectified me right out of them.

193
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,627
That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers.

194
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:20,006
When Queen Cersei wants something,
she pays in advance and in gold.

195
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,842
Several chests of it, in fact.

196
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:25,053
Waiting for you
in a wagon just outside.

197
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:33,854
So she wants to murder someone,
but she can't send her soldiers.

198
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,773
If it's the Dragon Queen
she's after...

199
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,817
She has other plans
for the Targaryen girl.

200
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,111
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

201
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:45,365
Our queen's brothers are unlikely
to survive their Northern adventures.

202
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,742
But in the event that they do...

203
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:57,836
She has a keen sense
of poetic justice.

204
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,839
That family.

205
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:04,968
When the Citadel expelled me,
I thought I would die poor and alone,

206
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,930
but in exchange for my service,
Queen Cersei made me her Hand.

207
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:13,310
What would she do for the man who
rids her of her treasonous brothers?

208
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:31,828
I wanted those elephants.

209
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:38,877
So...

210
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:44,591
how do I compare to the fat king?

211
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,385
You're insulting my late husband?

212
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,970
Are you offended?

213
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,352
Robert had a different
every night,

214
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:59,147
but he still didn't know
his way around a woman's body.

215
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,191
And the Kingslayer?

216
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,782
You enjoy risking your neck,
don't you?

217
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:11,785
Life is boring.

218
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,871
You're not boring,
I'll give you that.

219
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,760
Do I please the queen?

220
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,390
You might be the most arrogant man
I've ever met.

221
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,227
I like that.

222
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:41,272
But now I want to be alone.

223
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,657
I'm going to put
a prince in your belly.

224
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,921
Euron can't defend
the Iron Islands,

225
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:31,257
not if he's in King's Landing
with all his men and his ships.

226
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,052
We can take our home back.

227
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,012
Daenerys went north.

228
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:39,307
Daenerys will need somewhere to
retreat if they can't hold the North.

229
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,476
Somewhere the dead can't go.

230
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,652
You're my queen.
I go where you command.

231
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,575
You want to go to Winterfell.

232
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,119
To fight for the Starks.

233
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:03,873
Go.

234
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,880
What is dead may never die.

235
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,969
What is dead may never die.

236
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,143
But kill the bastards anyway.

237
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,964
Welcome back, my lady.

238
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:54,757
If you'd follow me...

239
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:56,843
The Karstarks.

240
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,970
One of the better sigils.

241
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,556
Beats an onion, anyway.

242
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,267
Can't argue with that.

243
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,145
Not so long ago,
the Starks and the Karstarks

244
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,272
were slaughtering each other
on the battlefield.

245
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,399
Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.

246
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:12,842
And our queen is grateful.

247
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,029
Her gratitude is lovely,
but that's not my point.

248
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:19,949
The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow,
not to her.

249
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,117
They don't know her.

250
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,119
The Free Folk don't know her.

251
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,331
I've been up here a while,
and I'm telling you,

252
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,874
they're stubborn as goats.

253
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,169
You want their loyalty,
you have to earn it.

254
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:44,933
I sense that you're leading
to a proposal.

255
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:48,269
A proposal is what I'm proposing.

256
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,689
On the off chance
that we survive the Night King,

257
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:56,402
what if the Seven Kingdoms,
for once in their whole shit history,

258
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,989
were ruled by a just woman
and an honourable man?

259
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,327
They do make
a handsome couple.

260
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,204
You overestimate our influence.

261
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:09,457
Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen
to lonely old men.

262
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,708
I'm not that old.

263
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,962
Not as old as him.

264
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:18,091
Our queen respects the wisdom of age.

265
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,676
Of course she does.

266
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,595
Respect is how the young
keep us at a distance,

267
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,431
so we don't remind them
of an unpleasant truth.

268
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,350
What is that?

269
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,811
Nothing lasts.

270
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:32,563
Hey!

271
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,488
Your sister doesn't like me.

272
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,078
She doesn't know you.

273
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,540
If it makes you feel better,

274
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:52,434
she didn't like me either
when we were growing up.

275
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,544
She doesn't need to be my friend...

276
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,422
but I am her queen.

277
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,594
If she can't respect me...

278
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,482
How many today?

279
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,401
Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.

280
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,656
What's the matter?

281
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,575
The dragons are barely eating.

282
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:44,886
What's wrong with them?

283
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:46,512
They don't like the North.

284
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:03,863
Go on.

285
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,954
I don't know how to ride a dragon.

286
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,041
Nobody does.
Until they ride a dragon.

287
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,045
What if he doesn't want me to?

288
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,423
Then I've enjoyed your company,
Jon Snow.

289
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,027
What do I hold onto?

290
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:45,863
Whatever you can.

291
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,649
Aah!

292
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,774
You've completely
ruined horses for me.

293
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:55,826
We could stay a thousand years...

294
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,330
no one would find us.

295
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,251
We'd be pretty old.

296
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,594
It's cold up here
for a southern girl.

297
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,389
So keep your queen warm.

298
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,154
Don't be afraid.

299
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:46,794
That's good.

300
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:57,847
- Gendry?
- He's here.

301
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:06,564
It isn't easy making a blade that big
with dragonglass.

302
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:11,360
You're saying you're good,
is that it?

303
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:13,164
I'm just saying
it's a tricky material to...

304
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,364
You know who makes weapons
for the wildlings?

305
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:18,034
Cripples and cocksuckers.

306
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:19,952
Which one are you?

307
00:35:20,036 --> 00:35:21,245
Leave him be.

308
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,296
I heard you were here.

309
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:34,091
You left me to die.

310
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,802
First I robbed you.

311
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:50,608
You're a cold
aren't you?

312
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:55,988
Guess that's why you're still alive.

313
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,956
That was a nice ax you made for him.

314
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,000
You've gotten better.

315
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,461
Yeah, thanks. So have you.

316
00:36:11,629 --> 00:36:14,131
I mean, you look good.

317
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,927
Thanks. So do you.

318
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:23,683
It's not a bad place to grow up,
if it wasn't so cold.

319
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,144
Stay close to that forge, then.

320
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:29,563
Oh, is that a command, Lady Stark?

321
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:30,856
Don't call me that.

322
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,025
As you wish, milady.

323
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:41,409
Here's my wish.

324
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:44,995
Can you make it?

325
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:47,221
What do you need
something like this for?

326
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,708
Can you make it or not?

327
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,418
You already have a sword.

328
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:51,502
What's that?

329
00:36:58,342 --> 00:36:59,635
It's Valyrian steel.

330
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,595
I always knew
you were just another rich girl.

331
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,267
You don't know any other rich girls.

332
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:17,903
Come in.

333
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,371
Lord Glover wishes us good fortune,

334
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:30,624
but he's staying in Deepwood Motte
with his men.

335
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,588
"House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

336
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,590
as we have for a thousand years."

337
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:40,551
Isn't that what he said?

338
00:37:40,634 --> 00:37:43,387
"I will stand
behind Jon Snow," he said.

339
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:46,390
"The King in the North."

340
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:50,203
- I told you we needed allies.
- You didn't tell me

341
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:52,521
you were going to abandon your crown.

342
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:54,356
I never wanted a crown.

343
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:57,151
All I wanted
was to protect the North.

344
00:37:57,777 --> 00:38:00,404
I brought two armies home with me,
two dragons.

345
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:02,198
And a Targaryen queen.

346
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:05,951
Do you think we can beat
the Army of the Dead without her?

347
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:09,079
I fought them, Sansa. Twice.

348
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:11,081
You want to worry about
who holds what title,

349
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:13,083
I'm telling you it doesn't matter.

350
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,504
Without her, we don't stand a chance.

351
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,515
Do you have any faith in me at all?

352
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:30,893
You know I do.

353
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:36,774
She'll be a good queen.

354
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,026
For all of us.

355
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,154
She's not her father.

356
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:50,454
No, she's much prettier.

357
00:38:56,085 --> 00:39:00,047
Did you bend the knee to save
the North or because you love her?

358
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:25,656
Oh!

359
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:29,869
So you're the man?

360
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:31,579
Um...

361
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:33,831
Which man am I, Your Grace?

362
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,542
The one who saved Ser Jorah
when no one else could.

363
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,670
They could, they just wouldn't.

364
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,732
I'll have to
make some changes

365
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,425
in the Citadel when I take my throne.

366
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:47,136
A great service
merits a great reward.

367
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:50,014
Oh, it's my honour
to serve you, Your Grace.

368
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:52,516
Well, there must be
something I could give you.

369
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:58,480
If it's not too much trouble,
I could use a pardon.

370
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:00,816
For what crime?

371
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,151
Um...

372
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,904
I borrowed a few books
from the Citadel.

373
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,866
And also a sword.

374
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,869
- From the Citadel?
- From my family.

375
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,414
It's been in House Tarly
for generations.

376
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,833
It would've been mine
anyway, eventually,

377
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,378
but my father had other ideas.

378
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,215
Not Randyll Tarly?

379
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:28,052
You know him?

380
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:36,393
I offered to let him retain his lands
and titles if he bent the knee.

381
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,522
He refused.

382
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:51,200
Well...

383
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:57,414
At least I'll be allowed home again,
now that my brother's the lord.

384
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,921
Your brother stood with your father.

385
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:19,687
Hmm.

386
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,481
Thank you, Your Grace.

387
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:24,358
For telling me.

388
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,442
And m...

389
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,862
- May I...?
- Of course.

390
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:13,574
What are you doing out here?

391
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,618
Waiting, for an old friend.

392
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,456
It's time to tell Jon the truth.

393
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:22,666
No, no.

394
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,587
You're his brother.
Shouldn't you tell him?

395
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,964
I'm not his brother.

396
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,717
He trusts you more than anyone.

397
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:34,511
Now's the time.

398
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:11,173
Sam?

399
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:14,718
I'm sorry, I know
I'm not supposed to be down here.

400
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:20,099
Were you hiding from me?

401
00:43:20,182 --> 00:43:21,225
Of course not.

402
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:23,977
What are you doing in Winterfell?

403
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,939
Or did you read every book
in the Citadel already?

404
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:31,568
What's wrong?

405
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,029
Gilly? Is she all right?

406
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:36,073
- She's good.
- Little Sam?

407
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:38,826
Don't you know?

408
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,453
Know what?

409
00:43:42,788 --> 00:43:43,831
Daenerys...

410
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:47,376
she executed my father and brother.

411
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:49,294
They were her prisoners.

412
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,092
She didn't tell you.

413
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,519
I'm so sorry.

414
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:10,566
We need to end this war.

415
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:13,402
Would you have done it?

416
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,948
Well, I've executed men
who disobeyed me.

417
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:20,075
You've also spared men.

418
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,577
Thousands of wildlings
when they refused to kneel.

419
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:24,121
I wasn't a king.

420
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,499
But you were.

421
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:30,627
You've always been.

422
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,131
I gave up my crown, Sam.

423
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,759
I bent the knee.
I'm not King in the North anymore.

424
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:39,362
I'm not talking about
the King in the North.

425
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:41,972
I'm talking about the King
of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

426
00:44:50,189 --> 00:44:51,481
Bran and I worked it out.

427
00:44:52,191 --> 00:44:54,568
I had a High Septon's diary.
Bran had...

428
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,362
whatever Bran has.

429
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:58,655
What are you talking about?

430
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,535
Your mother...

431
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:05,996
was Lyanna Stark.

432
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:08,790
And your father...

433
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,627
your real father

434
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:14,087
was Rhaegar Targaryen.

435
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,799
You've never been a bastard.

436
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:22,179
You're Aegon Targaryen,
true heir to the Iron Throne.

437
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:29,561
I'm sorry,
I know it's a lot to take in.

438
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:42,157
My father was the most honourable man
I ever met.

439
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:47,704
You're saying
he lied to me all my life.

440
00:45:47,788 --> 00:45:48,789
No.

441
00:45:49,957 --> 00:45:53,585
Your father... Well, Ned Stark.

442
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:56,630
He promised your mother
he'd always protect you.

443
00:45:57,256 --> 00:45:59,633
And he did. Robert would have
murdered you if he knew.

444
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,178
You're the true king.

445
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:08,433
Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name,
Protector of the Realm, all of it.

446
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:25,325
- Daenerys is our queen.
- She shouldn't be.

447
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:29,830
- That's treason.
- It's the truth.

448
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,126
You gave up your crown
to save your people.

449
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:36,878
Would she do the same?

450
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:47,426
Stay back, he's got blue eyes!

451
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:49,052
I've always had blue eyes!

452
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:00,272
Did you find anyone?

453
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:34,973
The Umber boy.

454
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:37,100
It's a message.

455
00:49:38,268 --> 00:49:39,478
From the Night King.

456
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:43,607
His army's between us and Winterfell.
We're on foot.

457
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,484
We rode down from Castle Black.

458
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:47,777
We can double up on the horses.

459
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:51,490
If the horses last,
we'll get there before the dead.

460
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:54,442
We just have to hope
the Night King doesn't come first.

461
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:48,838
Keep moving! Straight up!

462
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:53,802
Stay together! Don't fall behind!
