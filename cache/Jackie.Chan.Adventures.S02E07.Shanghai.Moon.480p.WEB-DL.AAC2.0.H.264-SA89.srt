1
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,374
Yes!

2
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:10,309
Yes.

3
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:23,789
To find this portal,

4
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,925
we must travel north...
Very north.

5
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:28,394
Brrr, chilly.

6
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,662
Very, very north.

7
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,265
Ok, check the warranty
on the box.

8
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,167
We're like halfway
to the moon.

9
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,769
Where did you
think

10
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:39,838
tso LAN the moon
demon would be
found?

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,274
(Nervous chuckle)
No way to get up there.

12
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,143
Ha! Yeah, right.

13
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:46,612
It's not like valmont
owns a flying saucer.

14
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:49,381
Yeah, I mean,
we'd have to go
all the way to cape

15
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:53,285
whatchacall in Florida
to catch a rocket
to space--oof!

16
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:56,488
Ahh,
- very well, then.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,024
Why couldn't it have
been the earth demon?

18
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:54,613
Jade.

19
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,215
Maybe a working
volcano exhibit

20
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:57,616
is too advanced for me.

21
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,418
Jackie?

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,787
Science project.

23
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,891
Valmont and his
cronies have been
spotted in Florida,

24
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,092
near cape canaveral.

25
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,994
I'm on my way.

26
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,362
Goin' on a mission, Jackie?!

27
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,965
Uh, no. Not
a mission. It's...

28
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,766
A conference on
feng shui.

29
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:15,834
In Minnesota.

30
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:16,969
Want to come?

31
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,972
Um, I would Jackie,
but, you know

32
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:22,241
I have that new
science project
to cook up.

33
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,217
My goosebumps
are gettin' goosebumps.

34
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,318
I say we vote.

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,053
Anyone who doesn't
want to go orbital,

36
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,388
raise your hand.

37
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,160
Uh, we didn't count
valmont's vote.

38
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,928
Never mind valmont.

39
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,365
You will board that
spacecraft or you
will perish.

40
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,267
Unh.

41
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,005
No sign of the portal.

42
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,843
Let's keep it
that way.

43
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,445
Rocks and minerals...
Dullsville.

44
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:03,448
Photosynthesis...
Double dullsville.

45
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,619
(Sighs) Maybe I can get
inspired by the science
network.

46
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,556
Announcer: The launchpad
area has been cleared
for liftoff

47
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:13,425
of the experimental
space shuttle, <i> saratoga,</i>

48
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,228
which will later dock
with space station
<i>niagara.</i>

49
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,168
Hello.

50
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,239
Minnesota, hmm?

51
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:36,582
Announcer: Liftoff in
t-minus 30 seconds.

52
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:40,319
Oh, uh, don't we need
like, astronaut training?

53
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,453
Climb aboard!

54
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,107
Announcer: Countdown
at 10, 9...

55
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,977
8, 7, 6...

56
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,346
5, 4...

57
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,381
3, 2...

58
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,183
1...

59
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,785
Liftoff.
We have liftoff.

60
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,860
Aah!

61
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,296
Black.

62
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:27,232
Tell uncle I have
a strong hunch

63
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:30,702
that the portal
belongs to the moon
demon.

64
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:32,404
(Machines hiss)
(Gasp)

65
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,444
(Gasp) Talk later!

66
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,121
Ah!

67
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,368
Whoa.

68
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,471
Ahh, liftoff, indeed.

69
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,175
Where are we?

70
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,543
What are you wearing?

71
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,248
Oh, no! Oh, no!

72
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,382
Oh, no!

73
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,651
Oh, no!

74
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,387
Uh, we're cruisin'
for la Luna, big v.

75
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,623
But that's impossible!

76
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,625
Who's piloting this craft?

77
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,999
Ahoy.

78
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,368
There has been
a grave error.

79
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,771
I demand you turn
this ship around, posthaste!

80
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,275
Aah!

81
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,777
(Screaming)

82
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,679
Aw.

83
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,577
Aah! Guh, guh...

84
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,778
Hi, Jackie.

85
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,879
Jade!

86
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,280
Check out the monkey suit.

87
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,515
Literally.

88
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,584
But, how did you--

89
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,819
speed talisman.
Fastest way to get to...

90
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,421
Minnesota.

91
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,563
Autopilot.

92
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,865
You can relax,
big v.

93
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,901
Major Matt monkey's
flying with
training wheels.

94
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,238
I feel so much better.

95
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,714
Ugh, those whirly rides
make me nauseous.

96
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,183
Space makes me nauseous.

97
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,291
The spinning
of the station creates
gravitational pull. See?

98
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,060
I am so
going to get an "a"
on my science project.

99
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,044
Secure the station.

100
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,480
Piece of cake. We're
the only ones here.

101
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,555
Let us ensure
utmost privacy.

102
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,660
Surveillance and
communications
systems

103
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,162
are down? How?

104
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,864
The monkey.

105
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,936
Now, we wait for this
station to intersect

106
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:54,105
with the portal
belonging to tso LAN.

107
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,108
And open her up
with this key.

108
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,345
I hope uncle
is on his way
with that chi spell.

109
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,750
This is a level 7 override.

110
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,819
My engineers will
take over from here.

111
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,688
Ok.

112
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,726
I have a second
shuttle prepped to
take you to Jackie.

113
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,063
Aiiyah! Do I look
like flash Gordon?

114
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:21,066
I am too old
to play space man!

115
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:24,703
But, if you do not go,
sensei, who will cast
the chi spell?

116
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,973
(Groans)

117
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,879
We are mere minutes
from the portal location.

118
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,615
Ready the pan ku box.

119
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,086
Uhh!

120
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,521
Well?!

121
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,556
Yo, chow

122
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,260
oh!

123
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,737
Whoa.

124
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,071
Chan!

125
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,806
Everybody's an astronaut.

126
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,876
Where is
the pan ku box?!

127
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,882
(Hissing)

128
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,186
(Snarls) Hak foo!

129
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,955
Retrieve it!
Unh!

130
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,557
You go, hak!

131
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,425
And you, simpletons,

132
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:21,560
get chan!

133
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,162
Jackie!

134
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,463
You use it!

135
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,401
Raaah!

136
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,203
Uhh!
Uhh!

137
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,188
The <i> eagle</i> has landed.

138
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,341
Tiger prowls...

139
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,009
Through pudding.

140
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,679
Turtle fist!

141
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,216
Sloth kick!

142
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:26,424
Aah!

143
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,928
Uhh! (Gasp)

144
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,134
Oh, boy.

145
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,278
(Chuckling)

146
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,318
Flying monkey
snatches magic box.

147
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,055
Yaah!

148
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,758
Uhh!

149
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,833
Where is hak foo?!

150
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,669
The portal approaches.

151
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,570
No box, no demon.
Check, please!

152
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,678
(Chattering)

153
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,683
Good monkey.

154
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,284
Nice monkey.

155
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,253
No, cosmo! Run!

156
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,157
Give it up! Give it up!

157
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,725
(Cosmo
screeches)

158
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:34,793
Huh?

159
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,132
Yes.

160
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,588
Houston, we have a problem.

161
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,358
Get it.

162
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,762
Tso LAN, so good
to see you.

163
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,997
Skip the pleasantries, shendu.

164
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:17,469
I am interested only
in seizing control
of the moon's gravity

165
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:21,072
so that I may pull the ball
from its orbit.

166
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,209
But--but that'll wreck
all of earth's ecosystems.

167
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,677
How do <i> you</i> know?

168
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,912
<i>I</i> watch the science network.

169
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,080
Puhhht!

170
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,882
The child is correct.

171
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:35,420
And only then will earth's
landscape be to my liking.

172
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,623
Whoa! He wants to
kebosh the planet.

173
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,358
And you made us
let him out?

174
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,894
Just be glad you
are up here.

175
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,000
Duh-oh!

176
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,902
Argh! Ehh...

177
00:12:55,141 --> 00:13:01,679
You have joined us in time
to see the Nemesis of all
demon sorcerers destroyed.

178
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,851
This is Jackie chan?

179
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,720
No. That is.

180
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,925
Bwwaaaa!

181
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,329
Ah!
Oh!
Uhh!

182
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,964
Duh-ah!

183
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,599
Time to put out
the trash.

184
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,667
Uhh!

185
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,642
Shendu, I despise you.

186
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,843
I heard that.

187
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:42,654
It appears the pleasure
of destroying you
shall be mine alone.

188
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,961
A good chi spell
would be nice right now.

189
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,967
Tohru, can you hear me?

190
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,470
Wha-a-a-at?

191
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:02,373
You make faces at me!

192
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,875
Whu...Uh...Eh--

193
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,243
no, sensei.

194
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,953
Hiding only
delays the inevitable.

195
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,662
Hey...

196
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:25,797
Lucky rabbit.

197
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,633
(Chittering)

198
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,902
Shoo! Shoo!

199
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,503
(Chittering)

200
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,839
(Screeching)

201
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,217
I see no one.

202
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,888
Uncle: Prepare
the chi spell,
<i>then</i> socialize!

203
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,658
Now, do you have
the lotus pod?

204
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,759
Check.

205
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,327
Jelly of jelly fish?

206
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,896
Check.

207
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,264
(Screeching)

208
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,503
Behold...

209
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,640
My mastery of gravity.

210
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,363
And for you,
things look very grave.

211
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,910
Jackie, man the torpedo.

212
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,714
Full speed ahead!

213
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,087
Uhh!

214
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,332
Outta the park.

215
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,867
Uh-oh.

216
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,439
He's rolling down
moon river.

217
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:18,242
This is very bad.
We need uncle's
chi spell.

218
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:21,012
Earth to Jackie.
We're in <i> space.</i>

219
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,880
Where are we
gonna get a chi spell?

220
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,217
A lotus pod?

221
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,418
Isn't that...?

222
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,886
The symbol
of the immortal

223
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,656
who originally
defeated tso LAN
the moon demon.

224
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,724
- Tohru?
- Tohru!

225
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,926
But...Where's uncle?

226
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,160
Uncle, yelling: Tohru!

227
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,731
Do you or do you not
have nosehair of possum?!

228
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,840
Hmm...

229
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,109
Could use a facelift.

230
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,159
Tall, dark, and creepy's
doing his moon-makeover thing.

231
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,827
Tohru, the chi spell.

232
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,196
Uncle: A spell can not work

233
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,867
if a demon is out of range
of the immortal's symbol!

234
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,370
How can we move
the immortal symbol
into range fast?

235
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,974
Jade: Duh!

236
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,266
Bad day!
Bad day! Bad day!

237
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,310
Jade, it's not safe.

238
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,511
So?

239
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,315
Eh, it's never safe.

240
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,350
I require assistance.

241
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:09,787
Awww, I thought
that's why you brought cosmo.

242
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,827
Where on earth
do I find a moon demon
on the moon?

243
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,061
Oh!

244
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,663
Behind you.

245
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,164
Heh. Hello.

246
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:25,570
You dare interrupt me
in my moment of triumph?

247
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,071
It's what I do.

248
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,673
Whuh!

249
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,608
Oh!

250
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,943
Oh...

251
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,179
Where's the lotus pod?

252
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,614
You put it in your suit.

253
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,754
Found it.

254
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:49,160
Tohru, the incantation!

255
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,230
Uncle: Aiyaaa!
That is my job!

256
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,232
Uncle!

257
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,533
Hurry!

258
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,939
(Chanting)

259
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,076
(Uncle chanting)

260
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,444
An incantation?

261
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:07,645
(Chanting continues)

262
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,080
The lotus pod.

263
00:19:09,082 --> 00:19:10,982
In order for it
to hex me,

264
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,850
you must remove
your helmet,

265
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,018
which you cannot do.

266
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,488
Oh! Grrr! Eh!

267
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,290
Then let me air this out.

268
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,126
(Inhales)

269
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,468
Aah!

270
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,673
Ah! (Breaths deeply)

271
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,349
Yesss!

272
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,251
(Cheering)

273
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:48,352
Right on!

274
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,530
So long, tso LAN.

275
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,971
My science product
is gonna rock!

276
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,182
Hey, Jackie,
if you weren't an actor,

277
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,750
what would you be?

278
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,586
I wanna be a pilot.

279
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,854
Oh, I just feel so cool.

280
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,756
Nothing cooler than pilot.

281
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:26,958
(Imitates plane flying)

282
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,893
Carrying the helmet,
wearing the suit,

283
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,995
walking...
But slow-motion.

284
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,298
The track behind you--

285
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,201
with--with the glasses.

286
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:41,372
Just by yourself,
go to the place nobody knows,
you know.

287
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,341
Oh, just, I wanna be a pilot.
