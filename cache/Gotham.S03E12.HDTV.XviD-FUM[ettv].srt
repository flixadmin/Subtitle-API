1
00:00:01,224 --> 00:00:02,459
Previously on Gotham..

2
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:04,800
Ooh...

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,203
What you call sanity...

4
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:09,705
Hey!

5
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:11,073
...is just a prison in your mind.

6
00:00:11,142 --> 00:00:12,441
Bang.

7
00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:14,843
Wake up!

8
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:20,048
You're the one who's been following us.

9
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:21,717
Do you know her?

10
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:23,252
That's my mom.

11
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:26,489
Isabella's death has altered things,

12
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:27,757
- and I can't continue.
- No!

13
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:29,792
Ed, I will not let you leave.

14
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,768
I don't want to kill him.

15
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:37,172
I want to destroy him.

16
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:39,741
Tetch infected him
that night in the hospital.

17
00:00:39,777 --> 00:00:41,297
Swear that you'll bring him in alive.

18
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:42,634
I swear.

19
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:44,913
After the wedding,

20
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:47,498
Mario and I are leaving Gotham.

21
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:48,866
I'll never see you again.

22
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:50,702
Lee, you cannot marry him.

23
00:00:50,737 --> 00:00:51,836
Get the hell out of here!

24
00:01:11,856 --> 00:01:14,890
"And the end will
come when he hands over"

25
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,991
the kingdom to God, the Father,

26
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,464
after he has destroyed all dominion.

27
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:23,665
The last enemy to be destroyed

28
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:26,375
"is death."

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,500
In nomine Patris

30
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:32,135
et Filii tu y Santos.

31
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,736
Amen.

32
00:01:34,737 --> 00:01:36,703
Amen.

33
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,423
Jim.

34
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:44,599
What the hell are you doing here?

35
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:47,083
If Falcone sees you, God
only knows what he'll do.

36
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:49,095
I had to do it, Harv.

37
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:52,219
He was infected. He would've killed her.

38
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:53,320
It was a legit kill.

39
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:54,655
That's the law.

40
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,057
This is family.

41
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:58,392
The man's burying his son.

42
00:01:58,427 --> 00:01:59,960
Lee's burying a husband.

43
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:02,997
I wanted to...

44
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,333
I don't know.

45
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:07,534
To what?

46
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,336
Say sorry?

47
00:02:09,372 --> 00:02:11,639
Talk about the past?

48
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:15,075
This isn't the time or the place.
Come on.

49
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,670
This is Edward.

50
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,271
Leave a message.

51
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:46,607
Or don't.

52
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:48,342
Doesn't really matter.

53
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,345
- Hey! Ooh.
- What?

54
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,646
Mayor, the press have assembled
in the conference room.

55
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:55,880
- They are requesting your presence.
- The press? Why?

56
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:57,618
The latest figures are in.

57
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,320
Fine.

58
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,724
Let the vultures have at me.

59
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:06,026
Hey, there he is.

60
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:13,267
They're through the
roof across the board.

61
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:15,569
Yeah, jobs are up, market's up.

62
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:17,137
Crime way, way down.

63
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:19,373
You did it.

64
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:22,910
Enjoy the moment, sir.

65
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:25,212
Excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me.

66
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:30,918
Praise well deserved, Mr. Mayor.

67
00:03:30,953 --> 00:03:33,454
I really think we need to
cash in on this good news

68
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,422
immediately.

69
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,725
You are a clever fellow, Tarquin, but...

70
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,059
I wish Ed were here.

71
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,627
My sole job as deputy chief

72
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:42,730
of staff is to serve
you with the exact same

73
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,866
zeal and smarts as Mr. Nygma would.

74
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:48,202
Thank you all so much for coming.

75
00:03:48,237 --> 00:03:49,436
Thanks, everyone.

76
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:50,871
Bob, great to see you.

77
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:52,506
Bill, take care.

78
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:57,678
Margaret Hearst. Know her?

79
00:03:57,713 --> 00:04:00,180
Of course.

80
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:02,383
When I saw these numbers
come in, I thought who better

81
00:04:02,418 --> 00:04:05,686
to help us capitalize on
this than Margaret Hearst?

82
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:08,455
The whole city... no, the whole
country... watches her show.

83
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:10,024
She can take you to a whole new level.

84
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:12,426
Solidify your legacy
on a national scale.

85
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,529
"National scale"?

86
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:17,297
She's in my office,

87
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,366
and she is dying to meet you.

88
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:21,168
Turn her down now, she won't come back,

89
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:23,170
like... ever.

90
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:25,105
What do you say?

91
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,644
How's my hair?

92
00:04:53,702 --> 00:04:56,236
Hope you don't mind.

93
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,638
I helped myself.

94
00:04:57,773 --> 00:04:58,871
What do you want?

95
00:04:58,872 --> 00:04:59,970
I'm here

96
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:02,171
as a messenger.

97
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:03,911
Okay, I'm listening.

98
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:06,780
You messed up, Jim.

99
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,348
Killed the don's son.

100
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:10,017
He's beside himself.

101
00:05:10,052 --> 00:05:11,551
I've never seen him like this before.

102
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:13,619
I want to speak to him.

103
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,453
Oh, no, we're way past that.

104
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,725
It's only a matter of time
before he gives the nod to...

105
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,194
...put a bullet in your head.

106
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:21,495
You could try.

107
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,898
I don't... try.

108
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:28,435
And I never stop.

109
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:30,237
You won't see me coming.

110
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:32,439
And you won't feel a thing.

111
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,043
If we don't get a chance
to talk before then,

112
00:05:36,078 --> 00:05:38,545
it's been really nice knowing you.

113
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:40,114
You're a good egg.

114
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:44,284
Also...

115
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,053
nice shot on Mario.

116
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:47,788
I never liked him.

117
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:07,041
Nice place.

118
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,713
What's with the raggedy clothes?

119
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,249
Why are you back?

120
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,586
To see you, of course.

121
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:24,591
Why now?

122
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,829
Why wait 11 years to see me?

123
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:30,464
That's right.

124
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:32,499
11 years.

125
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:36,003
You didn't even check up on me.

126
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:38,805
What can I say?

127
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:41,275
I'm sorry, and you have no idea

128
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,677
how many times I thought of you.

129
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:45,112
How many times, Mom?

130
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:46,280
I had to leave.

131
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:48,448
I had no choice.

132
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,987
You know that orphanage I left you at?

133
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:57,691
It's the same one I was
left at by who knows who.

134
00:06:57,726 --> 00:06:59,326
St. Maria's.

135
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:01,028
It's where I got my name.

136
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:05,299
I grew up there and on the streets.

137
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:07,634
It was on the streets that I had you.

138
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,835
Who's my father?

139
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,638
You're not dating that kid, are you?

140
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,310
You should go.

141
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,212
Wait, I me... I was a dumb kid, okay?

142
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:19,513
I got in trouble with the law.

143
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,614
I had to leave or they were
gonna take me to prison.

144
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:22,913
I had to run and run fast.

145
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:24,712
And you can't run fast
with a five-year-old.

146
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:26,646
Not just a five-year-old.

147
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:30,123
Your five-year-old.

148
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,326
Your daughter.

149
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:34,661
That was a bad call.

150
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,496
Okay?

151
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:41,201
I just wanted to come here,
and tell you that I love you.

152
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:44,404
And I'm sorry.

153
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,706
All righty then.

154
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,976
This has been so fun.

155
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,277
Bye.

156
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,347
Selina.

157
00:07:53,382 --> 00:07:54,548
Good-bye.

158
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:13,632
Mayor, this...

159
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:15,258
is Ms. Hearst.

160
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:16,526
Perhaps you've truly found

161
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:18,495
your calling in office, Mr. Cobblepot.

162
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,148
Or perhaps...

163
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:23,716
you just know how to show people
only what they want to see.

164
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:24,816
Hmm?

165
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,529
Either way, I plan

166
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,630
to get inside your head
and share what I find

167
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:30,164
with the citizens of Gotham.

168
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:31,302
Does that deter you?

169
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:33,871
Please.

170
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,971
Then I think

171
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,470
the exclusive interview should happen

172
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:37,536
here at City Hall

173
00:08:37,537 --> 00:08:39,237
this Friday, live.

174
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:41,645
Actually, I would prefer
to do it at home and...

175
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:42,813
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

176
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,149
This Friday or not at all.

177
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:49,019
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Mayor.

178
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:52,089
I'm not a fan.

179
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:55,092
I shan't be holding back.

180
00:08:55,127 --> 00:08:57,795
My audience expects the
truth and I give it to them.

181
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,430
The truth is in my numbers,

182
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:00,798
Ms. Hearst.

183
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,467
Then Friday it is.

184
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,369
Gotham will see their mayor...

185
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:07,037
as he truly is.

186
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:10,507
Dig deep.

187
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:13,110
I have nothing to hide.

188
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,128
Melanie Blake.

189
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:32,630
Found wandering the train tracks

190
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:34,698
late last night in a state of undress.

191
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:36,233
She collapsed soon after,

192
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:38,369
and died in the ambulance
of coronary failure.

193
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:41,171
At some point prior to her
appearance on the tracks,

194
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:45,276
somebody applied a strong
electrical current to her.

195
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:46,777
Considering the extent of the burns,

196
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:48,012
I'm guessing literally

197
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,414
thousands of volts were passed

198
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,749
through this poor girl.

199
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:52,883
Torture?

200
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,084
Perhaps.

201
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,920
She say anything before she die?

202
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:57,354
No.

203
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,822
She was...

204
00:09:58,858 --> 00:10:00,925
stabbed as well?

205
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,461
Melanie was stabbed three
days ago by her boyfriend.

206
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:05,396
She was pronounced
dead in the ambulance.

207
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:06,664
Wait, w-what?

208
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:07,798
Two days ago,

209
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,600
this girl was taken to the morgue,

210
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:10,935
dead.

211
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,236
And yet last night,

212
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:14,537
she's walking down the train
tracks after getting zapped

213
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:16,471
with 10,000 volts in her noggin?

214
00:10:16,472 --> 00:10:18,138
Doesn't anyone die in Gotham anymore?

215
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:20,377
Is it possible she wasn't actually dead,

216
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,379
and just walked out of the morgue?

217
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:24,715
These days I no longer say impossible.

218
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,916
Unlikely.

219
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,118
The morgue.

220
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:30,354
It's not a morgue, it's a motel.

221
00:10:33,793 --> 00:10:36,560
Harvey!

222
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,596
As acting captain, I
demand that you arrest

223
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:42,466
Detective Gordon for
the murder of my husband.

224
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:43,734
Lee...

225
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,669
please.

226
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:47,738
Please?

227
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,039
Please...

228
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:51,208
what?!

229
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:52,910
You didn't have to kill him.

230
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,245
Dr. Thompkins, if I may,

231
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,746
your husband took a drug that...

232
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,214
Nathaniel Barnes was infected

233
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:59,149
with the same virus.

234
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,718
He's alive.

235
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:03,053
Jim spared his life.

236
00:11:09,428 --> 00:11:12,329
And yet he gunned down
Mario on his wedding day.

237
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:24,408
You're the real virus, Jim.

238
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:28,145
You seep into people's lives

239
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,646
until you destroy them.

240
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:36,520
You haven't heard the end of this.

241
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,370
Father?

242
00:12:27,907 --> 00:12:30,007
Help me.

243
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,475
My God.

244
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,249
Of course. How?

245
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:42,453
He's not to be trusted.

246
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:44,188
Who?

247
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:02,039
Sorry to bother you so late, Mr. Mayor.

248
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,908
Yes. What is it?

249
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:07,211
Someone broke into
the cemetery and dug up

250
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,213
your father's remains.

251
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:22,472
GCPD.

252
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:26,519
You the night manager
here, Mister, uh...

253
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,022
Pollard?

254
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:31,597
Dwight, please, that's
correct. Something wrong?

255
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:34,233
Only if you call dead people
walking out of here wrong.

256
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,935
What?

257
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,102
Melanie Blake.

258
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:39,767
- She would have been here two days ago.
- Yeah.

259
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:43,476
Stabbing victim.

260
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,745
Drawer 12.

261
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:52,652
That's not right.

262
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:55,154
That's because she's on the M.E.'s slab,

263
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:56,656
dead, again.

264
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:58,591
What?

265
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:01,460
You have any security
cameras here? Guards?

266
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:02,661
No, we don't need them.

267
00:14:02,697 --> 00:14:03,996
Nothing ever happens down here.

268
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:07,600
Sorry.

269
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:08,968
Hey.

270
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:10,436
You jumpy, Jim?

271
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:12,438
Uh, we're all good.

272
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:16,609
You got something you want to share?

273
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:20,613
No.

274
00:14:20,648 --> 00:14:22,348
Let's stick around.

275
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,250
See where this Dwight takes us.

276
00:14:28,523 --> 00:14:29,989
I don't get it.

277
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:32,858
Why is it so important
to the Court of Owls?

278
00:14:32,894 --> 00:14:35,428
It's just an ornament.

279
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:37,029
I don't know.

280
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:38,331
Men died protecting it.

281
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:39,733
So we hide it,

282
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:42,068
hold onto it for leverage in
case they come for us again.

283
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:44,037
Perhaps in the cave.

284
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:10,329
Ms. Kyle.

285
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:14,734
What a surprise.

286
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,802
For what do we owe this pleasure?

287
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:19,171
I was just leaving this here for Selina.

288
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:21,741
Oh.

289
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:23,542
Uh... come in.

290
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,713
Please stay.

291
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:30,583
We've been meaning to thank you
in person for the other night.

292
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:31,951
I can't. I have a train to catch.

293
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:33,586
Please just see that she gets this.

294
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:34,953
Would you mind if I asked

295
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:36,422
what's in the box?

296
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,560
Some things I kept from
my time here in Gotham.

297
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:43,996
It's not something you'd like
to give to Selina yourself?

298
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:45,531
I tried reaching out to her.

299
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:47,533
She's too angry.

300
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:49,535
Not that I can blame her.

301
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,003
Please, just...

302
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,005
see that she gets this.

303
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:00,362
Ms. Kyle?

304
00:16:00,397 --> 00:16:03,365
Take it from someone who
misses his family very much.

305
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:06,034
Please don't leave just yet.

306
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:09,905
I know where she is.

307
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:12,674
Let me talk to her.

308
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:26,722
Okay, thanks.

309
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:29,024
This keeps getting better and better.

310
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:31,793
Guess where Dwight Pollard
worked before the morgue.

311
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:33,161
Indian Hill.

312
00:16:33,197 --> 00:16:34,229
How'd you know?

313
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:35,731
Where else in Gotham do the dead

314
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:37,165
get brought back to life?

315
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:42,905
The cops came by, idiot.

316
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,972
How'd she get out?

317
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:45,040
Never mind.

318
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:46,175
I have to get to the venue.

319
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,276
I'll come by after.

320
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:48,677
Should we grab him now?

321
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:50,913
No, I want to see where he's going.

322
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:56,218
The autopsy showed
that Mario did have the virus.

323
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:58,921
Mario was my son.

324
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:03,225
Whether he was sick or
not is of no concern to me.

325
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,460
Gordon took his life.

326
00:17:05,496 --> 00:17:07,396
What are you gonna do?

327
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:11,033
I cared for Jim Gordon.

328
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:14,403
In some ways, he was more
like my son than Mario.

329
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:16,538
His life is mine to take.

330
00:17:16,574 --> 00:17:18,941
That's the natural law.

331
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:21,710
Blood for blood.

332
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:25,047
I hate him.

333
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:27,115
God, I hate him.

334
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:29,818
Everything bad that's
happened in my life

335
00:17:29,853 --> 00:17:31,386
has happened because of him.

336
00:17:31,422 --> 00:17:33,388
If Gordon dies,

337
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:36,592
it's a weight we'll both have to carry.

338
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:38,594
I'm used to such burdens.

339
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:41,730
You're not.

340
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:43,599
He'll die by my hand, not yours.

341
00:17:45,202 --> 00:17:47,469
But this is something
you'll need to live with.

342
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:51,173
Can you?

343
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:13,933
What is that?

344
00:18:14,068 --> 00:18:15,534
Your mother brought it to my house.

345
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:17,702
Just leave it there.

346
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:19,504
I'll get it later.

347
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,146
Selina... I know how long

348
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:31,049
you've waited to see your mother.

349
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:33,452
I can't imagine all you must be feeling.

350
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:36,788
She left me here, Bruce.

351
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,657
Alone.

352
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,035
You're right.

353
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,703
It's hard to forgive.

354
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:44,772
It may be the hardest thing

355
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:47,508
any of us have to do in this life.

356
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,411
But she's reaching out.

357
00:18:50,446 --> 00:18:53,380
And it may be your only
chance to reach back.

358
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,887
She's a crook.

359
00:18:59,922 --> 00:19:01,822
Can't you see that?

360
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:03,691
She's still your mother.

361
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,660
Push her away now and you
may never see her again.

362
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,901
Okay.

363
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:22,469
Weird...

364
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:25,339
But not illegal.

365
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:43,223
Okay.

366
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:45,225
Weirder.

367
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,430
The people of this city are slaves.

368
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,765
Mm-hmm. See, they get up every day

369
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:55,736
and go to work so they
can pay their taxes,

370
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:57,237
their mortgages.

371
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,973
See, they believe what
the papers tell them.

372
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,077
They fear what the
politicians feed them.

373
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:05,979
See, they are mentally
shackled, and yet,

374
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,215
they do nothing about it!

375
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,687
Yeah! Nothing!

376
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:16,990
But there was someone who understood.

377
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,260
Someone who spoke out, who stood up,

378
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:23,297
to the jailers, puppets.

379
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:27,067
A man with no fear.

380
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:32,473
Hello, Gotham City!

381
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:35,709
We're the Maniax. And I'm Jerome,

382
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:38,278
the shot caller of our little gang.

383
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:41,549
We're here to spread the
message of wisdom and hope.

384
00:21:45,154 --> 00:21:47,721
Some people have no manners.

385
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:50,057
You're all

386
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:51,825
prisoners.

387
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:56,029
What you call sanity,

388
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,398
it's just a prison in your minds

389
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:01,969
that stops you from seeing
you're just tiny little cogs

390
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:04,471
in a giant, absurd machine,

391
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:05,739
Wake up!

392
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:07,808
Oh!

393
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:10,077
Time to go.

394
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:11,311
But don't worry.

395
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:13,480
We'll be back very soon.

396
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,749
Hang onto your hats, folks.

397
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:18,018
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet!

398
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:26,894
All right!

399
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,061
Show's over!

400
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,363
Time to go home.

401
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,832
GCPD!

402
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:37,638
Let's go!

403
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:47,414
Let's go!

404
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,559
You see Dwight?

405
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:01,094
He was probably the last
one to jump on the clown car.

406
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,031
Bringing back the dead is
something we need to, uh...

407
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,568
Oh, no... What?

408
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:08,702
Back!

409
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:10,904
Who the hell's that?

410
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:13,640
It's Victor Zsasz.

411
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:15,276
Falcone put out a hit on me. Oh!

412
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,211
Would've been nice if
you told me that earlier!

413
00:23:17,246 --> 00:23:18,312
He's only after me.

414
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:20,647
Zsasz is very professional in that way.

415
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:25,285
Trapped behind here,
we're sitting ducks.

416
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,955
I need to draw their
fire. Find me later.

417
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,224
Wait, Jim. Don't!

418
00:23:34,964 --> 00:23:36,230
Damn it.

419
00:23:43,532 --> 00:23:45,032
Everyone out! It's not safe.

420
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,975
- Hey, who is this guy?
- What are you deaf?

421
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,510
Get out of here!

422
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:22,910
It's inevitability, Jim.

423
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:24,311
Embrace it.

424
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:41,295
You've had a good run.

425
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,330
You should know that.

426
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:30,844
Who's there?

427
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:42,222
Father?

428
00:25:50,532 --> 00:25:51,732
Father.

429
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:53,200
How can I help you? What can I do?

430
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:54,468
Find me, my son.

431
00:25:54,503 --> 00:25:56,370
I cannot rest

432
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:58,405
until I lay underground once more.

433
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:02,442
He cannot be trusted!

434
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,944
Who?

435
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,246
Isabella is over on
the other side with us.

436
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:07,848
Whispering tales of murder.

437
00:26:07,883 --> 00:26:09,616
Dark plots are in motion, my son.

438
00:26:09,752 --> 00:26:10,917
Don't trust him!

439
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,184
Who?

440
00:26:12,185 --> 00:26:13,818
The birthday boy.

441
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,868
You want to know about your husband.

442
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:31,238
Was he a diseased maniac?

443
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:34,508
Would he have killed you?

444
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:37,010
Well, I can tell you this.

445
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:39,246
I've never felt better in my life.

446
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:41,381
Clearer, stronger.

447
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:43,583
More focused.

448
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:45,419
Even now, I can feel it

449
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:48,355
coursing through my veins.

450
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,223
Restoring my body.

451
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,528
So, Mario could've lived

452
00:26:54,563 --> 00:26:56,563
a normal life with it.

453
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,198
Would've given us time to find a cure.

454
00:26:58,233 --> 00:26:59,533
Jim didn't have to kill him.

455
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,435
Cure?

456
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,537
This virus isn't the disease.

457
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:06,273
It's the antidote.

458
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:09,109
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

459
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:11,445
I don't need a cure.

460
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,280
The murderers,

461
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:15,282
thieves, rapists.

462
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:22,456
James Gordon is one of them.

463
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:25,459
When I get out of here...
And trust me, I will...

464
00:27:25,494 --> 00:27:29,096
He'll be the first that I judge.

465
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:32,566
He and all the other human
garbage that plague this city.

466
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:35,235
All will be tried,

467
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,805
convicted and executed!

468
00:27:38,841 --> 00:27:41,742
I will purge Gotham,

469
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:44,010
and the innocents will thank me!

470
00:27:44,046 --> 00:27:46,279
Their savior!

471
00:27:47,516 --> 00:27:50,083
Their executioner.

472
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:54,521
I know, and the best part is,

473
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:57,791
that fake painting is still
hanging in the gallery.

474
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,794
Perhaps we might be able
to talk about something

475
00:28:00,829 --> 00:28:04,364
other than your previous
illicit exploits, Ms. Kyle.

476
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,966
Oh, I'm sorry, Alfred.

477
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:08,969
This was a great meal.

478
00:28:09,004 --> 00:28:10,337
You're quite the chef.

479
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:11,938
Thank you very much, miss.

480
00:28:11,974 --> 00:28:13,373
He's a catch, this one.

481
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:16,209
Got a stiff right hand, too.

482
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:18,044
Easy mark, though.

483
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,546
Thank you...

484
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,448
very much, cheeky monkey.

485
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:23,150
Oh, you poor thing.

486
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:24,518
Come here.

487
00:28:26,655 --> 00:28:28,488
Oh...

488
00:28:28,524 --> 00:28:30,657
I see what you mean, though.

489
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:32,893
Oh, well, that's just...

490
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:34,861
Just hilarious. You
know... Really. Thank you.

491
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:36,696
Thank you very much...

492
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:41,134
Oh, I guess I better go.

493
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,603
It's late. Stay.

494
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,672
Alfred will drive you to
your hotel in the morning.

495
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:47,841
You're very kind.

496
00:28:56,685 --> 00:28:58,185
Mr. Mayor?

497
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,388
Unless you are bringing strong coffee,

498
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:02,656
or you have information

499
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:04,825
on my father's stolen remains...

500
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,561
...go away.

501
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:08,662
Yeah, but...

502
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:20,540
The birthday boy.

503
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:14,160
Your Honor.

504
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:17,063
Can I help you?

505
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:18,265
Why?

506
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,968
Why would you do such a thing?

507
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:23,803
What are you talking
about? What is that?

508
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:26,339
You are a sick man!

509
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:30,110
What are you plotting?

510
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:31,745
What's the angle?

511
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,246
Who are you in on this with?

512
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:34,781
I-I have no idea.

513
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:35,949
Look, you're exhausted.

514
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:37,284
Y-You haven't slept in days...

515
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,518
You barely...

516
00:30:59,975 --> 00:31:01,007
Mr. Stemmel?

517
00:31:01,043 --> 00:31:02,242
The TV crew is ready.

518
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,010
It's time for the interview.

519
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:05,512
Have you seen the mayor?

520
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:21,314
Carmine... call it off.

521
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:23,984
Why?

522
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,290
I saw Barnes.

523
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:26,958
The virus has completely taken over.

524
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:28,193
He's insane.

525
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:30,094
What makes you want to save Gordon?

526
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,462
Please, just call it off.

527
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:32,764
You said you hated him.

528
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,399
That wasn't true, was it?

529
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,401
Call it off now!

530
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,403
You talk of hate

531
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,804
and revenge,

532
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,408
but that's only to mask
what really scares you.

533
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:47,378
You still love James Gordon.

534
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:55,853
Where is he?

535
00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:57,055
We're minutes away.

536
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,823
They're looking for him.

537
00:31:58,858 --> 00:31:59,924
Well, look harder.

538
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,327
Here he is!

539
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:03,595
Sorry I'm late.

540
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,365
Mayor stuff.

541
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:12,870
Mr. Mayor, this is a pin...

542
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:19,310
I hope you're ready, Mr. Mayor.

543
00:32:19,346 --> 00:32:23,014
The world is watching.

544
00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:25,283
And we're live in three,

545
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,285
two...

546
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,357
Mayor Cobblepot,

547
00:32:32,392 --> 00:32:35,026
as Gotham is enjoying an historic spike

548
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:37,829
in job growth and prosperity,

549
00:32:37,864 --> 00:32:40,965
it is also going through
one of the safest periods

550
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,200
in its history.

551
00:32:42,235 --> 00:32:44,235
And I'm sure everyone is wondering,

552
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:45,737
"How did he do it?"

553
00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:48,640
Uh...

554
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,454
Well...

555
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,167
Whoa, hey!

556
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,468
Hello to you, too.

557
00:33:17,504 --> 00:33:19,203
You didn't think you'd get rid of me

558
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:20,371
that easily, did you?

559
00:33:20,407 --> 00:33:22,373
I thought we might need something

560
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:23,574
with a bit more bite.

561
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:29,013
So, why didn't you tell me about Zsasz?

562
00:33:31,117 --> 00:33:32,350
It's my business.

563
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,618
Yeah? Not yours.

564
00:33:33,653 --> 00:33:35,219
That's a bit ridiculous, seeing as how

565
00:33:35,255 --> 00:33:37,889
I'm standing next to
you most of the time.

566
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,148
What's up?

567
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,619
Drop it, Jim.

568
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:10,588
It's your time to die today.

569
00:34:10,623 --> 00:34:12,090
Not his.

570
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,391
Don't listen to him, Jim.

571
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,060
Shoot him now!

572
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,196
Relax, Zsasz.

573
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:20,698
Job's cancelled.

574
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:26,337
You can go home.

575
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:29,140
Okay, boss.

576
00:34:40,186 --> 00:34:42,320
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:43,823 --> 00:34:47,625
If it was up to me, you'd be dead.

578
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:04,342
Whew!

579
00:35:11,682 --> 00:35:14,548
So from humble errand
boy to kitchen worker

580
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:18,383
to the so-called "King of Gotham,"

581
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:22,286
it is said that many
died so you could rise.

582
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:25,961
Oh...

583
00:35:25,997 --> 00:35:27,229
An exaggeration.

584
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:30,532
People love to invent scandal.

585
00:35:30,568 --> 00:35:33,869
But it was murder that
sent you to Arkham,

586
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:35,971
a prison for the criminally insane.

587
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:39,041
I rescued the city

588
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:42,278
from the madman, Theo Galavan.

589
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:44,647
Some call it murder.

590
00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:46,649
Others a public service.

591
00:35:46,684 --> 00:35:49,852
And after your controversial release

592
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:53,055
from prison, you met your father,

593
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,523
Elijah Van Dahl.

594
00:35:54,558 --> 00:35:58,060
A man whose identity

595
00:35:58,095 --> 00:35:59,528
your mother kept from you.

596
00:35:59,564 --> 00:36:00,763
Oh, my God.

597
00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:02,564
Yes, it must have been very upsetting.

598
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,900
What? Yes.

599
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:06,969
He also died under
suspicious circumstances.

600
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:10,039
His wife and step-children
disappearing soon after.

601
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:11,940
I-I have to go.

602
00:36:11,976 --> 00:36:14,010
Why? Is it because there's
substance to the rumors

603
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:16,345
that you had them killed to
inherit your father's wealth?

604
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,447
Fa-Father, Father wait!

605
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,447
Are you feeling well, Mr. Mayor?

606
00:36:21,452 --> 00:36:23,452
I'm fine. I-I'm great.

607
00:36:23,487 --> 00:36:24,753
Why would I not be fine?

608
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:26,222
The people of Gotham, and America,

609
00:36:26,257 --> 00:36:27,423
want to know the truth.

610
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:29,458
To hell with the people!

611
00:36:35,232 --> 00:36:37,399
Father, wait!

612
00:36:37,435 --> 00:36:39,735
Father?

613
00:36:44,709 --> 00:36:46,241
No! No!

614
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:14,770
A very good job.

615
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:27,750
Ah.

616
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:29,118
He bought it?

617
00:37:29,153 --> 00:37:30,652
Hook, line and sinker.

618
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:33,956
Ah, voice wasn't quite
right, but, uh, you know...

619
00:37:38,796 --> 00:37:40,529
Bravo, boys.

620
00:37:40,564 --> 00:37:42,831
Penguin lost his mind on national TV,

621
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:44,433
just like you said he would.

622
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:46,769
It's all about the power of suggestion.

623
00:37:46,804 --> 00:37:49,338
And whispering in the right ears.

624
00:37:49,373 --> 00:37:52,007
Do what I say, and you'll
be the next chief of staff.

625
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,577
Tell him, "I'm still grieving."

626
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:56,645
Margaret Hearse is in your
office waiting for you.

627
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,448
And remember to say
exactly what I told you

628
00:37:59,483 --> 00:38:01,049
about his father.

629
00:38:21,272 --> 00:38:23,906
Why don't you just leave
these bodies for the cops?

630
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:25,574
Have him arrested.

631
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:26,642
That's too easy, Tabitha.

632
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:31,647
I want this to be a slow...

633
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:33,982
painful death.

634
00:38:34,018 --> 00:38:37,486
One of a thousand deep cuts.

635
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:39,388
First we take away his mind...

636
00:38:39,423 --> 00:38:41,023
That's the part I like.

637
00:38:41,058 --> 00:38:44,560
We destroy his empire
and take it for ourselves.

638
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:48,263
And then, when this
bird is broken and alone,

639
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:51,033
we do the humane thing

640
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:52,568
and put him out of his misery.

641
00:38:52,603 --> 00:38:54,536
Mm.

642
00:39:02,346 --> 00:39:04,413
If there's anything I
can do for you, Ms. Kyle,

643
00:39:04,548 --> 00:39:05,781
please don't...

644
00:39:05,816 --> 00:39:08,016
hesitate to ask.

645
00:39:21,899 --> 00:39:23,131
Wait here.

646
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:25,667
What's wrong? Just do it.

647
00:39:28,873 --> 00:39:30,572
Did you think I wouldn't find you?

648
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:32,574
I was headed back tomorrow.

649
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,043
My money, where is it? 100 grand.

650
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:36,478
I don't have your money.

651
00:39:36,514 --> 00:39:38,881
What do I have to
do, beat it out of you?

652
00:39:38,916 --> 00:39:41,083
Leave her alone! I told
you to stay outside!

653
00:39:41,118 --> 00:39:42,484
Who's this?

654
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,619
Nobody.

655
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:44,786
We can get you the money.

656
00:39:44,822 --> 00:39:45,988
Is that so?

657
00:39:46,023 --> 00:39:47,723
Who from?

658
00:39:47,758 --> 00:39:50,726
The guy that dropped you
off in the Rolls Royce?

659
00:39:53,797 --> 00:39:56,098
One of you talk.

660
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:58,634
Who's the rich guy? Mom...

661
00:39:58,669 --> 00:40:01,670
Leave her alone. Well, well.

662
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:04,140
I hope she know what a
lying cheat you are, Maria.

663
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:06,607
Bruce will give you the money.
He's a good friend of mine.

664
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:08,741
Would you relax? Bruce Wayne?

665
00:40:08,812 --> 00:40:10,612
Well, now,

666
00:40:10,648 --> 00:40:11,813
that changes everything.

667
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:13,749
Why settle for a hundred?

668
00:40:13,784 --> 00:40:17,786
Perhaps I'll pay him a visit, tell him

669
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:19,688
all about you.

670
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:23,292
Who was that?

671
00:40:23,327 --> 00:40:25,661
That was my past coming
back to punish me.

672
00:40:25,696 --> 00:40:27,930
Was he the reason you
left Gotham before?

673
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:29,298
It's complicated.

674
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:31,533
We have to warn your friends.

675
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:33,368
Cole is not someone
they should mess with.

676
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,606
Good job, Mom.

677
00:40:48,052 --> 00:40:49,184
Were you followed?

678
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:50,886
No, no thanks to you.

679
00:40:51,022 --> 00:40:53,188
How did the girl escape?
You led the cops right to me.

680
00:40:53,223 --> 00:40:54,455
I turned my head for a minute.

681
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:55,888
She must have stumbled out.

682
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:58,357
But this proves that your designs work.

683
00:40:58,362 --> 00:40:59,861
She came back to life.

684
00:40:59,897 --> 00:41:01,663
But not for long.

685
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:03,198
The current's still too strong.

686
00:41:03,233 --> 00:41:04,700
Her body couldn't take it.

687
00:41:04,735 --> 00:41:06,868
We have to move quickly.

688
00:41:06,904 --> 00:41:08,737
Gather the others.

689
00:41:08,772 --> 00:41:10,672
It's time to get him.

690
00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:41,004
