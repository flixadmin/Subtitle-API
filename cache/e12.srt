You are still doing drama,

I have got your birth chart.

To become the owner
from an employee,

you first killed Malini
and then Anu.

Are you trying to say
that I have killed Anu?

Then why did you send
fake currency as ransom.

What are you saying?
Why would I do that?

Good, that you have a very bad aim.

Otherwise I would be with
my grandpa in heaven and crying.

00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:13,988
Seema. Our daughter.

329
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:16,624
The owner of Narayan Sugar Mills.

330
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,722
Unfortunately, you are her father.

331
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:23,722
[Mishra] <i>Another twist.</i>

332
00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:25,991
<i>The climax is not getting over.</i>

333
00:21:29,843 --> 00:21:31,389
Do you think I will believe you?

334
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:36,834
Malini, I don't trust you at all.

335
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:39,524
It doesn't matter
if you believe it or not.

336
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:42,356
The court will believe this.

337
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,195
DNA test.

338
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,194
The day you threw me
out of the house,

339
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:52,526
I knew that
I was pregnant with Seema.

340
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,440
You needed two crores for her?

341
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:06,108
For her treatment.

342
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:08,606
She is also your daughter, right?

343
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:10,337
There is problem with her blood.

344
00:22:11,524 --> 00:22:13,169
She needs to undergo transfusion.

345
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,903
I needed 70 lakhs.

346
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,382
The rest was for him.

347
00:22:21,803 --> 00:22:25,228
[Mishra] <i>I think my phone memory
card will get full.</i>

348
00:22:25,318 --> 00:22:27,421
<i>But their climax will not get over.</i>

349
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:30,190
What can I do for her?
What can I do?

350
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,944
You just need
to stay away from her.

351
00:22:33,993 --> 00:22:35,420
You know about the will.

352
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:38,251
Once she is 18 years old,

353
00:22:38,341 --> 00:22:40,235
she will come on her own
to ask for her rights.

354
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:42,339
And you know.

355
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:46,506
Anu used to feel suffocated
in the prison of your house.

356
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:48,820
She herself wanted
to get out of that place.

357
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,962
So live, Govind.

358
00:22:55,476 --> 00:22:56,966
Live in your jail.

359
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,538
Alone.

360
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:01,353
And count your days.

361
00:23:07,658 --> 00:23:08,883
Malini.

362
00:23:18,795 --> 00:23:19,786
[Gunshot]

363
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,635
[Thud]

364
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:09,501
- Are you okay?
- Hmm.

365
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:11,002
Did they beat you a lot?

366
00:24:13,543 --> 00:24:15,736
They beat me for three days.

367
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:19,527
And then they also made me drunk.

368
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:23,467
But it was awesome, boy.

369
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,240
Top quality.

370
00:24:29,262 --> 00:24:30,259
Listen.

371
00:24:30,674 --> 00:24:34,096
Find out where they
got the stuff from.

372
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:35,842
[Muffled laugh]

373
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,560
I am correct.

374
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:41,072
There is no one to ask.
Everyone is finished.

375
00:24:41,895 --> 00:24:42,890
Let's go home.

376
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,706
Try to shake them a little.
They might still be alive.

377
00:24:46,796 --> 00:24:49,029
Ask them kindly.
They will tell you.

378
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,333
There is no one left to ask kindly.

379
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,806
Let's go home with the policeman.

380
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:54,765
What policeman?

381
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,697
Who made you a policeman?

382
00:24:58,494 --> 00:25:00,940
You cannot find out about stuff.

383
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,343
They don't allow you
to wear the uniform.

384
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:05,691
And I have seen
your humanity today.

385
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:07,193
It's nothing.

386
00:25:07,283 --> 00:25:09,687
[Laughs]

387
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:13,513
You have no quality
to be a policeman.

388
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:14,778
[Laughs]
