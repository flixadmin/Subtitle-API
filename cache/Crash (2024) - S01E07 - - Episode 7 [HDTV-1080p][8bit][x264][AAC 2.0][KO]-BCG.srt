1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,950
CRASH

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,327
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,955
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,046
What the hell?

5
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,892
Look at this bastard.

6
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,564
Hey, stop the car!

7
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,150
Are you insane? I said stop the car!

8
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,736
Look at you.

9
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,030
You jerk.

10
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,043
Please help me.

11
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,962
Help me.

12
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,465
Please.

13
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,888
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,389
Please help.

15
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:39,933
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,012
Jungwook.

17
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,142
Jungwook is here.

18
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,226
Sir.

19
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,063
I won't be able to forget Jaeyoung.

20
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,486
My goodness.

21
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,656
My goodness.

22
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:44,080
When he was alive, he would cause
so much trouble with his drinking problem.

23
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,458
I didn't think he would die before me.

24
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,796
As for the matter of drunk driving,
I made sure word didn't get out.

25
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,965
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

26
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,593
Jaeyoung was like a son to me.

27
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,807
The thing is,

28
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,060
there's something about Jaeyoung's car.

29
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,981
The brake fluid line was pulled out.

30
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,525
Was there a problem with the car?

31
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,279
I don't think it was a simple accident.

32
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,615
I checked the surveillance cameras.

33
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,825
Before the accident,
a black car was following him.

34
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,998
Are you saying
that bastard killed Jaeyoung?

35
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,209
Who is he?

36
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,505
Who dared to kill my son?

37
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,882
I'm looking into it.

38
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,302
It isn't certain yet, so wait.

39
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,512
If I get my hands on that bastard…

40
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,117
Why did he pass away so soon?

41
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,205
My poor Jaeyoung.

42
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,128
What are you doing here?

43
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,257
I had to come when I heard the news.

44
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,343
You came to check if he's really dead?

45
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,972
How could you say that?

46
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,517
What happened to him?

47
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,228
- How did you know about his death?
- The alumni group chat.

48
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,563
Jaeyoung was on his way to Daejeon.

49
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,774
So you have a social life, huh?

50
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,738
- What did you do yesterday?
- I drove, worked,

51
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,324
- and ate out.
- It wasn't an accident.

52
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,618
Someone killed him.

53
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,788
A bastard in a black car.

54
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,165
Does that mean Jaeyoung…

55
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,587
Are you suspecting me?

56
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,551
Why would I do that? Huh?

57
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,136
Who knows?

58
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,513
A jerk with a messed up life
can do anything.

59
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,975
How about you? You sure you didn't do it?

60
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,352
Perhaps you wanted to keep him
from babbling about--

61
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,272
Shut up, you bastard.

62
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,399
How dare you?

63
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,987
What are you doing at a friend's funeral?

64
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,746
Kyungsoo, it's been a while.
Have you been well?

65
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,830
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,752
Kyungsoo, I was inattentive
after the incident.

67
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,881
- I'll do better from now on.
- Uh. Yes, sir.

68
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,507
All right then.

69
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,011
Always drive carefully.

70
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,929
Yes, sir.

71
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,098
By the way,

72
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,894
if you see a black car lurking around,

73
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,729
make sure you give me a call.

74
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,606
Yes, sir.

75
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,483
All right.

76
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,657
CRASH

77
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,075
THE LATE LEE HYUNSOO

78
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,953
EPISODE 7

79
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,469
You're here.

80
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,726
Did you bring those flowers?

81
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,938
No, they were already here when I arrived.

82
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,861
How is your wife doing?

83
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,989
She's the same.

84
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,410
And you? How is being a police officer?

85
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,912
I'm learning a lot, sir.

86
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,088
About that letter…

87
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,259
Did you find out who sent it?

88
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,304
No, not yet.

89
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,017
By any chance…

90
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,228
Do you know something?

91
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,482
No.

92
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,151
I just asked.

93
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,613
I was curious, that's all.

94
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,660
Let's go eat.

95
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,996
There's a nice sundubu place nearby.

96
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,664
Come with me.

97
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,756
My poor Jaeyoung.

98
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,555
How am I going to live?

99
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,897
Jaeyoung.

100
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,045
This is 112 Emergency Center.

101
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,757
<i>This is Route 78 to Seoul.</i>
<i>A car is parked on the road.</i>

102
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,301
<i>I think the driver fell asleep.
I'm worried an accident might happen.</i>

103
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,220
<i>Please do something.</i>

104
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,810
ROUTE 78

105
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,692
Why does she always make me carry
such a big bundle?

106
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,237
Gosh. There's more stuff every time.

107
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,321
Hello.

108
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,077
Do you know me?

109
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,246
Aren't you Detective Woo Donggi's father?

110
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,749
Have we met before?

111
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,294
No, you just resemble him a lot.

112
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,506
How do you know Donggi?

113
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,344
Well, I'm Detective Woo's colleague,
Eo Hyunkyung.

114
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,180
Oh, I see.

115
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,099
It's nice to meet you.

116
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,185
It must be hard to work with Donggi.

117
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,189
You see, unlike his looks,

118
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,482
he's quite difficult.

119
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,901
He gets his looks from me,

120
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,653
but his personality is

121
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,864
just like his mother.

122
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,742
Don't be ridiculous.
My personality is the same as yours.

123
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,911
Why did you bring so much? Give it to me.

124
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,542
- Your mom always makes me deliver things.
- Give it.

125
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,254
Must I always carry duvets and this bag

126
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,591
in order for you to give us a call
once in a while, you punk?

127
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,886
Why does she keep buying duvets? Does
she think I can't sleep without duvets?

128
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,889
How did you know that he was my father?

129
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,016
I'm sorry, but it's written on your faces.

130
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,977
Father and son.

131
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,270
It's written on my face?

132
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,773
Hey, hold on.

133
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,985
- Isn't this my hat?
- It's mine. Give it here.

134
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,613
- Give it here. Give it.
- Take the shiny one.

135
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,490
I don't want an old man's hat. It smells.

136
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:01,118
Give it here. It's mine. Gosh,
you ruined my hair.

137
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,579
There's no hair to ruin, you punk.

138
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,831
- Geez, seriously.
- It's as shiny as a dime in the sun.

139
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,249
For goodness' sake.

140
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,919
Wear this instead of a kid's hat.

141
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,630
- Come on, you punk.
- No. You wear it.

142
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,048
An old man's hat smells.

143
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,177
- Gosh, my hair. I need to go back inside.
- Goodness.

144
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,888
You always make a fuss
when you have no hair.

145
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:21,806
Get going.

146
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,184
- Give it here.
- See you around, okay?

147
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,644
Have a safe trip home, sir.

148
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,813
You're so pretty.

149
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,816
Hold on. Father.

150
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,402
Here. Take this.

151
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,696
- What's this?
- Take it. It's money.

152
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,532
- Is it money?
- Yes.

153
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,784
- Why is it so thin?
- They're 50,000 won bills.

154
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,747
My goodness.

155
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,166
They're really 50,000 won bills.

156
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,177
He's like your doppelgänger
in his looks, expressions and speech.

157
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,971
I guess his genes were strong.

158
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,472
Like two peas in a pod.

159
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,892
That's why I still don't eat peas.

160
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,647
Whenever I see same-looking things,
my heart drops.

161
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,692
Is he still in the freight business?

162
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,611
He quit last year.
His stamina isn't the same.

163
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:21,365
He runs errands for my mom,
gardens, and does household chores.

164
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,783
He's such a family man.

165
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,454
Despite his looks,
my father is very feminine and delicate.

166
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,706
Even his name is feminine.
It's Woo Gilsoon.

167
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,666
I can see Detective Woo's future.

168
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,877
Hey, take that back. Words have power.

169
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,591
Hyunkyung, who do you take after?
Is your mom a beauty?

170
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,011
- No.
- Then is your dad handsome?

171
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,847
- I don't take after anyone.
- That makes no sense.

172
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,475
They didn't pick you up on the streets.
Let's see a photo.

173
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,186
I don't like taking photos.

174
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,688
You're suspicious in many ways.

175
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,274
She doesn't have to tell us
if she doesn't want to, right?

176
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,528
Did you hear? Crimes Division and
Women's Division will get more recruits.

177
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,238
Yes, I heard.

178
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,741
Can't our team get more recruits too?

179
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,786
Probably not.
Inspector Cha joined recently.

180
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,204
That's right.

181
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,663
We have Inspector Cha. Where is he?

182
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,873
Why isn't he coming?

183
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,875
Is he the only one with flexible hours?

184
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,419
Is that it? What?

185
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,299
Yes, Superintendent.

186
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,552
I'm on my way.

187
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,931
There's a stationary car
in the middle of the road.

188
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,476
I'll call Inspector Cha.

189
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,355
Go.

190
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,649
- Seriously?
- Yes.

191
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,903
I got this information
from a subordinate at HQ.

192
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,948
You fed me false information
about Cha Yeonho

193
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,492
and made a complete fool out of me.

194
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,412
Do you know how hard my life is
after giving up my parking space?

195
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,914
I suffered so many losses.

196
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,875
But I'm certain this time.

197
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,086
- You sure? Did you double-check?
- Double--

198
00:13:59,004 --> 00:13:59,922
I triple-checked.

199
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,676
I see.

200
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,099
So someone in the Inspection Division
at HQ has a child at our station, huh?

201
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,308
That's right.

202
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,436
- Who is it?
- I don't know who it is.

203
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,397
Who is it? That's crucial information.

204
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,690
Who is it?

205
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,025
I don't know that yet, but it's true.

206
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,028
- For goodness' sake.
- All right.

207
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,113
But…

208
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,282
Trust me.

209
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,422
Here.

210
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,719
Sir.

211
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,724
Sir, wake up. Excuse me?

212
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,183
- Hyunkyung, open the door.
- Okay.

213
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,393
Did you call 911?

214
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,729
They're running late
due to morning traffic.

215
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,813
Okay.

216
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,653
- Ready?
- Yes.

217
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,572
I'll turn it. One, two.

218
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:12,912
It's working.

219
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,790
- A bit more. All right.
- One, two.

220
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,292
- It's working.
- One, two.

221
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,211
- Good. Open it.
- Oh, it worked.

222
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:23,923
Sir.

223
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,009
What should we do?

224
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,888
What do you think that is?

225
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,891
It looks like a machine part.
We'll need to send it to the NFS.

226
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,975
Oh, dear.

227
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,020
Hold on.

228
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,314
Yes, Inspector Cha.

229
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,442
<i>Hey, Min Sohee. This is Superintendent Ha
of Gangsan Police Station.</i>

230
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,237
Superintendent Ha,
why are you calling from this phone?

231
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,324
There's been
a car carrier trailer rollover,

232
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,742
so I'm at the scene.

233
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,621
A man keeps entering the scene,
claiming to be a police officer.

234
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,081
He doesn't have an ID.

235
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,541
Hey!

236
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,127
I told you not to enter!
Why won't you listen?

237
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,713
Get out!

238
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,759
<i>This is driving me crazy.</i>

239
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,136
Where are you?

240
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,429
STOP

241
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,390
- Oh, no.
- They're here.

242
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,684
My goodness.

243
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,811
Excuse me. Coming through.

244
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,105
Thank you.

245
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,608
Superintendent Ha.

246
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,444
- Hello.
- Hello.

247
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,197
Gosh, your skin is glowing.
Did you quit smoking?

248
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,242
Are you kidding me?
I just smoked one because of that punk.

249
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,995
Is he on your team?

250
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,457
Yes, he's Inspector Cha Yeonho.
He joined the team a few months ago.

251
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,335
Then why is he going around alone
without an ID?

252
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:48,924
Inspector Cha, didn't you bring your ID?
I told you to carry it with you.

253
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,926
In any case, take him with you.

254
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,847
What is he doing at our scene?
He keeps saying that something is missing.

255
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,931
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,100
Gosh, what happened here?

257
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,854
Isn't it obvious?
It's a rollover caused by an overload.

258
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,066
- Hey, hurry up and clean it up.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,068
We're blocking the road. Hurry up.

260
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:08,986
Inspector Cha.

261
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,032
It's rude to do this
at another team's scene.

262
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,451
It's a simple rollover.
What are you looking at?

263
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,536
Something doesn't seem right.

264
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,289
It needs to be here.

265
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,707
- Hey, Min Sohee.
- Yes?

266
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,292
- Hurry up and leave.
- Yes, sir.

267
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,626
Let's go. Hurry.

268
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,879
All right. Let's talk as we go.

269
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,255
Hurry up. Be careful.

270
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,090
Be careful. Watch out.

271
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,469
We're going. Thank you.

272
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,098
<i>On Route 78, near Gunae Tollgate,</i>

273
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,517
<i>a car carrier trailer rollover
caused injuries</i>

274
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,270
<i>and tens of millions of won worth
of damage.</i>

275
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,231
<i>This year alone,
there have been three cases of rollovers</i>

276
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,734
<i>resulting in five deaths.</i>

277
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,154
<i>The causes are illegal modifications
and overload.</i>

278
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,281
<i>A five-ton car carrier trailer</i>

279
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,785
<i>can only carry up to three cars
according to relevant regulations.</i>

280
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,746
<i>But this car carrier trailer
was carrying five cars.</i>

281
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:05,501
<i>In order to carry more cars in one trip,
the trailer had been illegally modified.</i>

282
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,546
<i>- What's the reason for the overload?
- Otherwise, there are no profits.</i>

283
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,715
<i>If the drivers say that it's illegal,</i>

284
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,801
<i>the company owners cut off work.</i>

285
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,260
- <i>We can't help it.</i>
- Gosh.

286
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,763
The driver who caused the accident
isn't at fault.

287
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,598
Seriously.

288
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,350
We have no power.

289
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,770
We must do as they say,
whether it be five or seven cars.

290
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,647
- Gosh.
- Everyone, be careful.

291
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,857
Insurance is of no use
in the case of a rollover.

292
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,692
Everyone knows that.

293
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,737
But we can't make any profits
if we follow regulations.

294
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,534
Seriously, it can't be helped.

295
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,870
<i>…and is threatening the safety</i>
<i>of our citizens on the road.</i>

296
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,167
Please come this way.

297
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,508
I did the basic inspection
as you requested

298
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,718
and changed the engine oil.

299
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,054
Would you like to take a look?

300
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,893
As you can see, nothing was amiss
from the engine and transmission.

301
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,148
Gosh, even a car checkup
uses data analysis these days.

302
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,733
The world changes
at an alarming speed, right?

303
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,236
Everything you requested is done.

304
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,239
- Please drive safely.
- Thank you. I'll take a look.

305
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,240
Yes, sir.

306
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,369
Inspector Cha, you're here.

307
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,663
- You have an appointment for 5 p.m.
- Yes.

308
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,417
- Hello.
- I didn't expect to see you here.

309
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,502
Do you two know each other?

310
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,549
I decided to start driving again.
I left my car here for maintenance.

311
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,928
I made a special effort
since it was your car, Inspector Cha.

312
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,180
You don't have to worry.

313
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,308
It's too bad that you won't need
a drive home from now on.

314
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,767
Right.

315
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,270
- Is that your car?
- Yes.

316
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,315
It's a nice car.

317
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,454
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

318
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,872
What is it?

319
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,790
It's a ratchet buckle.

320
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,834
It's used to secure the cargo
during transport.

321
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,921
If you look over here, it's a bit…

322
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,301
Someone cut it on purpose.

323
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,094
That's right.

324
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,556
If it broke on its own,
the cross section would've been smooth.

325
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,684
But it broke off in a pointed shape.

326
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,647
It means someone cut it on purpose
using a tool like a bolt cutter.

327
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,235
You already know this.
I heard you graduated from KAIST.

328
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,987
I'm also a fellow graduate.

329
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,364
I see.

330
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,533
What was the location of the accident?

331
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,620
Route 78, near Gunae Tollgate.

332
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,500
It isn't too far from the scene
of the car carrier rollover.

333
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,045
No way.

334
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,546
Excuse me.

335
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,897
So the metal piece stuck in
the deceased victim's neck

336
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,942
is from the trailer rollover
Inspector Cha witnessed.

337
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,822
We're certain it came
from the car carrier trailer.

338
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,241
It's a ratchet buckle, used to hold down--

339
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,410
- <i>Let's talk at the station.</i>
- Yes, sir.

340
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,546
So someone cut
the ratchet buckle on purpose.

341
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,758
Then it's a case, not an accident.

342
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,677
The dashcam had been formatted too.

343
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,055
The culprit erased it and turned it off
in case they were caught on camera.

344
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,933
The doors must've been locked.
How did he get in?

345
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,601
Maybe the driver did it.

346
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,062
There's a chance
he was after the insurance benefit.

347
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,941
A five-ton vehicle can only claim benefits
for the appropriate load.

348
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,361
Since the trailer was modified illegally
for overload,

349
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,697
insurance won't cover it.

350
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,533
Then who in the company
would benefit from this?

351
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,910
I know this since my father
was a freight driver.

352
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,539
An accident is bad news for the driver,
the freight owner and the company.

353
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,459
It's a loss for everyone.
It doesn't benefit anyone.

354
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,837
Then there's a high chance
that the cause is a personal grudge.

355
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,215
Let's interview people
the driver may know.

356
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,175
Okay.

357
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,428
What do you think you're doing?

358
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,055
Answer me.

359
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,767
Wipe this.

360
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,439
Do you have no morality?

361
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,359
How could you steal the case
without a word

362
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,694
in the middle of our investigation?

363
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,654
"Steal the case"?

364
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,240
We figured out
the possibility of a crime, so--

365
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,867
Forget about that crap.

366
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,952
Who has jurisdiction over this case?

367
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,537
We do.

368
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,499
If you wanted to investigate,
you should've consulted us first.

369
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,919
Why did you go through the dashcam
without telling us?

370
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,464
You thought it was an accident and
had the Investigation Section take over.

371
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,299
Wh-- What are you talking about?

372
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,636
We were running an investigation
thinking that it might be intentional.

373
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,012
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, sir.

374
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,431
In any case, we have jurisdiction over it.

375
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,517
Are you doing this because

376
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,770
what seemed to be a simple accident
became much bigger?

377
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,688
You just want to ride on our coattails.

378
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,066
What? How dare you say that?

379
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:25,487
- Hey, who's riding on whose coattails?
- Please sit. You sit down too.

380
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,993
Well…

381
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,997
Please calm down. How do we go about this?

382
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:40,585
According to page two, section nine
of the police's directives

383
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,131
on assigning jurisdiction over a case,

384
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,509
a case that has been reported
to two or more police stations

385
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,303
and is in need of a joint investigation

386
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,723
can be assigned by the chiefs
of the involved police stations

387
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:58,437
with the case's importance
and efficiency of investigation in mind.

388
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,398
That's the rule.

389
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,192
So it's up to the chiefs to decide

390
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,237
which police station
will take the case, right?

391
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,321
That's right.

392
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,699
Hold on.

393
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,662
Let's see.
Chief Seo of Gangsan Police Station.

394
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,504
Hello, Chief Seo.

395
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,966
It's been a while. Yes.

396
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:33,430
It's about the car carrier trailer case.
You heard, right?

397
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,599
Give us the case.

398
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,518
But… Wait, Chief.

399
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,814
Come on, why would you ask me that?

400
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:47,652
My guys have already made progress
with the investigation.

401
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,613
No, it isn't like that.

402
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:53,116
They were the ones who figured out
that it wasn't a simple accident.

403
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,369
Really? Okay. Let's do that.

404
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,747
Okay. All right.

405
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,209
Okay.

406
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,131
I'm going to use the restroom.

407
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,559
"My guys"?
Since when were we Chief's guys?

408
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,229
Rather than feeling touched,
I got the chills.

409
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,105
Why is Chief suddenly being like that?

410
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,941
He sided with his own subordinates.

411
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,735
Another station's good work
won't benefit him.

412
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,614
I get that, but his tone was strange.
He kept saying "my guys."

413
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,783
He was too affectionate. What an old fart.

414
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,076
I struggled with it too.

415
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,954
We have jurisdiction over it now,
so let's jump into the case.

416
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,748
Meet the car carrier trailer driver first.

417
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,542
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

418
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,266
I was very smooth just now, right?

419
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,685
Yes, you were quite natural.

420
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,438
There was a term for it.
Hold on. Don't tell me.

421
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,023
Hold on.

422
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,858
Cold on the outside, warm on the inside.

423
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,027
Right, exactly.

424
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,782
I think that should be
my character from now on.

425
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,951
- It won't be obvious.
- That's a good idea.

426
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,120
How did I do?

427
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,915
- What? What do you mean?
- Well…

428
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,335
"Page two, section three
of the police's directives."

429
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,004
Who has jurisdiction over the case?

430
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,215
I kept them on their toes
and tossed it to you at a crucial moment.

431
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,800
It was natural.

432
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:37,470
It was as precise as Beckham's pass.

433
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,972
Nice.

434
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,808
Do you know what kids call it these days?

435
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,394
Dragon and tiger's match?

436
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,688
We have good chemistry.

437
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,151
Nice! Hurrah for the perfect chemistry!

438
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,704
NAM JAEHOON

439
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,460
Can I help you?

440
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:12,213
We're the police.
We're here to see Mr. Nam Jaehoon.

441
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,424
- He was here just now.
- Lieutenant.

442
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,277
Where is that?

443
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,571
It's the rooftop.

444
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,824
Show me the cameras of the rooftop. Hurry.

445
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,523
Mr. Nam Jaehoon.

446
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,110
I'm a police officer.

447
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,998
Do you know
how many people visited me today?

448
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,712
Everyone is making a fuss

449
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,589
and demanding that I pay for the damage.

450
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,428
They're the ones who ordered me
to overload the trailer.

451
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,474
Now that there's been an accident,
they're feigning ignorance.

452
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,644
I'll lose my savings
for my kids' college tuition

453
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,147
and the security deposit for my house.

454
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:56,192
That alone is enough
to make me feel victimized and angry.

455
00:28:58,445 --> 00:28:59,446
But…

456
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,328
Apparently, someone died because of me.

457
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,040
He was hit by a buckle from my vehicle.

458
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,962
Please come down and talk.

459
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,719
I'm sorry.

460
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,806
I'm so very sorry.

461
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:36,566
But I can't bear
the outcome of my actions.

462
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,239
I have no courage to live. My goodness.

463
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,077
I just wanted to live diligently.

464
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,958
I don't know how this happened.

465
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,668
Dad!

466
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,007
What are you doing up here? I was worried.

467
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,427
Well,

468
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,682
I needed to have a conversation.
I came here to get some fresh air.

469
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,394
You should've put on a jacket.
What if you catch a cold?

470
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,065
Let's go.

471
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,527
See you around.

472
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,242
Let's go.

473
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,540
SEOUL METROPOLITAN POLICE

474
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,595
COMMISSIONER GENERAL
PYO MYUNGHAK

475
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,252
How nice.

476
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,172
<i>I'm Commissioner General Kim Junghak.</i>

477
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,010
<i>The government has assigned</i>

<i>Deputy Commissioner Pyo Myunghak

479
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,183
<i>The new Commissioner General</i>

<i>has worked in the police force
for about 30 years</i>

483
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,071
<i>He's an excellent expert
in police investigation.</i>

484
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,783
Someone cut the belt?

485
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,330
Is there anyone you're suspicious of?
Someone who'd do that to you.

486
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,834
No, not at all. That means…

487
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,713
I didn't kill someone, right?

488
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,301
We're still investigating,
but there's a possibility of a crime.

489
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,516
Oh, my. Thank God.

490
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,692
Mr. Nam Jaehoon,
where was the trailer loaded?

491
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,277
A used car dealership in Incheon.

492
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,197
Did you stop anywhere?

493
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,493
Uh, I had to unload the trailer
the next day,

494
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,579
so I stopped by a rest area
and slept there.

495
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,039
I hit the road early morning.

496
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,249
Where was the rest area?

497
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,503
- Sangsan Rest Area.
- Sangsan Rest Area.

498
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,672
Did anything happen there?

499
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,716
Nothing in particular…

500
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,558
Could it be that punk?

501
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:15,368
<i>A man got in a car that was
on the trailer, so I was startled.</i>

502
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,995
Hey! Hey, you!

503
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,790
Who are you? Get out, you punk!

504
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,626
Get out! What do you think you're doing?

505
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,129
Will you take responsibility
if the car gets damaged? Huh?

506
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,382
Don't be so dramatic.
I was just taking a look.

507
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,135
You crazy bastard! For goodness' sake.

508
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,929
Do you think you're
at a car dealership? Huh?

509
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,514
How dare you?

510
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,598
Did you just hit me?

511
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,393
- Yes, I did.
- Hit me more. Hit me!

512
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,187
<i>We got into a little fight.</i>

513
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,077
Mr. Cho Ikhwan?

514
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,538
Who are you?

515
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,877
Mr. Cho Ikhwan, where were you
around 11 p.m. on the 15th?

516
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,921
It really wasn't me.
Why would I do such a thing?

517
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,466
You got in a car that was on a trailer.

518
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,509
You had a go with the driver.

519
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,804
That only happened
because that punk ran his mouth.

520
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:21,851
Tell us where you were
around 11 p.m. that night.

521
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,814
I think I was in the dormitory.

522
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:36,365
At 11:40 p.m., this was caught
on the dormitory surveillance camera.

523
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,744
Mr. Cho Ikhwan, isn't that you?

524
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,290
You went out then
and returned around 4 a.m.

525
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,960
Mr. Cho, tell us honestly.

526
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:51,964
After you left the dormitory,
where did you go and what did you do?

527
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,931
Mr. Cho Ikhwan, tell us.

528
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,182
I…

529
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,644
He was with me!

530
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,151
We went out for a drive.

531
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:16,531
He said he'd take me to the sea
since he got a new car.

532
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,826
For goodness' sake, are you insane?

533
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,203
How could you date such a lunatic?

534
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,871
What was that?

535
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,082
A lunatic?

536
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,006
- <i>Eunju.</i>
<i>- Yes?</i>

537
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,175
<i>Tell me whenever you feel frustrated.</i>

538
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,969
<i>Let's go see the sea again.</i>

539
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,178
<i>Really?</i>

540
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,890
- <i>Let's go to the East Sea next.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

541
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,060
<i>Hey, there's something
I wanted to ask you.</i>

542
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,396
<i>Do I like you?</i>

543
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,898
<i>Don't be ridiculous.</i>

544
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,316
<i>Eunju.</i>

545
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,987
All right.

546
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,492
Okay. We verified your claim.

547
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,286
Thank you for your cooperation.

548
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,663
- By the way…
- Yes?

549
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,374
…while we were doing that--

550
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,839
Oh, sure. What happened?

551
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,716
I saw a suspicious man.

552
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,093
Suspicious?

553
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,763
- Eunju.
- Yes?

554
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,224
I can promise you this.

555
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:29,645
I'll help you cross all obstacles
with this car.

556
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,063
Ikhwan.

557
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,245
<i>A cutter?</i>

558
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,998
Yes. It looked like long scissors.

559
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,126
- A bolt cutter.
- A bolt-- Yes, that thing.

560
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,963
Were there any other characteristics?

561
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:00,593
He was a man of average height
wearing a black jacket and a green hat.

562
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,136
That's right. It was green.

563
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,263
Are you certain it was green?

564
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,724
Yes.

565
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:09,560
Did you see him again afterward?

566
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,978
A moment later,

567
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,147
he went that way.

568
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,358
What's that?

569
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:25,701
The Korea Transportation Safety Authority
built a rest area to prevent accidents.

570
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,204
- It's free for all truck drivers.
- I see.

571
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,167
Do all truck drivers fill out
this entry register here?

572
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,711
It isn't mandatory,
but we use it to get a count.

573
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,130
I ask them to fill it out,

574
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,050
but many drivers can't be bothered.

575
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,427
We'd like to check
the surveillance camera.

576
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,513
That one? It's broken.

577
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,599
No one checks it, so we never fixed it.

578
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,851
May we check inside?

579
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,019
I can't let you do that.

580
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,398
Some people walk around naked
since there's a bath.

581
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,817
I'll check the inside.

582
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,777
Okay then. I'll look over this.

583
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,903
Thank you.

584
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,077
Come on.

585
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,038
- For goodness' sake.
- Come on.

586
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,498
I told you to do that.

587
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,250
That's just wrong.

588
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,877
- Hey.
- Hurry up.

589
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,297
It's your turn.

590
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,560
Excuse me.

591
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,896
Are there no keys for these lockers?

592
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,483
There's no such thing.
What is there to steal?

593
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,371
The locker room had no keys.

594
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,374
It seems like the culprit took the keys
and committed the crime

595
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,419
while Nam Jaehoon was taking a shower.

596
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,546
He formatted the dashcam then.

597
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,382
- Then he put the keys back?
- Yes.

598
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,801
It must be a personal grudge,

599
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,096
but Mr. Nam doesn't know anyone
who wore a green hat.

600
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,931
He can't think of anyone either.

601
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,268
Since he used the truck lounge,
he must be a fellow truck driver.

602
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,272
We can't make a hasty conclusion
since anyone can enter the lounge.

603
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,900
Were there surveillance cameras?

604
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,986
The one near the entrance was broken.

605
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,613
Where will we find clues then?

606
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,824
If he used the lounge,
someone must remember him.

607
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,910
A black jacket and a green hat.

608
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:35,039
Some people filled out the entry register.
We'll meet them first.

609
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:39,001
We'll also check surveillance cameras
in the rest area for a green hat.

610
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,797
Tomorrow will be a busy day.

611
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:52,056
Jungwook has adjusted
to the company very quickly.

612
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,684
He takes after you,
so he has command over people too.

613
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,938
Gosh, I know my own son.

614
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,565
You don't need to sugarcoat things.

615
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,736
Just make sure he works quietly
without causing any trouble.

616
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,489
Of course. Don't worry.

617
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,703
- Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.
- Okay.

618
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,332
Young man, take good care of your pipe.

619
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,724
- Myunghak.
- Yes?

620
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,227
I found this

621
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,980
on Jaeyoung's desk.

622
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,944
LATE-NIGHT DRIVER HITS NEWLYWEDS
RESULTING IN THEIR DEATH

623
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,285
I know.

624
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,371
Jungwook and I received it too.

625
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,375
What kind of jerk sent this
to the Commissioner General?

626
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,377
What happened in Daejeon

627
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,172
should be smoothed over once again.

628
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,632
There was Jaeyoung's accident too.

629
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,093
I don't think this will be the end of it.

630
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,223
Do you mean

631
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,185
that the one who sent this…

632
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,147
This punk even entered
the Seoul Metropolitan Police.

633
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,858
There's a possibility
that he is in the police force.

634
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,195
Didn't the dead girl have family?

635
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:35,201
Her husband received surgery
and moved to the US.

636
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,161
He passed away not too long after.

637
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,079
Her father--

638
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,333
- That's right. Lee Jungsub.
- Yes.

639
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,378
He was a police officer too.

640
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,714
And he's close to Jung Chaeman.

641
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:53,093
What annoys me the most is…

642
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,015
that Cha Yeonho is
currently in Jung Chaeman's team.

643
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,436
Did the two of them find something out?

644
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,524
Otherwise, why would the two of them
be together?

645
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,487
I'll give Jaeyoung's case to Jung Chaeman.

646
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,906
Why would you do that?

647
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:17,910
Keeping the suspicious ones nearby
puts me at ease.

648
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,830
The investigation reports will
make it easy to find out where he went.

649
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,500
If he does anything suspicious,

650
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,627
I'll be able to sack him easily.

651
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,548
So you won't have to lift a finger.

652
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,550
You don't disappoint.

653
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,595
Myunghak, leave the cleanup to me.

654
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,099
You are now a man of prominence,
so you shouldn't get your hands dirty.

655
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:46,522
The final blow shall be carried out by me,
Jaeyoung's father.

656
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,447
That way.

657
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,167
Excuse me. You must be checking the tires.

658
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,586
Yes.

659
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,505
I moved the tires and put air into them.

660
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,340
I think the pressure is too high.

661
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,218
If the tires are overinflated,
they can burst due to road heat.

662
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,429
I see. You're very thorough.

663
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,139
If every driver is like you,

664
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:22,182
there won't be any traffic accidents.

665
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:26,103
You look quite young.
You must've started working early.

666
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:30,232
I followed my father's footsteps
and got into this business.

667
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,736
My father is a freight driver too.
I always followed him as a kid.

668
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:35,154
Same here.

669
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:38,741
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes.

670
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,409
You make a good first impression.

671
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:43,037
You're so friendly,
like I've met you somewhere.

672
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,914
I get that a lot.

673
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,460
Did you have something to say to me?

674
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,755
You came to the lounge on the 15th.

675
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,424
Did you see anyone in a green hat?

676
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:58,052
Perhaps he was carrying a bolt cutter.

677
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,928
I'm not sure.

678
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,222
Both hats and bolt cutters
are common here.

679
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,517
Do you know Nam Jaehoon by any chance?

680
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,771
Well, I don't recognize the name.

681
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,314
Here's a photo.

682
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,361
- What? He…
- Do you know him?

683
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,237
I saw him at the lounge that day.

684
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,156
That's right. You have a good memory.

685
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:23,661
A fight broke out in the lounge that day.

686
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,954
A fight? Was Nam Jaehoon involved?

687
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,998
Yes. It wasn't anything serious.

688
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,252
Excuse me. You're splashing
shampoo. Please be careful.

689
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,715
Goodness gracious. These things happen.

690
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,634
That's no way for a youngster to talk.

691
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,263
You won't get treated
as an adult if you behave that way.

692
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,393
What? What did you say, you punk?

693
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,270
- What?
- "What"? For goodness' sake.

694
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,981
Don't splash shampoo, okay?

695
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,442
You're so petty
despite your rough looks.

696
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,277
Wash up quietly, okay?

697
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:03,659
Come to think of it,
he was wearing a green hat.

698
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,078
What? Did you see his face?

699
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,580
- Was it someone you know?
- No.

700
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:12,209
But I saw him at the lounge earlier today.

701
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,335
Today?

702
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:21,760
Do you remember the seolleongtang place
we often went to in Daejeon?

703
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:26,682
The owner always added
a piece of ox knee as a service.

704
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:30,018
But I ate yours since you didn't like it.

705
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,772
I heard about your promotion.
Congratulations.

706
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,275
I somehow ended up reaching this position.

707
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,193
Thank you.

708
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,405
I'm on duty.

709
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,616
You haven't changed.

710
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:53,292
I've always thought you were difficult.

711
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,503
How should I put it?
You're always very sharp like a knife.

712
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,298
It's a must for a police officer.

713
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,799
There are many things to cut.

714
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,555
Are you still mad at me?

715
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,349
I thought I cleared up
our misunderstanding.

716
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,854
Did you call me over
to talk about the past?

717
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,525
Okay then.

718
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,947
- What is it?
- Take over a case.

719
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,700
It's a traffic accident,
but it could be murder.

720
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,745
Why should I?

721
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,498
Why?
It's your job to investigate.

722
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,292
This is your specialty, isn't it?

723
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:43,300
Why? Is there a reason you can't do it?

724
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,610
ROUTE ONE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT
FROM SEOUL TO DAEJEON

725
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:10,744
YANG JAEYOUNG'S CAR
BEFORE AND AFTER THE ACCIDENT

726
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:35,394
Yes, I did visit the lounge that day.

727
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,939
But around 4 a.m.,

728
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,400
I was sleeping in the lounge.

729
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,484
I see.

730
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:47,239
Okay. Thank you for your cooperation.

731
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:51,910
By the way, is this about
the car carrier trailer accident?

732
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,538
I know Jaehoon.

733
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,622
Is that so?

734
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:00,419
Did someone cut the belt on purpose?

735
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,797
Nothing has been confirmed yet.

736
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,303
How strange.

737
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:10,762
What do you mean?

738
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:15,267
A few months ago, a friend of mine
caused a car carrier trailer accident.

739
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,352
He said the accident occurred

740
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:22,441
even though he had fastened the belt
and secured the parking brake.

741
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,484
He felt so victimized.

742
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,488
When he tried to check,
the dashcam was turned off.

743
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,370
Please excuse me.

744
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,624
Yes, Detective Woo.

745
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,419
When did it occur?

746
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,798
Let me think.

747
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,636
When did it occur?

748
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,973
I'm checking the lounge
with Mr. Seo Dongwoo.

749
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,975
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>I'll send Inspector Cha there.</i>

750
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,977
<i>He might've left the lounge,</i>

751
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,146
so tell Hyunkyung to check the cameras.

752
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,689
- <i>Okay.</i>
- All right.

753
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,691
What happened?

754
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,779
You need to go to the lounge. Someone saw
the suspect in a green hat there.

755
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,030
Okay.

756
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,576
Nam Jaehoon.

757
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,080
That's right.

758
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,749
That did happen during the shower.

759
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,834
- <i>What about it?</i>
- Do you know him?

760
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:26,171
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Who is he? Do you have a photo?

761
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,768
That way.

762
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,157
<i>Han Kyungsoo.</i>

763
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,543
Mr. Han Kyungsoo.

764
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,841
It's you, right?

765
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,511
What are you doing here?

766
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:15,971
It's been a while.

767
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,515
You must remember me.

768
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,437
I don't think it has been a while.

769
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,814
I saw you at Jaeyoung's funeral.

770
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,905
You were there, right?

771
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,326
- How did Mr. Yang Jaeyoung--
- Did you come to see me?

772
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,288
Why?

773
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,249
No, it isn't like that--

774
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,715
Mr. Han Kyungsoo.

775
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,219
<i>It wasn't an accident. Someone killed him.</i>

776
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,055
A bastard in a black car.

777
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,197
Mister, what's wrong? Are you okay?

778
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,583
Lieutenant, I think
Inspector Cha found him.

779
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,709
He's at the parking lot.

780
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:32,005
Mr. Han Kyungsoo, are you okay?

781
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,759
Did you cause Jaeyoung's accident?

782
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,469
What do you mean?

783
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,054
Did you kill Jaeyoung?

784
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,641
- What do you mean by that?
- No, don't touch me.

785
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,643
Don't come near me.

786
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:45,852
Listen.

787
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,814
I'm different from Jaeyoung.

788
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,695
I won't become a victim so easily!

789
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,446
Han Kyungsoo!

790
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,827
Han Kyungsoo, stop!

791
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,026
Inspector Cha, he's the suspect
we were looking for.

792
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,695
The man who was with you. Get in!

793
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,935
For goodness' sake!

794
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:53,063
Gosh! Why did he appear? Why?

795
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,615
Is Han Kyungsoo a suspect?

796
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,368
Wasn't that why
the two of you were together?

797
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,203
No.

798
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,121
Uh-- Then why were you two…

799
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,874
Do you know him?

800
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,379
We're not close, but I know him.

801
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,799
Let's talk later.

802
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,305
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

803
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,682
Do you want to get out?

804
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,809
No, there's no time for that.

805
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,575
There it is.

806
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,802
License plate, 5428.5428.

807
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,971
Pull over, 5428.

808
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,436
- Hey, Hyunkyung.
<i>- Lieutenant, where are you?</i>

809
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,688
We're close to getting him.

810
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,815
- It's dangerous. Get out of there.
- What?

811
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,109
Someone cut the ratchet buckle
of the trailer.

812
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,819
That trailer is the next target!

813
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:23,737
What?

814
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,748
What? What's going on?

815
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,085
What's going on?
Why isn't the brake working?

816
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,349
What's going on?

817
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,856
Damn it!

818
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,455
Stop the car, 5428.

819
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,838
Stop, 5428. Pull over.

820
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:26,674
It isn't working.

821
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:55,453
What?

822
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,929
Damn it!

823
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,227
A wanted vehicle, 5428,
is passing Sangseon Interchange.

824
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,549
CRASH

825
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,461
What if there's another victim?

826
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:29,088
There's something that comes to mind.

827
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,673
Wasn't it your doing?

828
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:34,385
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>the accident and the letter are connected?</i>

829
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,638
<i>Is the investigation difficult</i>

830
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,182
or are personal feelings clouding
your judgments?

831
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,183
I need money.

832
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:43,353
<i>It's either I get killed like Jaeyoung
or die hungry.</i>

833
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,395
Nothing can stop me.

834
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,356
<i>We'll teach them not to act up.</i>

835
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,191
<i>The two are in the same location.</i>

836
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,401
<i>Father, please pick up the phone!</i>

837
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,907
PEOPLE OF THE POLICE STATION

838
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,618
Modern dramas and movies

839
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:03,873
often depict a used car dealer
who is involved in various crimes.

840
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,836
But in real life,
"illegal" used car dealers…

841
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,213
COMMISSIONER GENERAL
PYO MYUNGHAK

842
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,923
…are very few in number.

843
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,466
You know that, right?

844
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:18,513
There was a time when
scam deals and fraudulent reports

845
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:22,850
were pretty rampant
in used car dealerships.

846
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:28,773
However, tips on purchasing used cars
without getting scammed

847
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:30,567
have spread on social media.

848
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,736
Consumers are becoming smarter by the day,

849
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:38,408
and used car dealers
are actively revealing car records.

850
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:41,744
Such efforts continue to be made.

851
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:46,124
Perhaps that is the reason
that crimes involving used cars

852
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:48,626
are on the decline.

853
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,379
So, if you developed

854
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:54,299
prejudices regarding
the used car business by any chance,

855
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:57,260
please set aside your misunderstanding.

856
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:04,017
Recently, big companies in Korea
have entered the used car industry.

857
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,980
There's an expectation
for more transparency in the market.

858
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:14,736
Now, the breeding ground of crimes
you see in TV series

859
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,114
will be gone for good.

860
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:24,454
The police will be with you
along the journey.
