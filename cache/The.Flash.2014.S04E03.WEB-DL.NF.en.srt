I call quantum entanglement.

292
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,639
Discrete quantum particles
are connected,

00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,974

they simulate a synchronicity

296
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,523
- So if Becky can affect
the particles around her

297
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,232
in a positive way,
then their connected particles

298

start spinning negatively.
