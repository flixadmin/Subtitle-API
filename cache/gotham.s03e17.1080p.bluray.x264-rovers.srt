1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,832
- Previously on Gotham...
- You have five minutes, quiz kids.

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:06,819
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill,

3
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:10,496
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

4
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:12,925
A weapon is en route
to destroy the city.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,926
I can't take on Nygma and Barbara

6
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:17,463
and the rest of them by myself.

7
00:00:17,498 --> 00:00:18,797
Said you wanted to build an army, right?

8
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,500
What about an army of freaks?

9
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:22,835
Who ordered the hit on my father?

10
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,136
Frank Gordon.

11
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:26,605
- Your uncle.
- You have the right to remain silent.

12
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:30,809
Dock 9C.

13
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:32,277
It's where the weapon will be arriving.

14
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:34,580
Jim, do I hear a favor coming on?

15
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:37,249
What is coming into

16
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:39,084
Dock 9C?

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,919
Now I know who I am...

18
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:42,221
I'm the Riddler.

19
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:44,323
It's good to see you, too.

20
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:46,091
How'd things go with Selina?

21
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:48,494
This... is what I was made for.

22
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:49,828
The clone is in place.

23
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:51,363
Good evening, Alfred.

24
00:00:51,694 --> 00:00:53,098
And to you, Master Bruce.

25
00:00:53,134 --> 00:00:54,767
You need to join the Court of Owls, Jim.

26
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:56,602
A woman named Kathryn is going to call.

27
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:58,037
He would have been so proud of you.

28
00:00:58,072 --> 00:00:59,901
No!

29
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:02,775
Kathryn, I presume.

30
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,209
I killed my uncle.

31
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:05,511
I make no apologies for it.

32
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:06,872
Maybe it's time we meet.

33
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:08,982
My thought exactly.

34
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:38,477
Hello?!

35
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:40,345
Anyone home?

36
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,408
When this guy gets home, we got
to ask him to kick on the heat.

37
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:45,939
It's colder in here
than it is out there.

38
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,090
Fascinating.

39
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:53,348
I know you're hell-bent
on getting revenge

40
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:54,512
on Nygma and all,

41
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:57,576
and forming an army of freaks
is a great plan, I mean,

42
00:01:57,662 --> 00:01:58,931
it was my idea, but...

43
00:01:58,966 --> 00:02:01,086
Shh! Quiet.

44
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:02,992
I think I hear something.

45
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:05,078
Do you think it's him?

46
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:16,855
Mr. Fries.

47
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:20,062
Welcome home.

48
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:25,767
I see you still hold me responsible

49
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:29,068
for all of that awful monster rhetoric
I spewed during my campaign.

50
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:31,249
You ran people like me out of Gotham.

51
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:33,298
We both know I only said those things

52
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:36,200
because that's
what the voters wanted to hear.

53
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:39,427
Your experiments, Mr. Fries.

54
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:42,669
You're trying to reverse
your condition, aren't you?

55
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:44,450
I can help you.

56
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,271
And why would you do that?

57
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:48,566
My enemies took everything from me.

58
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:50,449
Tried to murder me.

59
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,136
You help me get my revenge,

60
00:02:53,402 --> 00:02:55,261
and when I take back
my throne, I will give you

61
00:02:55,332 --> 00:02:58,487
every resource you need to free
yourself from this icy prison.

62
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:03,792
Even if I wanted to say yes,

63
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,243
I can only survive
a few hours outside the cold

64
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:07,733
without my suit.

65
00:03:08,462 --> 00:03:11,421
And you don't have it
because it's been locked away

66
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:15,362
in a Wayne Enterprises black site
ever since you escaped Indian Hill.

67
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:18,320
Ivy?

68
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,851
Oh.

69
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:23,473
Ta-da.

70
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:24,616
My suit.

71
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,363
So, Mr. Fries, will you join us?

72
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:52,110
Where are we?

73
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:54,988
Where we are is not important, James.

74
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:58,175
What matters is why you're here.

75
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:00,316
You know why I killed my uncle.

76
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:01,987
Yes, I do.

77
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,583
Frank murdered your father.

78
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:09,239
What I need to know is if you hold
us accountable for his action.

79
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:11,129
Frank acted alone.

80
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,604
He admitted as much to me.

81
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:15,440
Good.

82
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:17,691
Then we can proceed.

83
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:22,159
The city needs you now
more than ever, James.

84
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:24,765
There's turmoil ahead,

85
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,951
and good men like you
are going to be needed

86
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,373
to hold it together.

87
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:30,055
But make no mistake,

88
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:34,364
the Court, and the Court alone,
can save Gotham.

89
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:36,922
So what do you want me to do?

90
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:39,791
Prove your loyalty to the Court.

91
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,019
Killing my uncle wasn't enough?

92
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:44,731
That was between you and Frank.

93
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,865
It had nothing to do with us.

94
00:04:48,428 --> 00:04:50,903
When the time is right,
we will call upon you.

95
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:54,773
And Frank's body?
It's still in the brownstone.

96
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:57,165
We've already taken care of it.

97
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,813
- Who's the stiff?
- Jim's uncle, Frank Gordon.

98
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:05,083
Never met him.

99
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:06,385
They were estranged.

100
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,786
Have you seen Jim?

101
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:09,521
He's working a case.

102
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:12,261
Or he's walking in the door as we speak.

103
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:15,527
Hey, Jim. Come in, we, uh,
have some bad news for you.

104
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:17,625
What's going on?

105
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,152
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,406
We found your uncle's body this morning.

107
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:24,903
He was pulled out of the harbor.

108
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,169
I did my prelim.

109
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,927
The burns on his left temple
suggest he was shot at close range.

110
00:05:29,005 --> 00:05:30,451
Lab is running ballistics.

111
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:33,245
You saw him at the cemetery yesterday.
He seemed on edge.

112
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,100
Did he say anything?

113
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:36,889
No. He, uh,

114
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:38,772
just stopped by to pay his respects.

115
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,086
We didn't talk much.

116
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:43,977
Thanks, Lee. I'll take it from here.

117
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:45,757
That's it? That's your reaction?

118
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:47,592
What do you want me to say?

119
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,829
I know you.

120
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,613
You're hiding something.

121
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:54,223
- You know something.
- Lee, come on.

122
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:55,838
The man just lost his uncle.

123
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,813
Yeah, Harvey, you just
keep covering for him.

124
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,471
My condolences.

125
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:06,198
She's right. You do know
something, don't you?

126
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:08,129
Uncle Frank shot himself.

127
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:11,116
Said it was the only way
to get me inside the Court.

128
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:14,252
- Did it work?
- I met with a woman named Kathryn.

129
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:17,923
She says I have to prove
my loyalty to the Court first.

130
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:21,031
Look, I see the need
for playing it cool.

131
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,161
But right now,
the Court's readying a weapon

132
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:24,429
that could destroy the city.

133
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:27,299
We don't have time to sit
on our thumbs and do nothing.

134
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:29,773
I don't like it any more than
you do, but if I push too hard,

135
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:32,078
we might blow the only chance
we have at stopping this.

136
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,473
And Uncle Frank will have died in vain.

137
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:37,664
Okay, so what do we do now?

138
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:41,279
Kathryn said to get back to work.
Keep up appearances.

139
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:43,170
That shouldn't be too hard.

140
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:45,349
- Look who resurfaced.
- _

141
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:50,549
Hello?

142
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:52,682
Ed?

143
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,033
It's Barbara.

144
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:58,057
Your old friend you've been blowing off.

145
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,126
I'll allow you to call me Ed

146
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:04,110
'cause we have history.

147
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:06,095
But my name...

148
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:09,374
is the Riddler.

149
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:11,710
So the headlines say.

150
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:14,180
Now, why are you here?

151
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:16,564
When Penguin was mayor,

152
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,658
did he mention a mysterious group?

153
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:21,081
One that controlled
the levers of power in Gotham

154
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:23,989
from the shadows with total impunity?

155
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:26,992
- No.
- See, I didn't claw my way to the top

156
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,192
only to find out
there was someone above me.

157
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:31,528
I've been trying to find out
who they are,

158
00:07:31,614 --> 00:07:35,012
but no one in this town seems
to know anything about them.

159
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:36,601
And how is it that you know about them?

160
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:39,524
Jim Gordon put me onto them.

161
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,258
And what is his interest in all this?

162
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:43,231
He didn't say.

163
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:47,168
But he did ask me
to investigate a shipment

164
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,141
coming into Dock 9C yesterday.

165
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,867
The harbormaster was protecting
a crate from Indian Hill.

166
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:55,913
- What was inside?
- I don't know.

167
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:58,803
Before I got a chance to
find out, some masked assassin

168
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,625
slaughtered half my men.

169
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,295
What do you know?

170
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:06,187
When I was at Indian Hill,

171
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:11,233
Professor Strange hinted at
some powerful, secret group,

172
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:12,795
but he didn't tell me who they were.

173
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,009
This is the one riddle that got away.

174
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,860
I will...

175
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:24,672
get you the answer you seek.

176
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,571
But I will do it in my own way.

177
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:30,889
You're gonna make a big
production of this, aren't you?

178
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:33,727
Only someone with power and connections

179
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,626
would have information on this group.

180
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:38,196
I need to speak with Gotham's elite.

181
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:40,976
And nothing brings out
the bourgeoisie quite like

182
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:43,561
opening night at the theater.

183
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:46,256
Where wilt thou lead me?

184
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:48,639
Speak,

185
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,362
for I will go no further.

186
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:02,103
I say, Ghost,

187
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:04,830
speak your business

188
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:09,033
or I shall go no further!

189
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:10,962
My business

190
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:13,652
is not with you, Prince of Denmark.

191
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,918
But with your audience.

192
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,331
I've come to address you,

193
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:28,269
the ruling class of Gotham.

194
00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:32,105
You've kept a secret for far too long.

195
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,198
But tonight

196
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:37,862
I will kidnap and torture one of you

197
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:39,425
to expose the truth.

198
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:42,995
So, spread the word to all your friends,

199
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:46,164
the Riddler is coming.

200
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,570
Also, I found your performance
to be wooden

201
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:54,502
and unrealistic.

202
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,197
And scene.

203
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,664
And that, my old mucker,

204
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:24,578
is checkmate.

205
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:30,131
Good game, Alfred.

206
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:33,293
You let me win, didn't you,
Master Bruce?

207
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:36,130
- No way, Alfred.
- No way, my foot.

208
00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:38,699
That's very unlike you, isn't it?

209
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:40,501
And to be honest, I mean,

210
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:42,903
you haven't been yourself
these past few days, have you?

211
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:45,139
I don't know what you're talking about.

212
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:47,863
I think you do know what
I'm talking about, so come on.

213
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:52,880
Out with it.

214
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:56,812
The other day when I came home,

215
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,585
you asked how things were with Selina.

216
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:01,388
I made it sound like
things were hopeful.

217
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:04,752
I lied.

218
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:07,736
She said she never wanted
to see me again.

219
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,696
I was embarrassed.

220
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,754
I was afraid you'd...

221
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:14,950
ask me about seeing Selina,
and I'd lie and...

222
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:18,221
I just didn't want to talk about it.

223
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,157
Well, then... I understand, Master B.

224
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:26,313
And thank you very much
for being so candid.

225
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:30,784
And I really wouldn't worry
about Ms. Kyle.

226
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:35,088
You know, time has a way
of sorting these things out,

227
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:36,022
doesn't it?

228
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:41,249
Talking of which,
I should check on the dinner.

229
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,042
Alfred.

230
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,765
Sir?

231
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:48,302
Thank you.

232
00:11:50,422 --> 00:11:52,336
You're a good friend.

233
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:55,218
Glad to hear it, sir.

234
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,070
It's me.

235
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,468
It's happening again.

236
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:28,227
Hey.

237
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:31,376
So, the audience has been accounted for.

238
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:33,766
Uh, is this Hamlet?

239
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:36,283
I guess he wasn't meant to be.

240
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:39,286
You crossed paths with Nygma recently.

241
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:41,544
Any idea what this secret is
he's talking about?

242
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:43,023
No, I have no clue.

243
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:44,524
My guess is he just made it up.

244
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,793
Captain, we got the all clear.

245
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:48,245
All right.

246
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:05,763
This is all that's in there.

247
00:13:13,922 --> 00:13:15,222
It's a riddle.

248
00:13:15,257 --> 00:13:16,558
Shocker.

249
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:20,354
Written in iambic pentameter
like a Shakespearean sonnet.

250
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:23,376
"I am a man who holds a high position,

251
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:25,999
"Who shows two faces
to all those he rules,

252
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:29,571
"A fraud, criminal,
and sometime politician.

253
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:33,189
Gotham, my constituency of fools."

254
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:35,676
A two-faced politician

255
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:38,525
- whose constituency is Gotham.
- The mayor?

256
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:42,368
"Fraud, criminal" sounds
like he's describing Penguin,

257
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:44,196
but that doesn't make any sense.

258
00:13:44,343 --> 00:13:46,665
Ed told Lucius he killed Penguin.

259
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,368
Aubrey James.

260
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,859
He was recently reinstated
and he's been mayor before.

261
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:53,560
"Sometime politician,"
but why not just grab him?

262
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,195
Why tell us in advance?

263
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,663
Because Nygma wants to make a show of it

264
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,265
and make us look bad in the process.

265
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,860
Call the mayor's office.
Tell him we're on our way.

266
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:09,843
We don't need Nygma for anything.
He should be dead by now.

267
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:13,580
He's obsessed with finding the answer,
which is an easy solution for us.

268
00:14:13,637 --> 00:14:15,902
Once he does, we'll get rid of him.

269
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:17,117
I promise.

270
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,125
And how's him causing a scene
at the theater help us?

271
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:22,093
It doesn't.

272
00:14:22,609 --> 00:14:24,148
But it does help me more

273
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:27,789
fully announce myself
on the Gotham stage.

274
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,115
If you'll forgive the pun.

275
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,631
Do you want to become famous?

276
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:33,342
Try dying.

277
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:36,584
- I can help you with that.
- Okay, that's enough.

278
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:39,470
What actually is your plan?

279
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:42,693
Kidnap Mayor James.

280
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,277
The man ran this place for ten years.

281
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:49,578
If anyone knows about this
mysterious group, he does.

282
00:14:49,603 --> 00:14:51,172
You could've just said that.

283
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,203
I could've had him here, being tortured.

284
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:56,703
Okay. See, but first
I had to tell the GCPD

285
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:58,297
what I was going to do.

286
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:01,532
How else am I supposed to properly
embarrass them publicly?

287
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:04,649
My crimes must live up to my name,

288
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,143
and this is no exception.

289
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:08,807
And what if the mayor doesn't know
anything about this group?

290
00:15:08,887 --> 00:15:11,190
Hmm? What then?

291
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:12,756
I have a plan B to smoke them out,

292
00:15:12,863 --> 00:15:16,927
but first... I need something from you.

293
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:19,832
There's a biker bar on the
corner of Spaulding and Eighth.

294
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:21,565
It's full of brawlers, lowlifes.

295
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:24,197
I need a bomb

296
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:26,143
to detonate there.

297
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,080
Tonight.

298
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:29,854
I'll let you know when.

299
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:31,241
So tell us, genius,

300
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:33,230
how do you plan to get Aubrey James

301
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:35,435
now that you've told the GCPD
you're going after him?

302
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:37,083
Oh, that's simple.

303
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,783
They're gonna bring him to me.

304
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,057
You know how many crooked politicians
there are in this city?

305
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:49,037
This riddle could be for anyone.

306
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:50,627
Oh, my gosh, these are delicious.

307
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:51,775
All the same, Mr. Mayor,

308
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,431
we'd like to move you
to a safe house immediately.

309
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:57,434
Did you not see
the muscle twins over there?

310
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,588
I'm perfectly safe here.

311
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:01,698
Besides, what's the Riddler
want with me, anyway?

312
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,167
We're not really sure.

313
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:06,854
He did say something to the crowd
at the theater about a secret.

314
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,255
My life's an open book.

315
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:14,351
Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mayor?
You look a little...

316
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:17,208
It's my blood sugar.
I've had too many of these Danishes.

317
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,262
Where are my pills?

318
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,924
Wait a minute, where'd you get these?

319
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,326
An appreciative citizen. Why?

320
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:26,963
Oh, boy.

321
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,558
Nygma.

322
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,964
This is bad.

323
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:45,526
Coming through.

324
00:16:52,854 --> 00:16:55,056
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

325
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:56,994
You cannot be serious.

326
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:59,997
I've seen mass graves more
inviting than this place.

327
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,172
Strange messed me up pretty good.

328
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:04,223
He convinced me

329
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,032
I was some sort of goddess,

330
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:08,461
and it took me a long time to get over it.

331
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,328
Now, this place might be bad,
but Gotham is worse.

332
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:13,731
Hey, freak! You're on company time.

333
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:15,676
Get back to work.

334
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:19,552
You don't have to take that.

335
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:23,583
- You should totally kick his ass.
- Yeah, but he's my boss.

336
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,178
Bridgit, there is nothing wrong
with being a freak.

337
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,081
I'm a freak.

338
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:31,745
So is Penguin.

339
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,184
You belong with us.

340
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,599
We've met before, haven't we?

341
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,924
Yeah. I'm Ivy Pepper.

342
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,760
Selina's friend.

343
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,034
Oh, I know. I ran into
one of Strange's puppies.

344
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,297
Kind of had a growth spurt.

345
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,544
Though, to be honest,
I'm not complaining.

346
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,763
Ivy.

347
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:53,125
And you're part of this?

348
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:56,341
Yeah. It's almost like we're a family.

349
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,297
You don't have to be alone anymore.

350
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:04,099
I could kill your boss
just to sweeten the deal.

351
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:07,875
Nah.

352
00:18:12,215 --> 00:18:13,707
Hey, you.

353
00:18:13,753 --> 00:18:15,135
I quit.

354
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:27,026
Thank you for letting me come in.

355
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,407
The nosebleeds are getting worse.

356
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,383
You did the right thing coming here.

357
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:34,004
- What did you tell Alfred?
- Nothing.

358
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,343
I said I was tired,
then snuck out of my room.

359
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,323
I'm dying, aren't I?

360
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:46,858
Yes.

361
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:48,493
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:48,725 --> 00:18:51,896
The process that brought you
into this world was flawed.

363
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,233
Will I die before Bruce returns?

364
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:58,210
No, Bruce Wayne will be back
in Gotham well before then.

365
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:03,429
I know we've asked a lot of you.

366
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:08,179
After Indian Hill I didn't know
what to do or where to go.

367
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,457
You gave me a purpose.

368
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,769
That's more than most people could say.

369
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,355
I'm glad you see it that way.

370
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,001
When Bruce returns...

371
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,869
people are going to die, aren't they?

372
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:26,539
A lot of people.

373
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,526
You haven't gotten attached
to anyone, have you?

374
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:32,143
Alfred, perhaps?

375
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,871
You've spoken fondly of him.

376
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,130
No.

377
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,086
I just want to know.

378
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:41,912
The number is immaterial.

379
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:46,219
What matters is that Gotham must fall.

380
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,492
And because of your sacrifice, it will.

381
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:53,531
Can we count on you?

382
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:56,521
Yes.

383
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,098
His BP's dropping.

384
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,323
- We need to stabilize him!
- I want this ER secured.

385
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:04,979
Badge access only. No one gets in

386
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,659
- unless they're sick or dying.
- 10-4.

387
00:20:06,684 --> 00:20:09,081
Nygma knows this is the closest
hospital to the mayor's office.

388
00:20:09,106 --> 00:20:10,266
We brought him right to him.

389
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,977
Great, let him show his face.
I got unis all over the place.

390
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,946
But what are we missing, Harvey?

391
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,271
What could Aubrey James know
that's so important to Nygma?

392
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:19,752
<i>Paging Detective James Gordon.</i>

393
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,587
<i>- Paging Detective James Gordon.</i>
- Where's that coming from?

394
00:20:22,617 --> 00:20:24,164
Communications room. Second floor.

395
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:26,016
- It's a trap.
<i>- Please don't kill me!</i>

396
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,967
<i>Please don't kill me!</i>

397
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:29,014
You stay here.

398
00:20:30,014 --> 00:20:31,889
<i>So, Jimbo,</i>

399
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:36,440
<i>I know you must be wondering what
I want from that ding-dong Aubrey James.</i>

400
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:40,973
<i>Well... turns out,
he has answers to a riddle,</i>

401
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:44,521
<i>one that you put into motion
when you sent Barbara down to Dock 9C.</i>

402
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:48,417
<i>The question being, who runs Gotham?</i>

403
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,274
- I got to get out of here.
- No, whoa, whoa, whoa.

404
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:54,491
Mr. Mayor, you're in no
condition to go anywhere.

405
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,756
Jim. Tell me you got him.

406
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,217
He wasn't there.

407
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:02,837
But the secret he's after,
it's the Court.

408
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:05,129
Lidocaine and an IV push.

409
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,850
<i>- You better get back here quick.</i>
- What is it?

410
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,335
There was some kind of explosion.
A lot of victims.

411
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,226
- I got a bad feeling.
<i>- It's him.</i>

412
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,809
Don't leave the mayor's side.

413
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:16,841
Authorized personnel only.

414
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,043
Hell with that. My friends got blown up!

415
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:31,267
Hello, Aubrey.

416
00:21:53,682 --> 00:21:55,102
We got company.

417
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:56,591
Where is she?

418
00:21:57,135 --> 00:21:58,384
Not here.

419
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:00,709
I know she and Nygma
kidnapped Mayor James.

420
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:03,736
Nygma mentioned Dock 9C and
she's the only one I told.

421
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,881
Nygma's got a big mouth.

422
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,478
Wait, wait, wait,
let me get this straight.

423
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,486
You mean this whole stupid
riddle thing with Nygma is real?

424
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:13,756
What? He clearly knows
everything already.

425
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:16,819
I heard a rumor

426
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:19,755
he hurt you pretty bad
a while back, both of you.

427
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,772
Surprised you're defending him.

428
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:23,806
Listen, you tell me where they are,

429
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,771
I'll take Nygma down,

430
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:28,044
but I'll give Barbara a free pass.

431
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,151
It's true. I hate him.

432
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:38,007
But I don't know where they are.

433
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:43,553
Harvey?

434
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:45,889
Okay. I'll be right there.

435
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,060
Nygma sent another riddle.

436
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:50,030
Never should have brought
Barbara into this.

437
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:52,218
You better hope I get to her first.

438
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,634
You should have given that freak up.

439
00:22:55,878 --> 00:22:57,811
No one wants Nygma dead more than me.

440
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,543
But I can't betray Barbara.

441
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,111
Yeah.

442
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:04,533
'Cause she's always got
your best interests at heart.

443
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:09,967
Listen.

444
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,116
You're in way over your head
on this one.

445
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:14,190
You don't want to mess
with these people.

446
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:16,401
You see, everything that you say

447
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:17,987
just makes me more intrigued.

448
00:23:18,924 --> 00:23:20,590
And determined.

449
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:24,961
I will be the one who unmasks them.

450
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:26,235
You're insane.

451
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,906
Remember me, Aubrey?

452
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,344
I know that voice.

453
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:34,219
I'm so glad.

454
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:37,357
I thought maybe it got muffled.

455
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,949
We put that box on your head.

456
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,695
That was fun. We should do
that again for old times' sake.

457
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,820
You don't get it, do you?

458
00:23:47,257 --> 00:23:48,678
These people, they're...

459
00:23:48,703 --> 00:23:50,726
they're like God.
They see and hear everything.

460
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,128
They'll know I talked.

461
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:54,185
Then it's the box.

462
00:23:54,257 --> 00:23:56,630
No, no, no. Please, a-anything but that.

463
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,800
They call themselves the Court.

464
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:05,362
And?

465
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:07,443
That's all I know.

466
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:09,573
I-I've never met these people.

467
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,614
I just did what they asked me to, I swear.

468
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:17,716
Very good! Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

469
00:24:17,826 --> 00:24:19,872
You've been very helpful.

470
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,302
Helpful?

471
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,293
All he gave us was "the Court."

472
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,381
He gave us tangible evidence
of their existence.

473
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:29,432
Now they'll know I'm not bluffing.

474
00:24:29,788 --> 00:24:31,434
What are you talking about?

475
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:35,004
I'm going to force the Court
to reveal themselves.

476
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,808
What is the one thing that every
secret organization is afraid of?

477
00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:40,666
Being exposed.

478
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,512
Bingo.

479
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,383
Finally. Did you bring what I asked for?

480
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:55,491
It's time to get the Court's attention.

481
00:24:58,304 --> 00:24:59,772
Baby...

482
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:02,565
Gordon came to the club.
He knows everything.

483
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,325
You should have never gotten
Nygma involved.

484
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,127
I boosted the premium stuff, Otto.

485
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,933
You're welcome.

486
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:28,986
Hello, Selina.

487
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:32,962
What the hell are you doing here?

488
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:34,924
I wanted to see you.

489
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:36,999
I missed you.

490
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,702
Did you fall on your head?
I told you to stay away.

491
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:41,455
You did?

492
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:43,506
I forgot.

493
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,281
Why are you acting so weird?

494
00:25:46,828 --> 00:25:48,757
I'm... I'm sorry.

495
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:51,039
I didn't sleep well last night.

496
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,758
Uh-huh.

497
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:55,553
Well, I just came to feed my cat.

498
00:25:55,578 --> 00:25:57,319
So, if you're not gonna leave, I am.

499
00:25:57,411 --> 00:25:59,302
I promised myself I'd stay away.

500
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,286
That it would be safer that way, but...

501
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:03,926
things have changed.

502
00:26:04,137 --> 00:26:05,728
What are you talking about?

503
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:07,763
You know what? I don't care.

504
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:09,717
Just don't be here when I get back.

505
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,334
Selina, wait.

506
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:17,726
I am not Bruce.

507
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,045
Jim?

508
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:25,968
- Lee, now is not a good time.
- Your uncle's autopsy.

509
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:28,667
Ballistics came back negative. No match.

510
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,020
But there were microscopic
tears along the entry wound,

511
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:32,558
made postmortem.

512
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:34,256
What are you saying?

513
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:36,926
Someone removed the bullet
that killed your uncle

514
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:38,527
and replaced it with another one.

515
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:40,630
It's an old mob trick
to cover up a murder.

516
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:42,716
- You're reaching, Lee.
- I don't think so.

517
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:45,036
And I think you know what happened.

518
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:46,802
Listen to me.

519
00:26:46,837 --> 00:26:48,988
You need to drop this.
You could get yourself hurt.

520
00:26:49,013 --> 00:26:50,873
You think I care what happens to me?

521
00:26:50,982 --> 00:26:52,708
I am sick of watching you

522
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:54,944
destroy people's lives
and get away with it.

523
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,625
When I find out what you did,

524
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:59,582
I'm gonna make sure you pay for it.
And I'm gonna enjoy it.

525
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,583
Jim, hey.

526
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,961
- Where's the riddle?
- Me and Lucius took a crack at it,

527
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:14,236
but maybe you'll have better luck.

528
00:27:14,486 --> 00:27:17,526
"You can see me,
but you cannot touch me.

529
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:20,738
"The flick of a switch,
I enter your home.

530
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,261
"With another, I leave you alone.

531
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:24,807
Where am I?"

532
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:26,909
He's taunting us. If he kills James,

533
00:27:27,035 --> 00:27:30,526
the press is gonna hand us
our asses on the 6:00 news.

534
00:27:30,628 --> 00:27:32,014
Harvey, you're a genius.

535
00:27:32,206 --> 00:27:34,049
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

536
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,329
<i>I have a question.</i>

537
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,540
<i>What is this mysterious "Court"</i>

538
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:43,859
<i>that controls the levers
of power here in Gotham?</i>

539
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:45,594
Alvarez, go to channel seven!

540
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,496
Find out where Nygma's broadcasting from.

541
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:52,045
<i>...let our dear mayor's head
be blown to bits</i>

542
00:27:52,136 --> 00:27:54,637
<i>in order to keep their anonymity?</i>

543
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,187
<i>Are you watching the television?</i>

544
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,311
I am.

545
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:05,475
The Court cannot be exposed.

546
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,870
We would clean this up on our own,

547
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,052
but there are too many eyes watching.

548
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:14,479
<i>However, this does afford us
an opportunity, James.</i>

549
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:16,382
To prove my loyalty.

550
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,845
You want me to find Nygma
and bring him to you?

551
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,999
I understand this puts you
in a difficult position.

552
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:26,695
He's a cop killer. He belongs in prison.

553
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,500
<i>If you decline, this
conversation will be our last.</i>

554
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:31,006
The choice is yours.

555
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,842
That was the Court.

556
00:28:34,438 --> 00:28:36,124
If I hand him over, I'm in.

557
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:38,013
- They'll probably kill him.
- And if I don't,

558
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,305
we'll never stop them
from destroying the city.

559
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,085
<i>I know what you're thinking, Aubrey.</i>

560
00:28:43,187 --> 00:28:46,855
That the police are gonna
somehow find you, rescue you.

561
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:50,663
But I gave the GCPD
every chance to save you.

562
00:28:50,843 --> 00:28:54,694
<i>But they're no match for me!</i>

563
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,397
We're both dead men.

564
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,048
You don't get it, do you?

565
00:29:01,853 --> 00:29:04,548
The Court isn't gonna bargain with you.

566
00:29:05,314 --> 00:29:07,342
You underestimate me, Mr. James.

567
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:13,782
- Hello.
- Nygma.

568
00:29:16,253 --> 00:29:17,930
<i>Jim, I'm so sorry.</i>

569
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:19,354
We can't be clogging up the lines.

570
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,923
I'm actually expecting
an important call.

571
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:23,118
<i>You want to know who runs Gotham?</i>

572
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:24,526
<i>I have the answer.</i>

573
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,719
Come by the GCPD. I'll tell it to you.

574
00:29:27,836 --> 00:29:29,898
Hmm. Yeah, I think I'll pass on that.

575
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,366
<i>Then you'll never know the truth.</i>

576
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:33,669
You think I told Barbara
everything I know?

577
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:38,225
You always were clever, Jim.
I respect that.

578
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:40,476
<i>Empty out the GCPD.</i>

579
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:42,978
<i>I want it to just be you and me.</i>

580
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:44,813
<i>Alone.</i>

581
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,617
<i>Well, and this idiot
with the bomb around his neck.</i>

582
00:29:56,132 --> 00:29:57,679
You think he'll show?

583
00:29:58,022 --> 00:30:00,467
The thing that drives
Nygma is also his weakness.

584
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,639
He'll be here.

585
00:30:01,664 --> 00:30:04,022
It's not like every man,
woman and child in Gotham

586
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:05,866
isn't depending on you to succeed.

587
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:08,109
Yeah. No pressure.

588
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:12,289
- Good luck, pal.
- Thanks.

589
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:19,992
Where's Ed?

590
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,214
That lunatic dropped me off.
Sent me in alone.

591
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,956
- Get the bomb squad in here!
- Sit down and shut up.

592
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:28,526
Ed?

593
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:30,725
It's just the two of us in here.

594
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,066
Just wanted to make sure
I wasn't walking into a trap.

595
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,682
Nah, ah, ah.

596
00:30:38,815 --> 00:30:40,571
Sit down, Aubrey.

597
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:46,223
You said you have the answer
I was looking for, Jim.

598
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:48,146
It would be incredibly disappointing

599
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,937
if this was all a ruse.
More so for Mayor James.

600
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:52,283
Just tell him what he wants.

601
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:53,985
He talks too much.

602
00:30:55,755 --> 00:30:57,743
You should probably just go ahead
and blow him up.

603
00:30:57,824 --> 00:30:59,323
I'll have your badge, Gordon.

604
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:02,434
I'm not bluffing, Jim.

605
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:04,653
Neither am I.

606
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:07,165
What's the blast radius on
that thing? Am I good here?

607
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,575
Or should I... duck behind a desk?

608
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,003
I want the answer, Jim!

609
00:31:15,575 --> 00:31:20,178
I kill him, I still walk out
of here with you as my hostage.

610
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,682
No!

611
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:25,550
No!

612
00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:28,619
No!

613
00:31:29,937 --> 00:31:31,622
Oh, come on.

614
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:34,621
There's a radio frequency

615
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:36,848
jamming the signal between
the detonator and the bomb.

616
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,896
- How?
- Tabitha.

617
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,860
She holds quite the grudge against you.

618
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:41,899
She called me.

619
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:44,068
Told me how to disarm the bomb.

620
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:48,906
I'll admit, I didn't see this coming.

621
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:52,450
But that doesn't change anything.

622
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:54,043
I want...

623
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:55,896
to know...

624
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:58,029
who the Court is.

625
00:31:59,571 --> 00:32:01,177
Or Aubrey dies.

626
00:32:02,822 --> 00:32:04,088
Don't!

627
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,060
You want to know who runs Gotham?

628
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:11,875
Then let Mayor James go.

629
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:13,977
Take a ride with me.

630
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,703
But if you pull that trigger,

631
00:32:15,835 --> 00:32:17,935
you'll never get the answer
you're looking for.

632
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,782
You fool me once, Jim,

633
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:23,978
shame on you.

634
00:32:24,978 --> 00:32:26,970
You fool me twice...

635
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,580
...well, that's just not gonna happen.

636
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:31,702
Then the riddle will go unsolved.

637
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:40,591
Fine!

638
00:32:47,277 --> 00:32:48,577
Let's go.

639
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:53,155
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

640
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:57,775
So, this limo pulls up
literally out of nowhere,

641
00:32:57,866 --> 00:33:01,479
and this creepy lady tells you
to get in because

642
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:04,228
"you could be so much more"?

643
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:05,983
And you did?

644
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,806
I had nowhere else to go.

645
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:09,829
So where have you been
the last few months?

646
00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:11,212
It's not important.

647
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,990
What matters is
you need to leave Gotham.

648
00:33:13,026 --> 00:33:14,692
- Right away.
- Why?

649
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,172
Because the city has been judged.

650
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:20,164
- And something bad is going to happen.
- Judged by who?

651
00:33:22,702 --> 00:33:24,373
The people who took you?

652
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,701
Wait a minute, your clothes, your hair,

653
00:33:27,998 --> 00:33:29,640
the way you talk.

654
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:34,278
Where is Bruce?

655
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:36,824
- Selina...
- What did you do to him?

656
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,382
He's fine. He's not in Gotham.

657
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:40,384
But nothing bad is going
to happen to him.

658
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,453
- Then where is he?
- It doesn't matter.

659
00:33:42,488 --> 00:33:44,989
You just have to trust me.
You need to leave Gotham today.

660
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,424
Trust you?

661
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:50,930
- I don't even know you.
- Where you going?

662
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,230
To tell Alfred.

663
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:55,202
- Selina...
- Now let me go!

664
00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:57,835
- Selina, you can't tell anyone.
- Then why the hell did you tell me?

665
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:02,340
Because I care about you.

666
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:05,009
And if there's one
person I want to save,

667
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,661
I want it to be you.

668
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:13,217
That's the difference
between you and Bruce Wayne.

669
00:34:14,854 --> 00:34:17,362
He would try and save everyone.

670
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,328
You can pretend all you want,
but you will never be him.

671
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,063
You're nothing.

672
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,094
You're not even a real person.

673
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:30,768
You don't matter.

674
00:34:33,747 --> 00:34:35,812
You're wrong about me.

675
00:34:36,711 --> 00:34:38,644
I do matter.

676
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:40,611
And I won't let you tell Alfred.

677
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:42,353
Oh, yeah?

678
00:34:42,797 --> 00:34:44,172
How you gonna stop...

679
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,035
You remember the night you
came over to Lee's for dinner?

680
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:27,679
It was like a lifetime ago.

681
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:30,289
Leslie made fondue.

682
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:32,990
The wine was a Bordeaux.

683
00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:36,701
Well-aged. Smooth tannins.

684
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:42,115
Ms. Kringle wore a black dress
with pink trim.

685
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:45,126
I tried like hell to get out of it.

686
00:35:47,308 --> 00:35:48,774
But Lee insisted.

687
00:35:49,453 --> 00:35:51,866
The truth is, I had a good time.

688
00:35:55,171 --> 00:35:56,871
I considered you a friend.

689
00:35:59,142 --> 00:36:00,775
I can sneak up on you

690
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,276
or be right in front of you
without you even knowing.

691
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,440
But when I reveal myself,

692
00:36:06,804 --> 00:36:08,649
you will never be the same. What am I?

693
00:36:08,674 --> 00:36:11,075
- I don't care, Ed...
- Betrayal.

694
00:36:13,189 --> 00:36:14,722
That's how every friendship ends.

695
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,600
So...

696
00:36:17,026 --> 00:36:19,326
so what good are friends anyway?

697
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:34,308
Who are they?

698
00:36:34,343 --> 00:36:36,157
The answer to your question.

699
00:36:55,185 --> 00:36:56,966
Hello, Mr. Nygma.

700
00:36:57,177 --> 00:36:58,989
I hear you've been asking about us.

701
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,935
How do I know you're real?

702
00:37:02,405 --> 00:37:04,832
Isn't that the point of a good mystery?

703
00:37:05,231 --> 00:37:08,409
You're never quite sure what
to believe until the end.

704
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:10,511
Gordon could've put you up to this.

705
00:37:10,536 --> 00:37:11,469
I assure you,

706
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:15,360
Detective Gordon had to be
convinced to bring you here.

707
00:37:16,107 --> 00:37:18,000
But let me put it like this:

708
00:37:18,435 --> 00:37:21,348
that question Professor
Strange had you ask

709
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:24,990
Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox
last year at Indian Hill,

710
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:28,128
the one that has tortured you,

711
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:31,589
the one you'll never be able to answer.

712
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,429
That answer is with me.

713
00:37:37,473 --> 00:37:38,757
What now?

714
00:37:38,908 --> 00:37:40,249
Get in.

715
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:42,977
And all your questions will be answered.

716
00:37:44,399 --> 00:37:45,813
You won't be needing the gun.

717
00:38:09,472 --> 00:38:12,212
You've made us proud, Detective Gordon.

718
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:14,341
What are you going to do with him?

719
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:18,230
A man with Nygma's intellect
could be quite useful to us.

720
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:20,648
I'm sure we'll find
something for him to do.

721
00:38:22,512 --> 00:38:24,020
We'll be in touch.

722
00:38:46,227 --> 00:38:48,442
Good evening, Ms. Kean.
May I offer you a drink?

723
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:51,879
Something went wrong.

724
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,749
Gordon took down Nygma
before he could find out

725
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:55,449
the truth about the Court.

726
00:38:55,771 --> 00:38:58,513
Probably 'cause I told Gordon
how to disarm the bomb.

727
00:38:58,575 --> 00:39:00,004
What?

728
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,988
Why?

729
00:39:02,058 --> 00:39:04,644
You promised that when Nygma
handed over the underworld,

730
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:06,590
I would get to kill him.

731
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:09,880
Sealed it with a kiss, remember?

732
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,809
Don't you get it?

733
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:15,703
As long as the Court is out there,

734
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:18,830
I'll never be in control!

735
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:23,541
Don't you mean we'll
never be in control?

736
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:34,700
Seen it a thousand times.

737
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,564
Ambition, power.

738
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,493
People can't help themselves.

739
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:42,002
She's changed, baby.

740
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:43,744
When are you gonna see that?

741
00:39:43,856 --> 00:39:45,791
Shut up, Butch!

742
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:47,301
Move!

743
00:39:49,272 --> 00:39:51,154
This is trouble.

744
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:58,638
It's good to be home.

745
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:02,513
FYI, I've been to Wayne Manor.
It's way cleaner.

746
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:05,886
You never said anything about
Fries being a part of this.

747
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:08,105
You're a little hot.

748
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,472
Maybe you need to cool off.

749
00:40:09,558 --> 00:40:11,083
Oh, come on, you guys.

750
00:40:11,152 --> 00:40:13,394
We're on the same team now, remember?

751
00:40:14,397 --> 00:40:16,543
A family?

752
00:40:19,135 --> 00:40:20,634
Keep him away from me.

753
00:40:27,774 --> 00:40:30,602
There's a question mark on your face.

754
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:33,332
You can sleep in the freezer.

755
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:37,518
<i>The study speculates that widespread
chemical dumping is to blame.</i>

756
00:40:37,572 --> 00:40:40,188
<i>And this just in:
we now go to breaking news...</i>

757
00:40:40,213 --> 00:40:44,076
- Hey, Pengy. Check it out.
- Do not call me "Pengy"!

758
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:45,889
- My...
- <i>The Riddler, aka Edward Nygma,</i>

759
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:47,815
<i>was apprehended by the GCPD</i>

760
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,676
<i>this afternoon after kidnapping
Interim Mayor Aubrey James.</i>

761
00:40:51,793 --> 00:40:54,300
<i>However, while en route
to Arkham Asylum, he managed</i>

762
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:56,433
- <i>to escape police custody...</i>
- Riddler.

763
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:57,870
<i>...and is now at large.</i>

764
00:40:57,895 --> 00:41:00,007
How long did he have
to think about that one?

765
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:04,478
<i>Once the right hand</i>

766
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:06,590
<i>to former mayor Oswald Kap...</i>

767
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,605
Rest up, everyone.

768
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,109
Tomorrow is going to be a busy day.

769
00:42:15,551 --> 00:42:18,218
I'd like to introduce our newest member,

770
00:42:18,504 --> 00:42:20,637
James Gordon.

771
00:42:33,265 --> 00:42:36,462
Welcome to the Court of Owls.
