1
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,441
Long ago, in ancient China,

2
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:28,445
the Peacocks
ruled over Gongmen City.

3
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:32,533
They brought great joy
and prosperity to the city,

4
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:35,911
for they had invented fireworks.

5
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:42,292
But their son, Lord Shen,

6
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:46,380
saw darker power in the fireworks.

7
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,466
What had brought color and joy,

8
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:54,012
could also bring darkness
and destruction.

9
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,975
Shen's troubled parents
consulted a soothsayer.

10
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:03,647
She foretold that if Shen
continued down this dark path

11
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:09,236
he would be defeated
by a warrior of black and white.

12
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:13,240
The young lord
set out to change his fate.

13
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,659
But what he did next...

14
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,620
...only sealed it.

15
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:27,254
Shen returned to his parents,
full of pride.

16
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,425
But in their faces,
he saw only horror.

17
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,180
He was banished
from the city forever.

18
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,683
But Shen swore revenge.

19
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,561
Someday he would return

20
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,440
and all of China
would bow at his feet.

21
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,807
It's almost done, Lord Shen,
but we've run out of metal.

22
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:26,939
Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,982
China will be mine.

24
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,454
And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!

25
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,582
And they became the most
awesomest kung fu team ever!

26
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,501
Enough talk. Let's fight!

27
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:49,837
Listen, listen.

28
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,172
You can hear the Dragon Warrior
training right now!

29
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,258
- Thirty-three.
- Stop him!

30
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,301
- It's too dangerous!
- Thirty-five.

31
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,638
- Stay focused!
- Thirty-six, 37!

32
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,182
How is he doing that with his face?

33
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,647
Thirty-eight bean buns!

34
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,358
Yes! New record! You monster!

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,777
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.

36
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,154
You guys wait, we'll get to 40!

37
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,447
Do it.

38
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,491
No problem!

39
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,868
Yeah!

40
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,704
Yeah!

41
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,165
Give me a minute.

42
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,876
Yeah!

43
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,794
- Yes!
- He did it!

44
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,671
Well done, Po!

45
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,174
Your training has paid off.

46
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,510
Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!

47
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,555
You'll save those for me, right?

48
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,619
Inner peace.

49
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,291
Inner peace.

50
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,338
Inner peace.

51
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,714
Master Shifu.

52
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,926
Master Shifu, what do we got?

53
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:21,762
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

54
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:26,183
Whatever it is, I will take them down,
'cause I am in a mood.

55
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,603
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

56
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,855
What are you doing?

57
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:35,692
One of Master Oogway's
final teachings.

58
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,724
Awesome!

59
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,227
How did you do that?

60
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,229
Inner peace.

61
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:15,607
Inner piece. That's cool.

62
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,401
Inner piece of what?

63
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,486
It is the next phase of your training.

64
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:25,492
Every master must find his path
to inner peace.

65
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:30,163
Some choose to meditate for 50 years
in a cave just like this...

66
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,960
...without the slightest taste
of food or water.

67
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,838
Or?

68
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,466
Some find it through pain and suffering
as I did.

69
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,012
Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior

70
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,930
was the worst day of my life.

71
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,432
By far.

72
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,434
Nothing else came close.

73
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,980
It was the worst, most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment...

74
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,482
- OK.
- ...I have ever experienced.

75
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:05,866
But once I realized the problem
was not you, but within me,

76
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,618
I found inner peace,

77
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,455
and was able to harness
the flow of the universe.

78
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,166
So that's it? I just need inner peace?

79
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,460
My innards are already super,
super peaceful,

80
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:20,130
so all I need to do
is just get this thing going.

81
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,174
Inner peace, you're going down.

82
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,134
Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

83
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,302
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

84
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:28,555
Po! Bandits!
Approaching the musicians' village.

85
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,806
Danger.

86
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:33,977
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music, because it is on.

87
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,355
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

88
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,565
No snack stops this time.

89
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,151
Snack stops.

90
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,861
Wait, are you serious?

91
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:58,126
Get all the metal you can find!

92
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,549
Grab the metal!

93
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,055
Help, help, help, help!

94
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,186
That's everything!
Let's get out of here.

95
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,312
OK.

96
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,856
Oh, no.

97
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,779
Wings of Justice!

98
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,036
Po!

99
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,091
The Dragon Warrior!

100
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,552
The panda? That's impossible.

101
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,512
My fist hungers for justice.

102
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,557
That was my... fist.

103
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,058
Get 'em!

104
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,102
- Come on!
- Yeah!

105
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,501
Take that!

106
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,596
Po! Incoming!

107
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,139
Thanks, Mantis!

108
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,910
Tigress, Double Death Strike!

109
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,586
Feet of Fury!

110
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,509
Tigress!

111
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,635
Monkey!

112
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,679
Viper! Mantis!

113
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,681
Bunny! What?

114
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,599
Oh, sorry.

115
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,524
Help!

116
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,734
- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!

117
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,006
Is everyone OK?

118
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,008
Awesome!

119
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,887
I got this.

120
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:06,940
Po!

121
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,282
Chew on that, tubby!

122
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,169
- Are you OK?
- What happened?

123
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,631
I think I saw...

124
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,926
I think... I gotta go.

125
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:42,309
Thank you. Thank you for coming
to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

126
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,228
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

127
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,022
If you need anything, just ask.

128
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,026
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!

129
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:56,114
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!

130
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,618
No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.

131
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,662
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!

132
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,582
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

133
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,335
He doesn't work here anymore.

134
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,922
He's busy out there
protecting the Valley.

135
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,632
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.

136
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,425
- Po!
- Wow!

137
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:17,928
Here.

138
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,429
OK, OK.

139
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,639
You should have told me
you were coming.

140
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,974
Hi, Dad.

141
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,142
I would have saved you
some stinky tofu.

142
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:29,523
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

143
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:35,153
In honor of my son,
free tofu dessert for everybody!

144
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,196
With purchases.

145
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:41,118
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

146
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,913
Have you lost weight? I can
almost put my wings around you.

147
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,665
Ah, well, maybe a little.

148
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,126
Poor you, you must feel weak.

149
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:51,795
- Let me get you some soup.
- No, that's OK, Dad.

150
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,839
- I'm not hungry.
- Not hungry?

151
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,549
Po, are you all right?

152
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:57,467
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

153
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,970
Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.

154
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,306
Nothing too dangerous.

155
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,141
- They were just, you know...
- Yeah.

156
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:08,478
And then the strangest thing happened.
I had this crazy vision.

157
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,648
I think I saw my mom and me,
as a baby.

158
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,985
What? Mom? A baby?

159
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:19,656
- Dad?
- What are you talking about?

160
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,742
- What...?
- How do I say this?

161
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,245
Where did I come from?

162
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:34,880
Well, you see, son,
baby geese come from a little egg.

163
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,216
Don't ask me
where the egg comes from.

164
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,801
Dad, that's not what I meant.

165
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,347
I know it's not.

166
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:48,393
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.

167
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,687
OK.

168
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,774
You might have been kind of...

169
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,863
...adopted.

170
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,865
- I knew it.
- You knew?

171
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,035
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

172
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,871
But if you knew, why didn't you
ever say anything?

173
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,915
Why didn't you say anything?

174
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,920
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?

175
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,092
Actually, you came from this.

176
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,974
It was just another day
at the restaurant.

177
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,393
Time to make the noodles.

178
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,686
I went out to the back

179
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,064
where my vegetables
had just been delivered.

180
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,817
There were cabbages,
turnips, radishes.

181
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,737
Only there were no radishes...

182
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,199
...just a very hungry, baby panda.

183
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,079
There was no note.

184
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,123
Of course, you could have eaten it.

185
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:56,170
I waited for someone to come
looking for you but no one did.

186
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:22,154
I brought you inside.

187
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,033
Fed you.

188
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,161
Gave you a bath.

189
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,499
And fed you again.

190
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,087
And again.

191
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:43,175
And tried to put some pants on you.

192
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:55,229
And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever.

193
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,025
To make my soup without radishes...

194
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:04,446
...and to raise you as my own son.

195
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:09,743
Xiao Po, my little panda.

196
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:15,499
And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life

197
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,710
have been that much sweeter.

198
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,880
And, little Po,
that's the end of the story.

199
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,343
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

200
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:31,014
That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!

201
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:35,269
Well, there was the time
you ate all my bamboo furniture.

202
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,938
It was imported, too.

203
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,774
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.

204
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:50,117
Oh, Po, your story may not have
such a happy beginning,

205
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,785
but look how it turned out.

206
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:55,706
You got me. You got kung fu.
And you got noodles.

207
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,542
I know. I just have so many questions.

208
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,128
Like, how did I ever fit
in this tiny basket?

209
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,838
Why didn't I like pants?

210
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,176
And who am I?

211
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,310
Good. Watch your form.

212
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,439
Good.

213
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,026
Better. Elbow.

214
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,987
Straighten it out!

215
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,098
Shen?

216
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,227
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

217
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,063
Now we've got the pleasantries
out of the way,

218
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,190
please leave my house.

219
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,442
- Your house?
- Yes.

220
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,986
Didn't you see the peacock
on the front door?

221
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,115
There you are, Soothsayer.

222
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:17,579
It seems your fortune-telling skills
are not as good as you thought.

223
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:21,750
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

224
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,461
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

225
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,548
What is rightfully mine.

226
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,132
Gongmen City!

227
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,969
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Masters' Council

228
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,470
and we will protect it.

229
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,806
Even from you.

230
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,394
I'm so glad you feel that way.

231
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,438
Otherwise, I'd have dragged
that here for nothing.

232
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,649
What's in the box, Shen?

233
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:48,694
You want to see? It's a gift.

234
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,238
It's your parting gift.

235
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,323
In that it will part you.

236
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:54,992
Part of you here, part of you there

237
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:59,162
and part of you way over there,
staining the wall!

238
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,706
You insolent fool!

239
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,017
Show-off.

240
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:24,855
That is a warning.
You are no match for our kung fu.

241
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:26,940
I agree.

242
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,692
But this is.

243
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,542
Are you familiar with
the Master of Gongmen City?

244
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,211
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

245
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,796
- Son of Legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

246
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:53,050
And Slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

247
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,218
He's dead.

248
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:56,512
That's impossible.

249
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,181
Rhino's Horn Defense
is impervious to any technique.

250
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:03,018
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon.

251
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,270
One that breathes fire and spits metal.

252
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:10,776
Unless he is stopped,
this could be the end of kung fu.

253
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:15,489
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.

254
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:19,701
Go! Destroy this weapon
and bring Lord Shen to justice!

255
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,578
OK, here we go! Here we go!

256
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,915
Wait a second.
How can I do this?

257
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:28,252
I mean, how can kung fu stop
something that stops kung fu?

258
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,087
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

259
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,757
anything is possible
when you have inner peace.

260
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,140
Inner peace. Inner peace.
Inner peace.

261
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,184
Peace on.

262
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,395
- Oh, Po?
- Peace!

263
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,689
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.

264
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,109
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.

265
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,320
I even packed all your action figures.
See?

266
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,867
Oh, hey...
I don't know what those are.

267
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,743
Never seen them before in my life.

268
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,787
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

269
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,832
I also packed your paintings
of our best time together,

270
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,585
just in case you get lonely.

271
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:13,630
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.

272
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:16,884
And that's me giving you
a piggyback ride.

273
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,594
Isn't that cute?

274
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,762
On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.

275
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,806
Hey, they're waiting for me.

276
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:26,476
Of course, of course.
You have a job to do...

277
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,811
...far from home,

278
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,439
in a strange city,
filled with strange people,

279
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,815
and strange noodles,

280
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:35,569
facing horrible danger
from which you might never return!

281
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:36,695
Don't go, Po.

282
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:41,950
I gotta go. I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.

283
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:45,120
And if I don't... what am I?

284
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,164
You're my son.

285
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,126
Right?

286
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:55,631
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.

287
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,426
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

288
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:01,887
He'll be back before
you can say "noodles".

289
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,561
Noodles.

290
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,945
Come on, guys, let's go!

291
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,196
Yeah!

292
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:25,369
Yeah, yeah.

293
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,537
Yeah...

294
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,576
Mama?

295
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:54,625
Mom? Dad?

296
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,876
Is that you?

297
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,128
Mom! Dad!

298
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,466
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

299
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,928
Honey, what are you doing here?

300
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,137
But I thought...

301
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:10,140
We've replaced you, dear,
with this lovely radish.

302
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:14,478
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and frankly,

303
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,688
does better kung fu.

304
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,774
No. No, no, no.

305
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:23,862
Wait!

306
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:42,381
Radish, radish, radish.

307
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:53,058
Inner pea...

308
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,603
Pea...

309
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,649
Inner peace.

310
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,709
Inner peace! Inner peace!

311
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,837
Inner peace!
Inner peace, inner peace...

312
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,887
I'm... training.

313
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,222
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

314
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:38,395
- I am ready.
- OK.

315
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:40,439
So serious.

316
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:51,074
- I think I prefer the mast.
- Apologies.

317
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:55,245
I used to punch the ironwood trees
by the palace to train.

318
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:56,622
Now I feel nothing.

319
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,625
That's severely cool.

320
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,129
Again!

321
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:10,677
So, this punching ironwood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

322
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:14,348
- Twenty years.
- Twenty years?

323
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,767
Is there any, you know, faster way?

324
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:19,645
You know, until you, you know,
don't feel anything?

325
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,647
No. Besides...

326
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:28,654
I don't think hard style is your thing.

327
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,786
Po, why are you really out here?

328
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,499
I just found out that my dad
isn't really my dad.

329
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,336
Your dad? The goose.

330
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:49,383
That must have been quite a shock.

331
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,926
Yeah.

332
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,471
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

333
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:57,641
We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.

334
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:59,768
Souls of platinum.

335
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,144
Like you.

336
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,146
So hardcore you don't feel anything.

337
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,695
- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?

338
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,489
Nothing. Nothing.

339
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,825
Po's having daddy issues.

340
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:18,161
I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.

341
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,622
Maybe it's because Mom
ate his head before I was born.

342
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:23,625
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

343
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,836
Po is the one freaking out.

344
00:26:25,878 --> 00:26:28,172
- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.

345
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,549
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!

346
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:33,385
- What?
- We're here.

347
00:26:33,427 --> 00:26:35,387
Gongmen City.

348
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:54,406
My father's throne.

349
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:57,618
He used to let me play here beside him,

350
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:02,164
promising someday
that this throne would be mine.

351
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:08,378
A little to the left.

352
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,714
Oh, but it's so heavy, master!

353
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:14,176
Thirty years I've waited
for this moment.

354
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:17,846
Everything must be exactly
how I envisioned it,

355
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,600
and I envisioned it
a little to the left.

356
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:23,936
Perfect!

357
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:27,189
With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.

358
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:35,239
With the weapon by my side,
all of China will bow before me.

359
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,074
We move out in three days,

360
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:40,953
when the moon is full
and the tide is high.

361
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:45,749
Now, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

362
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:46,959
Fortune?

363
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:51,755
Future. I was going to say future.

364
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:55,384
Look into your bowl
and tell me what glory awaits.

365
00:27:57,094 --> 00:28:01,390
If you continue on your current path...

366
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:06,979
...you will find yourself
at the bottom of the stairs.

367
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,775
I see...

368
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:14,278
I see...

369
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,822
I see pain.

370
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,616
- And anger.
- How dare you?

371
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:21,785
That is the finest silk in the province!

372
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:25,205
- Followed by denial.
- This is not fortune-telling.

373
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:28,667
- You're just saying what's happening...
- Now?

374
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:32,171
The most important time is now.

375
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:35,841
But if you really want
to see the future...

376
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:40,387
Oh, what do you see?

377
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,686
A peacock...

378
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:53,525
...is defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

379
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,695
Nothing has changed.

380
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:05,954
That's impossible, and you know it.

381
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:09,333
It is not impossible,
and he knows it.

382
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:13,128
- Who?
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!

383
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,338
A panda?

384
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,509
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!

385
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,302
Big and furry.

386
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:23,514
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.

387
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:27,309
There are no more pandas.

388
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:30,812
Even with his poor eyesight,
he can see the truth.

389
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:33,857
Why is it that you cannot?

390
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:38,028
Find this panda and bring him to me!

391
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,947
Yes, sir!

392
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:43,951
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.

393
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:47,871
You're right.
Being right makes me right.

394
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:52,209
Then I will kill him
and make you wrong.

395
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,921
Will you stop that!

396
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:11,770
That must be Shen's palace
on the other side of the city.

397
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,481
Great. We'll march into the tower
and proclaim,

398
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:16,900
"We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

399
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:18,735
and we are here to
bring you to justice!"

400
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:23,115
What are you doing?

401
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,825
This place is crawling with wolves.

402
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,916
Hey, isn't that the guy
who hammered you in the face?

403
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:38,088
I do not like that guy.

404
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,717
We need to get to that tower without
being spotted by those wolves.

405
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,428
Got it. Stealth mode.

406
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:10,078
- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.

407
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,498
Now where did those noodles go?

408
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:22,925
Hello. I couldn't help but...

409
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:25,344
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?

410
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:28,514
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

411
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:33,727
OK.

412
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,069
Guys! Guys?

413
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,946
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

414
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,614
So that was stealth mode, huh?

415
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:48,242
To be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

416
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,702
...gold in there, come on!

417
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:53,455
This rice is raw!

418
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:56,166
You stole all my metal pots
for Lord Shen!

419
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:59,503
Either you cook my rice,
or I cook you!

420
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:02,172
- My apologies.
- Po, do something.

421
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:05,092
How am I supposed to help her
cook rice without getting caught?

422
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,302
- Wait, I have a better idea.
- ...two...

423
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,470
One.

424
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:10,347
- Hey.
- Hey.

425
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,278
We're here to liberate the city
and bring Shen to justice.

426
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,946
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

427
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,698
but it's too dangerous.
I can't let you.

428
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:31,034
Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.

429
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,536
Right.

430
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:37,541
I'm talking about Masters Ox
and Croc.

431
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:40,586
They're in Gongmen Jail
on Black Dragon Alley.

432
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,880
What? They're still alive?

433
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,048
They must be in that jail
gathering intelligence,

434
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,926
hatching a plot to use their
awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

435
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,761
OK, let's go!

436
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:53,015
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!

437
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,349
- Hold it right there!
- Get them!

438
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:57,561
- Get them!
- Sorry!

439
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:59,229
Take... that!

440
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,856
- Keep going!
- Faster!

441
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:26,340
Surround him.

442
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,968
Now!

443
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:32,221
Gotcha!

444
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:34,723
Where'd he go?

445
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:37,434
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?

446
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:41,605
- Is there a part of everywhere?
- I... I guess.

447
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:43,482
Then search there!

448
00:33:48,237 --> 00:33:51,782
They must be close. I can feel
a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

449
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:53,825
Sorry, Po. It's just me.

450
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:56,995
Look. Gongmen Jail.

451
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,376
Aw, it's cute.

452
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:04,878
Cute, huh?

453
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:15,681
Nice work, Po.

454
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,810
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

455
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:23,272
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

456
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:25,690
Excuse me, when have I
ever made that noise?

457
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:28,819
Master Ox! Master!

458
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:33,364
The ferocious Master Croc!

459
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:36,869
And Master Storming Ox.

460
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:40,831
I can't believe we're rescuing
actual legends of kung fu.

461
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:42,833
We're gonna free you from those
bonds of injustice. No problem.

462
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:45,502
Gotta be a key around here. No,
they wouldn't leave a key around here.

463
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:50,047
Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!

464
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,384
We're coming for you, Shen!

465
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,349
Guys, are we going or not?

466
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:00,934
Do you want to meet us there later?

467
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:02,853
You do want to take back your city,
right?

468
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:04,730
Of course we do.

469
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:08,734
But if we stand up to Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city.

470
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:09,860
Listen to yourself.

471
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:12,279
You're protecting Gongmen City
by not protecting Gongmen City?

472
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:17,451
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

473
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:21,371
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!

474
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:23,999
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

475
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:28,879
...by the unstoppable weapon.

476
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:32,007
Nothing's unstoppable except for me
when I'm stopping you from telling me

477
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:33,926
something's unstoppable!

478
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:47,272
Master Ox, I'm not letting you
stay in this cell.

479
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:49,191
I'd like to see you get me out!

480
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,366
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.

481
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:59,243
Come on! Whatever
happened to being heroes?

482
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:02,120
The only hero in this town
is a dead one!

483
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,795
Like I said, you are not
getting me out of this cell!

484
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,424
Yes!

485
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,052
All right, let's go!

486
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,137
I get the top bunk.

487
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,100
It's time to surrender, panda.

488
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,602
Kung fu is dead.

489
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:27,145
I...

490
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:31,483
You...

491
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:34,611
Kung fu is dead? Fine!

492
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:38,448
You stay in your prison of fear
with bars made of hopelessness.

493
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,827
And all you get are three
square meals a day of shame!

494
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,620
With despair for dessert.

495
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:47,958
We'll take on Shen and prove to all
those who are hungry for justice

496
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,044
and honor that kung fu still lives!

497
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:52,462
Yeah!

498
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:56,675
Monkey!

499
00:36:58,302 --> 00:36:59,720
You! You're mine!

500
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:01,722
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

501
00:37:01,763 --> 00:37:04,808
My fist in your plush, cuddly,
super-soft face!

502
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,354
Get him!

503
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,899
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!

504
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,317
Stop him!

505
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,613
Faster!

506
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:23,243
Go, go!

507
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,871
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

508
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:29,875
- Viper!
- Hang on!

509
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:42,054
- What?
- Watch out!

510
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,725
Uncool, very uncool!

511
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,977
Try this!

512
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:52,147
Guys, guys, guys!

513
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,195
Maybe something smaller!

514
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,781
No, no! Oh, no, no.

515
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:08,038
Cute bunnies off the face!
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!

516
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:19,424
Fire! Fire!

517
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,593
We've lost them.

518
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:31,937
Again, again!

519
00:38:33,689 --> 00:38:35,607
Crane, catch!

520
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:39,444
Gotcha!

521
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:50,747
Guys, guys, guys, give me a shove!

522
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,458
Mantis, now!

523
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:07,973
Is that all you've got?

524
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,851
'Cause it feels like I'm fighting
a big, old, fluffy cloud!

525
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:13,145
Well, this cloud is about
to bring the thunder!

526
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:17,482
Your turn!

527
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:23,155
Why are there so many signs?

528
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:41,298
Come here! Alakasquasho!

529
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:46,094
Yes! Taste the defeat!

530
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,638
Let me tell you something.

531
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,682
Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole...

532
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:04,071
I guess nobody told you,
if you mess with the wolf,

533
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:05,364
you get the fangs.

534
00:40:05,864 --> 00:40:09,743
I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?

535
00:40:12,663 --> 00:40:14,581
We surrender!

536
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:21,255
You can chain my body,
but you'll never chain my...

537
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:22,548
...warrior spirit.

538
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:23,715
Hey, don't forget the little guy.

539
00:40:23,757 --> 00:40:25,133
Did you just call...?

540
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:28,345
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

541
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:33,016
No way.
Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

542
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:36,311
Like the ones that held Tai Lung. The
more you move, the tighter they get.

543
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,231
These are the best cuffs!

544
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,403
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

545
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,614
No, no, no.

546
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:54,621
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

547
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:56,498
Greetings, panda.

548
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,500
We meet at...

549
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:02,963
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.

550
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:05,883
He is coming to me in chains.

551
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:08,427
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

552
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,183
Don't even think about it.

553
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:30,365
I hope this turns out better than
your plan to cook rice in your stomach,

554
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:32,868
by eating it raw
and then drinking boiling water.

555
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,037
This plan is nothing like that plan.

556
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:37,080
- How?
- This one's going to work.

557
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:51,637
Keep moving.

558
00:41:58,685 --> 00:41:59,895
My old enemy.

559
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,485
Stairs.

560
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:38,225
Thanks for carrying me
those last few flights. OK.

561
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:40,769
I threw up a little bit
on the third floor.

562
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,312
Someone might want to clean that up.

563
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:45,148
Is there some sort of
evil janitor or something?

564
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,900
Greetings, panda.

565
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:49,278
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

566
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:52,531
Hey.

567
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:55,492
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

568
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,579
Enough with the poking around.

569
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,498
Strong. Healthy.

570
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,334
Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, sir.

571
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:06,962
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.

572
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:09,840
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.

573
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:13,093
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!

574
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:14,928
Bring the prisoners to me.

575
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,722
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

576
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:19,308
Keep your eyes peeled for the...
weapon!

577
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:24,938
Sparrow kick!

578
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:30,152
We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...

579
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:42,706
Do you actually believe this is
the warrior destined to defeat me?

580
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:45,834
I do not. I know he is.

581
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,295
Oh, look at him.

582
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:52,382
A lifetime to plot his revenge
and he comes to me on his knees.

583
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:53,634
What? A lifetime?

584
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,886
I did not have a lifetime.

585
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:58,096
We only heard about Master Rhino
a few days ago,

586
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,389
and we came to avenge him!

587
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:02,893
You've come to avenge nothing else?

588
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:05,562
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.

589
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:08,148
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?

590
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,901
You probably did some other evil stuff
along the way. I don't know.

591
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:13,237
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

592
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:14,488
Know what?

593
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,614
What's so funny?

594
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:18,909
The very thing that you
clearly do not know!

595
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:22,996
OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?

596
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:26,500
First we come in and the weapon is tiny.
Surprise, it's big.

597
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:30,128
And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...

598
00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:36,510
The only reason you are still alive
is that I find your stupidity

599
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:38,512
mildly amusing.

600
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:42,015
Well, thank you. But I find your
evilness extremely annoying.

601
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:44,059
Who do you think you are, panda?

602
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:46,728
Who do you think I am, peacock?

603
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:57,823
Why are we laughing?

604
00:44:58,615 --> 00:44:59,783
Take aim.

605
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:12,838
Fire.

606
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:19,887
Well, light the thing!

607
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:21,930
I did!

608
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:28,270
Fear the bug!

609
00:45:37,154 --> 00:45:38,655
Get the weapon!

610
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:42,701
Tigress!

611
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,944
You... you were there.

612
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:19,905
Yes. Yes, I was.

613
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:29,373
You just let Shen get away!

614
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:30,916
At least we destroyed the weapon.

615
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,422
Fire!

616
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:41,760
Oh, no, he's got way more.

617
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,018
- My wing!
- Help, Po!

618
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,061
Coming!

619
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:53,605
- Watch out!
- Po!

620
00:46:57,651 --> 00:47:00,654
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

621
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:02,239
Use the ropes.

622
00:47:11,123 --> 00:47:13,208
Run, run, little panda!

623
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:26,597
Po, come on. We need you to focus!

624
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:29,308
- I got it, I got it!
- Bring it down!

625
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:34,813
- We're trapped!
- This way!

626
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:40,986
Goodbye!

627
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:45,324
Fire!

628
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:49,161
Get back!

629
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:57,753
The only way out is up.

630
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,048
What?

631
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:13,644
Follow me! Come on!

632
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:16,980
- Where are they going?
- To the top!

633
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:19,107
Come on! Keep going!

634
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:27,616
Here we go!

635
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:47,719
You idiot!

636
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:49,763
My nose!

637
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:53,892
Call in the wolves! All of them.
I want them ready to move!

638
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:58,146
The Year of the Peacock begins now!

639
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:01,191
Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year,

640
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:03,902
so you'd only get, like,
a half of the Year of the Peacock.

641
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:09,449
And this is the Year, of course,
of the Peacock.

642
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:10,993
Happy New Year, sir.

643
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:19,209
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.

644
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:20,460
Now!

645
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:22,546
Now, now, now, now!

646
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:25,382
Move! Move, move, move, move!

647
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:43,775
This way.

648
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:49,615
Let's go.

649
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:58,415
Oh, you! What did you do?
It's chaos up there.

650
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:00,125
What happened to stopping Shen?

651
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:03,378
Yeah.

652
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,924
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

653
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:10,010
I meant for him to get away because...

654
00:50:10,052 --> 00:50:12,346
...it was a trick. It was a plot.

655
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:17,309
I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.

656
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:20,103
That makes no sense.

657
00:50:20,145 --> 00:50:23,273
- What do you mean? Sure it does.
- Po, the truth.

658
00:50:23,315 --> 00:50:25,817
- You had Shen. What happened?
- What are you talking about?

659
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:28,904
I don't know what you're talking about.
I, yeah--

660
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:30,322
OK, he caught me off guard.

661
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:33,158
The truth.

662
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:39,456
Fine. They will keep you
far from danger.

663
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:42,167
- Real far.
- What?

664
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:44,336
You're staying here.

665
00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:46,547
Wait!

666
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:48,298
I have to go ba...

667
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:54,471
You're staying here!

668
00:50:55,013 --> 00:50:57,182
I'm going. And you can't stop me.

669
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,855
OK. I wasn't ready that time.

670
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:04,731
Guys? Don't.

671
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:05,858
Ready.

672
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:07,526
Look!

673
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,456
Stay down.

674
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:25,669
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!

675
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:31,008
He was there! OK?

676
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:34,386
The peacock was there
the last time I saw my parents.

677
00:51:34,428 --> 00:51:38,182
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.

678
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,684
Who I am.

679
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:46,356
Look, I'm going.

680
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:49,526
I have to know.

681
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:52,487
- The hardcore can't understand.
- Tigress, no!

682
00:51:57,659 --> 00:51:59,661
The hardcore do understand.

683
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,999
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

684
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:09,630
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

685
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:12,591
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

686
00:52:14,259 --> 00:52:16,553
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

687
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:18,388
You're better off here.

688
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:33,237
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.

689
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:35,739
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

690
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:38,867
Are you certain it is the panda
who is a fool?

691
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:41,411
You just destroyed
your ancestral home, Shen.

692
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:46,917
A trivial sacrifice
when all of China is my reward.

693
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:49,545
Then will you finally be satisfied?

694
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:53,799
Will the subjugation of the whole world
finally make you feel better?

695
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:58,345
It's a start. I might also convert
the basement into a dungeon.

696
00:53:01,265 --> 00:53:04,101
The cup you choose to fill
has no bottom.

697
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:07,145
It is time to stop this madness.

698
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:12,484
- Why on earth would I do that?
- So your parents can rest in peace.

699
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:16,280
My parents hated me.

700
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:19,116
Do you understand?

701
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:26,039
They wronged me...
and I will make it right.

702
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:29,126
They loved you.
They loved you so much

703
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:32,296
that having to send you away
killed them.

704
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:40,679
The dead exist in the past
and I must tend to the future.

705
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:49,688
Set the Soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.

706
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,481
Goodbye, Shen.

707
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:53,483
I wish you happiness.

708
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:56,236
Happiness must be taken...

709
00:53:57,863 --> 00:54:00,199
...and I will take mine.

710
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:23,263
Hurry it up!

711
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:29,353
If all of those weapons
leave the building, China will fall.

712
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:32,189
- We bring down the building!
- Hey, guys.

713
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:33,607
How about this?

714
00:54:36,235 --> 00:54:38,529
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.

715
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,072
I can't feel my face.

716
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:58,632
Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?

717
00:54:58,674 --> 00:55:01,051
- Hey.
- Hey.

718
00:55:01,093 --> 00:55:02,719
OK. Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

719
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:05,222
You! Where are you going?

720
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:10,769
On your feet! And wipe those
stupid grins off your faces.

721
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:27,953
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster. Load them all.

722
00:55:38,297 --> 00:55:40,299
Greetings, panda.

723
00:55:43,927 --> 00:55:47,014
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

724
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:50,184
- That night.
- Ah, that night.

725
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:53,228
Yes. We're talking about
the same night, right?

726
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:58,066
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched
as your parents abandoned you.

727
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:01,945
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.

728
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:14,416
Here's your New Year's gift.

729
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,627
Hope you like it
'cause you can't return it.

730
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:20,881
Po? What's he doing here?

731
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,050
Return it! Return it!

732
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:37,814
Are you willing to die
to find the truth?

733
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:41,401
You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.

734
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:05,884
We got them. Go!

735
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:29,116
You looking for me?

736
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:37,666
I said that too soon, didn't I?

737
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:47,384
Po!

738
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:53,932
Po, get away from him.

739
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:55,934
I'll get up. Here we go.

740
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,565
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

741
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:03,734
Now... answers.

742
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,486
Oh, you want to know so badly.

743
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:10,449
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

744
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:14,745
Fill some crater in your soul?

745
00:58:14,786 --> 00:58:16,997
Well, here's your answer.

746
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:20,125
Your parents didn't love you.

747
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:23,212
But here...

748
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:25,797
...let me heal you!

749
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:50,549
Yeah, like you could
make me drink that.

750
00:59:55,012 --> 00:59:59,391
If I wanted you dead, I would
have left you in that river.

751
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:00,601
Well, why save me?

752
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:03,520
So you can fulfill your destiny.

753
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:06,773
What are you talking about?
Where am I?

754
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:11,236
What is this place?

755
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:14,907
I'm surprised you remember so little.

756
01:00:14,948 --> 01:00:18,410
But you were so little
when it happened.

757
01:00:23,707 --> 01:00:26,251
Perhaps you do remember.

758
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:28,545
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.

759
01:00:28,587 --> 01:00:30,631
Nightmare or memory?

760
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,373
This was a thriving village.

761
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:08,085
Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen City.

762
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:10,087
But he wanted more.

763
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:14,466
I foretold that someone
would stand in his way.

764
01:01:14,508 --> 01:01:16,093
A panda.

765
01:01:16,134 --> 01:01:19,972
But I never could have foretold
what came next.

766
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:34,611
Get them all!

767
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:44,663
Take our son and run away. Go!

768
01:01:58,218 --> 01:02:01,847
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

769
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:09,975
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning

770
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:13,270
but that doesn't
make you who you are.

771
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:15,856
It is the rest of your story.

772
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,859
Who you choose to be.

773
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:54,394
So, who are you, panda?

774
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:04,071
I am Po.

775
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:07,824
And I'm gonna need a hat.

776
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:20,212
Such sad, sad faces.

777
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:23,215
But now is a time only for joy.

778
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:27,302
You are going to be part
of something beautiful.

779
01:05:29,555 --> 01:05:33,684
Once we reach the harbor,
in front of all the world,

780
01:05:33,725 --> 01:05:37,896
you and your precious kung fu
will die.

781
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:45,112
Then China will know to bow before me.

782
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:46,154
Set sail!

783
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,543
What is that?

784
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:23,275
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.

785
01:06:23,317 --> 01:06:26,445
I always thought I'd meet
a nice girl and settle down

786
01:06:26,486 --> 01:06:28,363
and then she'd eat my head.

787
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:30,949
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

788
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:35,537
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hardcore. Right, Tigress?

789
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:47,466
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

790
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:49,426
Fire!

791
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:00,479
You coward!

792
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:11,114
Po?

793
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:14,952
Po!

794
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:22,167
How many times do I have to kill
the same stinking panda?

795
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,303
Shen!

796
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:37,391
A panda stands between you
and your destiny.

797
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:39,309
What?

798
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:43,480
Prepare yourself for a hot
serving of justice.

799
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:45,274
Your reign of terror comes to an end.

800
01:07:45,315 --> 01:07:48,694
- What?
- And now, free the Five!

801
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:50,821
Disc of Destruction!

802
01:08:01,915 --> 01:08:03,333
OK.

803
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:04,835
Take aim!

804
01:08:16,138 --> 01:08:17,848
Ready?

805
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:35,573
This way and that way.
That way and this way.

806
01:08:38,618 --> 01:08:39,912
You can't follow me.

807
01:08:40,871 --> 01:08:41,913
Just get him!

808
01:08:47,252 --> 01:08:48,962
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!

809
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,720
- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

810
01:08:57,763 --> 01:08:59,348
No, don't shoot!

811
01:08:59,389 --> 01:09:02,225
- Don't shoot.
- Don't shoot!

812
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:04,102
I won't shoot if you won't shoot.

813
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:05,687
Don't shoot!

814
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:09,399
Don't shoot! Crossfire!

815
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:10,442
Attack!

816
01:09:16,615 --> 01:09:17,908
Catch of Freedom!

817
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:19,076
Monkey!

818
01:09:24,456 --> 01:09:26,750
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?

819
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:28,085
Step one: Free the Five.

820
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:29,461
What's step two?

821
01:09:29,502 --> 01:09:31,087
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

822
01:09:31,129 --> 01:09:32,214
Po!

823
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:34,424
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbor.

824
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:40,973
Nice!

825
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,893
Viper, Puppet of Death!

826
01:09:45,644 --> 01:09:46,645
Tigress!

827
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,405
Master Ox!

828
01:09:57,489 --> 01:10:00,117
- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.

829
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:02,995
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

830
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:11,837
Master Shifu!

831
01:10:14,173 --> 01:10:16,508
Quickly. Use their boats
to block the way.

832
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:28,353
Crane!

833
01:10:29,313 --> 01:10:31,231
Wings of Justice!

834
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:35,027
Yeah!

835
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:42,367
What?

836
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:55,380
I love you guys.

837
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:06,517
Why aren't we firing?

838
01:11:06,558 --> 01:11:09,728
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.

839
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:14,733
Fire! Fire! Fire at them!

840
01:11:14,775 --> 01:11:19,112
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said, fire at them!

841
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:20,197
Fire!

842
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:23,867
No.

843
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:32,417
Po!

844
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:09,538
Tigress?

845
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:01,173
As you wish.

846
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:03,300
Let's finish this.

847
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:27,658
Fire!

848
01:13:32,788 --> 01:13:36,333
Inner peace.
Inner peace. Inner peace.

849
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:03,110
Again!

850
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:11,451
Yeah!

851
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:15,706
Kill him! Somebody kill him!

852
01:14:37,936 --> 01:14:40,272
What? No!

853
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:49,948
Keep firing! Keep firing!

854
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:11,428
Skadoosh!

855
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:43,669
How did you...?

856
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:46,713
How did you do it?

857
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:53,303
You know, you just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

858
01:15:53,345 --> 01:15:56,640
Not that. How did you find peace?

859
01:15:56,682 --> 01:16:00,477
I took away your parents.
Everything.

860
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:02,896
I scarred you for life.

861
01:16:03,522 --> 01:16:07,150
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.

862
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:11,321
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

863
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:13,907
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess.

864
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:18,495
- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

865
01:16:18,537 --> 01:16:22,583
You gotta let go of that stuff from
the past 'cause it just doesn't matter.

866
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:27,254
The only thing that matters
is what you choose to be now.

867
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:28,839
You're right.

868
01:16:28,881 --> 01:16:31,258
Then I choose... this!

869
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:26,271
That was pretty hardcore.

870
01:17:35,572 --> 01:17:40,077
- Po, come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.

871
01:17:40,118 --> 01:17:43,914
It seems you have found inner peace.

872
01:17:43,956 --> 01:17:46,416
And at such a young age.

873
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:48,335
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

874
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:13,110
What do you mean, he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.

875
01:18:13,151 --> 01:18:15,654
All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

876
01:18:15,696 --> 01:18:18,574
How about some tofu birthday cake
instead, huh?

877
01:18:18,615 --> 01:18:21,577
You know, I think we'll just
try again another time.

878
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:22,995
When do you think he'll be back?

879
01:18:25,956 --> 01:18:30,085
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.

880
01:18:30,127 --> 01:18:33,589
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job. I'm his dad.

881
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:35,966
At least, I was his dad.

882
01:18:36,008 --> 01:18:39,803
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.

883
01:18:39,845 --> 01:18:43,515
But why? He's just one little panda.

884
01:18:59,031 --> 01:19:01,325
So, how did it go?

885
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:05,329
- Did you save China?
- Yep.

886
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:07,789
Well, I knew you would.

887
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:09,708
That's why I had new signs made.

888
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,127
"My son saved China.
You, too, can save.

889
01:19:12,169 --> 01:19:14,838
Buy one dumpling, get one free."

890
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,340
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

891
01:19:16,381 --> 01:19:19,051
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

892
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:23,931
There's something I should tell you.

893
01:19:26,725 --> 01:19:32,814
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.

894
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:36,360
I found out how I ended up
in that radish basket.

895
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:38,070
You did?

896
01:19:38,862 --> 01:19:40,447
I know who I am.

897
01:19:41,573 --> 01:19:42,699
You do?

898
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:46,245
I'm your son.

899
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:53,961
I love you, Dad.

900
01:19:55,546 --> 01:19:57,089
I love you, too, son.

901
01:20:01,134 --> 01:20:03,178
Delicious, fat radishes!

902
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,597
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

903
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:07,516
What are you talking about?
I'll cook.

904
01:20:07,558 --> 01:20:09,226
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!

905
01:20:09,268 --> 01:20:11,395
It's the least I can do.
You saved China.

906
01:20:11,436 --> 01:20:13,939
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

907
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:15,065
- Po.
- Dad.

908
01:20:15,107 --> 01:20:16,692
- Po!
- OK.

909
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:18,569
Let's both cook.

910
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:20,946
- Together.
- Together?

911
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:22,489
No, I'll cook.

912
01:20:57,482 --> 01:20:59,776
My son is alive!
