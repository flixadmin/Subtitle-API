1
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,441
BECKY: There's a big gap.

2
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:16,777
DAN: This feels like the
only route, let's keep going.

3
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:24,158
You okay?

4
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:29,262
It's all right, kid.
Never be easy.

5
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:31,726
Okay.

6
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,501
DAN: One... BECKY: Be careful.

7
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,203
DAN: Two, three!

8
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:39,173
BECKY: You okay?

9
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,669
Okay.

10
00:01:42,508 --> 00:01:43,837
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:44,872
DAN: Never better.

12
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:48,744
Okay.

13
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,520
Whoa, whoa, you're good. Shit.

14
00:01:56,555 --> 00:01:57,719
You're good. Yeah?

15
00:01:58,425 --> 00:01:59,425
You're good?

16
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:01,360
No.

17
00:02:01,395 --> 00:02:03,857
Okay, you've done
way scarier than this.

18
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:06,365
Remember A.J. Hackett,
Snake Dike.

19
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,268
Stupid singing competition.

20
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:09,665
God, you married this sad sack,

21
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,634
for Christ's sake.

22
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,471
Yeah? Okay. Okay.

23
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,837
One... Two...

24
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:18,905
Three!

25
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,611
Come on! I got you.

26
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:22,810
That's my girl.

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,683
HUNTER: Ew! Gross!

28
00:02:27,718 --> 00:02:29,454
You guys, get a room!

29
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,919
Here comes Ethan Hunt.

30
00:02:32,954 --> 00:02:35,295
Careful, H, there's loose
rock around the elbow.

31
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,726
Worry about your ropes, bitches.

32
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:39,299
I'm fine.

33
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:41,367
Whoo!

34
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:42,863
Try to keep up!

35
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:56,415
Taking your time there, hotshot.

36
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,385
BECKY: Hunter, you show off!

37
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,518
HUNTER: Whoo!

38
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:38,886
Dan!

39
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,594
BECKY: Dan!

40
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,509
HUNTER: Hold on, Dan.
Hold on, I'm coming.

41
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:47,796
BECKY: Dan, are you okay?

42
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,832
Just hold on. I'm coming down.

43
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,472
DAN: Come on. Come on.
I can't make it.

44
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:55,738
Oh, my God.
DAN: Okay, Becky, Becky.

45
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,069
I just need
a little more length.

46
00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:59,445
Can you un-clip? Are you secure?

47
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,908
Are you secure? Yeah.

48
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:02,679
Yeah, I'm... I'm secure.

49
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:04,659
Just un-clip and I'll be able
to swing to the rock.

50
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:06,485
Okay.
DAN: I think I can reach it.

51
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,585
Ready?

52
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,426
BECKY: Can you reach it?

53
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,823
DAN: Just... Just one second.

54
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:16,396
All right.
I think I can make it.

55
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:17,925
HUNTER: Hold on, Dan.

56
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,399
I'm almost there.

57
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:20,510
Just need
a little more momentum.

58
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:21,665
Okay.

59
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:23,964
DAN: No!

60
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:27,033
Dan!

61
00:04:52,093 --> 00:04:53,532
BECKY: Hey!

62
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:54,742
DAN: Hey, this is Becky and Dan.

63
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:55,699
Leave a message.

64
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,899
MAN: Hey, Becky, it's me.

65
00:04:57,934 --> 00:05:01,705
Look, I've tried to console you
every way I know how.

66
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,377
But I

67
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:06,743
I can't help you
if you don't pick up the phone.

68
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:09,449
Sweetheart,
I'm worried about you.

69
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:11,451
So whenever
you stop hating on me,

70
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,816
I am here.

71
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:45,485
DAN: Hey, what's up?

72
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:49,522
This is just the voice mail.

73
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,952
You've reached Dan.

74
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:52,833
Just leave a message,
I'll hit you back when I can.

75
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:54,626
Get it off at the beep.

76
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,694
Hey.

77
00:05:58,665 --> 00:05:59,796
Miss you.

78
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:11,137
Dad, what?
Are you stalking me now?

79
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,941
No, I just don't know
what else to do,

80
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:14,679
'cause you're not
answering your phone.

81
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:16,109
Take a hint.

82
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:17,528
I... I think this is getting
a little bit ridiculous.

83
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:19,046
"Ridiculous"?

84
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:21,752
You told me I shouldn't be
so broken up about him,

85
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:23,853
because he was an asshole. No.

86
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:25,888
I said that maybe he didn't
belong on this pedestal

87
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:27,791
that you were putting him up on,

88
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:30,101
that he wasn't this martyr that
you've been making him out to be.

89
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,927
This is how
you console your daughter?

90
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:34,193
I just want you to be able
to move on with your life.

91
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:38,505
I don't want to move on.
I miss him!

92
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,804
Every day, I miss the way
he looked at me.

93
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,079
I miss the way he made me feel.

94
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:43,136
Sweetie. Don't!

95
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:44,577
Don't what?

96
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,238
What do you think
you're doing, Becky?

97
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,053
Getting away from you.
You are not driving. Stop it.

98
00:06:48,077 --> 00:06:49,582
Fuck off!

99
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,177
You don't get to
talk to me like that.

100
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:54,147
Your mother and I, we
raised you better than that.

101
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:56,017
So getting shit-faced

102
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:58,657
and pushing the people away
that love you,

103
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,692
it's not gonna work.

104
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:01,792
All right, look,

105
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:04,564
a horrible thing
happened to you,

106
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,797
but you have to start
living your life again.

107
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:08,535
All right?

108
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,042
There's a whole big wide
world out there that needs you

109
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:11,802
and believe it or not,
I need you.

110
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:14,805
Let me give you a ride home.

111
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,204
I'd rather walk.

112
00:07:21,715 --> 00:07:23,011
Let me ask you something.

113
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:25,849
If roles reversed,

114
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:28,720
if it had been you
that had fallen that day,

115
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:30,788
do you think Dan
is standing out here alone?

116
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:33,725
Drowning in booze,
grief, sorrow,

117
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,727
whatever the hell this is?

118
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,027
He's not.

119
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:40,732
And you damn well know it.

120
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:44,538
God damn it, Becky,
I need you to try.

121
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:49,070
Do you know what I need, Dad?

122
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:51,270
I need you to leave me alone.

123
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,082
God damn it.

124
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,660
AUTOMATED VOICE: The number
you have called has been disconnected.

125
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:15,833
No.

126
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:18,066
No!

127
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:00,273
Hi! Hey.

128
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:03,045
You look, um...

129
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,618
Awful. Yeah.

130
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:06,312
Yeah, like
really freakin' awful.

131
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:07,786
Well, come here.

132
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,793
So, what brings you back?

133
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:16,289
Are you finally ready to rest?

134
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,127
I'll rest when I'm dead.

135
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,636
I have something that's planned.

136
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,132
And I need a partner in crime.

137
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:29,973
Look, your dad called me
a few weeks ago.

138
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:31,744
He didn't know
who else to turn to.

139
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,812
And he said that
you were in a bad place.

140
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:36,111
He had no right to do that.
He's worried about you.

141
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:37,343
It's coming up on a year.

142
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:39,686
He doesn't want you to be alone.

143
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:41,721
Look, the only thing
that drives me crazier

144
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:44,691
than Dan's boxed ashes
collecting dust in there,

145
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:47,826
is my best friend
stuck in here with him.

146
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:50,125
So I have something
that I wanna pitch you.

147
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,258
You're not gonna like it,

148
00:09:51,293 --> 00:09:53,128
but just try to keep
an open mind.

149
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:54,360
Look...

150
00:09:56,738 --> 00:09:59,805
The B-67 TV Tower.

151
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,807
It's only a six-hour drive
from here.

152
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:03,842
I was planning on
climbing it this weekend

153
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:06,075
and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.

154
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:10,849
It would be an adventure,

155
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:14,050
like old times.

156
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:16,118
And you could scatter
Dan's ashes on top.

157
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,990
I just...
I haven't climbed since

158
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,025
I get it.

159
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:24,137
But if you don't
confront your fears,

160
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:25,765
you are always
going to be afraid.

161
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,669
What is it that Dan used to say?

162
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:32,838
Don't die if you wanna live

163
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:35,368
or keep living
even if you're dying.

164
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:37,205
Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.

165
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,075
No, I'm sorry.

166
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,681
Hunter, I just... I can't.

167
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:44,982
It's like I know I
can't do it, I'm sorry.

168
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:46,786
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

169
00:10:46,821 --> 00:10:48,788
I can't. Hey, hey, it's okay.

170
00:10:48,823 --> 00:10:50,757
It's okay.

171
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:30,731
Morning, princess.

172
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:35,395
What's wrong?

173
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,804
"If you're scared of dying,
don't be afraid to live."

174
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:41,401
That's what Dan used to say.

175
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:44,976
Let's do it.

176
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:48,342
Let's climb your stupid tower.

177
00:11:48,377 --> 00:11:50,410
Oh, my God, Becky,
baby, I'm so excited!

178
00:11:58,057 --> 00:12:00,354
BECKY: I've never
actually seen this video.

179
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:03,797
Shit, I was really ripped.

180
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:06,129
Yeah! You're awesome.

181
00:12:06,164 --> 00:12:08,263
That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.

182
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,102
BECKY: Aw!

183
00:12:12,137 --> 00:12:15,237
Holy shit!
Look at your beaming face.

184
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,041
Now, who's this
in the photo with you?

185
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:19,076
I don't know. It's an oldie.

186
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:21,276
Who is it? Nobody.

187
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:23,212
Just give it back.
Hunter has a boyfriend.

188
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:25,379
It's nothing. Just some guy.

189
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:28,118
Oh, that some guy sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.

190
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:42,462
HUNTER: Yo, what's up, guys?

191
00:12:42,497 --> 00:12:44,970
Danger D,
and I'm back stateside, yo,

192
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:46,939
hashtag, super badass.

193
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,403
Okay, in my defense,

194
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:51,537
I may act like
a total dick on camera,

195
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:52,604
but it's worth it.

196
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,243
I get paid for this shit.

197
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:56,443
It's enough to keep me
traveling and you know me,

198
00:12:56,478 --> 00:12:59,182
I have to be doing dangerous
shit to keep my blood pumping,

199
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:01,184
so I might as well
monetize that.

200
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:04,022
I'm just saying if you're
gonna be a YouTuber,

201
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:05,991
why not be yourself?
You are awesome.

202
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:08,554
Natural born click-bait. No.

203
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:11,898
What we're doing here,
this is clickbait.

204
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:17,167
Excuse me?

205
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:19,235
Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone?

206
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,039
Power ain't free, ma'am.

207
00:13:21,074 --> 00:13:24,273
Oh, and do you know
where the B-67 TV Tower is?

208
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:25,439
We can't find it on the map.

209
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:28,981
You don't need a map.

210
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,444
You see that light way up there?

211
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:34,019
That's your tower.

212
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:36,087
That's insanely high.

213
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:39,926
What's with the light?

214
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:40,894
I thought you said
it was out of commission.

215
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,358
So aircraft can see it.

216
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:45,899
You know, this was once
the tallest structure in the U.S.

217
00:13:47,397 --> 00:13:50,101
Now it's just this old relic.

218
00:13:50,136 --> 00:13:52,169
They're due to tear it down
next winter.

219
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,073
Becky?

220
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:57,009
Becky?

221
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,044
What?
Give me your phone charger.

222
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:01,211
What are you doing?

223
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,380
A very cool life hack.

224
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,318
Now I'm just gonna
line up the prongs

225
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:11,419
with the elements in the lamp.

226
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:12,519
And...

227
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:17,095
How's that for a dumb YouTuber?

228
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:39,348
DAN: Hey, honey.

229
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:41,284
BECKY: Mm-hmm.
DAN: Did you sleep well?

230
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:48,687
I love you.

231
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,002
You're not gonna say it back?

232
00:14:57,368 --> 00:14:58,400
I am saying it.

233
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:00,337
One...

234
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:02,602
Four...

235
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:05,243
Three.

236
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,574
I love you.

237
00:15:28,432 --> 00:15:30,971
HUNTER: Hey, come
on, Becks. Sun's up.

238
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:40,409
What up, El Capitan?

239
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:43,445
I don't know, but something's
up, Sports Illustrated.

240
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,512
Tits for clicks.

241
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:50,782
Are you live streaming?

242
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,059
No, dude. Shoot now, post later.

243
00:15:53,094 --> 00:15:54,489
Oh, good.
I don't wanna be in it.

244
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:58,790
Hey, guys. Danger D here

245
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,694
and I have somebody
very special for you to meet.

246
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:05,269
Say hello, Becky C. Hi.

247
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:07,040
And we have something

248
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:10,703
totally bat shit crazy
for you guys today.

249
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:14,641
The B-67 TV Tower.

250
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:18,117
This bad boy is
over 2,000 feet tall.

251
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:19,712
And your home girls

252
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:22,451
are gonna be climbing
to the tippy, tippy top.

253
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,136
But don't worry, Becky C,
because you're safe with...

254
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
BECKY: Watch out!

255
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:36,729
Holy shit!

256
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:37,829
Whoo!

257
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,073
Eight more lives, baby!

258
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,572
Shit.

259
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:28,187
Looks like
we're walking from here.

260
00:17:28,222 --> 00:17:30,123
How far? I don't know.

261
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:34,589
Like a mile?

262
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:35,854
Maybe two-ish?

263
00:17:40,531 --> 00:17:42,531
BECKY: Damn, it's hot.

264
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,797
HUNTER: You'll cool down
once we get some air time.

265
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,646
BECKY: We've got
enough water, you think?

266
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,143
HUNTER: Water's check.
Harnesses check.

267
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:52,673
Super badass 4K drone check.

268
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,313
Selfie stick,
all the essentials.

269
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:56,710
BECKY: Food?

270
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:57,821
Nah, we'll be back in time
before lunch...

271
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,614
Oh, Jesus.

272
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:04,685
Holy shit, they're big.

273
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:11,362
It's still alive.

274
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:12,528
Get off of him!

275
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:14,134
Hey! Hey! Go away!

276
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:16,499
Just go. Go!

277
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,903
BECKY: Poor thing.

278
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,282
Pricks.

279
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,747
Survival of the fittest, right?

280
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:37,751
You'd do the same
if you were starving out here.

281
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:41,953
"Feeling peckish." Hunter.

282
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,493
What?

283
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:44,659
That's funny.

284
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:00,543
HUNTER: Holy shit, 300 likes.

285
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:01,907
BECKY: Oh, wow.

286
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:05,482
HUNTER: 350.

287
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:07,957
BECKY: I wonder how many of
your followers are serial killers.

288
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:11,785
Holy shit.

289
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:15,393
Looks a lot bigger
up close, right?

290
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:19,496
This is sick.

291
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:22,697
This is awful.

292
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,469
Hey, guys!

293
00:19:25,504 --> 00:19:27,438
Danger D here.

294
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:31,310
And we are at the foot of this
stomach-churningly massive

295
00:19:31,345 --> 00:19:33,807
fourth-highest structure
in the U.S.

296
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:36,249
We're gonna begin
our grueling journey

297
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:38,713
with an 1,800-foot ladder climb

298
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:41,320
inside a steel cage.

299
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:42,585
And then after the cage

300
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,886
we have a 200-foot,
vertigo-inspiring mast

301
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:48,624
with an external ladder.

302
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:51,627
Your girl's gonna be wide open
to the elements.

303
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:54,663
And then beyond that,
we have the precipice.

304
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:57,798
The ledge.
The top of the world, Ma.

305
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,865
BECKY: Hunter?

306
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:05,476
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

307
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:06,972
Babe, of course you can.

308
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,842
No, um, I really can't.
I'm, like.

309
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,713
I'm petrified.
I'm, like, shaking.

310
00:20:12,782 --> 00:20:13,847
I'm here.

311
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:16,553
Take a breath.

312
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,690
After Dan died, I was
afraid of my own shadow.

313
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,759
But I pushed through.

314
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:27,465
I overcame the fear.
I took control.

315
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,601
Do not let this fear
consume you.

316
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:34,703
Come at it head on
and kick its ass.

317
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:37,937
If you can beat it,
you can beat anything.

318
00:20:37,972 --> 00:20:41,380
And I'm right here
beside you the whole time.

319
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,615
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

320
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,486
So shut your shit.

321
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:49,751
And let's do this.

322
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:53,722
BECKY: God, Hunter.

323
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:55,493
You know,
that's the kind of shit

324
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:57,055
you should be posting
on Instagram.

325
00:20:58,058 --> 00:20:59,058
Come on.

326
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,800
Dude, this is so cool.

327
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:07,373
Holy shit.

328
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,344
Look at this.

329
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:14,347
BECKY: Damn it, Hunter.
You are such an asshole.

330
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:16,910
What are you getting us into?

331
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:18,109
HUNTER: Don't worry.

332
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,452
We've got 50 feet of rope
between us.

333
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,421
We're clipped in
and we're all good.

334
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:24,885
Okay.

335
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,392
One rung at a time,

336
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:27,827
and let me know
if you have to rest.

337
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:00,789
Okay, okay.

338
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:11,404
HUNTER: See?

339
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,570
It's easy.

340
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:17,575
Sure.

341
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:21,172
You're doing great. Come on.

342
00:23:05,922 --> 00:23:07,119
You okay?

343
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:09,957
No.

344
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:12,729
You're doing great.

345
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:14,193
Come on.

346
00:23:51,902 --> 00:23:52,902
Hunter?

347
00:23:55,741 --> 00:23:57,202
Hunter? Yeah?

348
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:59,171
Can we rest a moment?

349
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:00,645
I need a drink.

350
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Of course.

351
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:06,046
Those guy lines means
we're halfway up.

352
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:11,524
Perfect spot.

353
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:14,791
Wanna know something crazy?

354
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:17,057
What?

355
00:24:17,092 --> 00:24:18,795
Halfway up.

356
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,732
That means we've
climbed about 1,000 feet.

357
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,965
So we've climbed the height
of the Eiffel Tower.

358
00:24:25,606 --> 00:24:27,166
Please don't say
shit like that, Hunter.

359
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,905
Whoa!

360
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,842
There's the motel.
And the diner.

361
00:24:32,877 --> 00:24:36,109
No way. Looks like
a little toy town.

362
00:24:40,984 --> 00:24:42,621
Let's just get this over with.

363
00:24:42,656 --> 00:24:43,656
Yeah.

364
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:48,693
Come on.

365
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:49,728
Catch up.

366
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:10,913
That's it.

367
00:25:10,948 --> 00:25:12,783
Becky, you're doing amazing.

368
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:17,755
Come on!

369
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,020
Come on, Becky!

370
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:37,940
Okay.

371
00:25:37,975 --> 00:25:40,338
This is the end
of the internal ladder.

372
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,714
One step at a time, okay.
You got this.

373
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,719
The next 200 feet is external.

374
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,951
I'm not gonna lie.

375
00:25:48,986 --> 00:25:50,282
It's gonna get
a little bit crazy

376
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:51,954
when we're out of the cage
in the open.

377
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:53,087
But don't panic.

378
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:06,738
BECKY: Hunter.

379
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,069
Hunter!

380
00:26:08,104 --> 00:26:09,708
Hunter! Hunter!

381
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:12,205
Becky! You gotta come up.
It's so sick!

382
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:15,142
BECKY: Okay.

383
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:29,728
Hunter?

384
00:26:29,763 --> 00:26:31,125
I'm here.

385
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,995
It's just like 200 feet more,
that's all.

386
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,700
I can't!

387
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:36,196
Yes, you can!

388
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,035
Just look up and only up.

389
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,405
You're doing great.
You got this.

390
00:26:50,718 --> 00:26:51,750
Okay.

391
00:26:52,214 --> 00:26:53,246
Okay.

392
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:05,764
Okay.

393
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,051
Yeah! You're killing it!

394
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:30,118
Whoo!

395
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,222
You're okay.

396
00:27:36,764 --> 00:27:38,390
Remember, only look up.

397
00:27:44,904 --> 00:27:46,299
What the hell are we doing?

398
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:48,367
Hey!

399
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:50,105
Stop over thinking.

400
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,942
BECKY: How?
HUNTER: I don't know.

401
00:27:51,977 --> 00:27:54,439
Concentrate on
something else, like...

402
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:58,278
Sing a, a nursery rhyme
or some shit.

403
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:02,920
BECKY: Okay, okay.

404
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:05,186
Okay.

405
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:07,518
♪ Ring around the roses

406
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:10,224
♪ Pocket full of posies

407
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,162
♪ Ashes, ashes
We all fall down ♪

408
00:28:14,197 --> 00:28:15,867
Down!

409
00:28:17,134 --> 00:28:18,463
I wouldn't have picked that one.

410
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:21,840
Wow.

411
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,501
Okay. Okay, Becks,

412
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,911
this is gonna look a
little bit worse than it is.

413
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:29,848
Ah, what the hell, Hunter?
Let's just go back down!

414
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,922
Becky, if I let you go back now,

415
00:28:37,957 --> 00:28:39,253
fear wins.

416
00:28:39,288 --> 00:28:41,959
And I'm not going
to let that happen.

417
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:18,226
HUNTER: It's okay, Becks.

418
00:29:20,296 --> 00:29:21,328
It's okay.

419
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:22,835
I've got your weight.

420
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:26,971
BECKY: Thanks. Okay.

421
00:29:44,518 --> 00:29:45,924
HUNTER: Reach up.

422
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,159
BECKY: Okay. HUNTER: Oh, yeah.

423
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:56,429
Okay.

424
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:59,135
Smooth as sailing
to the top now.

425
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,235
You got this.

426
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:05,075
I actually really
do hate you, Hunter.

427
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:08,408
Hey, does this ladder
feel loose to you?

428
00:30:12,051 --> 00:30:14,018
Stop, you dick, Hunter!

429
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:15,954
Sorry.

430
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:25,161
What was that?

431
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:27,559
HUNTER: Come on,
we're almost there.

432
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:33,169
Come on. Okay.

433
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:04,234
HUNTER: Wow.

434
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:10,140
Becky, you're not gonna
believe this.

435
00:31:10,175 --> 00:31:11,535
You gotta come up here.
I'm coming.

436
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,178
BECKY: Okay. HUNTER: Whoo!

437
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:17,246
BECKY: Okay.

438
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,088
Hunter.

439
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,492
Hey, trust me.

440
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:35,968
Okay, okay.

441
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,343
HUNTER: Fuck, Becky!

442
00:31:48,378 --> 00:31:50,246
Oh, I'm here. Oh, my God.

443
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:01,092
Oh, my God.

444
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,489
HUNTER: We did it, Becks!

445
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:03,622
I knew you could.

446
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:06,064
BOTH: Whoo!

447
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,643
BOTH: Whoo!

448
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:29,054
HUNTER: Here we go!

449
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:34,719
HUNTER: On top
of the goddamn world!

450
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:36,259
BECKY: Whoo!

451
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,132
HUNTER: Do you wanna try?

452
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,597
Shit! Hunter, stop!

453
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,434
Just focus on
getting a good shot.

454
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:48,337
I didn't wear this
stupid bra for nothing.

455
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:49,503
No.

456
00:32:49,538 --> 00:32:50,702
No, Hunter. Whoo!

457
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,277
HUNTER: Swoop it around!

458
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:58,347
Seize your day!

459
00:32:58,382 --> 00:33:00,580
Okay. Oh, my God.

460
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:14,099
How'd it look?

461
00:33:14,134 --> 00:33:16,497
Insane! Insane. Crazy.

462
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:20,765
HUNTER:
Let's get this bad boy back.

463
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,538
Holy shit, so sick, dude.

464
00:33:24,573 --> 00:33:27,310
Okay. Now the ultimate, Becks.

465
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:28,608
Your turn.

466
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,549
What? No.

467
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:37,518
Do you want to kick fear
in the dick or not?

468
00:33:37,553 --> 00:33:41,159
No. No, Hunter.

469
00:33:41,194 --> 00:33:43,128
The old Becky
would have done it.

470
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:46,824
Just saying... Dude.

471
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,365
Here. I'll hold your hand.

472
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,834
Okay. Yeah?

473
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,209
Okay.

474
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,574
Shit.

475
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:02,312
Come on, come on!

476
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:05,183
You can do this.

477
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,286
You can do it.

478
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:12,586
BECKY: Okay, okay, okay.

479
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:15,589
HUNTER: I got you. BECKY: Okay.

480
00:34:15,624 --> 00:34:17,195
Okay. Whoa!

481
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,768
HUNTER: You can trust me.
BECKY: Whoa, okay.

482
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:20,632
HUNTER: I've got you, Becks.
BECKY: Oh, my God.

483
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:23,135
HUNTER: Careful over the ledge.

484
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:26,138
Take it easy.

485
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:28,734
Okay, I've got you.
I've got you.

486
00:34:35,215 --> 00:34:36,544
Open your eyes.

487
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:41,318
Whoo-hoo!

488
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:49,557
Okay, just one more.

489
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,366
HUNTER:
You're coming up right now.

490
00:35:00,207 --> 00:35:01,536
HUNTER: My God, you did it.

491
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:04,473
You did it!
You did it, you idiot.

492
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,577
Yes! Look.

493
00:35:09,612 --> 00:35:11,810
Look how amazing these are.
Oh, my God.

494
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:13,746
Whoa!

495
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,489
Next time you are
ever afraid of anything,

496
00:35:20,524 --> 00:35:22,293
I want you to look at these

497
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,295
and know that you have
nothing to be afraid of.

498
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:28,596
Thank you. Yeah.

499
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:30,169
I'm really proud of you.

500
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,732
Dan would be, too.

501
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:37,837
Yeah.

502
00:35:45,912 --> 00:35:47,351
Okay.

503
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,782
Okay, it's time.

504
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:28,656
You and I were one, Dan.

505
00:36:30,429 --> 00:36:32,297
And whenever I needed a laugh,

506
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,268
you told me
one of your shit jokes.

507
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,341
And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on,

508
00:36:43,376 --> 00:36:44,474
it was yours.

509
00:36:47,743 --> 00:36:49,842
And now you're gone and I'm.

510
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,419
I don't feel whole anymore.

511
00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:04,527
I miss you, um,
just so much and I'm.

512
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,827
I love you.

513
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,665
Goodbye, Dan.

514
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:29,420
Hey. I'm sorry.

515
00:37:31,017 --> 00:37:33,391
I just didn't expect it
to hit me like that.

516
00:37:34,394 --> 00:37:35,921
Yeah.

517
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:37,989
I've just been
so far away for so long.

518
00:37:39,564 --> 00:37:41,762
It just didn't really
feel real until then.

519
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:48,406
Come on.

520
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:53,576
Let's get back down
on earth, okay?

521
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:55,490
I don't know about you,
but I really need to pee.

522
00:37:55,514 --> 00:37:57,554
I've needed to pee since
we passed the Eiffel Tower.

523
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,616
Okay?

524
00:38:00,651 --> 00:38:02,717
Okay, home time.

525
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,114
BECKY: Home time.

526
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,457
Harnesses? Harnesses.

527
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,596
HUNTER: Think of the
ice-cold beers waiting for us.

528
00:38:13,631 --> 00:38:14,894
BECKY: Oh, stop.

529
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:19,866
I've got you. Okay, slowly.

530
00:38:19,901 --> 00:38:21,131
BECKY: Okay.

531
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,968
Uh, I'm just getting
a stitch here.

532
00:38:23,003 --> 00:38:24,706
Okay, okay.

533
00:38:42,693 --> 00:38:43,693
Okay.

534
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:01,579
Hunter!

535
00:39:11,524 --> 00:39:13,018
No!

536
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:25,635
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, holy shit.

537
00:39:27,804 --> 00:39:30,607
Don't let go. Yeah, I got you.

538
00:39:30,642 --> 00:39:31,674
Hunter!

539
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,786
Oh, God, please don't drop me.

540
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,723
Don't drop me.

541
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:00,968
Becks?

542
00:40:06,678 --> 00:40:07,941
I've got you, Becks.

543
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:12,583
BECKY: I can see the ladder.

544
00:40:27,226 --> 00:40:28,896
HUNTER: I've got you.

545
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:34,605
I just died almost.

546
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:40,710
Oh, my God.

547
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:43,075
Did that really just happen?

548
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,517
Oh, my... Jesus Christ!

549
00:40:45,552 --> 00:40:46,716
I wish we'd filmed that.

550
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:50,214
Oh, you're here.

551
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:52,590
Let's get back on the ground
before I actually pee myself.

552
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:53,822
Yeah.

553
00:40:53,857 --> 00:40:54,889
Okay, take two.

554
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:05,834
HUNTER: Oh, no.

555
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,870
The ladder.

556
00:41:08,707 --> 00:41:09,772
It's gone.

557
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,627
Hunter, how do we get down?

558
00:41:29,662 --> 00:41:30,793
Shit!

559
00:41:30,828 --> 00:41:31,972
Please tell me there's
a way to go down.

560
00:41:31,996 --> 00:41:34,324
There's nothing on the pole
I can get a good foothold on.

561
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,194
No. Oh, no.

562
00:41:36,229 --> 00:41:37,899
BECKY: No, no, no.

563
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:40,132
Um, there must be something.

564
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:43,608
BECKY: No. Shit.

565
00:41:43,643 --> 00:41:45,170
I don't have a signal.

566
00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:48,910
I don't get it, either.

567
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:51,715
I'm sure there's something,

568
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,189
I'm sure it's just
really spotty up here.

569
00:41:53,213 --> 00:41:54,894
No, we're too freaking high.
There's no signal up here.

570
00:41:54,918 --> 00:41:56,346
We're gonna be okay.

571
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:57,798
Freaking out is not gonna
help anything right now.

572
00:41:57,822 --> 00:41:59,085
So just take a breath.

573
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,691
We're stuck on
a pizza-sized platform

574
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,187
in the middle of nowhere,
Hunter.

575
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:04,761
Becky, freaking out
is not gonna help anything.

576
00:42:04,796 --> 00:42:06,224
It's not gonna help, okay.

577
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:07,930
It's okay.

578
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:12,362
I'm sure we can...
Wait, Hunter. Hunter, Hunter.

579
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:13,737
Look at this.

580
00:42:13,772 --> 00:42:15,640
Oh, my God.

581
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:17,708
Binoculars. Amazing. Okay.

582
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:19,875
BECKY: We have a flare.

583
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:20,910
Okay.

584
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,945
Okay.

585
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,078
This is great news. Okay.

586
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:36,254
Oh, shit, our bag is down there.

587
00:42:37,994 --> 00:42:40,093
Oh, man, our water's in there.

588
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,206
Shit, we're gonna die of thirst.

589
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,032
No. No. We don't have water.

590
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:46,638
No, think about it... The noise!

591
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:47,980
That is how you die
when you're stranded.

592
00:42:48,004 --> 00:42:49,685
The noise that this thing made
when it crashed,

593
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:52,270
there is no way
nobody heard that.

594
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:54,646
Okay? I'm... I'm sure that there

595
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:57,913
are like multiple calls to 911
as we speak.

596
00:42:57,948 --> 00:42:59,211
Do you really think so?

597
00:43:00,016 --> 00:43:01,246
Yeah.

598
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:02,357
Yeah, the cavalry
is coming, okay?

599
00:43:02,381 --> 00:43:04,821
We just... We just have to wait.

600
00:43:04,856 --> 00:43:06,790
Okay. Okay.

601
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:10,321
Holy...

602
00:43:10,356 --> 00:43:11,927
What? What? Becky, your leg.

603
00:43:11,962 --> 00:43:13,665
My God.

604
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,360
What the hell?

605
00:43:16,395 --> 00:43:18,065
I didn't even notice this.

606
00:43:18,738 --> 00:43:20,265
Whoa!

607
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,103
Um, whoa!
Come here. Let's compress it.

608
00:43:23,138 --> 00:43:24,841
Are you okay? I know.
Ow! It really hurts.

609
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:26,216
Can you just like...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

610
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,877
Can you warn me? Okay.

611
00:43:27,912 --> 00:43:29,714
Count of three? Yeah. One...

612
00:43:29,749 --> 00:43:32,717
Two... Sorry. I'm really sorry.

613
00:43:32,752 --> 00:43:34,015
I know. Oh, man.

614
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,984
Are you okay?

615
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:38,217
Yeah, I know I'm like,
I'm okay. It's like.

616
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:45,191
I really have to pee.

617
00:43:45,226 --> 00:43:46,995
HUNTER: Just go. BECKY: No.

618
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,228
HUNTER: Just pee.
No, it's fine. I can hold it.

619
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:50,867
I just need to get comfortable.

620
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:01,383
HUNTER: Can you go any farther?

621
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,473
It's, like, spraying.

622
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:05,475
Okay, careful over the ledge.
I'm trying.

623
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,477
Stop looking at me.

624
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:10,414
Oh, God. That's a relief.

625
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:14,253
I'm just grateful
you didn't need to shit.

626
00:44:14,288 --> 00:44:16,420
Okay, well, we should find
a way to get comfortable,

627
00:44:16,455 --> 00:44:18,415
'cause I think we're gonna
be up here for a while.

628
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:21,327
All right.

629
00:44:26,465 --> 00:44:27,871
All right!

630
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:35,846
Do you really think
someone's coming?

631
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:39,245
One million percent.

632
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:23,256
Hey, Danger D,
what's happening, guys?

633
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:26,160
I'll tell you what's happenin',
Becky C.

634
00:45:26,195 --> 00:45:31,000
We are stuck at the top of a
2,000-foot tower with no way down.

635
00:45:31,035 --> 00:45:34,069
And I shot some of the best
goddamn footage of my life.

636
00:45:34,104 --> 00:45:35,840
And no way to upload it.

637
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:37,635
That's what worrying you
about the situation?

638
00:45:38,372 --> 00:45:40,240
It's quite ironic.

639
00:45:40,275 --> 00:45:42,352
Well, don't worry, you'll
still be famous if you fall,

640
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:44,376
as the girl who died
taking a selfie.

641
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:46,411
Now, that is ironic.

642
00:45:46,446 --> 00:45:49,150
I would like to be remembered
for my life, not my death.

643
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:51,119
Thank you very much.

644
00:45:51,154 --> 00:45:52,923
Hashtag, life over death.

645
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,255
Hashtag, Becky's a dick hole.

646
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,224
Hashtag, Hunter says

647
00:45:57,259 --> 00:45:58,841
she's doing this YouTube
thing for the money,

648
00:45:58,865 --> 00:46:01,096
but really I think
she's just like a "like" whore.

649
00:46:01,131 --> 00:46:02,262
It's not like that.

650
00:46:02,297 --> 00:46:04,264
Okay, what is it like then?

651
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:06,332
Come on, show us who you are.

652
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:07,564
Show us Shiloh Hunter.

653
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:10,138
Tell us why you vlog.

654
00:46:12,439 --> 00:46:14,538
Okay, firstly,

655
00:46:14,573 --> 00:46:16,045
you're an asshole.

656
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,475
Hmm. Yeah.

657
00:46:18,247 --> 00:46:19,345
Secondly,

658
00:46:21,118 --> 00:46:22,315
um...

659
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,353
And this is gonna sound stupid,

660
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,961
but I do this because of Dan.

661
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:38,430
What happened...

662
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,905
It just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

663
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:47,439
And I want to spread that
message, that life is short,

664
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:48,605
too short.

665
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:52,048
So, you gotta use every moment.

666
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:55,414
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

667
00:47:06,163 --> 00:47:07,525
That was amazing.

668
00:47:09,364 --> 00:47:12,167
Wow, I mean, I told you,
you should just be yourself.

669
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:14,939
That was really great.

670
00:47:18,472 --> 00:47:20,307
Should I kill Danger D?

671
00:47:20,342 --> 00:47:21,539
Mm-hmm.

672
00:47:21,574 --> 00:47:23,277
I'll help you bury the body.

673
00:47:40,395 --> 00:47:42,296
HUNTER: Oh, shit.

674
00:47:42,331 --> 00:47:44,067
There's like
an old RV thing down there.

675
00:47:44,102 --> 00:47:45,332
Can I see?

676
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:47,202
Just past the gate,
a little over.

677
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,503
BECKY: Yeah.

678
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:52,537
That looks abandoned.

679
00:47:54,574 --> 00:47:56,178
It's been five hours.

680
00:47:56,213 --> 00:47:58,015
If anyone called 911,
they'd be here by now.

681
00:48:15,364 --> 00:48:16,396
Oh, my God.

682
00:48:17,234 --> 00:48:18,596
Holy shit.

683
00:48:18,631 --> 00:48:21,731
Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here,

684
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:23,304
but we definitely
did down there.

685
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:24,701
Remember, I got all those likes?

686
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,076
Shit.

687
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:28,639
Okay.

688
00:48:28,674 --> 00:48:30,190
Okay, so we don't know at
what point we lost service.

689
00:48:30,214 --> 00:48:31,642
Maybe it was just up here

690
00:48:31,677 --> 00:48:33,325
because of some
like interference with the...

691
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:34,711
The broadcast antenna. Yeah.

692
00:48:34,746 --> 00:48:36,526
I think you're definitely
onto something, Hunter.

693
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,319
Okay, we have 50 feet of rope.

694
00:48:38,354 --> 00:48:40,123
We can try to fish for coverage.

695
00:48:40,158 --> 00:48:42,389
I just need something
to secure this with.

696
00:48:42,424 --> 00:48:44,589
My hair tie. Yeah, perfect.

697
00:48:44,624 --> 00:48:45,624
Okay.

698
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:48,131
Okay.

699
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,506
Can you message
emergency services?

700
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,727
I don't think so.

701
00:48:50,762 --> 00:48:52,135
But I have
over 60,000 followers.

702
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,433
Okay.

703
00:48:53,468 --> 00:49:00,605
"Help us. Stuck on B-67 Tower.
Call 911."

704
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,046
It's ready to post.

705
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:03,575
We should hear it when it sends.

706
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:11,550
Come on, come on.

707
00:49:12,124 --> 00:49:13,288
Okay.

708
00:49:14,258 --> 00:49:15,258
Okay.

709
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,131
Let's see if I can get lower.

710
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,795
BECKY: Just be careful.

711
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,204
HUNTER: Got it, okay. Come on.

712
00:49:33,673 --> 00:49:35,178
That's the end.

713
00:49:35,213 --> 00:49:37,345
I didn't hear anything.
I didn't, either.

714
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,742
I don't think it posted.

715
00:49:41,813 --> 00:49:43,681
HUNTER:
Okay, maybe I can get lower.

716
00:49:45,223 --> 00:49:46,618
What? What do you mean? Just

717
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:47,853
I've got it. I've got an idea.

718
00:49:55,497 --> 00:49:57,794
Careful, Hunter. Feels solid.

719
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,925
BECKY: Are you okay?
HUNTER: Yeah, I'm okay.

720
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:09,311
Okay.

721
00:50:09,346 --> 00:50:11,214
BECKY: Oh, my God. HUNTER: Shit.

722
00:50:11,249 --> 00:50:12,292
BECKY: Careful. HUNTER: Shit.

723
00:50:12,316 --> 00:50:13,744
Oh, my God, Hunter.

724
00:50:13,779 --> 00:50:15,680
BECKY: Are you okay?
HUNTER: Yeah.

725
00:50:15,715 --> 00:50:16,995
BECKY: Oh, my God. HUNTER: Yeah.

726
00:50:19,785 --> 00:50:21,521
Careful. Shit.

727
00:50:30,169 --> 00:50:31,409
I don't hear anything. Nothing.

728
00:50:31,434 --> 00:50:32,763
Okay, you need to come back up.

729
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:37,702
Shit.

730
00:50:45,415 --> 00:50:46,415
I got it.

731
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,426
Did it post?

732
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,692
No.

733
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,267
What do we do now? I don't know.

734
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:09,470
Wait, hold on.

735
00:51:09,505 --> 00:51:11,604
We know there's a signal
at the base for sure.

736
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:12,671
Yeah.

737
00:51:12,706 --> 00:51:14,739
What if we just drop the phone?

738
00:51:14,774 --> 00:51:16,422
Okay, but what if my phone
just shatters into a million pieces?

739
00:51:16,446 --> 00:51:17,841
Not if we reinforce it somehow,

740
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:19,516
so it doesn't like
the egg drop challenge.

741
00:51:19,548 --> 00:51:21,383
Yeah. Okay, shit.

742
00:51:21,418 --> 00:51:24,419
Um, we just need something to...
To put it in.

743
00:51:24,454 --> 00:51:26,190
Yeah. This.

744
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:28,588
It's welded on.

745
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:30,392
My shoe's too flimsy.

746
00:51:30,427 --> 00:51:33,296
Your shoe? Yeah, perfect.

747
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:34,792
Okay, got it.

748
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:40,270
We need some padding.
Can we use your sock?

749
00:51:41,867 --> 00:51:43,702
Yeah. Okay.

750
00:51:44,738 --> 00:51:46,309
BECKY: Okay.

751
00:51:48,808 --> 00:51:51,281
We still need something
more substantial.

752
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:53,877
Oh, Hunter.

753
00:51:53,912 --> 00:51:55,549
Your push-up bra.

754
00:51:55,584 --> 00:51:57,815
That is more substantial. Yeah.

755
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,817
Dying to get
this thing off, anyway.

756
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:03,227
Thank you, VS.

757
00:52:05,363 --> 00:52:06,824
Okay.

758
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:08,529
HUNTER: Hope it's strong enough.

759
00:52:08,564 --> 00:52:10,399
BECKY: Shove it real good.

760
00:52:13,767 --> 00:52:14,799
Okay.

761
00:52:17,573 --> 00:52:18,638
Here goes nothing.

762
00:52:33,754 --> 00:52:35,226
BECKY: Did it work?

763
00:52:35,261 --> 00:52:36,621
HUNTER: I don't know.
I can't tell.

764
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:52,870
BECKY: Do you see anything?

765
00:52:52,905 --> 00:52:54,608
HUNTER: No, nothing.

766
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:56,775
Don't worry.

767
00:52:57,745 --> 00:52:58,843
They're coming.

768
00:53:05,588 --> 00:53:08,886
Holy shit!
There's a freaking guy!

769
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:11,394
BECKY: What?
HUNTER: Oh, my God. Yes.

770
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:12,626
And a dog, too.

771
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,696
Hey! Up here! Hey, help us!

772
00:53:19,767 --> 00:53:22,570
Look, I sent you the check, man.
Come on.

773
00:53:22,605 --> 00:53:24,968
I need that...

774
00:53:25,003 --> 00:53:26,904
BECKY: Hey!
HUNTER: Hey, boy! Big boy!

775
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:33,482
Parker.

776
00:53:34,749 --> 00:53:36,749
Come! Come on, boy.

777
00:53:36,784 --> 00:53:38,014
HUNTER: No, no, no, no, no.

778
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,424
Shit!

779
00:53:41,756 --> 00:53:42,920
Hey!

780
00:53:45,463 --> 00:53:46,627
Let's go.

781
00:53:49,027 --> 00:53:50,697
HUNTER: God damn it,
they're getting away.

782
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:06,713
Parker.

783
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:09,782
BECKY: He got the shoe.

784
00:54:09,817 --> 00:54:11,553
Hey! Up here!
Look up here. Please!

785
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,058
Hey! Hey!

786
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,532
He's walking! Hey!

787
00:54:30,574 --> 00:54:32,343
No, no, no, turn around!
Turn around!

788
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:33,542
Right here!

789
00:54:33,577 --> 00:54:34,609
Hey!

790
00:54:35,942 --> 00:54:38,074
Shit! Shit! Hey!

791
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:42,518
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.

792
00:54:42,553 --> 00:54:44,355
Do not fire the flare,
he's not looking.

793
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,631
BECKY: This might be
our only chance.

794
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:47,688
No, no, no, he's not looking.

795
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,757
Wait.

796
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:52,660
Hold on.
There's somebody by the RV.

797
00:54:52,695 --> 00:54:54,662
He's setting up
a grill or some shit.

798
00:54:54,697 --> 00:54:55,993
BECKY: Okay.

799
00:54:56,028 --> 00:54:57,709
And we'll fire the flare
when the sun goes down

800
00:54:57,733 --> 00:54:59,568
in like... In like an hour.

801
00:54:59,603 --> 00:55:00,883
We've only got one shot at this.

802
00:55:02,705 --> 00:55:03,968
Oh, damn.

803
00:55:04,003 --> 00:55:05,068
BECKY: What?

804
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:07,741
They're making ribs. Oh, no.

805
00:55:07,776 --> 00:55:09,413
And they have really cold beer.

806
00:55:09,448 --> 00:55:10,546
Don't.

807
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,729
These guys
are definitely a couple.

808
00:55:29,732 --> 00:55:32,436
Dirty weekend away.

809
00:55:32,471 --> 00:55:33,602
I'm jealous.

810
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,820
Hey, hey, hey.
They're finishing up.

811
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,162
It's now or never,
fire the flare.

812
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:57,494
Is it dark enough? Uh-huh.

813
00:55:57,529 --> 00:55:59,760
Okay.

814
00:55:59,795 --> 00:56:01,025
Shit. Shit. What the hell?

815
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,862
Why isn't it firing? I fired it.

816
00:56:02,897 --> 00:56:04,710
I cocked it, maybe there's
a safety or something?

817
00:56:04,734 --> 00:56:06,547
Shit. Okay, they're
going in, they're going in.

818
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:07,746
You have to do the flare now.
BECKY: I'm trying.

819
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:08,879
HUNTER: Get it to go.
It's stuck.

820
00:56:08,903 --> 00:56:10,474
Okay, I got it. I got it.

821
00:56:15,976 --> 00:56:18,581
MAN: Hey, Randy,
come check this shit out.

822
00:56:18,616 --> 00:56:20,781
Okay, give me your phone. Okay.

823
00:56:22,752 --> 00:56:24,785
Hey, sons of bitches, up here!

824
00:56:25,788 --> 00:56:27,854
Holy shit! Check this out.

825
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:30,560
Up here! Hey!

826
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,704
BECKY: Wait, wait, wait,
they're looking at us.

827
00:56:31,728 --> 00:56:32,760
What? They can see us.

828
00:56:32,795 --> 00:56:33,926
Oh, my God!

829
00:56:33,961 --> 00:56:35,224
Holy shit! Oh, my God,

830
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:37,765
let me see, let me see,
let me see.

831
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,470
BECKY: Oh, my God,
they're coming.

832
00:56:40,671 --> 00:56:41,703
BOTH: Hey!

833
00:56:45,544 --> 00:56:46,884
BECKY: Holy shit,
they found the car.

834
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:48,611
They found our car,
they found our car.

835
00:56:51,044 --> 00:56:52,813
They have a... A crowbar.

836
00:56:52,848 --> 00:56:54,288
They're probably
gonna open the gate.

837
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,883
Okay. BECKY: Okay.

838
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:58,027
HUNTER: Wait, what the hell?

839
00:56:58,051 --> 00:56:59,556
BECKY: Wait, what's going on?

840
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:01,558
They stopped. What?

841
00:57:01,593 --> 00:57:03,857
Quit chatting,
go open the freakin' gate.

842
00:57:03,892 --> 00:57:06,728
No. No, no, no. What the hell?

843
00:57:06,763 --> 00:57:07,872
They're stealing
my freakin' car!

844
00:57:07,896 --> 00:57:08,961
What?

845
00:57:08,996 --> 00:57:11,128
No, you sons of bitches! Hey!

846
00:57:11,163 --> 00:57:13,229
HUNTER: You asshole!
What the hell?

847
00:57:13,264 --> 00:57:15,165
No! I need to see it!

848
00:57:16,971 --> 00:57:21,138
Oh, my God. No, no!
Die, you freakin' assholes!

849
00:58:11,927 --> 00:58:14,631
Okay. New rule.

850
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:18,030
If somebody falls off the tower,

851
00:58:18,065 --> 00:58:20,065
they bring the cell phone
with them.

852
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,133
And call for help
on the way down.

853
00:58:24,643 --> 00:58:26,203
And maybe post that video.

854
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,306
Kidding, ish.

855
00:58:33,982 --> 00:58:35,245
Yeah, my leg.

856
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,555
I could eat aspirin
like Skittles right now.

857
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,855
Yeah.

858
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,593
It's looking a little funky.

859
00:58:42,628 --> 00:58:44,221
Could use some washing, here.

860
00:58:56,136 --> 00:58:57,136
HUNTER: I'm sorry.

861
00:59:07,147 --> 00:59:08,850
We'll just keep it wrapped up.

862
00:59:11,822 --> 00:59:12,986
What's wrong?

863
00:59:16,893 --> 00:59:19,025
Dan could never say
the words, "I love you."

864
00:59:22,096 --> 00:59:23,865
1-4-3.

865
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:30,036
1-4-3.

866
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:37,747
Becky, I... How long?

867
00:59:41,918 --> 00:59:43,654
Four months.

868
00:59:48,254 --> 00:59:50,925
It was a huge mistake.

869
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,764
I'm sorry, I am so, so sorry.

870
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,228
For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?

871
00:59:57,263 --> 00:59:59,296
For falling in love
with the same guy.

872
01:00:31,132 --> 01:00:33,704
BECKY: Who made the move?

873
01:00:33,739 --> 01:00:35,706
HUNTER: Both super drunk.
BECKY: Who?

874
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:39,842
HUNTER: He did.

875
01:00:41,813 --> 01:00:45,848
But it was a huge,
huge mistake, Becks.

876
01:00:49,282 --> 01:00:50,282
BECKY: No.

877
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:53,955
A mistake is a kiss.
A one-night stand.

878
01:00:55,387 --> 01:00:57,827
You said you loved him, so...

879
01:01:00,964 --> 01:01:02,865
It got out of hand.

880
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:07,870
I tried so hard not to,
but I fell for him. I mean...

881
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:10,939
He listened to me, he was...

882
01:01:10,974 --> 01:01:12,974
He was just different
than every other douche bag

883
01:01:13,009 --> 01:01:14,239
that I'd ever dated and...

884
01:01:16,342 --> 01:01:18,243
And I'd never
felt that way before.

885
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,225
And then you asked me
to be your maid of honor

886
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:23,919
and it all hit me
like a ton of bricks,

887
01:01:23,954 --> 01:01:25,448
how messed up this all was.

888
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,793
I loved him,

889
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:34,292
but I love you more,
so I ended it.

890
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:40,804
It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.

891
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:44,137
And after Dan died, I.

892
01:01:45,404 --> 01:01:47,404
I just didn't have the strength

893
01:01:47,439 --> 01:01:48,878
to be there for you.

894
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:51,111
To be strong enough
for you, so...

895
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:53,443
So, I ran away.

896
01:01:55,282 --> 01:01:57,414
And now you hate me
and I don't blame you,

897
01:01:57,449 --> 01:02:00,120
and now we're stuck on
this stupid, freaking tower

898
01:02:00,155 --> 01:02:01,924
in the middle
of freaking nowhere.

899
01:02:03,158 --> 01:02:04,454
And it's all my fault.

900
01:02:06,293 --> 01:02:09,261
I am so, so sorry.

901
01:03:23,436 --> 01:03:25,942
What's that?

902
01:03:25,977 --> 01:03:28,373
I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.

903
01:03:30,575 --> 01:03:32,245
It's been 24 hours.

904
01:03:35,448 --> 01:03:37,316
I think it's time to accept

905
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:39,263
that either your 60,000
followers don't give a shit

906
01:03:39,287 --> 01:03:41,991
or your phone's down there
in a million pieces.

907
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:45,192
Okay.

908
01:03:45,227 --> 01:03:48,459
Well, we've got one more shot.
Your phone.

909
01:03:48,494 --> 01:03:50,296
Yeah, no padding
this time, though.

910
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:52,133
Even less of a chance.

911
01:03:52,168 --> 01:03:54,048
And if this fails we really
don't have any hope.

912
01:03:57,536 --> 01:03:59,371
How long till we die of thirst?

913
01:04:00,946 --> 01:04:02,308
It's just killing me
that our water

914
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:04,442
is just right down there
in that bag.

915
01:04:06,182 --> 01:04:08,578
Yeah, with the drone.

916
01:04:08,613 --> 01:04:11,020
We could've used that
to get help.

917
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:14,155
We could have flown it back to our
motel with a good old fashioned note.

918
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:21,459
Wait, maybe I can get it.

919
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:24,396
What do you mean?

920
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:26,068
You said it was too smooth.
No footholds.

921
01:04:26,103 --> 01:04:27,542
Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday,

922
01:04:27,566 --> 01:04:30,006
I think the rope was
long enough to reach it.

923
01:04:32,604 --> 01:04:34,538
Are you serious? Yeah.

924
01:04:36,443 --> 01:04:38,179
Yeah, I seriously think
I can get it.

925
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:49,025
Hunter, I don't think
this is a good idea.

926
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:51,654
Becky, I don't think
we have a choice.

927
01:04:51,689 --> 01:04:53,931
Every hour that passes,
the weaker we get.

928
01:04:58,432 --> 01:05:00,399
Besides...

929
01:05:00,434 --> 01:05:02,467
Maybe you'll get lucky
and I'll fall.

930
01:05:13,414 --> 01:05:14,512
Hunter.

931
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,352
Be careful.

932
01:05:22,291 --> 01:05:23,488
I'm sorry, Becks.

933
01:05:25,162 --> 01:05:26,359
I love you.

934
01:05:38,538 --> 01:05:39,669
Okay.

935
01:05:49,219 --> 01:05:50,647
Are you okay?

936
01:05:51,683 --> 01:05:52,683
HUNTER: Yeah.

937
01:05:54,125 --> 01:05:55,487
Yeah, all good.

938
01:06:02,595 --> 01:06:04,133
Okay.

939
01:06:11,241 --> 01:06:12,241
Okay.

940
01:06:20,283 --> 01:06:21,381
BECKY: Hunter, careful.

941
01:06:23,319 --> 01:06:24,319
HUNTER: Shit.

942
01:06:25,552 --> 01:06:27,750
I can't quite reach it.

943
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:29,158
Just come back up.

944
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,753
We'll attach it lower. Come on.

945
01:06:30,788 --> 01:06:32,755
Shit.

946
01:06:36,497 --> 01:06:38,200
I think I can drop myself lower.

947
01:06:38,235 --> 01:06:40,103
What?

948
01:06:40,138 --> 01:06:42,402
What the hell
are you doing, Hunter?

949
01:06:43,768 --> 01:06:44,768
Hunter!

950
01:06:52,744 --> 01:06:53,744
Shit.

951
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:04,325
I think I can swing to it.
Hunter, no!

952
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,591
Hunter! Come back up!

953
01:07:06,626 --> 01:07:07,856
Hunter, no!

954
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:09,099
Hunter!

955
01:07:15,602 --> 01:07:17,074
BECKY: Are you okay?

956
01:07:19,342 --> 01:07:20,342
HUNTER: Yeah.

957
01:07:25,183 --> 01:07:27,447
Is there a way down?

958
01:07:27,482 --> 01:07:30,384
No. The ladder ripped
all the way off.

959
01:07:41,793 --> 01:07:42,825
Water.

960
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,205
Oh, my God. Wait, Hunter.

961
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,471
How are you gonna
get back on the rope?

962
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:56,510
HUNTER: Uh.

963
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:58,709
Shit.

964
01:08:00,779 --> 01:08:02,581
Can... Can you reach it?

965
01:08:12,956 --> 01:08:15,660
HUNTER:
♪ Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall

966
01:08:16,729 --> 01:08:18,399
Oh, my God.

967
01:08:18,434 --> 01:08:20,896
♪ Humpty Dumpty
had a big fall... ♪

968
01:08:33,515 --> 01:08:34,515
Shit.

969
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:41,422
You okay? Yeah.

970
01:08:41,457 --> 01:08:42,918
I have an idea.

971
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,270
Okay.

972
01:08:54,305 --> 01:08:56,536
I'm gonna try
to hook it on with this,

973
01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:59,341
and then we're gonna
work together to pull me up.

974
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:01,673
Okay? That's amazing.

975
01:09:01,708 --> 01:09:03,873
That's some good MacGyver
shit right there.

976
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,937
Oh, come on. Please. Come on.

977
01:09:37,909 --> 01:09:40,250
You did it! Okay.

978
01:09:40,285 --> 01:09:43,550
Okay. I'm gonna jump onto this.

979
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:45,684
I'm gonna need
your help to pull me up.

980
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:47,257
Okay. Get ready, Becks.

981
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:49,325
Okay. Okay.

982
01:09:49,921 --> 01:09:50,986
Okay.

983
01:09:54,662 --> 01:09:56,502
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, you can do it.

984
01:10:06,443 --> 01:10:07,640
Shit.

985
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:09,807
Hunter, are you okay? You okay?

986
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:15,010
HUNTER: Okay. I'm okay.

987
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:17,045
Let's do this
fast and quick, Becky.

988
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,684
Work together to pull me up.

989
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,017
Okay. I climb, you pull.

990
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:25,427
Okay? Okay, now!

991
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:57,624
HUNTER: I can almost
reach the ladder.

992
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:03,894
Almost there, Becks.

993
01:11:11,101 --> 01:11:12,540
HUNTER: Okay.

994
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:46,068
Becky! I landed on the bag!

995
01:11:46,103 --> 01:11:48,378
Oh, my God... Are you okay?

996
01:11:48,413 --> 01:11:51,909
I hurt my hands, real bad.
I don't think I can climb.

997
01:11:51,944 --> 01:11:53,878
You're gonna
have to pull me up, okay?

998
01:11:53,913 --> 01:11:55,110
Okay. Okay.

999
01:11:58,951 --> 01:12:00,016
I got you.

1000
01:12:37,825 --> 01:12:38,857
BECKY: Oh, shit.

1001
01:12:41,961 --> 01:12:44,060
Oh, no. Are you okay?

1002
01:12:44,095 --> 01:12:46,766
Shit. I thought you died there.

1003
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:48,570
I'm not going anywhere, Becks.

1004
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,100
Yeah, that was scary.

1005
01:12:58,912 --> 01:13:00,681
We should ration it. Okay.

1006
01:13:00,716 --> 01:13:01,716
You're right.

1007
01:13:03,114 --> 01:13:05,455
Is there any food in there?

1008
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:07,787
No, it's just
your cherry lip balm.

1009
01:13:07,822 --> 01:13:10,020
I don't think you can eat that.

1010
01:13:10,055 --> 01:13:12,220
Okay. It's getting dark.

1011
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:14,893
I think it's now or never
on that drone.

1012
01:13:14,928 --> 01:13:18,831
I guess we need to...
We need to write a note.

1013
01:13:18,866 --> 01:13:21,031
Okay, the receipt
from the diner.

1014
01:13:21,066 --> 01:13:24,705
A pen... Do you have a pen?
Eye liner in here.

1015
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,300
Aren't you glad
I brought up makeup now?

1016
01:13:29,074 --> 01:13:30,711
"Help."

1017
01:13:30,746 --> 01:13:35,980
"Stuck on top of B-67 Tower.
Call 911."

1018
01:13:37,852 --> 01:13:39,115
Yeah, perfect.

1019
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,594
Okay. See that?

1020
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:48,058
That's the road
where we almost got wiped out.

1021
01:13:48,093 --> 01:13:50,632
It leads to the motel.

1022
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:52,502
Let's do this while
we still have light.

1023
01:13:56,167 --> 01:13:57,474
Okay.

1024
01:14:00,743 --> 01:14:02,688
Okay, just keep it straight
and follow the line of the road.

1025
01:14:02,712 --> 01:14:04,778
Let it drift down as it goes.
Okay.

1026
01:14:18,596 --> 01:14:20,189
Okay.

1027
01:14:20,224 --> 01:14:22,697
Okay, we're almost
past the gate.

1028
01:14:22,732 --> 01:14:23,962
BECKY: Oh, my God.

1029
01:14:23,997 --> 01:14:25,304
No, no, no. The battery.
HUNTER: What?

1030
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:27,570
It's running out of juice.
Oh, shit.

1031
01:14:27,605 --> 01:14:30,067
Hit retrieve.
Or has it gone too far?

1032
01:14:30,102 --> 01:14:32,036
Is it gonna make it?
There's no chance!

1033
01:14:32,071 --> 01:14:33,873
Are you sure?
It's not even at the gate.

1034
01:14:33,908 --> 01:14:35,545
Shit. It's dropping.

1035
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:36,590
Hit retrieve, hit retrieve...
Hunter.

1036
01:14:36,614 --> 01:14:37,679
Hit retrieve. Okay.

1037
01:14:39,045 --> 01:14:40,594
BECKY: It's coming back.
HUNTER: Fly it up.

1038
01:14:40,618 --> 01:14:42,057
Give it the best shot
to get back to us.

1039
01:14:42,081 --> 01:14:43,801
Come on, just get it
higher, higher, higher.

1040
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,788
Just get it higher! I'm trying.

1041
01:14:49,253 --> 01:14:50,296
We'll grab it
when it gets close.

1042
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,561
Okay.

1043
01:14:54,929 --> 01:14:56,698
HUNTER: Okay. We've got this.

1044
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:59,734
Get it, Becks, get it.

1045
01:15:02,904 --> 01:15:05,036
Nice! Good job.

1046
01:15:17,754 --> 01:15:19,688
We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.

1047
01:15:20,658 --> 01:15:22,020
Maybe just turn it off

1048
01:15:22,055 --> 01:15:23,769
and once it's rested,
it will have more juice.

1049
01:15:23,793 --> 01:15:26,255
It's never gonna
be enough. Hunter.

1050
01:15:35,871 --> 01:15:37,772
What are we gonna do?

1051
01:15:37,807 --> 01:15:39,939
Hey, we're not gonna panic.

1052
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:42,337
We're gonna stay calm.

1053
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:44,339
We're gonna figure it out, okay?

1054
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:45,648
There's gotta be a way.

1055
01:15:49,148 --> 01:15:50,620
Are we gonna die?

1056
01:15:51,249 --> 01:15:52,347
No.

1057
01:15:53,218 --> 01:15:54,855
No, we're gonna be okay.

1058
01:16:24,018 --> 01:16:25,688
Hunter. Hunter...

1059
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:28,284
Where are you? Hunter...

1060
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:36,799
Hunter...

1061
01:16:38,296 --> 01:16:40,230
Hunter, where are you?

1062
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:46,302
Hunter. Hunter!

1063
01:17:49,268 --> 01:17:50,432
Becky, it's okay.

1064
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:53,501
You just had a bad dream.

1065
01:17:53,536 --> 01:17:55,503
You're nice and safe,

1066
01:17:55,538 --> 01:17:59,012
2,000 feet up
in the middle of nowhere.

1067
01:18:07,957 --> 01:18:09,891
BECKY: I have an idea.

1068
01:18:09,926 --> 01:18:11,321
How to charge the drone.

1069
01:18:13,061 --> 01:18:14,423
Your dumb life hack.

1070
01:18:15,492 --> 01:18:17,426
Becky, you freakin' genius.

1071
01:18:24,941 --> 01:18:27,073
I think it's light enough now.
Let's do it.

1072
01:18:46,996 --> 01:18:48,897
Okay, it's a standard
bulb fitting,

1073
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:50,459
but it's gonna be hot.

1074
01:18:50,494 --> 01:18:52,428
It's 30 feet but it's
gonna feel like 1,000.

1075
01:18:56,599 --> 01:18:59,039
Is your leg okay? Yeah.

1076
01:18:59,074 --> 01:19:01,140
It smells,
but it doesn't hurt anymore.

1077
01:19:01,175 --> 01:19:02,175
It's fine.

1078
01:19:03,144 --> 01:19:04,176
Okay.

1079
01:19:08,281 --> 01:19:09,445
You can do this.

1080
01:19:18,324 --> 01:19:19,796
HUNTER: Yeah! Yeah.

1081
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,065
Keep going, Becky.

1082
01:19:29,907 --> 01:19:31,137
You got this, Becky.

1083
01:19:41,578 --> 01:19:43,314
I can't.

1084
01:19:43,349 --> 01:19:44,854
HUNTER: It's okay, it's okay.

1085
01:19:44,889 --> 01:19:46,548
I can't.

1086
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:48,121
You can do it, Becky.

1087
01:19:48,893 --> 01:19:49,893
You got it.

1088
01:19:53,425 --> 01:19:55,062
It's okay.

1089
01:19:55,097 --> 01:19:57,328
It's just like pole dancing.

1090
01:19:57,363 --> 01:20:00,166
Um... Okay, Cherry Pie.

1091

Yes!

1102
01:20:34,103 --> 01:20:35,498
You did it,
my little cherry pie.

1103
01:20:35,533 --> 01:20:36,631
Good job!

1104
01:20:39,372 --> 01:20:41,207
Okay. Yeah!

1105
01:20:41,242 --> 01:20:43,242
You did it, cherry pie!

1106
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:46,641
All right. All right.

1107
01:20:47,985 --> 01:20:49,512
Okay. Okay. Remember, it's hot.

1108
01:20:52,418 --> 01:20:53,450
Be careful.

1109
01:21:12,339 --> 01:21:14,471
Okay, just think back
to the diner.

1110
01:21:14,506 --> 01:21:16,946
You're gonna want to line
the prongs of the charger

1111
01:21:16,981 --> 01:21:19,113
with the elements
of the bulb socket.

1112
01:21:25,022 --> 01:21:26,582
I don't think it's long enough.

1113
01:21:26,617 --> 01:21:28,485
I think the back prong
doesn't reach.

1114
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,289
Okay, you're gonna need

1115
01:21:30,324 --> 01:21:33,292
something small and metal
to carry the current, like a...

1116
01:21:33,327 --> 01:21:36,592
Like a screw or something
that you can jam in there.

1117
01:21:36,627 --> 01:21:39,430
There isn't anything.
Jesus. Um...

1118
01:22:08,098 --> 01:22:10,725
It's working!
It's freaking working!

1119
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,760
Holy shit, my hero!

1120
01:22:12,795 --> 01:22:15,499
Okay, we're gonna need
a full charge.

1121
01:22:15,534 --> 01:22:18,238
I don't know.
It just has four lights.

1122
01:22:18,273 --> 01:22:20,405
Okay, we have to
charge it all the way.

1123
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,275
Give ourselves the best shot.

1124
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:23,606
You gonna be okay?

1125
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:25,113
Yeah.

1126
01:22:25,148 --> 01:22:26,148
I got this.

1127
01:22:56,509 --> 01:22:57,640
You okay?

1128
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:00,379
Yeah.

1129
01:23:00,414 --> 01:23:01,578
Hang in there, Becks.

1130
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,647
BECKY: Past halfway.

1131
01:23:25,868 --> 01:23:27,175
Get off of me!

1132
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:38,318
It's okay, it's okay, Becky.
You've got it.

1133
01:23:39,519 --> 01:23:41,222
BECKY: Three lights.

1134
01:23:45,525 --> 01:23:47,624
Come on, Becky, you're so close.

1135
01:23:54,435 --> 01:23:56,600
Get the hell away from me!

1136
01:24:02,707 --> 01:24:03,739
You did it!

1137
01:24:09,384 --> 01:24:10,647
Jesus, I'm so proud of you.

1138
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:17,522
Why didn't you catch the bag?
Uh...

1139
01:24:17,557 --> 01:24:19,458
Babe, you okay?

1140
01:24:26,665 --> 01:24:30,205
We need to fly that thing
when the motel is the busiest.

1141
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,669
Checkout, 10:00 a.m.

1142
01:24:32,704 --> 01:24:34,341
Just a couple of hours.

1143
01:25:02,932 --> 01:25:04,932
You know,
he was right about Dan.

1144
01:25:04,967 --> 01:25:06,769
He was just trying to help me.

1145
01:25:09,444 --> 01:25:11,543
And I was so horrible to him.

1146
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:17,351
If there was anyone I
could text, it would be him.

1147
01:25:17,386 --> 01:25:18,484
Just to say.

1148
01:25:20,224 --> 01:25:21,652
I'm so sorry.

1149
01:25:24,261 --> 01:25:25,524
I love him.

1150
01:25:32,302 --> 01:25:33,598
I'm tapping out here.

1151
01:25:35,272 --> 01:25:36,898
Stay with me.

1152
01:25:36,933 --> 01:25:39,835
Try to keep your mind occupied.

1153
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:42,607
Tell me something,
something that...

1154
01:25:42,642 --> 01:25:44,576
That you and your dad
used to do together.

1155
01:25:48,318 --> 01:25:49,944
We would watch wrestling.

1156
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:54,553
WWE. Yeah.

1157
01:25:54,588 --> 01:25:56,621
I forgot you guys
were into that.

1158
01:25:56,656 --> 01:25:57,853
Yeah.

1159
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,460
It was our thing, you know.

1160
01:26:00,495 --> 01:26:01,923
He was always said

1161
01:26:01,958 --> 01:26:06,895
I'd be world champion
with my fighting spirit.

1162
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:09,700
I always felt so close to him
when we would watch it.

1163
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:15,376
Name some of
your favorite wrestlers.

1164
01:26:18,942 --> 01:26:21,613
Uh, "Stone Cold" Steve Austin.

1165
01:26:22,847 --> 01:26:25,452
The Rock.

1166
01:26:25,487 --> 01:26:28,917
What was Cactus Jack's name
when he was wearing the mask?

1167
01:26:28,952 --> 01:26:30,358
Mankind.

1168
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:33,262
Mankind.

1169
01:26:35,332 --> 01:26:37,266
Wait, I thought you said
you didn't watch it.

1170
01:26:37,301 --> 01:26:38,861
I didn't.

1171
01:26:38,896 --> 01:26:40,896
Keep going,
you need to stay awake.

1172
01:26:43,538 --> 01:26:44,801
Batista.

1173
01:26:50,611 --> 01:26:52,578
Okay. It's checkout time.

1174
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,418
Okay, here it goes.

1175
01:27:04,724 --> 01:27:06,427
HUNTER: Just keep
that shit straight.

1176
01:27:06,462 --> 01:27:08,330
Follow the line of the road.

1177
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,699
BECKY: Come on, you son of a.

1178
01:27:20,872 --> 01:27:22,773
I'm past the point of no return,

1179
01:27:22,808 --> 01:27:24,940
so how's the battery?

1180
01:27:24,975 --> 01:27:26,414
Should I retrieve?

1181
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:28,878
No, keep going.

1182
01:27:31,553 --> 01:27:33,784
Come on, come on,
just follow the road.

1183
01:27:40,826 --> 01:27:41,858
Oh, shit.

1184
01:27:47,899 --> 01:27:49,932
It's gonna work.

1185
01:27:58,712 --> 01:28:00,008
Oh, God.

1186
01:28:03,849 --> 01:28:04,881
BECKY: No.

1187
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:09,820
Screw your truck. Get the drone!

1188
01:28:09,855 --> 01:28:11,052
Get it!

1189
01:28:16,092 --> 01:28:18,730
No, no, no, no!

1190
01:28:18,765 --> 01:28:21,700
Go back! Go back.

1191
01:28:21,735 --> 01:28:25,132
No, no, no. Go back!

1192
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:26,375
Go back!

1193
01:28:31,415 --> 01:28:32,876
Fuck, no!

1194
01:29:21,993 --> 01:29:23,927
BECKY: Is that a storm?

1195
01:29:26,063 --> 01:29:27,931
It's kind of beautiful
from up here.

1196
01:29:34,236 --> 01:29:36,676
I can't survive another night.

1197
01:29:36,711 --> 01:29:38,172
Becky, don't talk like that.

1198
01:29:41,947 --> 01:29:43,518
I just

1199
01:29:43,553 --> 01:29:46,884
I just wanna sleep.
You can't sleep.

1200
01:29:46,919 --> 01:29:49,557
The vultures,
they can smell your leg.

1201
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:51,757
They're waiting for you to
give up so they can attack.

1202
01:29:55,631 --> 01:29:57,466
Survival of the fittest.

1203
01:29:58,634 --> 01:30:00,634
You need energy.

1204
01:30:00,669 --> 01:30:02,636
We should eat something.

1205
01:30:02,671 --> 01:30:04,671
What?

1206
01:30:04,706 --> 01:30:08,037
We're 2,000 feet up in
the middle of the desert.

1207
01:30:08,072 --> 01:30:10,006
There's no food up here.

1208
01:30:10,041 --> 01:30:11,678
There's always something.

1209
01:30:14,782 --> 01:30:16,452
It's hopeless.

1210
01:30:20,656 --> 01:30:22,953
Let's send another message.

1211
01:30:22,988 --> 01:30:25,153
We can pad the cell
better this time.

1212
01:30:25,188 --> 01:30:27,628
With what? Give me your shoe.

1213
01:30:27,663 --> 01:30:30,257
I can't. Why?

1214
01:30:30,292 --> 01:30:32,798
It's not up here, is it? What?

1215
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:37,099
It's down there.

1216
01:30:38,674 --> 01:30:40,036
It's on your foot.

1217
01:30:41,578 --> 01:30:42,709
Yes.

1218
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:50,717
But I'm down there, remember?

1219
01:30:56,087 --> 01:30:57,691
I fell.

1220
01:31:01,026 --> 01:31:03,697
You can't have the shoe,

1221
01:31:03,732 --> 01:31:05,831
because I didn't catch the bag.

1222
01:31:07,032 --> 01:31:08,537
I bled out.

1223
01:31:26,117 --> 01:31:29,624
You didn't really think your scrawny
ass could pull me up, did you?

1224
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,101
You pulled the bag up.

1225
01:31:53,848 --> 01:31:56,046
I guess you were just too afraid

1226
01:31:56,081 --> 01:31:59,588
to realize that
you were up here,

1227
01:31:59,623 --> 01:32:01,887
all alone.

1228
01:33:17,195 --> 01:33:18,634
BECKY: Hi, Dad.

1229
01:33:20,770 --> 01:33:23,705
I wanted you to know that I

1230
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:25,905
I found my fight again.

1231
01:33:29,878 --> 01:33:31,638
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Please leave your message.

1232
01:33:32,848 --> 01:33:34,276
BECKY: I wanna live.

1233
01:33:35,983 --> 01:33:37,752
I wanna go home,

1234
01:33:40,152 --> 01:33:43,186
but I'm not gonna make it.

1235
01:33:48,864 --> 01:33:51,161
You were right
about everything and I.

1236
01:33:52,263 --> 01:33:53,966
I'm sorry, Dad.

1237
01:34:00,073 --> 01:34:02,007
By the time you see this.

1238
01:34:04,748 --> 01:34:05,879
I'll be gone.

1239
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:15,790
I love you.

1240
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,382
That's it! Fuck!

1241
01:36:17,947 --> 01:36:19,243
HUNTER: You need energy.

1242
01:36:20,378 --> 01:36:21,817
You should eat something.

1243
01:36:26,417 --> 01:36:28,219
BECKY: Survival of the fittest.

1244
01:37:05,456 --> 01:37:07,929
I can pad the cell
better this time.

1245
01:37:09,229 --> 01:37:10,459
Give me your shoe.

1246
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:30,946
Hunter.

1247
01:38:44,687 --> 01:38:46,258
God, I love you.

1248
01:39:19,425 --> 01:39:20,721
I'm sorry.

1249
01:39:21,493 --> 01:39:23,295
I'm so sorry,

1250
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:25,176
but I really have to make
sure this gets through.

1251
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,101
God, God, I'm sorry.

1252
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:47,610
OFFICER: You can't park here.

1253
01:40:47,645 --> 01:40:50,613
Becky! Becky!

1254
01:40:56,555 --> 01:40:57,620
No.

1255
01:40:59,426 --> 01:41:00,623
No.

1256
01:41:03,265 --> 01:41:05,331
BECKY: Dad?

1257
01:41:05,366 --> 01:41:06,366
Dad?

1258
01:41:07,764 --> 01:41:08,764
Dad!

1259
01:41:15,277 --> 01:41:17,838
I thought that was you.

1260
01:41:17,873 --> 01:41:21,611
Dad, I love you. I'm so sorry.

1261
01:41:22,878 --> 01:41:24,383
DAD: It's okay.

1262
01:41:26,717 --> 01:41:27,749
I just

1263
01:41:27,784 --> 01:41:29,520
I just want you to be okay.

1264
01:41:33,724 --> 01:41:35,493
I am, you know.

1265
01:41:35,528 --> 01:41:36,692
I'm gonna be okay.

1266
01:41:37,827 --> 01:41:39,365
Really.

1267
01:41:54,448 --> 01:41:55,678
Let's go home.

1268
01:41:58,617 --> 01:42:00,155
BECKY: Life is fleeting.

1269
01:42:00,916 --> 01:42:02,520
Life is short.

1270
01:42:03,391 --> 01:42:04,720
Too short.

1271
01:42:04,755 --> 01:42:08,229
So, you gotta use every moment.

1272
01:42:08,264 --> 01:42:11,430
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

1273
01:42:11,465 --> 01:42:13,432
And that shit?

1274
01:42:13,467 --> 01:42:17,502
That would spread that
message far and wide.
