1
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:07,795
MAN 1: Riders approaching!
MAN 2: Open the gate!

2
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,034
- YARA: Why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.
- (MEN LAUGHING)

3
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,662
- Envy isn't attractive.
- What envy?

4
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:44,749
You should be proud
of your brother's achievement.

5
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,335
I took the great castle of Winterfell
with 20 men.

6
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,211
You're a great warrior.

7
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,839
I saw the bodies above your gates.

8
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:56,177
Which one gave you the tougher fight,
the cripple or the six-year-old?

9
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,261
(MEN LAUGHING)

10
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,682
I treated the Stark boys with honor,
and they repaid me with treachery.

11
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:04,935
You treated them with honor?
By butchering them?

12
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,270
Before I had to kill them,

13
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:09,148
- I treated them...
- You seized their home, as is your right.

14
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,941
We're ironborn, we take what we need.

15
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,026
Exactly.

16
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,196
Then you made them prisoners in their home
and they ran away.

17
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,947
Is that treachery?

18
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,283
I'd call it bravery.

19
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,870
- They made me a promise...
- Your little boy prisoners made you a promise

20
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,581
and you got mad when they broke it?

21
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,249
Are you the dumbest cunt alive?

22
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,959
- Don't call me...
- A cunt.

23
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:32,922
A dumb cunt who killed
the only two Starks in Winterfell.

24
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,466
You know how valuable those boys were?

25
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,386
If I hadn't killed them,
the Northerners would think me weak.

26
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:41,222
You are weak. And you're stupid.

27
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,306
I'm warning you.

28
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,685
Go on, then. Warn me.

29
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,359
You haven't brought enough men.

30
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,653
How am I supposed to
defend Winterfell with just this lot?

31
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:56,737
You're not.

32
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:59,907
I've come to bring you home.
Father wants a word.

33
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,659
Is this a joke?

34
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,077
Winterfell is the heart of the North.

35
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,122
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.

36
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,084
We're islanders, baby brother.
Had you forgotten that?

37
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,003
Our power comes from our ships.

38
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:16,549
And now that you've decorated your walls
with the bodies of the Stark boys,

39
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,844
every man in the North wants
to see you hanged.

40
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:23,347
- When Robb Stark finds out...
- He won't find out.

41
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:24,974
We've killed all the ravens.

42
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,017
We have all the horses.

43
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,271
I've taken Winterfell.

44
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:33,566
And I will keep Winterfell.

45
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,945
Leave us.

46
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,752
Theon, you're my blood.

47
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,590
We both loved our mother.

48
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:00,384
We both endured our father.

49
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:04,847
Come home with me. Don't die here alone.

50
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,891
I don't intend to die.

51
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,398
You were a terrible baby, do you know that?

52
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,069
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.

53
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:23,073
And one night, you just wouldn't shut up,

54
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,367
screaming like a dying pig.

55
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,748
I walked over to your crib,
I looked down at you.

56
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,958
I wanted to strangle you.

57
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,463
And you looked up at me
and you stopped screaming.

58
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,341
You smiled at me.

59
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,139
Don't die so far from the sea.

60
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,366
I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.

61
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:09,703
I already got one crow. Don't need two.

62
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:11,956
Mance will want to question this one.

63
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,458
Knows all about where the crows are
and what they're planning.

64
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:18,212
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.

65
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,338
Gut him.

66
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,299
He could have killed me half a dozen times.

67
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,676
And now he wishes he did.

68
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:25,386
Gut him.

69
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,847
He's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.

70
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,270
Mance will want him.

71
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:37,731
What does Mance want
with a dead man's bastard?

72
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:39,066
I don't know.

73
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,278
I think he'll want to decide for himself.

74
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:52,079
He runs, I'll chop his balls off.

75
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,790
He runs, I'll do it meself.

76
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,800
We're even now, Jon Snow.

77
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,226
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

78
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:19,940
I couldn't do it.

79
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,109
I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't...

80
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,360
I know.

81
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,738
The others?

82
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:28,616
When you didn't come back,
we went looking for you.

83
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,160
We found your tracks fast enough.

84
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:33,912
But they found us before we found you.

85
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,248
They died because of me.

86
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,710
See that it wasn't for nothing.

87
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,919
MAN: All right, up, lad.

88
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:43,213
Come on, on your feet, now.

89
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,548
Move it.

90
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,514
Is she beautiful?

91
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,309
I've never met her.

92
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,436
What's her name?

93
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,564
Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name.

94
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,401
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

95
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,237
(LAUGHING)

96
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,865
And you're marrying her for a bridge?

97
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,700
- An important bridge.
- Ah.

98
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,913
It was before they killed my father.

99
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,375
I still thought I could march south
and rescue him in time,

100
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,919
but only if I crossed that bridge.

101
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,674
When I speak to people from the North,

102
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,967
they all loved your father.

103
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,513
He was the best man I ever met.

104
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,265
I know children always think that
about their fathers, but...

105
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,436
Children do not always think that
about their fathers, believe me.

106
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:44,983
He once told me
that being a lord is like being a father,

107
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:49,613
except you have thousands of children
and you worry about all of them.

108
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,616
The farmers plowing the fields
are yours to protect.

109
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,786
The charwomen scrubbing the floors,
yours to protect.

110
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,455
The soldiers you order into battle.

111
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:04,712
He told me he woke with fear in the morning
and went to bed with fear in the night.

112
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,756
I didn't believe him.

113
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:13,137
I asked him,
"How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"

114
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:18,308
"That is the only time a man can be brave,"
he told me.

115
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,439
I wish I could have met him.

116
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,483
He would have liked you.

117
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,530
Most lords worry more about their gold
and their glory

118
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,365
than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.

119
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:36,827
- He didn't care much about gold or glory.
- And you?

120
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:41,290
You think I'm fighting this war
so they'll sing songs about me?

121
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,417
I want to go home.

122
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,880
- I want the men following me to go home.
- Then why don't you?

123
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:51,759
Because we'll never be safe
until the Lannisters are defeated.

124
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,927
And because I believe in justice.

125
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:57,389
- Chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.
- That would be a start.

126
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,599
(HORSE NEIGHING)

127
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,109
Your Grace, milady.

128
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,571
The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.

129
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,448
How?

130
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,451
How?

131
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,874
Tell me this isn't true.

132
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:29,963
Why?

133
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,258
For the girls.

134
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,510
- You betrayed me.
- Robb...

135
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,719
No!

136
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,598
You knew I would not allow it
and you did it anyway.

137
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:44,144
Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.

138
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,272
Sansa and Arya are
captives in King's Landing.

139
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,942
I have five children,
and only one of them is free.

140
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,904
I lost one son fighting by your son's side.

141
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,574
I lost another to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

142
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:02,412
You commit treason
because your children are prisoners?

143
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,792
I would carve out my heart
and offer it to the Father,

144
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:11,296
if he would let my sons wake
from their graves and step into a prison cell.

145
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,841
- I grieve for your sons, my lord.
- I don't want your grief.

146
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,968
I want my vengeance.

147
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,262
And you stole it from me.

148
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,767
Killing Jaime Lannister
would not buy life for your children,

149
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:27,521
but returning him to King's Landing
may buy life for mine.

150
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,858
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.

151
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,194
You've weakened our position.

152
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:35,904
You've brought discord into our camp.

153
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,491
And you did it all behind my back.

154
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,372
- Make sure she's guarded day and night.
- Robb.

155
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,833
How many men did we send
in pursuit of the Kingslayer?

156
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,001
Forty, Your Grace.

157
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:52,087
Send another 40 with our fastest horses.

158
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,672
Robb.

159
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,228
(GROANS)

160
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,524
JAIME: Damn.

161
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,488
You're much uglier in daylight.

162
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,240
What's your name?

163
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,120
I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock,
son of Tywin.

164
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:30,584
A captive knight has
a right to know his captor's identity.

165
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,252
Brienne of Tarth.

166
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,338
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.

167
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,049
Crescent moons and starbursts.

168
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,717
Lord...

169
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,887
Selwyn Tarth. Your father.

170
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,059
Do you have any brothers and sisters,
my lady?

171
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:51,271
It's a long way to King's Landing.
Might as well get to know one another.

172
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,399
Have you known many men?

173
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,609
I suppose not.

174
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,402
Women?

175
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:58,487
Horses? Ah.

176
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,950
I didn't mean to give offense, my lady.
Forgive me.

177
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,577
Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.

178
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,205
Why do you hate me so much?
Have I ever harmed you?

179
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,875
You've harmed others,
those you were sworn to protect,

180
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,294
the weak, the innocent.

181
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:17,506
Has anyone ever told you
you're as boring as you are ugly?

182
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,133
You will not provoke me to anger.

183
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,844
I already have. Look at you.

184
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,429
You're ready to chop my head off.

185
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,391
Do you think you could?

186
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,184
Do you think you could beat me
in a fair fight?

187
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,144
I've never seen you fight.

188
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,938
The answer is no.

189
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,483
There are three men in the kingdoms
who might have a chance against me.

190
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,068
You're not one of them.

191
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,571
All my life men like you have sneered at me.

192
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,491
And all my life I've been
knocking men like you into the dust.

193
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,703
If you're so confident, unlock my chains.
Let's see what happens.

194
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:51,498
Do you take me for an idiot? In!

195
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:57,879
I took you for a fighter, a man...

196
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,549
Pardon. Woman of honor.

197
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,468
Was I wrong?

198
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,137
You're afraid.

199
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,017
Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.

200
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:27,325
KEVAN: King's Landing will fall
an hour after Stannis lands his force.

201
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:33,832
It's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei
and the court to ride west to safety.

202
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,126
Surrender the Iron Throne?

203
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,421
Better than seeing their heads mounted
on the city gates.

204
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,757
Stannis will execute them all.

205
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,218
No, a king who runs will not be king for long.

206
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,763
He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.

207
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:53,852
Stannis, two days from the capital
and the wolf at my doorstep.

208
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,981
The scouts assure us
Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.

209
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,734
Ha! The last time the scouts assured us
of Stark's movement,

210
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,319
he lured us into a trap.

211
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,823
Which is why my son is his prisoner.

212
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,329
Too close to Casterly Rock.

213
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,292
He sent a splinter force
to recapture Winterfell.

214
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,003
The Greyjoys have done us a great favor.

215
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,883
Stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock
until he's at full force.

216
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,177
He's a boy and he's never lost a battle.

217
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,014
He'll risk anything at any time

218
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,392
because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.

219
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,194
We'll ride at nightfall.

220
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,197
I want a full night's march
before he knows we're on the move.

221
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:51,284
Clegane, you'll maintain
a garrison here at Harrenhal.

222
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,204
Track down this brotherhood
and destroy them.

223
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,835
The girl has proven herself a good servant.

224
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,170
She'll stay on with you.

225
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:04,214
See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.

226
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:09,469
He's poor company when he's sober,
but he's better at his work.

227
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,271
GUARD: You've got some
questions to answer.

228
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,231
Who killed Ser Amory?

229
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,817
MAN: I don't know! Please!
GUARD: Give me the name.

230
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,863
GUARD: Take this one out for the crows.
MAN: I told you, I don't know.

231
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,115
Please.

232
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,577
Look, it's Yoren's little cunt.

233
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,454
Used to be a boy, now it's a girl.

234
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,081
Where's Jaqen?

235
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,666
Don't care.

236
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,752
Where's your stick now, bitch?

237
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,462
I promised to fuck you with it.

238
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,174
GUARD: Come on, time to kill some wolves.

239
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,727
You need sour cherries to make it right.

240
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,897
And the secret is you dry the stones,
and then you break them with a mallet.

241
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,233
That's where the real flavor is.
You crush 'em up real fine.

242
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,485
And then when you're finished,
you sprinkle them over the piecrust.

243
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,570
Where's Jaqen?

244
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,447
- How would I know?
- I need him now.

245
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,117
- Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
- You need him?

246
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:15,952
He's helping me.

247
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,121
- HOT PIE: I saw him.
- Where?

248
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,043
- Where? Where?
- Ow!

249
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,378
They went riding out the gates
a few hours ago.

250
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,630
On patrol.

251
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,840
Let go of my ears.

252
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,175
(HORSE NEIGHING)

253
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,597
What do you want with him anyway?

254
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:53,323
QHORIN: Mance is gonna march on the Wall.

255
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,661
When he does, one brother inside his army
will be worth 1,000 fighting against it.

256
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,829
- They'll never trust me.
- They might.

257
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,706
- If you do what needs to be done.
- What?

258
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,417
(SHOUTING) How does it feel
knowing those men all died

259
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,587
so you could skip through the snow
with your little savage girl?

260
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,256
- I didn't.
- I should have known better,

261
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,341
trusting a traitor's bastard.

262
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,431
He's not yours to kill, crow.

263
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:42,706
Do you have to do that here?

264
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,002
I like to keep me hands clean.

265
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,338
Yes, but do you have to do it here?

266
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:00,974
You should start wearing the gold cloak.

267
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,517
I don't want to wear a gold cloak.

268
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,644
You're commander of the City Watch.

269
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:08,273
- You shouldn't be dressed like a common...
- A cloak slows you down in a fight.

270
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,525
Makes it hard to move quietly.

271
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,321
And the gold catches the light,
so you're nice and easy to spot at night.

272
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:17,615
Well, you're not
sneaking through alleyways any longer.

273
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,908
You're supposed to stand out.

274
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,078
We had a deal
and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.

275
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,788
Fine, fine.

276
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,417
No gold cloak.

277
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,259
What?

278
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,011
- What?
- What? What?

279
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,471
Why are you staring at me?

280
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,975
You don't want me cleaning me nails.
You don't want me looking your way.

281
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,144
Why am I here?

282
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,396
To help me plan
the defense of King's Landing.

283
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,522
(LAUGHS)

284
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,775
- Stannis will be here any day.
- (SIGHS)

285
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,113
And one of these explains how to beat him?

286
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,701
"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros."

287
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,079
By Archmaester Shevelathin.

288
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,623
Shevelatesh.

289
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,208
Chevalteesh.

290
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,547
I'd swap all your books
for a few good archers.

291
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,674
My Lord Hand. Commander.

292
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:20,178
I must compliment you
on the gold cloaks' performance

293
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,388
these last few weeks.

294
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,725
Did you know there has been
a marked drop in thievery?

295
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,353
I did not know.

296
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,773
And how did you accomplish
this marked drop in thievery?

297
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,984
Me and the lads rounded up
all the known thieves.

298
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,946
For questioning?

299
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,197
No.

300
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,700
It's just the unknown thieves
we need to worry about now.

301
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,745
- We talked about this.
- Aye, we talked about it.

302
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:48,915
Have you ever been in a city under siege?

303
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,501
Maybe this part's not in your books.

304
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,462
See, it's not the fighting
that kills most people. It's the starving.

305
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,215
Food's worth more than gold.

306
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,969
Noble ladies sell their diamonds
for a sack of potatoes.

307
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,305
Things get bad enough,
the poor start eating each other.

308
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,517
The thieves, they love a siege.

309
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,520
Soon as the gates are sealed,
they steal all the food.

310
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,315
By the time it's all over,
they're the richest men in town.

311
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,863
Given the circumstances, my lord,
I believe extreme measures are warranted.

312
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,073
Ah.

313
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:25,285
"The Great Sieges of Westeros."

314
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,454
Thrilling subject.

315
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:31,666
Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan
wasn't a better writer.

316
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,423
Stannis knows King's Landing.

317
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:41,801
He knows where the walls are strongest,

318
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:45,180
and he knows which gates are weakest.

319
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,767
The Mud Gate.

320
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,104
A good ram will batter it down in minutes,

321
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,523
and it's only 50 yards from the water.

322
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,400
That's where he'll land.

323
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,195
And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate,

324
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,071
what is our plan?

325
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,782
We could throw books at his men.

326
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,242
We don't have that many books.

327
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,744
We don't have that many men, either.

328
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,914
What do we have?

329
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:13,875
Pig shit.

330
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,559
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

331
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,395
I'm not cut out for this sort of work.

332
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,483
I always imagined meself
doing something much worse.

333
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,277
We're digging latrine pits
at the end of the world.

334
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,321
I can't imagine anything much worse.

335
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,241
You lack imagination.

336
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,703
Where do you think Jon is right now?

337
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:53,581
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn't come back.

338
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,625
A betting man would go with dead.

339
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,753
He's not dead.

340
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,880
No, Jon's a great fighter.

341
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,133
Well, he's better than me
and a lot better than you.

342
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,303
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.

343
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,681
So did his father.

344
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,559
And Qhorin Halfhand
is the greatest ranger alive.

345
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,436
Great rangers never get old is the problem.

346
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,272
Shit ones neither.

347
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:21,317
It's them in the middle that last a long time.

348
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,278
(METAL CLANGS)

349
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,616
What in seven hells is that?

350
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,634
The First Men made these marks.

351
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,344
Help me with it.

352
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,642
(GRUNTS)

353
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,026
Look.

354
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,699
If you find something you're not supposed to,

355
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,077
best thing to do
is pretend you've never seen it.

356
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,163
That's a Night's Watch cloak.

357
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:16,914
It's been here a long time.

358
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,379
Oh.

359
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,298
Must be dragonglass.

360
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,758
GRENN: Dragonglass?

361
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:29,427
The maesters call it obsidian.

362
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,972
Why would a brother hide it here?

363
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:36,893
I expect it's 'cause
he wanted somebody to find it.

364
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,442
Mind where you're going.

365
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,702
I'm sorry. I'll...

366
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,664
Where were you?

367
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:58,998
A man has patrol duty.

368
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,876
Tywin Lannister was right here,
and now he's gone.

369
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,920
A girl owes one more name.

370
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,005
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.

371
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,594
How long after I give you the name
does it take you to kill someone?

372
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:14,514
A minute, an hour, a month.

373
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:17,600
Death is certain,

374
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,353
the time is not.

375
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,689
He's taking his army to attack my brother.

376
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,816
I need him dead right now.

377
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,276
This a man cannot do.

378
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,113
You promised you'd help me.

379
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:33,199
Help was not promised, lovely girl.
Only death.

380
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,495
There must be others. Give a name, any name.

381
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,372
And you'll kill them?

382
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,457
Anybody?

383
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,547
By the Seven New Gods
and the Old Gods beyond counting,

384
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,215
I swear it.

385
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:53,636
All right.

386
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:00,977
Jaqen H'ghar.

387
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,485
A girl gives a man his own name?

388
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:12,155
- That's right.
- Gods are not mocked.

389
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,741
- This is no joking thing.
- I'm not joking.

390
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,284
A man can go kill himself.

391
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:17,744
Un-name me.

392
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,245
- No.
- Please?

393
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:22,999
I'll un-name you.

394
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,878
- Thank you.
- If you help me and my friends escape.

395
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,757
This would require more than one life.

396
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,926
- This is not part of our bargain.
- Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.

397
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,887
A girl lacks honor.

398
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:47,064
If I do this thing, a girl must obey.

399
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,858
A girl will obey.

400
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:54,864
A girl and her friends will
walk through the gate at midnight.

401
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:00,912
Thank you, Podrick.

402
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,212
Odd little boy.

403
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,714
I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.

404
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,175
You and Varys both.

405
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:18,304
Excellent lamprey pie.

406
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,474
Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?

407
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,768
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.

408
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,187
An inspiration for the troops.

409
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,897
The young king in his shining armor

410
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,650
fighting to defend the capital
against the wicked old rebel.

411
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,610
He's only a boy.

412
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:35,404
Younger boys are off fighting his war.

413
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,574
- He's not ready.
- What is he, 17?

414
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:41,953
- Remember Jaime at 17?
- Better than you.

415
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:45,039
Some men have a gift for this sort of thing,

416
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,958
some don't.

417
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,751
His place is not on the battlefield.

418
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,003
It's not on the throne, either,

419
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,839
sadly for all of us.

420
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,177
Do you think I'm an idiot?

421
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:00,513
No, I'd say you possess
above-average intelligence.

422
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,015
You shipped off my only daughter.

423
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:06,102
And now you want to send my eldest son
to the battlefield to die.

424
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,521
He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him.

425
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,524
He has the finest armor gold can buy.

426
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,192
He needs to be out there.

427
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:16,863
The men will fight more fiercely
seeing their king fighting beside them

428
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,490
instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts.

429
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,909
Any dessert?

430
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:25,496
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?

431
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,875
Because he has
thousands of spies in his employ.

432
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:31,752
Because he knows everything we do
before we do it.

433
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,212
Because he doesn't have a cock.

434
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,548
Neither do you.

435
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:39,719
Perhaps I'm dangerous, too.

436
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:43,848
You, on the other hand,
are as big a fool as every other man.

437
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,727
That little worm between your legs
does half your thinking.

438
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,478
- It's not that little.
- (LAUGHS)

439
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,737
Why are you smiling?

440
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,822
Because I'm happy.

441
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,866
And why are you happy?

442
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:08,539
Because I have your little whore.

443
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:13,586
I thought you preferred blondes.

444
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,421
Such a droll little fellow.

445
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,256
Tell me, have you married this one yet?

446
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,300
No?

447
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,136
Good. Father will be so pleased.

448
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,263
Why do you care who I fuck?

449
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:26,933
Because a Lannister always pays her debts.

450
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,476
You stole my only daughter,

451
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:30,186
you plot to have Joffrey killed.

452
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:33,230
This is madness. Stannis will be here in days.

453
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,607
- You need me.
- For what?

454
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,525
Your skill in battle?

455
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,529
Pretty thing, your whore.

456
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,949
Lovely body.

457
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,743
The bruises will heal in time.

458
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:48,996
Where did you find her?

459
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,332
Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers.

460
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,251
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?

461
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,964
You need to hide your secret whores
more carefully.

462
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,925
You've forgotten the most
important thing about whores.

463
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,009
Oh?

464
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,513
Well, you're the expert. Tell me.

465
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,557
You don't buy them,

466
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,476
you only rent them.

467
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:14,271
You're usually a better liar, baby brother.

468
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,774
This one you like.

469
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,735
You like her very much.

470
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:21,988
Could it be love?

471
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,908
Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough.

472
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,493
Unless Joffrey is hurt.

473
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,871
And then every wound he suffers,
she'll suffer, too.

474
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,915
And if he dies,

475
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:38,838
there isn't a man alive who could devise
a more painful death for your little cunt.

476
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:45,177
And how do I know
you haven't killed her already?

477
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:46,470
Would you like to see her?

478
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,180
I thought you might.

479
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,142
Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.

480
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,648
(DOOR OPENING)

481
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,551
I'm sorry they hurt you.

482
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,763
You must be brave.

483
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,479
I promise I will free you.

484
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:39,774
Don't forget me.

485
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:41,650
Never.

486
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,035
(DOOR OPENING)

487
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:53,454
(DOOR CLOSING)

488
00:32:00,211 --> 00:32:02,338
I will hurt you for this.

489
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:06,425
A day will come
when you think you're safe and happy,

490
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:10,012
and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.

491
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:13,099
And you will know the debt is paid.

492
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,018
Get out.

493
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,156
Shae!

494
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,495
I've been waiting all night.

495
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,163
What is wrong?

496
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,165
You're beautiful.

497
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,384
Then why do you look sad?

498
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:57,101
We have to be more careful.

499
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:00,104
Don't be afraid. I can take care of myself.

500
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,732
There are people who want to hurt me.

501
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,776
I know. I won't let them.

502
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,571
I'll cut off their faces. I will.

503
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,744
I would kill for you. Do you know that?

504
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,499
I expect I'll have to before this is over.

505
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,753
You're mine.

506
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,048
I'm yours.

507
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,676
Promise me.

508
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,682
I'm yours, and you are mine.

509
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:50,654
ROBB: Still no word?

510
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:54,283
We've sent a dozen ravens.
None have returned.

511
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:59,205
My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.

512
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,332
- Once he captures the castle...
- Theon has my brothers.

513
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,127
- If we storm the castle...
- He wouldn't dare hurt the boys.

514
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:10,299
They're his only hope
of escaping the North with his head.

515
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,636
Send word to your son.

516
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:19,600
Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed
to return safely to their homes.

517
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:23,187
A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace.
Too much...

518
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,941
Any ironborn with the exception
of Theon Greyjoy.

519
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,069
He betrayed our cause.

520
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,821
He betrayed me.

521
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:35,616
And we will hunt him down
no matter where he runs.

522
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,911
I expect his countrymen will turn on him
the minute they hear the offer.

523
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,792
Your pardon, my lord. Your Grace.

524
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,293
My lady.

525
00:34:58,472 --> 00:34:59,974
How are you?

526
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,185
How am I?

527
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:05,437
I've had to arrest my mother.

528
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,606
The Lannisters have my sisters.

529
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,359
The man I considered my closest friend

530
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,653
has seized my home and my brothers.

531
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,531
I'm fighting a war and I don't know
if I should march south or north.

532
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,909
I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.

533
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,369
No.

534
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,829
Forgive me.

535
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,706
You're being kind.

536
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,917
- I have no right.
- You have every right.

537
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,335
You're a king.

538
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:30,504
That's not the kind of king I want to be.

539
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,132
What kind do you want to be?

540
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,216
I don't know.

541
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,718
The good kind.

542
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,390
Most kings grew up as princes.

543
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,768
They spend their whole lives
preparing for the crown.

544
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:47,479
I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.

545
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,109
I was raised to be a proper little lady,

546
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:57,323
to play the harp and dance the latest steps
and recite Valyrian poetry.

547
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,741
I'd like to hear you play the harp.

548
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,868
- No. No, you would not.
- (CHUCKLES)

549
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,251
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry

550
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:12,129
to sawing off men's feet?

551
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,350
When I was 12,

552
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:27,061
my mother and father went to a wedding.

553
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:30,314
Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.

554
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,108
And they left me with my little brother.

555
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:38,322
The second afternoon they were gone
was the hottest day in the three-year summer.

556
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:43,077
We couldn't bear to be inside,
so we ran down to the Rhoyne.

557
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,455
Every child in Volantis
was in the Rhoyne that day.

558
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:49,958
The rich, the poor, we were all there.

559
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:53,420
Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.

560
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:56,924
Drummers were playing
for coppers on the east bank.

561
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,554
I was treading water,

562
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,516
talking to a friend,

563
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,727
when I realized I hadn't seen my brother.

564
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,355
I called his name.

565
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,150
Then I started screaming his name.

566
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,487
And then I saw him...

567
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,490
floating face down.

568
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,994
My heart just... stopped.

569
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,454
I was...

570
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:34,002
I dragged him from the water.

571
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:36,964
My friend helped me, I think.

572
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,007
I don't even remember.

573
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,345
He was so little.

574
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,474
Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.

575
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,438
And I screamed at him and I shook him.

576
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,816
And he was dead.

577
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:58,986
Just dead.

578
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,616
A man ran over.

579
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,621
He had a fish tattoo on his face.

580
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,584
In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos.

581
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:17,045
So you know what they are
without having to talk to them.

582
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,132
And this man worked on a fishing boat.

583
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,634
And he pushed me out of the way.

584
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:28,348
You have to understand,
for a slave to push a highborn girl,

585
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:31,560
that's death for the man, a terrible death.

586
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,314
But he pushed me out of the way,

587
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:40,736
and he started pressing on my brother's chest

588
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,323
again and again and again,

589
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:48,494
until my brother spat out

590
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:52,080
half of the Rhoyne and cried out.

591
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:55,792
And the man cradled his head
and told him to be calm.

592
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,676
I decided two things that day.

593
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,265
I would not waste my years planning dances
and masquerades with the other noble ladies.

594
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,769
And when I came of age,

595
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:18,190
I would never live in a slave city again.

596
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:25,364
(SIGHS)

597
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,949
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

598
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,369
You told me of your problems
and I've blathered on.

599
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:33,205
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

600
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,126
I don't want you to marry her.

601
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,299
But you needed that bridge.

602
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:48,971
I hope it's a very beautiful bridge.

603
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:27,884
(CHUCKLES)

604
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,021
(MOANING)

605
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,456
HOT PIE: The sour cherries
was all crushed up and ready.

606
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:58,624
GENDRY: Shut up.

607
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:01,543
HOT PIE: Probably in the piecrust by now.
In the oven.

608
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:04,046
The nice, warm oven.

609
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,256
Shut up. What did you bring?

610
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,134
The cheese could be better.

611
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,677
I did get some nice sausages.

612
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:13,305
What did he want us
to do about those guards?

613
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,890
He didn't say.

614
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,642
He just said, "Walk through the gates."

615
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:17,851
What about the guards?

616
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,811
He didn't say anything about the guards.

617
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:21,480
What, he left that bit out?

618
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,106
It's a pretty important part, don't you think?

619
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,275
We have to trust him.

620
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,443
Trust him?

621
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,655
You trusted him to fight with us
when you set him free and he ran.

622
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:31,698
- I want to go back to the kitchens.
- Shut up.

623
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,076
Stay here if you're afraid.

624
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:38,455
HOT PIE: Arry, don't.

625
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:08,402
Away!

626
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:09,778
Reset!

627
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:21,123
If the wind holds,
we'll reach King's Landing in a day.

628
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:22,541
Will it hold?

629
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,919
Can't make promises for the wind,
Your Grace.

630
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:28,380
MAN: Again, pull!

631
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,219
I admire you, Ser Davos.

632
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:37,514
I thank you, Your Grace. Pleased to hear it.

633
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:41,560
Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight
and think they insult you.

634
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:43,895
So you take the onion for your sigil,

635
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,398
sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.

636
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,442
My son wishes me to change it.

637
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:51,820
Three mermen with tridents,
something like that.

638
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,907
I understand why
the older families look down at me.

639
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,909
Do you? Why?

640
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:00,954
- My father was a crabber.
- And?

641
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:05,041
Well, sons of lords don't like
to break bread with sons of crabbers.

642
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,585
Our hands stink.

643
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,045
And where were those lords
when Storm's End starved?

644
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:11,548
Many fought bravely for your brother.

645
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:14,259
Many fought for the Mad King.

646
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,721
You defend these men
who insult you behind your back.

647
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,474
Some are happy to do it to my face.

648
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:22,434
We were forgotten.

649
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:25,228
Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes.

650
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:29,399
The glorious rebels
marching from battle to battle,

651
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:31,693
liberating towns
from the yoke of the Mad King,

652
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:34,112
while I held Storm's End with 500 men.

653
00:43:34,196 --> 00:43:36,615
- No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
- No? Robert did.

654
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:39,910
He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war.
Renly never fought a day in his life.

655
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:43,538
- He was only a boy.
- Then why'd he give him Storm's End?

656
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,835
First, we ate the horses.

657
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:52,464
We weren't riding anywhere,
not with the castle surrounded.

658
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,633
We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses.

659
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:57,969
Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine.

660
00:43:58,053 --> 00:43:59,805
I do like dogs.

661
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:03,433
Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them.
Then the rats.

662
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,646
The night before you slipped through,
I thought my wife was dying.

663
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,940
She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail.

664
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:13,485
And then you made it through the lines.

665
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:16,822
Slipped right through
in your little black sailboat with your onions.

666
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:19,658
And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.

667
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,993
Every man in Storm's End wanted
to kiss you that night.

668
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:24,371
I was relieved they did not.

669
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:29,918
Robert told me to hold Storm's End,
so I held it.

670
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,422
Then he told me he was giving it to Renly,
so I gave it up.

671
00:44:34,923 --> 00:44:37,217
Insult or no, I gave it up.

672
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,177
Because Robert was my older brother,
and he was the king

673
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:41,346
and I've always done my duty.

674
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:45,684
But now, I'm the rightful king
by every law of Westeros.

675
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,811
And when I sit the Iron Throne,
you'll be my Hand.

676
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,566
Your Grace,

677
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:56,945
I pray I serve you well.

678
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,782
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son
to wear the badge.

679
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,291
You're the Master of Whisperers.
You're supposed to know everything.

680
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:12,335
No man can be in all rooms at all times.

681
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:15,213
I have many little birds in the North, my lord,

682
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:19,718
but I haven't heard their songs
since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.

683
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:23,597
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.

684
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,307
To strike?

685
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:29,019
My dear nephew, you do see these men
preparing the walls for siege?

686
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:32,647
You do understand
Stannis Baratheon sails this way?

687
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:35,025
If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores
of King's Landing,

688
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:36,902
I'll ride out to greet him.

689
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:38,820
A brave choice, Your Grace.

690
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:41,656
I'm sure your men will line up behind you.

691
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,993
They say Stannis never smiles.

692
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:47,495
I'll give him a red smile

693
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:49,289
from ear to ear.

694
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,296
Imagine Stannis' terror.

695
00:45:57,339 --> 00:45:58,840
I am trying.

696
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:01,927
You're an intelligent man.

697
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,637
I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.

698
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,515
Oh, no one disputes that, my lord,
not even the multitudes who despise you.

699
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,518
I wish we could converse
as two honest, intelligent men.

700
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:12,187
I wish we could, too.

701
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:16,358
What do you want?

702
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,151
Tell me.

703
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:22,364
If we're going to play, you'll have to start.

704
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,705
My brother was
the youngest Kingsguard in history.

705
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:34,751
My sister became queen at the age of 19.

706
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,672
When I reached manhood,

707
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:42,509
my father put me in charge of all the drains
and cisterns in Casterly Rock.

708
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,761
A most highborn plumber.

709
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,805
The water never flowed better.

710
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:49,641
And all the shit found its way to the sea.

711
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:52,727
I never expected to have any real power.

712
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:54,729
So when my father named me acting Hand...

713
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:56,731
You're quite good at being Hand, you know?

714
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:59,901
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men.

715
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:01,987
Honorable men.

716
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,864
But they disdained the game
and those who played.

717
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:07,200
- You enjoy the game.
- I do.

718
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,869
Last thing I expected.

719
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:11,287
And you play it well.

720
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:13,498
I'd like to keep playing it.

721
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:19,129
If Stannis breaches the gates,
the game is over.

722
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:23,133
They say he burns his enemies alive
to honor the Lord of Light.

723
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:26,011
The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned,

724
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:28,680
the Drowned God wants them drowned.

725
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,598
Why are all the gods such vicious cunts?

726
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,310
Where is the god of tits and wine?

727
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:39,107
In the Summer Isles,
they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats.

728
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:42,110
We should sail there immediately.

729
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,364
This morning, I heard a song

730
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,285
all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.

731
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,287
Daenerys Targaryen lives.

732
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,250
A girl at the edge of the world
is the least of our problems.

733
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,252
She has three dragons.

734
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:03,339
But even if what they say is true,

735
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:06,301
it'll be years before they are fully grown.

736
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,637
And then there will be nowhere to hide.

737
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,348
One game at a time, my friend.

738
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:24,903
JORAH: Careful, Khaleesi.

739
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:29,449
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks
have a thousand eyes watching for you.

740
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,368
I found one.

741
00:48:33,203 --> 00:48:35,455
A ship with a good captain.

742
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,248
She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.

743
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:38,708
Astapor?

744
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:40,043
We cannot stay here.

745
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:43,254
They have my dragons.
A mother does not flee without her children.

746
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:45,298
They're not your children.

747
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,135
I know they call you the Mother of Dragons
and I know you love them,

748
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:50,762
but you didn't grow them in your womb.

749
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,306
They didn't suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.

750
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:55,809
And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.

751
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:59,521
You should sail to Astapor.
I'm sure you'll be safe there.

752
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,942
You know I would die for you.

753
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:07,320
I will never abandon you.

754
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,405
I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.

755
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:11,533
Then serve me.

756
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:15,161
If my dragons are in
the House of the Undying, then take me there.

757
00:49:15,245 --> 00:49:17,122
That's what the warlock wants.

758
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,832
He told you so himself.

759
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:21,709
If you enter that place,
you will never leave again.

760
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:24,796
- His magic is strong.
- And what of my magic?

761
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:27,882
You saw me step into the fire.
You watched the witch burn.

762
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:31,177
What did the flames do to me?
Do you remember?

763
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:35,932
Until my last breath, I will remember.

764
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,728
After I have forgotten my mother's face.

765
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,318
They are my children.

766
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:51,865
And they are the only children I will ever have.

767
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:59,747
Take me to them.

768
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,887
We should bury them.

769
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,932
I'd leave 'em up a few more days.
Sends a message.

770
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,269
If they haven't got the damn message yet,
a few more days won't help.

771
00:50:22,437 --> 00:50:23,980
As you say.

772
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:27,233
But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.

773
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:31,112
- What's this?
- Gold for the farmer.

774
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:33,239
For his trouble.

775
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,241
His troubles are done.

776
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,703
He's feeding the crops now.

777
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,455
His wife, too.

778
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:45,710
You want to keep a man silent,
you silence him.

779
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,982
OSHA: Got as far
as the farm and then doubled back.

780
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,613
Walked through the stream
to throw off the hounds.

781
00:51:15,657 --> 00:51:19,160
Hoped this would be the last place
they'd think to look.

782
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,789
LUWIN: You're right

783
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,332
so far.

784
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:29,170
OSHA: Who was that
out there hung up at the gates?

785
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:33,591
Must have been the farmer's boys.

786
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,053
OSHA: He killed them and burned them

787
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,432
and passed them off as the little lords?

788
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,519
LUWIN: They mustn't know.

789
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,356
Bran would blame himself.

790
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:50,316
OSHA: They'll never hear it from me.

791
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:54,570
The little lads have suffered enough.
