1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,802
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,804
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,327
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,847
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,371
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,682
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>and I saw him
murder the woman that I love.</i>

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,771
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,804
<i>I'm gonna do everything
in my power to change the future.</i>

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,606
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to keep her alive.</i>

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,802
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,929
<i>Previously, on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,162
You wanna open
S.T.A.R. Labs to the public?

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,765
- <i>In two weeks?</i>
- Soft open.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,921
I'm Alchemy.

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,129
Turning innocent people into meta-humans,
worshipping this Savitar.

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,681
An article.
Used to be written by Iris West-Allen.

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,001
Something's changed with our future.

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,525
- Barry.
- No!

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,126
What you saw was
one possibility of the future.

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,481
Then I can stop this from happening.

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,642
I don't understand, where are we?

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,647
Home. I don't know
what's gonna happen in the future.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,327
All I know is, right here, right now,
I wanna spend every moment I can with you.

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,370
Don't! Don't do this.

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,484
- Barry...
- You lose, Barry.

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,687
No!

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,685
- Babe, are you okay?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,970
- Yeah?
- It's a bad dream.

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,567
Go back to sleep.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,531
Yeah, sure.

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,524
I'm not completely wide awake
after hearing you scream in your sleep.

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,165
You wanna talk about it?

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,080
No, you know what I wanna do.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,884
I wanna unpack. It's been a month.

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,521
Do not change the subject, Bartholomew.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,727
- "Bartholomew"?
- Mmm-hmm.

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,881
Am I in trouble?

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,520
Well, this is the third night in a row.

40
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,882
I know something else
that's happened three nights in a row.

41
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,887
- It's a fire.
- Richmond Heights.

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,770
Go, Wally's gonna beat you there.

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,403
- What?
- I just...

44
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,200
I just really love you.

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,242
Detective Patterson just ran inside.
He hasn't come out yet.

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,402
The fire department
will not make it here on time.

47
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,410
<i>Help! I'm trapped in here!</i>

48
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,881
We gotta get him out of here.
This place is up in flames any second.

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,485
- You see the soot around this door?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,846
Means the fire has no ventilation.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,322
So if we open the door now, the sudden
inrush of oxygen will cause an explosion.

52
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,603
<i>- Hey!</i>
- Okay, so what do we do?

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,290
Create an exit point
for the heat and smoke,

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,124
and remove all the
oxygen at the same time.

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,611
- Which will put out the fire.
- Yeah.

56
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,761
<i>Help me!</i>

57
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,770
When I say so, open the door, all right?

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,961
Now.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,809
Flash, thanks.

60
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,841
Two of 'em.

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,090
Oh, man, that was so dope.
How do you stay so calm?

62
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,328
You're, like, scary
calm in the middle of a fire.

63
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,720
It's just experience, Wally.

64
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,644
It's why it's important
for you to shadow me for a while

65
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,211
and try to learn everything I know.

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,010
And then I get to kick some ass?

67
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,322
Let me give you some advice, Wally.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,847
Being a superhero
is not about kicking ass.

69
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,404
Well, nope, actually,
that's a straight-up lie.

70
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,971
There's a lot of ass-kicking involved.

71
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,282
Just keep doing
what you're doing, watching me.

72
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,805
You're doing great.

73
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,406
I gotta go to breakfast with Dad,
but I'll catch up with you guys later.

74
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,846
Yo, that's where... Nope.

75
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,923
- You okay?
- My suit goes there.

76
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,923
Ah, two suits, one mannequin.
That is what we call a conundrum.

77
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,127
No, I...

78
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,881
Hey-

79
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,721
You Okay?

80
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,161
Yeah, these things have
just been on the fritz lately.

81
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,209
It makes me feel like a criminal.

82
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,850
Hasn't been on the fritz, okay?

83
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,441
Maybe if you charged
the battery like I told you to...

84
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,931
Oh, I'm just supposed to hook myself up

85
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,889
to an outlet like
I'm some sort of human tablet?

86
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,840
Either you charge the cuffs,
or you go all Frozone on us again.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,206
Or...

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,809
- You could fix them for me?
- Or I could fix them.

89
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,725
- Sumptuous day, brethren.
- Oh, boy.

90
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,362
- Good morning, H.R.
- Oh, not just good, it's great!

91
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,686
And why is that?

92
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,730
Because I'm finally ready to announce that

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,326
the new S.T.A.R. Labs
Museum is ready for its opening.

94
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,802
Soft opening.
So, come, let's take the tour.

95
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,246
This could've been avoided.
You know that, right?

96
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,401
Mmm-hmm.

97
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,560
<i>Yeah, I just don't
see why you're defending the yellow guy.</i>

98
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,961
<i>Yes, he goes everywhere the Flash goes.</i>

99
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,929
But this morning, for example,
he's just standing back,

100
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,570
waiting for the warehouse to burn down.

101
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,087
Well, maybe he's training with the Flash,
you know, learning the ropes?

102
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,562
Okay, well, we send rookie cops
out on patrol, expect them to perform.

103
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,082
Look, I think the
yellow guy's gonna surprise you.

104
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,969
Once he gains a little bit of experience,

105
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,531
he's gonna give
the Flash a run for his money.

106
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,251
You know what I think?
I think maybe he's just not that fast.

107
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,680
Or maybe he's just a coward.

108
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,366
You don't get paid to think.
And Kid Flash ain't no coward.

109
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,366
"Kid Flash"? Okay, there it is!
The name says it all.

110
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,610
Hey...

111
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,601
I say we just send him to Keystone.
We already have a Flash.

112
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,207
Wally.

113
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,121
- Did you hear any of that?
- Any of what?

114
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,601
Nothing, it was just a cop being stupid.
Take you to breakfast?

115
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,807
Please.

116
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,528
- Behold.
- Whoa.

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,486
- You did all this?
- Yeah.

118
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,002
Well, I don't wanna take all the credit.
I'm too modest to do that, but, yeah.

119
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,568
Who exactly is paying for all this?

120
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,563
That's a great question. Olga!

121
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,806
Allow me to introduce you
to your new coworkers.

122
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,644
Everybody, this is Olga.

123
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,723
Hi.

124
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,731
She doesn't really speak English so much.
But she's great.

125
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,362
So, right over here, we have
the ticketing and the admissions.

126
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,171
Over there are specialty coffees.
Oh, uh, that reminds me.

127
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,164
Caitlin, initially,
I had you targeted for ticketing.

128
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,049
But it occurs to me,
with a few lessons in foam art,

129
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,326
you could very well man up...

130
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,450
Excuse me, woman up our cappuccino stand.
What do you think?

131
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,723
H.R., I think Caitlin's
gonna have plenty to do as it is.

132
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,086
Can I ask you a question?

133
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,687
Do you want to eat pizza pockets for
every meal for the rest of your life?

134
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,966
You don't. Nobody wants that.

135
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,044
What you want is an income,
and we, collectively,

136
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,522
need a cover for S.T.A.R. Labs
for our continued operation.

137
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,170
He makes some good points.

138
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,966
Now, for the <i>piéce de résistance...</i>

139
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,722
<i>Welcome to S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

140
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,364
I'm sorry, did you make a hologram of me?

141
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,364
Well, Francisco,
you made it perfectly clear

142
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,208
you didn't wanna be a tour guide.
You're not. You're a virtual tour guide.

143
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,682
Guess what? That falls under the umbrella
of "not wanting to be a tour guide."

144
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,927
On we go.

145
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,287
<i>My name is Francisco Ramon.</i>

146
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,842
<i>I wasn't always the esteemed
engineer you see before you.</i>

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,729
<i>It was my love of science</i>

148
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,201
<i>that allowed me
to overcome my tough upbringing</i>

149
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,727
<i>and join S.T.A.R. Labs
before our beautiful</i>

150
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,043
<i>and handsome founder, Harrison Wells,
stepped down.</i>

151
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,043
<i>I hope my love of science</i>

152
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,285
<i>will inspire some among you
to join the scientific community.</i>

153
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,885
- Wow.
- Thanks.

154
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,520
Here's the thing:
I don't sound anything like that.

155
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,245
<i>My love of science...</i>

156
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,563
<i>My love of science...</i>

157
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,246
<i>My love of science...</i>

158
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,640
Yeah, I'm gonna
need you to take a look at that.

159
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,126
I can't do that,

160
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,408
'cause I have important things
to do right now, so, yeah...

161
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,891
No...

162
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,964
- I gotta run an errand. See you later.
- Where are you going?

163
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,842
- Ah, hello, you.
- Hey.

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,890
- Am I in for another kidnapping?
- Okay, I deserved that.

165
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,488
No. I just came to check on you.

166
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,130
We haven't seen much
of you since Christmas.

167
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,087
That's very sweet of you.
I'm doing well, thank you.

168
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,444
You know, what Savitar did,
forcing you to hurt people...

169
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,127
Savitar was controlling me, okay?

170
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,169
As far as I'm concerned,
my conscience is clear.

171
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,321
Really?

172
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,330
Then why the zolpidem?
Are you having trouble sleeping?

173
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,049
Why don't we stop
playing games, Doctor Snow,

174
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,440
and you tell me
what you actually came for,

175
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,284
rather than accusing me
of having insomnia?

176
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,086
I actually need your help.

177
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,447
How can I help you?

178
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,963
Well, you're the world's foremost
specialist on meta-humans.

179
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,246
Yes, this much is true.

180
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,882
And I need you to
help me get rid of my powers.

181
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,010
I've tried everything.
I've run every test, blood, DNA.

182
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,646
And I can't reverse this.

183
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,049
I need to get rid of my powers before...

184
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,281
Before what?

185
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,164
Before I hurt someone else,
the way I hurt you.

186
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,043
I don't cure meta-humans.
I put them in prison.

187
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,850
You're on your own, I'm afraid.

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,971
No, no, no. Please...

189
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,281
<i>Okay.</i>

190
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,408
<i>- Can I open my eyes yet? Please?</i>
<i>- Um...</i>

191
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,766
- Yeah. But just one second.
- Okay.

192
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,001
Just, um...

193
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,051
Yeah. Okay, open 'em.

194
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,041
Well,

195
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,361
I know you wanted to unpack slowly,
like a normal couple,

196
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,168
but I don't know, between our jobs
and the S.T.A.R. Labs Museum and...

197
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,367
Do you hate it?

198
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,770
- No. No, I don't hate it.
- You know, I just, I don't...

199
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,090
I just wanna give you
the home that you deserve. I...

200
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,721
Barry, you have. I love our loft.

201
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,647
Look...

202
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,805
What I don't love is you not talking
to me about these nightmares.

203
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,041
I don't know. I mean, I've seen
a lot of terrible things in my life.

204
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,844
The nightmares, they're just a part of me.

205
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,451
Yeah, but, Barry, I have been with you
through all of those terrible things.

206
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,086
This is different. It feels different.
What are you not telling me?

207
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,487
I'm sorry.

208
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,250
- Uh, that's a robbery in progress.
- That is a robbery in progress.

209
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,482
- I'm sorry.
- Go.

210
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,506
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

211
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,126
See, I'm living with someone now.

212
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,204
So I can't have criminals
constantly interrupting our alone time.

213
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,321
Flash.

214
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,041
<i>Morillo was found guilty of grand theft</i>

215
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,363
<i>and aggravated assault
after he was caught by the Flash...</i>

216
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,369
That gun.

217
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,329
I've never seen
anything like that in my life.

218
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,608
- I want a gun like that.
- What happened out there?

219
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,649
Your telemetry readings
dropped precipitously.

220
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,451
I don't know. But it caught me off-guard.

221
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,609
I've gotta run an errand.
I'll be right back.

222
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,042
Okay. So, we're up
against a guy with a futuristic rifle

223
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,851
that steals jewelry
and looks like a pirate.

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,240
A pirate, right. Then,

225
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,961
we shall call this scurvy lad
by the name of Plunder.

226
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,727
<i>- Plunder, agreed?
- Jared Morillo, aka Plunder...</i>

227
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,684
<i>Okay, aren't you supposed
to be working on, like,</i>

228
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,841
<i>your museum or something?</i>

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,207
Aren't you supposed to be helping me,
Francisco, with me hologram.

230
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,361
That's not my problem.

231
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,607
Yeah, I just wanna show you something.

232
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,004
Why do I feel like
I'm walking into a trap?

233
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,484
Anyway, I'm gonna get CCPD to monitor
all the jewelry stores in the city.

234
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,769
This guy must be pretty full of
himself knowing he escaped the Flash.

235
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,843
- So ten to one, he'll be back.
- All right.

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,162
When he is, we'll be ready for him,
though. Right, Barry?

237
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,881
No, not we, Wally.
This... You're still training.

238
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,204
Have you seen my times
in the Speed Lab lately?

239
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,725
I'm almost as fast as you.

240
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,921
Okay, this isn't about speed.

241
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,048
This is about gaining
knowledge and experience.

242
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,804
So please just trust me, all right?

243
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,402
Look, I am as overprotective
a father as you can get,

244
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,643
but I gotta be honest, Barr, I'm...
I agree with Wally.

245
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,801
I don't know, Joe.

246
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,407
Let's just see what else we can find
on this guy before we let Wally loose.

247
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,449
Okay. Well, remember the best way
to teach somebody something

248
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,649
is to throw them in the deep end.
That's how I taught you how to swim.

249
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,245
That was...

250
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,721
- I'm still mad about that.
- You can swim now, can't you?

251
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,727
Yeah.

252
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,327
Got your text.

253
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,481
Hi. Come, take a seat.

254
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,843
I know I was rude yesterday.

255
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,162
Yeah, you were a world-class jerk.

256
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,449
- Yeah, there is a reason.
- Because you are a world-class jerk?

257
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,601
Fair enough.

258
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,887
Listen, I've been trying really hard
not to think about my alter ego,

259
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,201
about what he did.

260
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,807
And seeing you,
it just brought it all back.

261
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,649
Look, what Alchemy did was not your fault.

262
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,801
Yeah.

263
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,443
Tell that to Dave Frieman, to Ben Edwards,
Jorge Gonzales.

264
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,961
These men were part of the
CCPD Task Force that Savitar murdered.

265
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,809
I should have died, not them.

266
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,646
Julian, what you're feeling,
it's completely normal.

267
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,407
It's called survivor's guilt.
But it wasn't your fault, okay?

268
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,490
You're a victim, too. I...

269
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,848
I tortured people and
nearly killed my best friends.

270
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,847
I didn't ask for these powers, just like
you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.

271
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,561
Yeah.

272
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,405
I just don't know how to move forward.

273
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,201
Why don't you come
join us at S.T.A.R. Labs?

274
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,330
You can help Team Flash fight meta-humans.

275
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,481
- Being serious?
- Yeah.

276
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,802
Barry and the team,
they'd be thrilled to have you.

277
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,485
I would be thrilled to have you.

278
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,441
Uh...

279
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,967
I'll give it some thought.

280
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,727
Thanks for coming.

281
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,885
Tell me why I'm in here
fixing your hologram.

282
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,491
Well, I'm just so persuasive.

283
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,246
As a matter of fact,
my partner on my Earth,

284
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,890
Randolf, used to say, "Why, H.R.",

285
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,283
"you could convince a cowboy to
buy dirt in a sand storm." Cappuccino.

286
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,727
- Didn't you just have one of those?
- Oh, yeah.

287
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,089
Look, I gotta order
more parts for this thing.

288
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,129
Yeah, no, go ahead. Price is no object.

289
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,610
Hey. How's it going?

290
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,401
You know, S.T.A.R. Labs Museum,
gift that keeps on giving. So...

291
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,761
- Okay.
- Barry, cappuccino.

292
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,161
- Hi. I'm good. I'm sorry.
- Okay. All right.

293
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,089
- You know I'll double down.
- Yeah, no. Sure.

294
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,362
I just actually wanted to
ask you something about

295
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,330
your scientific, romance novels.

296
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,562
My novels? Yeah. Sure, please.
Have a seat.

297
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,370
- Yeah, ask anything you want.
- Okay.

298
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,522
- Any question. Yeah.
- Yeah? All right, cool.

299
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,331
Um, I was just wondering if you've
ever written about time travel.

300
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,801
More specifically,
traveling to the future.

301
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,685
No, my bestseller,
<i>The Future Ain't What It Used to Be,</i>

302
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,564
that was...

303
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,051
It was all about this guy who's
actively trying to prevent his own murder.

304
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,368
Won the Nebula Award.
It was well-received.

305
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,846
- Wow.
- Yeah.

306
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,447
So this character, your character,
was he able to change his future?

307
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,565
More specifically, if he allowed
certain events to occur naturally,

308
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,520
was he only cementing the very timeline
that resulted in a horrible event later?

309
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,681
There were two schools of thought.

310
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,330
One faction, one group of fans,

311
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,244
they believe that the
future is ever-changing.

312
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,050
You know, it's not fixed. And so,

313
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,083
you could make of
the future anything you wish.

314
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,241
Right.

315
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,323
Another group of fans
vehemently disagreed with it.

316
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,606
They said, "No, no, no."

317
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,128
"The future is fixed, and you can't
change it, no matter how hard you try."

318
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,441
Mmm-hmm.

319
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,204
Where do you come down
on a fixed or ever-changing future?

320
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,489
Well, I think that a man
often meets his destiny

321
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,648
on the very road he takes to avoid it.

322
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,649
- Meaning...
- Meaning...

323
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,281
The future is fixed.

324
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,241
Yeah.

325
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,488
<i>Yo, there's a robbery at the Payson Hotel.</i>

326
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,687
- Go.
- Yeah.

327
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,321
Hey.

328
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,803
Bring that chopper back.

329
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,728
You just couldn't resist
another heist, huh?

330
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,290
What's the fun in one and done?

331
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,922
Avoiding a 15-yearjail sentence in
Iron Heights would have been nice.

332
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,605
But you're forcing my hand.

333
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,809
And I guess
it's a little late for that now.

334
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,770
Yeah, guess again.

335
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,567
Barry! Behind you!

336
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,850
<i>I can't shake these things, Cisco.</i>

337
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,280
- Shake faster.
- <i>Huh?</i>

338
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,761
He means phase.

339
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,241
<i>Barry, what are you waiting for?</i>

340
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,962
<i>After he was caught by the Flash...</i>

341
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,241
Watch out!

342
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,281
On, Wally.

343
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,807
I caught that whole thing, man.
Anything you wanna say to camera?

344
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,126
Oh, for real?

345
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,324
Uh, what up, Central City?
The name's Kid Flash.

346
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,166
Wally, congratulations. That was amazing!

347
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,926
- Great job, Wally.
- Kid Flash. Let 'em know!

348
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,089
That's how it's done!

349
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,924
We just deposited Plunder in Iron Heights.

350
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,964
- Yes, you did.
- His real name is Jared Morillo.

351
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,169
Turns out he's wanted for a string of
robberies from here to Star City.

352
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,401
Wally, what was that?

353
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,925
I mean, you're supposed
to be shadowing me.

354
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,330
Wait, you're mad at me? I thought...

355
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,529
- Observe and learn, that's it. That's it!
- Whoa.

356
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,727
Barr, ease up.

357
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,968
- Wally just saved your life!
- I'm sorry, Wally.

358
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,964
But if you can't learn to follow orders,
this deal between us, it's over.

359
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,562
Okay! Who's ready for...

360
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,922
Oh, man. Wallace,

361
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,651
B.A., you're supposed to be
dressed for the museum opening!

362
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,404
H.R., we're speedsters. We have time.

363
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,840
- Nobody likes a braggart.
<i>- Yeah,</i>

364
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,490
but we were actually talking
about something important

365
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,971
- before you showed up. So...
- You...

366
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,484
- Okay, you clean up well.
- Thank you.

367
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,407
I like the way you dress.
Guys, this is a very, very big deal!

368
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,531
For all of us! Come on.
Don't be late to the party!

369
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,207
Wally...

370
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,086
Look, I'm gonna go over to CCPD
and fill out this Morillo paperwork.

371
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,164
Whatever the reasoning you have for
ragging on Wally, please get over it.

372
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,841
Hmm.

373
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,166
Caitlin, where is everybody?
Nobody's here.

374
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,841
No one showed up.

375
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,723
Ah, a customer...
Our first customers! Welcome.

376
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,360
Welcome to the grand
S.T.A.R. Labs Museum opening.

377
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,841
And today, for your ticket price
of admission, today only,

378
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,044
you also get a free steaming cup of Joe.

379
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,170
- Ticket price?
- Yep.

380
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,401
I thought this museum was free.

381
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,168
Oh, did you find us
through social media? 'Cause...

382
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,560
<i>Welcome...</i>

383
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,046
Olga!

384
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,406
The thing, it's doing the thing.

385
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,329
Folks! No, wait... Don't...

386
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,171
Wait, no. Half price. Half... Quarter...

387
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,560
I'll make a new pot of coffee.

388
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,245
- Don't bother.
- No one's coming.

389
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,488
This isn't working. I don't know why.

390
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,641
You see this?

391
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,565
Do you see what you've done, H.R.?

392
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,122
You've distracted us for months so what,
so that you could feel useful?

393
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,130
You're not useful.
This museum isn't useful.

394
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,409
You know what? That's mean.

395
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,562
Yeah, well, I guess I learned
that from your doppelganger.

396
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,484
And at least he contributed something.

397
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,761
Guys, there's another...

398
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,850
Hey, welcome to... It's Julius, you guys.

399
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,286
What are you doing here?

400
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,843
Well, I've given it some thought.
And I'd like to accept your invitation.

401
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,411
Invitation for what?

402
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,130
Did you ask Julian
to join Team S.T.A.R. Labs?

403
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,089
I know he's an acquired taste, but...

404
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,925
Yeah, well, he is Doctor Alchemy,
the big bad's little bad, so...

405
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,208
Yeah, he gave Wally his powers.

406
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,401
That I don't mind.

407
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,607
Guys, I need his help.

408
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,726
I'm sorry, Cisco, but these cuffs,
they aren't cutting it.

409
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,123
Every night when I go to bed,
I'm afraid that I'm gonna wake up...

410
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,927
Her.

411
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,160
Maybe Julian can think
of something that we haven't.

412
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,200
Barry, when your mom was murdered,

413
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,404
Joe and Iris, they took you in.

414
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,971
Cisco, when Dante died,

415
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,929
I slept on your couch to keep you company.

416
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,802
The things we see,
the things that we face,

417
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,646
no one can do this alone.

418
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,960
Trying is the biggest
mistake that you can make.

419
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,722
He hasn't told anyone
that Barry's the Flash.

420
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,969
I think we can give him a chance.

421
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,884
Tell Julian
we'll think about it, all right?

422
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,686
- Iris.
- Hey.

423
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,246
I need to show you something.

424
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,407
- I forgot this place existed.
- Yeah.

425
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,211
The original Wells
used to call it his Time Vault.

426
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,370
I've been coming down here a lot lately.

427
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,804
I guess I've become as obsessed
with the future as he once was.

428
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,171
After Flashpoint happened,
this article reappeared.

429
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,281
"Flash missing,"

430
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,729
"vanishes in crisis. Julie Greer.
April 25th, 2024."

431
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,445
The byline used to read,
"Iris West-Allen."

432
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,524
The future's changed.

433
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,285
So maybe I quit my job.

434
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,600
Yeah, that's what I'd hoped at first, too,
or something. But, I...

435
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,048
Iris, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you this sooner.

436
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,562
When I threw the Philosopher's Stone
into the Speed Force,

437
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,683
I accidentally ran to the future.

438
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,964
I saw Savitar murder you.

439
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,725
And I saw myself,

440
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,084
and I wasn't fast enough to save you.

441
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,163
Barry, no, I mean, we...

442
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,801
We destroyed the Stone.

443
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,122
- Savitar's gone, so...
- Maybe not.

444
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,289
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe not.

445
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,600
Is that why you keep having nightmares?
You keep seeing me.

446
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,682
So, what does this
have to do with Plunder?

447
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,049
He was already in jail in the future.

448
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,170
So, I don't know.
I thought if I didn't catch him,

449
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,120
that I could stop
the timeline from cementing.

450
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,009
I could prevent your death. I don't know.

451
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,164
Barry, you cannot stop
protecting the city to save me.

452
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,321
Why?

453
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,124
Why not? I'm sorry, one robber goes free,
it's that versus your life.

454
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,204
Joe would want me to make the
exact same choice, Iris. He...

455
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,007
Iris...

456
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,450
- How long?
- How long what?

457
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,250
How long until it happens?

458
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,926
This is not gonna happen.

459
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,803
Hey, look at me. This is not gonna happen.

460
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,561
Jay said that your death is
just one possible future. Okay?

461
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,326
So that gives us four months
to figure out how to stop Savitar.

462
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,085
I swear on both my parents' lives,
I will protect you.

463
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,604
We can't do this alone, Barry.

464
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,529
Hey. Guys. Um...

465
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,131
Iris and I, um,

466
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,528
we have something we need to tell you.

467
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,090
So you're saying that
four months from now, Savitar will...

468
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,049
- Kill me.
- Possibly.

469
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,521
It's okay, guys. I'm okay, really.

470
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,447
- How are you gonna tell Dad?
- I'm not.

471
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,880
Iris, he needs to know.

472
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,247
I agree with Wallace. Joe needs to know.

473
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,402
No. Guys, this news would blind him, okay?

474
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,206
We all saw how crazy he went
when Wally was in danger.

475
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,408
Imagine if he knew that
Savitar was trying to kill me.

476
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,562
He would go after Savitar himself.

477
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,887
Wally...

478
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,170
The future isn't set. There's still hope.

479
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,570
But, Barry, the future,

480
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,404
it's harder to change
than you can imagine.

481
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,005
The future wants to happen.

482
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,605
The way it was explained to me was,

483
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,922
imagine if you had
a row of dominoes, okay?

484
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,923
Now, those dominoes are all set up.

485
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,923
- And the... It's...
- Here.

486
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,561
So convenient.
Yeah, give me them. Barry, if you...

487
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,404
So, imagine, okay, a domino.

488
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,250
Each domino is a moment in time.

489
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,686
One moment in time leads to the next.

490
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,569
So as one domino falls, it hits the next,

491
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,688
it hits the next, and the next,
and the next, and so on,

492
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,525
leading to the inevitable conclusion.
And that is...

493
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,406
The future.

494
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,803
And what happens
if we alter certain events?

495
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,247
Well, you could, conceivably,

496
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,206
change where you end up.

497
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,442
But, Barry, if you would...

498
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,129
So, you could change the future.

499
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,682
But you have to be
very careful about which events...

500
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,846
You alter.

501
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,811
We need to figure out everything
that happens leading up to Iris' death.

502
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,450
Wait, when I saw the future,

503
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,201
there was a news scroll on TV
I mean, that could offer us some clues.

504
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,806
Absolutely. I think I can help with that.

505
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,050
Hang on, McFly.
I'm about to vibe you back to the future.

506
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,405
- Can you pass me the multi-meter, please?
- Yeah.

507
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,726
- The multi-meter.
- Yeah.

508
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,321
- The multi-meter.
- Yeah.

509
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,489
I'm better with the tools of the scribe.
There it is.

510
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,881
Are you sure your buddy Randolf
back home didn't just solve

511
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,485
that cryptogram to get rid of you?

512
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,841
Well, perhaps he did.

513
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,486
Look, I came to
this Earth seeking redemption.

514
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,604
But I realize now, you're right.

515
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,843
Greatness isn't in the cards for me.

516
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,447
Okay.

517
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,531
So you failed.
So nobody came to your opening.

518
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,446
Don't end it like this.
Greatness takes time.

519
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,961
And you know this.

520
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,046
"If a string is in a knot,
patience will untie it."

521
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,162
"Patience can do lots of things.
Have you ever tried it?"

522
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,881
Right.

523
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,530
- Hey, guys. You ready?
- Yeah.

524
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,051
Yeah, we're ready.

525
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,804
The machine's souped up and ready to go.

526
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,689
It's gonna be a hell of a vibe.

527
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,927
All you have to do is just sit back,
relax, or, well, try to relax.

528
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,521
And concentrate, really focus,

529
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,809
on the exact date
in the future that you traveled to.

530
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,687
Yeah.

531
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,086
May 23rd, 2017.

532
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,681
Barry, whatever happens,
I am right here waiting for you, okay?

533
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,881
- I know.
- Crank it.

534
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,761
Three, two, one...

535
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,170
<i>- What do you see?</i>
- An empty street, a bus stop.

536
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,923
The me from Christmas
just came out of the Speed Force.

537
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,570
<i>In other legal news,
the highly publicized trial</i>

538
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,768
<i>- of Jared Morillo, aka Plunder...
- He's watching the news report.</i>

539
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,081
<i>Comes to a close.</i>

540
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,921
<i>Morillo was found guilty of grand theft
and aggravated assault...</i>

541
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,851
- These are the headlines, right?
- Headlines. Yeah.

542
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,128
You know what? Call 'em out.
I'll write 'em down.

543
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,450
Um...

544
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,969
"Music Meister gets six-figure book deal."

545
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,767
<i>Luigi's opens after murder.</i>

546
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,122
"Joe West honored at City Hall."

547
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,281
Good for you, Joe.

548
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,441
"Killer..."

549
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,967
What does it say?

550
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,811
"Killer Frost still at large."

551
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,842
"S.T.A.R. Labs Museum closes."

552
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,807
<i>Don't!</i>

553
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,805
<i>Savitar has Iris.</i>

554
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,321
<i> Don't do this.</i>

555
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,051
<i>Now, finally, I am free of you.</i>

556
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,644
Look, up on the roof.

557
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,841
Barry, I love you.

558
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,001
<i>No, don't say that, all right?</i>

559
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,003
- H.R. is here.
- Me? Are you sure?

560
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,844
Yeah. You weren't here before.

561
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,365
The future's changed since then.

562
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,964
You lose, Barry.

563
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,326
<i>No!</i>

564
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,481
Just get us out of here.

565
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,409
You had a rifle pointed at Savitar.

566
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,291
Somehow, telling you about
Iris' death changed the future.

567
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,366
I was wrong, you were right.
Your theory is correct.

568
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,444
Guys, my future isn't the
only one that we need to change.

569
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,601
No, these headlines, though,

570
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,008
they tell us what happens in the future

571
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,202
where Caitlin becomes
Killer Frost and Iris dies.

572
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,364
If we can change the headlines,
that means we can change the future.

573
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,363
That's right. Challenge accepted.

574
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,043
Dad's upstairs.
We've been looking for you.

575
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,806
- What happened?
- Plunder escaped.

576
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,611
Morillo assaulted two guards
on his way out of Iron Heights.

577
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,569
Any idea where he might strike next?

578
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,041
Well, we've got it narrowed
down to 35 jewelry stores

579
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,208
and 48 hotels in Central City. So...

580
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,089
What about banks? Auction houses?

581
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,768
<i>He was caught by the Flash robbing the
Central City Museum earlier this year.</i>

582
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,927
Central City Museum. That's where he is.

583
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,287
Where'd you get that?

584
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,927
Um, isn't there a jewelry
exhibit there right now?

585
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,127
<i>Yeah.</i>

586
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,521
Uh-huh. With diamonds. Big ones.
So it makes sense.

587
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,247
Let's suit up.

588
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,849
- I don't understand.
- Come here.

589
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,080
I was a dick yesterday, Wally.
It wasn't about you.

590
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,646
I was scared when you caught Plunder.

591
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,370
I didn't know
what it meant for Iris' future.

592
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,601
You're ready.

593
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,367
Far more ready than I was when I started.
What do you say?

594
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,641
- I'm in.
- All right.

595
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,200
Plunder, my man,
where do you think you're going?

596
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,204
Right through you.

597
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,171
- You all right?
- I'm good, dude. You can have this one.

598
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,607
- No, Wally, this one has to be you.
- Why?

599
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,286
Because if you take down Plunder,

600
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,011
the news report that says that
I captured him in the future, it's wrong.

601
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,808
We can prove that
we can alter the future, here and now.

602
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,210
So that's why you sent me out here.

603
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,203
I sent you out here because you're a hero.

604
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,409
Iris needs a hero right now, Wally.

605
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,242
They are running.

606
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,086
Wally, take your next left.
The streets meet up in about two miles.

607
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,402
If you time it just right,
you'll be able to blindside him.

608
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,561
Got it.

609
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,530
<i>Kid Flash! Kid Flash! Kid Flash!</i>

610
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,047
You hear that? They're saying your name.

611
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,003
<i>Today's top story:
Jared Morillo, aka Plunder,</i>

612
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,924
<i>is back in police custody</i>

613
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,731
<i>after attempting to rob
the Central City Museum.</i>

614
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,923
<i>Morillo was apprehended by a new speedster
who goes by the name "Kid Flash."</i>

615
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,762
That settles it.
I think you're officially Kid Flash now.

616
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,090
Yeah, it's growing on me.

617
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,688
And this rifle is growing on me.

618
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,169
Heat-seeking bullets are just the
beginning of what this bad boy can do.

619
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,129
How did you end up with Plunder's rifle?

620
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,282
- Barry stole it for me. Right, Barr?
- Mmm-hmm.

621
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,284
Oh, so you plundered Plunder?

622
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,204
I had to do something
while Wally was cuffing him.

623
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,968
Thanks to you, we changed the future.

624
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,928
If we can change one of these events,

625
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,122
we can change them all.
Nothing is set in stone.

626
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,046
See you guys tonight?

627
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,241
- Can't wait.
- All right.

628
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,561
Yeah.

629
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,210
I called the local elementary school and
gave the principal discounted tickets.

630
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,047
I figured, hey, you know,
if the kids love it,

631
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,283
they'll tell their parents, and,
well, the rest writes itself.

632
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,484
You, Francisco, are brilliant.

633
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,482
Of course, science

634
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,730
is what will inspire these children,
not just the Flash. Of course.

635
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,086
Check it out.

636
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,006
Welcome to S.T.A.R. Labs.
My name is Francisco Ramon.

637
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,084
I wasn't always the
esteemed engineer you see before you.

638
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,727
<i>But after years of hard work and
studying, I joined S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

639
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,564
- <i>I hope my love of science...</i>
- Should we go talk to them?

640
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,285
<i>Will inspire some among you</i>

641
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,321
<i>to join the scientific community as we
strive to reach a new age for humanity.</i>

642
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,247
Thank you.

643
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,245
You're very welcome.

644
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,806
Okay, the quiche is in the oven,

645
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,291
- the beer and wine are in the fridge...
- Okay. Yeah.

646
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,805
- And the candles are on the table.
- Yes.

647
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,371
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- What?

648
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,521
I forgot the ice.

649
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,246
Instant party save.

650
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,131
- Babe, you have never been sexier.
- I know.

651
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,321
Hey, Iris...

652
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,082
How are you doing? For real. Are you okay?

653
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,646
Yeah, I'm fine.

654
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,371
Okay. 'Cause if you're not fine,
you can talk to me, you know that, right?

655
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,327
I know.

656
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,131
All right.

657
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,281
- You ready?
- Yeah.

658
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,487
All right.

659
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,441
- Hey!
- Hey!

660
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,847
I got you guys a plant. That's
a standard housewarming gift, right?

661
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,081
<i>- Thanks!</i>
- Yes. Perfect. Hi.

662
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,401
<i>Not on my Earth.
On my Earth, we give reptiles.</i>

663
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,843
- Whoa.
- Present to you McSnurtle, the turtle.

664
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,809
Careful, she bites.

665
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,201
- I get... This is for me? For...
- Just for you. Housewarming.

666
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,441
- Hi!
- Wow.

667
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,121
- Hey.
- Hey.

668
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,451
You two did really well.
This place is noyce.

669
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,728
Thank you. Hi, Daddy.

670
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,241
Oh.

671
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,211
Oh, my God, it's perfect.

672
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,087
- Wow.
- Yeah, right?

673
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,890
What are we gonna call you?

674
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,411
Look, I got a pet.

675
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,607
- Where are you trying to...
- What's his name?

676
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,886
- Hello, hello.
- He says Fred...

677
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,041
Hey.

678
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,689
- I hope I'm not too late.
- Right on time.

679
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,008
- Yeah.
- This is, uh, for you.

680
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,571
- Ah, thank you.
- Yeah.

681
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,682
Um... Yeah.
So we all talked it over, and...

682
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,441
Welcome to the team.

683
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,405
- You being serious?
- Yeah.

684
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,008
- Thank you. Yeah, this is so exciting.
- Yeah.

685
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,290
I mean, my last team,
they were all murdered by Savitar. So...

686
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,842
We need to work on your small talk skills.

687
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,923
Yeah, sure. Just wanted to be upfront.

688
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,570
- Come on.
- That's nice of you.

689
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,242
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, love one.

690
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,491
- Is this for me?
- Oh, yeah.

691
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,768
- All right.
- This place is incredible, Barr.

692
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,206
Thank you.

693
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,443
I have to admit,
I missed you around the house.

694
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,011
- Yeah?
- But...

695
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,845
Wally over there keeps me plenty occupied.

696
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,210
Yeah, I already talked to Wally,
but I'm sorry about yesterday.

697
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,681
You were right.
He's really important to this team.

698
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,761
He's a real hero, Joe.

699
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,325
Both my sons are heroes.

700
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,005
Julian and I were talking about
your battery problem with your cuffs.

701
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,808
We decided we'd invest
in an alternate accessory.

702
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,121
<i>Voilà.</i>

703
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,246
Every time you go outside,
solar energy will recharge it.

704
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,685
Guys, this means so much to me. Thank you.

705
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,527
Of course.

706
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,881
Thank you.

707
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,601
Ta-da!

708
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,841
Hi, guys. I asked myself
to say a few words on this occasion.

709
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,771
A home, you know,
more than bricks and mortar,

710
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,327
and a turtle, it's a feeling.

711
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,724
It's a feeling of belonging, isn't it?

712
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,851
Of love, of course.
Of hope for the future.

713
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,367
I don't know if I have ever met two people

714
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,330
who are more suited
to one another than you two.

715
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,081
To Barry and Iris.

716
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,330
- Barry and Iris.
- To Barry and Iris.

717
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,481
Barry and Iris.

718
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,880
- To us.
- To us.
