00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,052
[sighs]

161
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,846
...I used to dream of having kids with you.

162
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,598
- Oh.
- [chuckles] No, I did.

163
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,475
A family. Nesting, you know.

164
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:17,354
I-I mean, can you imagine
how perfect our kids would be?

165
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,647
Sublime.

166
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,025
Twice as strong as Ryan.

167
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,612
No kid of mine would ever know
a room like this, I'll tell you that.

168
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,739
Just so you know,

169
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,659
I'll fucking shatter whatever
you try to stick up there.

170
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,370
Maeve! Don't be so crass.
We're not savages.

171
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:36,373
I respect what you are, even if you don't.

172
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,958
I would never force myself on you.

173
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:39,960
[Homelander sighs]

174
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,422
But I am gonna harvest your eggs.

175
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:51,722
[stammers] That way,
if, God forbid, you do die,

176
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,058
whether by accident or choice,

177
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,560
you'll die knowing
that the very best of you carries on.

178
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:58,687
With me.

179
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:03,359
See, Maeve, I'm not letting you live.

180
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,694
I'm keeping you alive.

181
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:12,618
This is still a top-three day in my life.

182
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,123
Because today is the day I saw you scared.

183
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,921
[chuckles]

184

[door closes]

186
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,433
The hell happened to you two?

187
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,478
- It is but trivial.
- Trivial, my ass.

188
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,230
Y'all look like y'all got hit by a truck.

189
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,691
[Starlight] Oh, my God,
you shouldn't even be on your feet.

190
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:44,983
Come here, come here. Come on.

191
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,695
Yeah, um, we're just gonna
go lie down for a minute.

192
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,321
Okay? Come on.

193
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,532
She insisted when you called, right?

194
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,619
Butcher is everyone's problem now.

195
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,205
We're here to help.

196
00:08:58,956 --> 00:08:59,998
Oh.

197
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,085
[clattering]

198
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,294
Frenchie, are you high?

199
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,088
Well, that goes without saying.

200
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:15,180
Okay, satellite view has Mindstorm's place
about two miles in, due west.

201
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,432
Two miles?

202
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,017
Fuck me.

203
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,478
We could've parked closer.

204
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,692
So, do you mind telling us
what we're walking into here?

205
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,694
All you got to know is,

206
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,322
if he tries to make eye contact
with you, close your eyes.

207
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,241
Or what?

208
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,119
Just don't make eye contact with him,
then you got nothing to worry about.

209
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,295
Hey, why do you keep buying him,
like, Hefty bags full of weed?

210
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,714
[Butcher] Better high than mental.

211
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,258
Takes the edge off his PTSD.

212
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,968
Wait, he has PTSD?

213
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,928
Yeah, I saw it at Herogasm.

214
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,347
It's why he keeps blowing
the fuck out of everything.

215
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,060
We got to keep that cunt dozy as a lamb.

216
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:07,232
So, just to recap, uh, he's radioactive,

217
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,360
highly traumatized
and heavily self-medicated.

218
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,197
Feels good, feels right.

219
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,740
[scoffs] Tell me about it.

220
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,743
I mean, what sad bastard
self-medicates like that, eh?

221
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,455

[birds chirping]

225

Earving, sooner or later,
you're gonna have to t-t-talk about it.

226
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,804
Remember when you were nine,

227
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,807
a-and you hid in that ball pit
right over there,

228
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,019
after you p-p-p-paralyzed Lewis Frankel?

229
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,772
This is just like that.

230
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:32,067
[sighs] You can't hide from Soldier Boy.

231
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,320
We're your best pals, aren't we?

232
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:39,074
We got you through that erection
in the seventh grade,

233
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,536
that Hard Rock Cafe m-m-massacre in Lagos.

234
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,622
And by golly,
we'll get you through this, too.

235
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,958
- That's right.
- You're our friend.

236
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,643
What'd you say?

237
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,562
- What?
- What?

238
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,691
Nothing, mate. No one said nothing.

239
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,243
Hey, hey. Uh, your... your brain's leaking.

240
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,835
Oh, fuck.

241
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:38,008

Oh, shit.

[whistling]

00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,902
What the fuck is this shite?

246
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,323
Mum.

247
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,784
Oi, Mum.

248
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,080
Fucking Mindstorm.

249
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,252
Knock it off, you little fucking freak.
Come on.

250
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,004
Butcher, wake up. Wake up!

251
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:17,673
Fucking freak slipped away.

252
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,508
- He's gonna pick us off one by one.
- Butcher, wake up.

253
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,009
Wake up, Butcher. Butcher! Wake up!

254
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:23,011
No, you're wasting your time, he's gone.

255
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,222
- What did Mindstorm do?
- Well, if it's his usual MO,

256
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,057
trapped him in an endless nightmare

257
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,267
till he dies of terminal dehydration.

258
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,727
No, there's got to be a way
we can wake him up.

259
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,355
Mindstorm put him into this.
He can snap him out.

260
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,399
- Okay, great, great. Uh...
- But he's about to be dead.

261
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,068
Wait, wait, just hang on.
If we, if we, if we grab Mindstorm,

262
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,528
- we make him help Butcher...
- No way.

263
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,654
And then you can kill him.

264
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,531
Then you can go to town on him, man.
I don't give a fuck.

265
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,617
Hey. If you're gonna act hysterical,
I'm gonna slap you like I'm Connery.

266
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,704
Now, unless you want to end up
like your friend there,

267
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,038
it ain't worth the risk.

268
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,835
Look, chin up, okay? Deal's a deal.

269
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,170
You help me finish this,
I'll kill Homelander.

270
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,339
Butcher would have given up his life
for that in a heartbeat.

271
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,135
So, we doing this or not?

[groans]

273
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,765
Leave it. We got to move fast.

00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,354

Uh... [clears throat] You might
want to lay off the weed, huh?

00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,818

[Sam] Left his bloody bike
in the garden again.

Is that halothane?

00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:27,070
I chucked some at him at Herogasm.
The motherfucker didn't even flinch.

304
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:30,699
It will be the greatest sorrow of my life
that I missed Herogasm.

But no, this is not halothane.

00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,874
She's trafficking kids
the same age as Janine,

790
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,709
as the... as the kids in my classroom.

791
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:50,212
Homelander is the only one
protecting them.

792
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,047
Okay, you guys. That's enough.

793
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,757
Homelander ain't protecting shit,
all right?

794
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,801
He's feeding you this insane fairy tale,

795
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,762
and you're too fucking stupid
and-and brainwashed to fucking see it!

796
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,431
- Hey, fuck you. [chuckles]
- Both of you, stop.

797
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:05,894
You know what?

798
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,524
If you want to risk your life, fine.
Have at it.

799
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:12,567
But not with my baby girl.

800
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:13,985
You're not her father.

801
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:15,320
Someone's got to be.

802
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,366
- [grunts]
- [Monique] Marvin!

803
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:20,575
[voice breaking] Oh, my God, Todd.

804
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:22,702
Todd. Oh, my God, Todd.

805
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:25,705
Todd. Todd. Open your eyes. Wake up.

806
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,351
Here she is.

807
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:50,105
Did you think I wouldn't know
the second you walked through the door?

808
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,732
Well, we broke up.

809
00:44:52,816 --> 00:44:53,984
[Homelander chuckles]

810
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,820
It was time to pack my shit and go.

811
00:44:58,238 --> 00:44:59,364
[Homelander chuckles]

812
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,616
[inhales] Okay.

813
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,785
So, here's what happens now.

814
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:05,829
You're gonna march into VNN studios,

815
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:08,123
and you're gonna recant
everything you said.

816
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:12,294
It was a tragic cocktail
of heartbreak, Zoloft and despair.

817
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:16,965
You regret any harm that your lies
have caused Vought or me,

818
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,384
but me in particular.

819
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,094
- Mmm. Okay.
- Good.

820
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,389
Okay. But, um,
you want to hear my counter?

821
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,434
I stop Soldier Boy
before he murders more people,

822
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,477
and I find Maeve.

823
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,147
If she's still alive.

824
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,649
Maeve's just learning her manners.

825
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:37,360
And you should do the same.

826
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,573
Seriously, before you throw away
everything you've worked so hard for.

827
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,325
- Hmm?
- You know what? I could give a shit.

828
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,368
Really? You sure about that?

829
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:49,039
Your fame is the only thing
protecting you.

830
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,208
Here's the thing.

831
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,669
I'm not scared of you anymore.

832
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:57,339
I'm not. I see who you are.

833
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,257
I see how small you are.

834
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:03,136
I saw it.

835
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,431
[exhales]

836
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,017
I saw it the night
that you killed Supersonic.

837
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,311
You know what I remember from that night?

838
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:16,024
I remember what I told you
would happen to Hughie.

839
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:19,903
You walk, that's next.

840
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:24,866
Good luck with that.

841
00:46:25,742 --> 00:46:30,080
Now that you've told
my 190 million followers.

842
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:32,332
I'm still pretty famous.

843
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,959
- [chuckles] Hey, everybody!
- [elevator bell chimes]

844
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:35,710
Oh, that's me.

845
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:36,962
I got to go.

846
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:38,213
Starlight, uh, wait.

847
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,716
You're not supposed to record us
when we're running lines.

848
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:44,803
[elevator whirring]

849
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:48,640
[wind chimes tinkling]

850
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:57,774
[inhales deeply]

851
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:25,844
[tinkling continues]

852
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,993
- [whoosh]
- [soft thud]

853
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,164
[grunts]

854
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:56,875
Shit!

855
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:58,793
[both grunt]

856
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:00,253
- What the hell?
- [Hughie] Okay, wait! Wait.

857
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,839
- Why the fuck am I naked?
- I can explain, okay?

858
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,257
You're with Soldier Boy.

859
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,925
- You're trying to fucking kill me.
- No!

860
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:08,219
- No. No, I just saved your life.
- Leave me alone!

861
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:10,180
Please, calm down.
I only want to talk, okay? Just talk.

862
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:11,598
I'm not bothering anyone.

863
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:13,224
I'm just trying to get away
from all the fucking voices.

864
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:14,851
I'm just trying to get away
from the voices.

865
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,186
I'm just trying to get away
from the voices!

866
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,605
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
open my eyes, all right?

867
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:21,691
Please don't coma me. [breathing shakily]

868
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,321
Okay. Hey. We're cool.

869
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,947
Very chill. Very cool.

870
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:32,869
Also, we-we don't have to do this naked.

871
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,162
All right?

872
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,997
Just-Just clothes. They're clothes.

873
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,291
I'm gonna reach in.
I'm gonna grab you some, okay?

874
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,375
[bag unzips]

875
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:47,050
Look. Look, hey, I don't want to be here.

876
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:49,010
I-I was pretending to be someone I'm not.

877
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:51,930
I'm not like Soldier Boy.
That guy's full of shit.

878
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,723
I mean, no one is that tough, and then...

879
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:56,643
And the people who say they are?
They're lying.

880
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:58,603
And I'm... I'm done.

881
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,896
I want to go home.

882
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:03,149
So, I'm just... I'm begging you...

883
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:06,152
to please wake up my friend.

884
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:09,239
[Mindstorm] I've been inside his head.

885
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:11,116
- That guy's a piece of shit.
- It doesn't matter.

886
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,660
I-I don't want to be someone
who leaves people behind.

887
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:15,328
I want to be someone who saves his family.

888
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,871
And for better or worse...

889
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:19,457
[voice breaks] ...he's family.

890
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,084
- Please wake him up.
- No.

891
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,627
- No way.
- I can get you out of here.

892
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,964
If you just please, please wake him up,

893
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:27,924
I'll teleport you away.

894
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,220
You'll be safe away from everyone,
including Soldier Boy.

895
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,930
I'll take you wherever you want to go.

896
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,726
And I will never tell a soul
where that is.

897
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:39,894
Hand to God.

898
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,318
[inhales]

899
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,321
No. Not here.

900
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:51,823
So, that's it then, Billy?

901
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:54,659
Jesus, Lenny.

902
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:58,705
Just gonna piss off,
no goodbye or nothing like that?

903
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:01,583
I'll be back Christmas, once I got
everything sorted at the barracks,

904
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,710
you can maybe come out and see me.

905
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,172
Billy. Please don't leave me
alone with him.

906
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:09,257
I can't hack it.

907
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,218
You'll be all right.

908
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,015
No, he won't. Fucking listen to him.

909
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:18,766
If I stay, I'm gonna end up killing him,

910
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,643
get sent off to Borstal, or prison,

911
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:22,604
and what's that gonna do to Mum, hmm?

912
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:25,481
Break her bloody heart, is what it'd do.

913
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:30,486
Besides, the old cunt hates me the most,

914
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:33,489
so maybe if I'm gone, he'll leave you be.

915
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:35,408
You stupid fucking twat.
Don't you leave him.

916
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:38,703
I got to go, Len.

917
00:50:39,829 --> 00:50:41,789
- Billy, please.
- Leave off.

918
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:45,001
For fuck's sake, Lenny,
it ain't my job to look after you.

919
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:48,338
Don't be such a fucking poof
all your life.

920
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:00,683
Right.

921
00:51:05,438 --> 00:51:07,440
Please, don't go.

922
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,845
You served me up to him on a plate.

923
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,849
No, I... I didn't.

924
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:43,142
I-I wouldn't.

925
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,980
It's been six months,
and you come home to check on me

926
00:51:47,063 --> 00:51:48,356
not once.

927
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,857
Len, I-I'm sorry, but they...

928
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:52,694
they just wouldn't let me out
of the barracks.

929
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:03,037
Oh, Jesus, please. Please, fuck, no.

930
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,789
He's beating the living shit
out of me, Billy.

931
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,666
Day in and day out.

932
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:09,252
- I can't take no more.
- Please, Len, don't.

933
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,380
You fucking knew what he'd do.
It's your fault.

934
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,716
No, don't say that.
That's... That's not true.

935
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,134
I... I'm not that bastard.

936
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:19,554
Come off it, Billy. You always have been.

937
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:24,392
'Cause anyone who's ever loved you,
you end up getting them killed, don't you?

938
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:29,147
Me. Becca.

939
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,315
Now, Hughie,

940
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,358
the last person on God's green earth

941
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:34,610
trying to stop you from being a monster,
and what do you do?

942
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,738
Drag him down to your level.

943
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:40,616
When he dies, and he will,

944
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:43,244
then no one can stop you.

945
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:46,831
Can they?

946
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:48,499
[Butcher] No!

947
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,709
- Lenny, no!
- [gunshot]

948
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,002
[panting]

949
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,842
I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry!

950
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,510
Sorry for what?

951
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,182
- Hughie.
- It's okay, Butcher.

952
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:06,184
It's okay. You're all right.

953
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:08,311
Here. You're okay.

954
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,562
Hey, kid.

955
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:12,690
Right, right, yeah.

956
00:53:13,483 --> 00:53:15,443
Okay. Deal's a deal.

957
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,528
- Where we headed? [gasps]
- [screaming]

958
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:31,334
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

959
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:45,973
[Hughie grunts]

960
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,643
[coughs, groans]

961
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,188
Hiya, Dan.

962
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,190
It's-It's not what you think.
It wasn't my idea.

963
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:57,110
Oh, I know. It was Noir's,
but how does that work, huh?

964
00:53:57,193 --> 00:53:59,821
'Cause no way he makes a fucking move
without Vought.

965
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,115
- They gave him the green light.
- Why would they do that?

966
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:07,620
[indistinct conversation]

967
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:10,248
What? That's impossible.

968
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,002
[Mindstorm groaning]

969
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:22,093
[shouting]

970
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:27,181
[gasps]

971
00:54:43,114 --> 00:54:44,490
What'd he say?

972
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:12,477
[sniffles]

973
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:18,357
[cell phone buzzing]

974
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:22,487
Hello?

975
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:25,156
- I need to talk to Hughie. Where is he?
<i>- Oh, Starlight.</i>

976
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,449
How delightful.

977
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,576
He's just popped out for a bit.

978
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,869
Okay, well, he's not answering his phone.

979
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:32,872
Bit hard to keep a phone when
you're teleporting all day, innit, love?

980
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:36,375
<i>- How can I help?</i>
- Temp V is gonna kill you both.

981
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:38,252
Well, it's gonna have to join the queue.

982
00:55:38,336 --> 00:55:40,505
I was just in the lab. It causes lesions.

983
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:43,674
Okay? It turns your brain
into fucking Swiss cheese,

984
00:55:43,758 --> 00:55:45,384
<i>so, please, be honest with me,</i>

985
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:47,678
and tell me how many doses have you taken?

986
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,891
- Just a couple.
<i>- Jesus Christ.</i>

987
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:55,144
Butcher, three to five doses kills you.

988
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:57,688
You need to tell Hughie.

989
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,360
Yeah, yeah. I will, I will. I promise.

990
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:05,154
<i>Okay, but I'm calling back
every five minutes until...</i>

991
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:06,739
- [phone beeps]
- Butcher?

992
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:09,825
Goddamn it.

993
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:10,993
[door closes]

994
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,287
- [footsteps approaching]
- [Hughie] Okay.

995
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:16,832
Hi. Only thing open
was Long John Silver's,

996
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:20,086
so, I guess that's kind of
fish and chips, right?

997
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,171
Yeah.

998
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:24,966
- Nice one.
- Everything all right?

999
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,846
It's, uh...

1000
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:37,436
- It's the Temp V.
- What about it?

1001
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,409
We got to swing by the office
and get some more.

1002
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,626
And then you, me,

1003
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:04,422
and granny fucker are gonna
finish this fucking job.

1004
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,552
[chuckles] Yeah, fuck yeah.

1005
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:18,311
[line ringing]

1006
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:23,774
<i>- Your call has been forwarded...</i>
- Fuck.

1007
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:25,985
Do you think Monsieur Charcutier
will tell Hughie?

1008
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,528
Do you?

1009
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:39,915
I'm gonna save Hughie,

1010
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:43,169
even if he doesn't want me to.

1011
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,028
Ready, <i>mon coeur?</i>

1012
00:58:13,783 --> 00:58:14,784
Oh.

1013
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:16,577
Enjoy them

1014
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:19,747
before they feel like bendy straws again.

1015
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,380
[inhales sharply]

1016
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,516
<i>- Mon coeur?</i>
- [sighs]

1017
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:15,636
[soft chuckle]

1018
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:20,516
[Homelander] Obviously, I didn't realize
the little bitch was recording me, did I?

1019
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,143
No, no. A...

1020
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,353
- Ashley, I don't fucking care.
- [other line beeps]

1021
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,605
You're the spin doctor,
go fucking spin it.

1022
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:28,190
What?

1023
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:30,484
<i>- Sir, I apologize for disturbing you...</i>
- [sighs]

1024
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:31,777
<i>...but you have a call.</i>

1025
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:35,614
<i>He says he's...
Well, he's claiming to be Soldier Boy.</i>

1026
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,534
[stammers]

1027
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:40,995
Put him through.

1028
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:46,417
This really you?

1029
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,918
[Soldier Boy] <i>The situation's changed.</i>

1030
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:49,503
I thought we should have a conversation.

1031
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:50,921
<i>I don't know who the fuck
you think you are,</i>

1032
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:54,383
but you got lucky once
because you fucking ambushed me.

1033
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:55,468
<i>Fall 1980,</i>

1034
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:58,387
I get called into Vogelbaum's lab
for an experiment,

1035
00:59:58,471 --> 01:00:00,473
some shit about genetics.

1036
01:00:00,556 --> 01:00:02,933
<i>I still remember the</i> Penthouse <i>I used.</i>

1037

June.

1038
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:07,104
Danielle Deneux, bush like a Pomeranian.

1039
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:09,064
- What?
<i>- I beat my meat into a cup.</i>

1040
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:11,609
Turns out...

1041
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:14,278
Vogelbaum made a kid.

1042
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:17,615
<i>Born spring 1981.</i>

1043
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,201
A boy.

1044
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:22,870
<i>You know what the bitch of it is?</i>

1045
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:27,208
<i>If they'd have just kept me around,
I'd have let you take the spotlight.</i>

1046
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,836
What father wouldn't want that
for his son?
