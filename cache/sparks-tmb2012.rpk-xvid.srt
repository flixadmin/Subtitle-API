1
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,974
Terrific.

2
00:00:42,177 --> 00:00:43,417
What's up, numb-nuts?

3
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:44,821
Read 'em and weep.

4
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,587
Van Halen at the Centrum.

5
00:00:46,648 --> 00:00:47,752
Third row!

6
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:49,657
You should take Jolene, man.

7
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:51,493
I heard she got big nipples.

8
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:53,260
This is Van freakin' Halen, man.

9
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:54,824
Get serious.

10
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,632
Besides, I'm just not into girls anymore.

11
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:00,305
Dude, I'm into guys, too!

12
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:01,634
No, no, no, no, no.

13
00:01:01,697 --> 00:01:02,937
That's not what I meant.

14
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:06,139
I'm into women.

15
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:34,732
Hey, Mary.

16
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:37,968
I got two tickets to Van Halen this weekend.

17
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:39,171
What time should I pick you up?

18
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:42,040
It is Miss McGarricle, Donny.

19
00:01:42,104 --> 00:01:45,574
And that's cute,
but I am your teacher, not your girlfriend.

20
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:48,144
Whoa, Miss McGarricle,
who said anything about girlfriends?

21
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,780
Let's just start with a summer fling,

22
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:50,983
couple of hand jobs,

23
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:52,816
no expectations.

24
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:54,858
Don't get all psycho on me right away.

25
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:57,529
That is a month's detention.

26
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:01,793
What's a hand job?

27
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:04,394
I don't know, but I think I want one.

28
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:09,308
Can I go to the bathroom?

29
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:12,277
No. No talking in detention, Mr. Berger.

30
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,242
All right, I'm sorry for what I did.

31
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,781
I promise I won't do it again.

32
00:02:16,772 --> 00:02:18,547
You're in a lot of trouble, Donny.

33
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:22,015
Wait, you're not gonna tell my dad, are you?

34
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:24,315
He'll kick my ass. He's crazy.

35
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:26,586
What were you trying to do, anyway?

36
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:27,854
Impress your friends?

37
00:02:28,383 --> 00:02:31,455
Well, you know, you're...

38
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,364
You have a little crush on me?

39
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:35,795
No.

40
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:39,134
"No." So, you...

41
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:41,034
You don't want me.

42
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:44,909
No. Yeah.

43
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:47,537
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say right now.

44
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:49,741
Is that gum in your mouth, Donny?

45
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:02,761
You know,
I've been watching you all year, Donny.

46
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:04,991
When you hit that shot to beat Fairfield

47
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:09,729
and you were jumping up and down
in your little Larry Bird short-shorts

48
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,329
and sweating like ajar of pickles
in the hot sun...

49
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:15,198
Oh, God.

50
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:16,867
That was so hot.

51
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,979
Is this really happening?

52
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:24,210
This is happening.

53
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:26,513
It's happening right now.

54
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:28,054
In my office.

55
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,084
Okay. Awesome.

56
00:03:30,145 --> 00:03:32,352
So, I'm totally in.

57
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:34,052
How do you want to do it?

58
00:03:34,116 --> 00:03:37,222
'Cause I made sex before, lots of ways.

59
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,697
So you want to go straight to hand jobs

60
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:42,827
or eating me out or taking me from behind?

61
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:44,199
I'll teach you.

62
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:46,068
I'm a virgin.

63
00:03:48,263 --> 00:03:51,540
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,375
Oh, my God.

65
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:57,679
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

66
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,734
Who? Me?

67
00:04:37,312 --> 00:04:38,791
Hey, Donny, what'd you get?

68
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,492
And if I'm elected
eighth grade class president,

69
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:47,590
I promise to...

70
00:04:47,656 --> 00:04:49,863
You're getting so good at this!

71
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:58,469
I promise to do my best to lower prices at
the school stores and...

72
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:01,275
All of our practice is really paying off!

73
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:03,939
I like the sound of that.

74
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,855
Timmy, stop. Hold on a second.

75
00:05:27,596 --> 00:05:29,439
My dad's gonna kick my ass.

76
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:45,751
Calm down!

77
00:05:58,226 --> 00:06:01,105
Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny!

78
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,334
Who's the man?

79
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,037
Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny!

80
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:08,342
Yeah! You want some of me? Who's the man?

81
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,517
All right, everybody!

82
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:17,851
Enough!

83
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:19,950
I am aware that a lot of people think

84
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,389
that this young man

85
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:24,359
is not really a victim,
but someone that's living

86
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,332
the ultimate teenage boy's fantasy.

87
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:28,696
Absolutely.

88
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:32,600
But this is a serious crime.

89
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:35,335
Mary Beth McGarricle, rise for sentencing.

90
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:41,172
The fact that this relationship

91
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:44,706
has resulted in a pregnancy
and you show absolutely no remorse,

92
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,213
saying, and I quote,

93
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:51,223
I would fuck that kid again and again.

94
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,627
"He makes me feel like there's a rainbow
coming out of my beaver."

95
00:06:58,153 --> 00:06:59,928
...leaves me absolutely no choice

96
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:02,298
but to levy the maximum penalty.

97
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:06,864
Thirty years
in the Massachusetts Women's Penitentiary.

98
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:11,602
And furthermore, the court grants custody
of the unborn child

99
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,111
to Donald Berger's father...

100
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:14,778
Dumb-ass.

101
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,941
...until Donald turns 18,

102
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:19,952
at which time he will assume full custody.

103
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:22,519
Take care of our baby, Donny!

104
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,782
Miss McGarricle!

105
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:25,791
I'll never stop loving you!

106
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:28,286
That is just fucking mental.

107
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,816
The kid is young, he's attractive,

108
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:04,864
he can probably keep a hard-on
longer than this fucking guy.

109
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:17,471
Made you flinch, pansy.

110
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,236
Go ahead! I don't need you!

111
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,211
I'm Donny freakin' Berger!

112
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:24,449
I'm wicked famous
and I got a wicked big schlong!

113
00:08:24,606 --> 00:08:27,610
Hey, here's something.
Donny Berger's back in the news.

114
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:28,813
That kid who got his teacher pregnant?

115
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:30,185
- Exactly.
- I love that guy.

116
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:31,986
Seems like he bought a round last night.

117
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:33,048
Okay-

118
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:34,650
For everybody in Boston Garden.

119
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,821
Oh, my God, he's my hero.

120
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:41,027
That kid is burning through that money,
but he's having a good time doing it.

121
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,315
So, guy, how'd we do?

122
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,548
What them fuckers at the IRS say?

123
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,953
Well, they said a lot of stuff.

124
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:05,423
The thing that really jumped out

125
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,859
-was "three years in prison."
- Three years?

126
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,329
Yeah, you haven't paid taxes
since '94, Donny.

127
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:14,265
What... I thought they were
taking it out automatically!

128
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:15,926
I told them that's what you thought,

129
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,901
and they said
it's the stupidest thing they ever heard.

130
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,528
But there is some good news.

131
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:22,164
If you can pay
the balance off by the end of the weekend,

132
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,470
they'll suspend the sentence.

133
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:25,043
Oh, okay, there you go.

134
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,511
What are we talking about? Hit me.

135
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:27,772
Forty-three thousand.

136
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:29,042
Forty-three grand?

137
00:09:29,104 --> 00:09:30,276
No!

138
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,383
Come on, Donny!

139
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,114
Don't screw up my Tom Brady poster.

140
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:36,621
It's my favorite one.

141
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:38,316
Look at that jaw line.

142
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,882
Just the right amount of scruff.

143
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:43,156
I'm sorry! I'm just freaking out here!

144
00:09:43,218 --> 00:09:44,788
I don't got 43 grand!

145
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:46,661
Well, look, hey, good news.

146
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:48,325
Monday's Memorial Day,

147
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,266
so you don't need
to get the money till Tuesday.

148
00:09:50,325 --> 00:09:53,670
All right. That'll give me time to
sell my diamond Lamborghini!

149
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:56,473
Hey, hey, hey! You're killing me, man!

150
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:58,511
Don't mess with the genius.

151
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:01,445
Jimmy, I got $28 to my name.

152
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:02,914
Twenty-eight, huh? Okay.

153
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:05,645
I got a hot tip on a long shot
that just might come in.

154
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:07,150
- What is it, a horse?
- No.

155
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:11,279
This is Tubby Tuke, fat guy.

156
00:10:11,346 --> 00:10:12,757
Fat guy?

157
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:16,352
Gonna run the marathon.
Odds on him winning are 8,000-to-1.

158
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,454
But this cat's got wheels on him.

159
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,466
I think he's gonna win, I really do.

160
00:10:20,522 --> 00:10:23,992
All right, I'll put 20 on the fat fuck,
but I can't count on that.

161
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:26,129
It's a long shot, you said it yourself.

162
00:10:26,194 --> 00:10:27,366
But what about your kid?

163
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:28,736
Maybe he can come up with the dough.

164
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:30,472
We don't talk no more.

165
00:10:30,532 --> 00:10:32,512
He kind of moved out when he turned 18,

166
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,513
and that's the last I seen of him.

167
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:36,378
- What happened?
- I don't know.

168
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:40,850
I loved that little Han Solo
more than anything in the world, too.

169
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:44,618
- You named your kid Han Solo?
- Yes, sir.

170
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,157
Han Solo Berger?

171
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:47,693
Coolest name in the world, right?

172
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:49,228
Why don't you just Facebook him?

173
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:51,787
I can't afford that shit.
What am I, a billionaire?

174
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:54,959
I don't think he wants to be found, anyways.

175
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:57,025
Especially by me.

176
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,041
Hey, look! It's us!

177
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,347
- On the cover!
- Don't we look great?

178
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:15,649
Yeah, well, you look good.

179
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,246
I kind of look like a ventriloquist.

180
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,156
I don't know, it's still kind of weird, right?

181
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:23,162
I mean, it's got our faces and our names.

182
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:25,095
It just seems like anyone could find us.

183
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:28,691
"Find us"?
Honey, did you take your Xanax today?

184
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:29,826
Yeah, two.

185
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:32,302
I always double down
when your parents are in town.

186
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:34,565
Do you have your security undies?

187
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,040
- Yep, right here.
- Good.

188
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:37,508
I know that makes you feel better.

189
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:39,567
There's stranger things than walking around

190
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:42,080
with an extra pair of underwear
for emergencies.

191
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:46,084
Look, just this once, don't be so weird.

192
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,915
We're gonna have the best wedding ever.

193
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,113
Okay.

194
00:11:57,452 --> 00:12:01,332
Holy shit. What the hell happened
to my life, Champale?

195
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:04,801
Don, honey, no way to come up
with that money, huh?

196
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:07,668
No. The only thing
I'm good at is being Donny Berger,

197
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,436
and no one wants to pay for that anymore.

198
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:11,135
Aw, Donny.

199
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,077
Wow!

200
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,875
My face is your toilet!

201
00:12:14,936 --> 00:12:17,542
Show some fucking respect
over there, Kenny.

202
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:18,948
Hey, whoa.

203
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:22,583
Hey, Mom, did you want
some breakfast after you finish your dance?

204
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:24,020
Give it to me now, honey.

205
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,149
Donny doesn't mind, do you, Donny?

206
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:28,559
Holy cow, that's my son!

207
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:29,917
Who, Han Solo?

208
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:32,226
I thought you said he was a fatty.

209
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:34,699
No, no, no.
He must have lost the weight or something,

210
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,633
'cause I swear to God, that's my boy.

211
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:39,463
It says, "Todd Peterson to
wed Jamie Martin this Sunday

212
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,529
"at All Saints Church on Cape Cod."

213
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,269
Todd Peterson?

214
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:44,605
He changed his name!

215
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,736
Why?

216
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:49,313
What was wrong with Han Solo Berger?

217
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,475
It's the coolest fucking name of all time.

218
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,916
"Peterson is one of the youngest

219
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,648
"large-cap hedge fund managers
in the financial industry."

220
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,587
He got rich on us, huh?

221
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:03,753
"All the more impressive
considering he was orphaned

222
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:07,322
"at age nine, when both his parents died
in a horrific explosion."

223
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:10,498
He fucking blew me up and his mother?

224
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:12,765
Donny, maybe your son could
help you, financially.

225
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,340
I don't know. This kid changed his name.

226
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:17,467
He doesn't even want
to be a Berger anymore.

227
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:19,068
He's not gonna want to talk to me.

228
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:22,311
That was the incomparable Champale.

229
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:25,812
And now, looking hot
and ignoring doctor's orders,

230
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,614
let's welcome Amber.

231
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:29,986
What the fuck happened to her?

232
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:32,024
Fuck you, Kenny!

233
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,060
Hey, what's up, Robe-Cop?

234
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:39,026
This is where your boss lives?

235
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:41,328
It's actually just his summer home.

236
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:44,029
- Summer home. What a dick.
- Dad!

237
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,098
Oh, my goodness.

238
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,403
Todd, it's just breathtaking!

239
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:51,408
Hey! There he is.

240
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:52,774
Hey, Mr. Spirou.

241
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:54,813
There's my golden boy.

242
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,212
Come over here, champ.

243
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,840
Come on, get over here.

244
00:13:57,905 --> 00:13:59,043
Hi.Yeah.

245
00:13:59,107 --> 00:14:00,643
Look at you.

246
00:14:01,109 --> 00:14:03,919
Look at you, the lovely bride.

247
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:05,922
What a couple!

248
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,620
Mr. Spirou, it's so amazing
that you're letting us all stay here.

249
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:09,855
Seriously, thank you so much.

250
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:11,828
Steve, these are
my parents, Gerald and Helen.

251
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:13,263
- It's a pleasure.
- Hi.

252
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,595
Your daughter's a sweetheart.

253
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:17,200
You can tell she likes Todd for Todd,

254
00:14:17,258 --> 00:14:19,329
not because he's gonna be rich.

255
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:21,499
I wouldn't want
my boy to end up with some gold digger

256
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:23,473
like the last three whores I married, huh?

257
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:28,640
True story. All three? Whores.

258
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:33,613
Well, guys, this weekend, mi casa es su casa.

259
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:35,950
You know, every member
of my staff are lucky to be in this country,

260
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,820
so feel free to abuse the shit out of 'em.

261
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:41,794
Go get the fucking bags!

262
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:46,224
Well, Mrs. Spirou,
I've always said that if the finance game

263
00:14:46,287 --> 00:14:48,528
was an amusement park,
your son would be a roller coaster,

264
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,230
and I would just ride him all day long.

265
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:54,368
That came out weird.

266
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:55,965
Yeah, well, Stevie likes to think

267
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,237
that he's the star of the family.

268
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,940
But before he was born,
I modeled a bathing suit

269
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:04,643
for a Woolworth advertisement.

270
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:08,312
Well, you still have
quite a figure on you there, Delores.

271
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:10,947
Yeah, I can see
where Steve got his rocking bod.

272
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:14,148
Why, thank you.

273
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,585
Chad's here!

274
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:17,925
- Oh, my God.
- Hooray.

275
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:19,020
Fantastic.

276
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,726
I guess they didn't want to see it.

277
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:23,962
Yay, Chad!

278
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,766
- Come here.
- Mom.

279
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:27,306
- Sweetheart.
- I'm home.

280
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,772
Dad, how are you, sir?

281
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,309
- You look great.
- Thank you, sir.

282
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:31,502
Hey, Chad, I'm Todd.

283
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:32,977
Oh, my God.

284
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:35,207
Oh, God, I missed you, sis.

285
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,680
That's a good hug.

286
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:40,017
Chad, this is my fiancé, Todd.

287
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:42,245
Pleasure to meet you, Chadwick.

288
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:43,515
Are you a soldier?

289
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:45,182
No.

290
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:46,919
- Sailor?
- No.

291
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:49,018
- Airman?
- No.

292
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,187
Girl Scout?

293
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:51,752
No.

294
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:55,426
Well, then I'd prefer if you take
your fingers away from your forehead

295
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,300
and you shake my hand
like the civilian you are.

296
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:01,499
Yeah, sorry, I'm stupid.
I don't know why I did that.

297
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,667
Honest mistake. Come here,
I want to show you this.

298
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:06,871
Look, if you ever do anything

299
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:11,108
to hurt my sister, I will take
my government-issued service revolver,

300
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:14,551
stick it straight up your fuppin' poop chute,
and empty the clip.

301
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:15,849
Do you feel me?

302
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,551
Yes, I totally feel you... Dawg.

303
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:22,794
Randy Jackson, right?

304
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:25,789
I've got 10 ways
to kill you with my bare hands right now.

305
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,594
Don't.

306
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,594
Don't.

307
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:36,369
Hi, sweetheart, how are you?

308
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,467
Can I see Randall Morgan possibly?

309
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,137
Yeah, you're gonna need an appointment.

310
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:41,804
I knew you were gonna say that.

311
00:16:42,303 --> 00:16:44,613
But you know what?
Tell him Donny Berger's out here.

312
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,481
He'll be pretty psyched to see an old friend.

313
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,317
You know what? Mr. Morgan's
on vacation right now. I'm sorry.

314
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,184
- He's on vacation? That son of a...
- Oh, hey!

315
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:52,383
Vanilla Ice.

316
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,222
Randall's just getting makeup.
Go ahead to the green room.

317
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,665
Vanilla, what's up, guy?

318
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,397
It's been a long time. How you been?

319
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,933
Are you seriously giving me
the silent treatment still?

320
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:08,234
You know that hurts me.

321
00:17:08,296 --> 00:17:09,639
Yeah? Well, that's why I'm giving it to you.

322
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:10,732
How's it feel, chump?

323
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,401
It's breaking my heart.

324
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:14,707
We were friends for 20 years, guy.

325
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,544
We were friends until you banged my mother!

326
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:18,584
I didn't know it was her, I swear to God!

327
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,550
It's not like her last name is Ice.

328
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:23,046
You should've known by the haircut!

329
00:17:23,144 --> 00:17:24,885
Aw, come on, Vanilla Bean Latte.

330
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:26,289
- Will you just...
- What?

331
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:28,121
I'm just saying, I'm in big trouble, guy.

332
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:30,219
This, like, monetary thing.

333
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:34,130
I'm going to prison
if I don't get 43 large, so...

334
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:35,428
What, do you think I got that kind of money?

335
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:36,934
Of course you got that kind of money.

336
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,597
Royalties from Ice Ice Baby,
you must be fucking loaded!

337
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,072
Man, listen, Queen took 50%.

338
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,767
Suge took the other 60%.

339
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,606
I fucking owe money when
that shit gets played, man!

340
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,806
Dude, come on,
will you please stop, collaborate and listen?

341
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,576
- Oh, here...
- What? No, I love that song.

342
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:51,742
You know that shit.

343
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:53,308
I was on top of that, fucking day one.

344
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,918
Listen, man. I work at a ice rink now.

345
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:57,820
I deep-fry chicken nuggets, man.

346
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,789
I'll get you a deal on
a barbecue sauce packet.

347
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,121
Fucking A, buddy.

348
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:03,890
Both of us. This sucks.

349
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:05,953
Broke. Who'd have thought
this would happen to us?

350
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:10,428
Maybe I should call your mother.
She'll give me the money, I know that.

351
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:12,664
- What?
- What? What? What?

352
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:16,469
Hey, dude.

353
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,771
Didn't spill my beer, fucker.

354
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,971
Fuck you.

355
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,604
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

356
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:24,644
Nobody comes in here
and starts busting up my joint

357
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,776
unless I got cameras rolling.

358
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,349
Look, Donny,
nobody remembers what Tiger Woods did,

359
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,254
let alone something
that happened 25 years ago.

360
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:33,917
I'm telling you, when I walk down the street,

361
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:35,460
people are like, "There's that guy!"

362
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:37,052
I'm still fucking big, dude.

363
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:40,930
All right, how about this?
I'm doing a show on '80s train wrecks.

364
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:43,366
Maybe I slip you in
after that Milli Vanilli guy, all right?

365
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,870
- Who, Fab? He's a fucking buddy of mine.
- Yeah.

366
00:18:45,926 --> 00:18:47,769
That would be huge, dude.
How much money?

367
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:51,070
Maybe 400 bucks.

368
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:52,440
Four hundred bucks?

369
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,970
Dude, I need 43 G-birds.
What are we talking about right now?

370
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:58,108
You need $43,000?

371
00:18:58,172 --> 00:18:59,617
Are you back on drugs?

372
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:00,914
- Yeah.
- It's never...

373
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,716
This is never going to happen. Never.

374
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:04,222
Little bit more blush if you can.

375
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:07,350
Just like you did that John Wayne Bobbitt
in his penis reunion show.

376
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,459
That's actually a good idea, a reunion.

377
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:19,532
Me and Miss McGarricle, together again,
live from a women's prison.

378
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,943
A women's prison.

379
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:27,971
Very sexy.

380
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:31,209
We could shoot it this weekend.
You could give me the money.

381
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:33,144
Very sexy.

382
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,585
You know, you could eat that ass
after I leave the room,

383
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:37,554
but I need an answer right now.
What do you think?

384
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,783
What about your kid?

385
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,553
My kid? What about my kid?

386
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:43,617
He's got to be a walking Gong Show.

387
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,891
No. What are you talking about?
He's doing great.

388
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:47,660
He's, like, a hot shit now.
He's getting married

389
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:49,668
-down at the Cape this weekend.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

390
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:52,261
"Horny teacher baby makes good."

391
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,398
Smell that? Smell it, Donny?

392
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:59,071
What? That's not me.
She probably cut the cheese.

393
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:00,908
No, no, no. No, ratings.

394
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:02,639
I smell ratings.

395
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:06,941
My kid is very publicity-shy, so I...
You know, to be honest,

396
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,611
I don't think he'd do
a piece of shit show like this.

397
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,120
All right, here's the deal.

398
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:11,850
You get yourself and your actual kid

399
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:14,654
up to the women's
prison this weekend, I will shoot it,

400
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,592
I will give you 50 grand in cash.

401
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:19,659
'Cause I'm going to guess, Donny,
you want to be visiting a prison,

402
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,393
not living in one.

403
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:27,699
So, Todd, how does one get into
the hedgehog business anyway?

404
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:29,833
Oh, it's actually hedge funds.

405
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,570
You think you're better than me?

406
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,369
No.

407
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,910
Chad, did you know
that Todd is really great with numbers?

408
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:38,314
- You got to see this.
- Jamie, no. Don't make...

409
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:40,147
What's 452 times 77?

410
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,583
84,304.

411
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,022
Oh, he could just be making that up.

412
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,183
No, he's not!

413
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:50,989
There's a calculator on my cell phone.

414
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:52,052
Okay.

415
00:20:52,386 --> 00:20:55,731
What is 94

416
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,067
times 312, Todd?

417
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:03,541
29,328, Helen.

418
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:05,304
Freaky.

419
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:07,846
I don't know. It's just something I can do.

420
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,881
Are you sure you're not a Chinaman?

421
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,507
Oh, that's inappropriate.

422
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:12,710
White whore.

423
00:21:15,643 --> 00:21:17,020
I'll get it.

424
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,494
Oh, my God. You must be Jamie.

425
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,454
You're, like, even hotter
than you looked in the paper.

426
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:29,963
Look at your hair,
blowing in the wind like Tawny Kitaen

427
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:32,026
when she was fucking dry-humping that car.

428
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:33,730
Okay.

429
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:35,967
And you must be...

430
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:37,537
Donny.

431
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,137
What's the matter?
Chubby never even mentioned me?

432
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:42,269
Chubby?

433
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:44,712
Oh, I mean Todd Peterson.

434
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:46,641
Why do you say it like that?

435
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:48,548
It just comes out that way.

436
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:49,917
Where are my manners, right?

437
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,957
Could you hold that?
Take a chug if you'd like.

438
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:54,284
I got you a fucking great gift.

439
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:56,887
Here it is.

440
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:58,494
I'll take the brew back.

441
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:00,190
Just, you got to read it, though. It's fucking...

442
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:04,592
Yeah!

443
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,464
I don't know where they
come up with this shit,

444
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:09,132
but it's pretty fucking funny.

445
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:10,971
Spencer's Gifts never fucking fails me.

446
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:12,669
I want to meet Mr. Spencer one day and say,

447
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,337
"Thanks, motherfucker, for all the laughs."

448
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:17,006
Hey, I also made you a mix tape.

449
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:18,846
Who the fuck is rich in this house?

450
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:19,941
Jeezum, it's huge.

451
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:23,787
Todd, your old man is here?

452
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:26,051
'Wassup!

453
00:22:28,716 --> 00:22:30,195
Helen, oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

454
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:31,252
No, it's...

455
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:32,353
Let me just get that for you.

456
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,489
- That's...
- What? No.

457
00:22:33,554 --> 00:22:35,033
Oh, sorry, those are yours. I...

458
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:38,332
Donny, what... What the fuck, man? Sorry.

459
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:40,435
What are you doing here?

460
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:41,932
What do you mean?

461
00:22:41,996 --> 00:22:43,270
I thought you said your parents were dead.

462
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:46,237
No, they are. Super dead.

463
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,836
He's hilarious.

464
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:50,142
My old man.

465
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:52,506
My old man friend.

466
00:22:53,474 --> 00:22:54,680
From...

467
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:56,753
'Wassup!

468
00:22:56,944 --> 00:22:57,945
Right?

469
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:00,658
Well, aren't you going to introduce us?

470
00:23:00,948 --> 00:23:02,018
- No.
- Yes.

471
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,492
Yes. Here we go.

472
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:06,797
This is my future father-in-law, Gerald,

473
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:09,063
and his lovely wife, Helen.

474
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:11,164
And Jamie's brother, Chad.

475
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:13,367
- Hey-0!
- Don't. That's...

476
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:19,734
What?

477
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:20,868
I like the look of this. Who's this?

478
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:24,780
Okay. This is my boss Steve's mother,
Delores, who's awake now.

479
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:27,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's where you
get all the looks from, huh, sweetie?

480
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:29,083
Yeah, no, we're not related.

481
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:32,416
Oh, yeah? Well, she wishes,
'cause you got the fucking...

482
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,425
You're stacked pretty good.

483
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:39,529
Anyhow, Jame, this is my old friend, Donny.

484
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,126
Your best friend.

485
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:42,693
I'm his best friend.

486
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:44,932
Your best friend.

487
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,466
Yeah, no.

488
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:49,508
Remember I told you we met...

489
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,031
Where'd we meet?

490
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,771
- We met...
- Where?

491
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:54,807
- Come on.
- It's coming to me.

492
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:56,105
I saved his life.

493
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:58,781
Well, more metaphorically.

494
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,850
No, no, no, no, no. Here's what happened.

495
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:03,354
It was, like,
one of them train track kind of deals.

496
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:05,147
My man over here, I see him,

497
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:07,192
he drops his burrito on the tracks.

498
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:08,984
I'm like, "All right, that happens."

499
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,862
Next thing you know,
homeboy leaps down there,

500
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,830
and he tries to retrieve the burrito.

501
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:16,700
Okay? I see a train whizzing at him.

502
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:19,294
I'm like, "This guy's about to die,
and he don't know it."

503
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,738
I fucking leap down there myself, right,

504
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,536
and I give him a little shove on the heinie.

505
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:25,167
"Get out of the way, buddy!"

506
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:26,540
Next thing you know, I realize

507
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,304
this thing's going to hit me.

508
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:30,006
I fucking remember, though,

509
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,276
I had a kung fu instructor

510
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:33,648
who taught me
how to tighten the diaphragm,

511
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:35,516
and I bring it in there.

512
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:36,850
And I feel the train go by.

513
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,945
My eyes are closed.

514
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:40,788
Rips my shirt off my body, okay?
I open my eyes.

515
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:43,852
I see all these chicks just kind of looking
at me, going, "What is that?

516
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,419
"That's the fucking
most chiseled guy I've ever seen."

517
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:47,261
I worked out at the time.

518
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,858
Anyways, the place goes bananas for me,
I sign a couple of titties,

519
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,630
and I started hanging out
with this guy ever since.

520
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:53,262
Best friends, right? Here you go, my boy.

521
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,933
I just can't believe
I've never heard that story before.

522
00:24:57,364 --> 00:24:59,503
Why wouldn't you just
get another burrito, Todd?

523
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:02,609
Wouldn't it be dirty?

524
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:04,616
Great questions.

525
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:08,478
It's one of the many things about this story
that's pretty hard to believe.

526
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,219
So, where are you staying, Donny?

527
00:25:10,377 --> 00:25:11,685
He's not staying.

528
00:25:11,745 --> 00:25:12,746
No.

529
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:17,259
I can't stay. Yeah, no, he's right.

530
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:20,524
Oh, pshaw. I mean, invite him to stay here.

531
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:22,066
You have to stay.

532
00:25:22,122 --> 00:25:24,398
He's your best friend. You're his best friend.

533
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:25,903
Sheesh, I'm not messing with her.

534
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,439
I mean, you are my best friend, guy.

535
00:25:28,495 --> 00:25:30,975
And, Jamie, you can be my breast friend.

536
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:36,612
Breast, with an With an

537
00:25:39,473 --> 00:25:42,113
By the way, dude, you look fantastic.

538
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:43,912
You lost all the weight, homeboy.

539
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:45,183
I miss the titties.

540
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:47,521
You saved my life? Seriously?

541
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:49,492
What? They ate that up.

542
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,224
You came up with a whole lot of nothing.

543
00:25:52,953 --> 00:25:54,193
That's a nice suitcase, by the way.

544
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:55,324
What is that, Louis Vuitton?

545
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,266
This is a Hefty bag.

546
00:25:57,691 --> 00:25:59,102
What the fuck are you talking about?

547
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,068
What do you want, Donny? Money?

548
00:26:01,128 --> 00:26:03,699
You heard I was doing well,
so you came looking for a handout?

549
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:06,142
I don't want none of your money.
How is that? Okay?

550
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,645
I get it. You don't like me.

551
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,112
I exploded.

552
00:26:09,303 --> 00:26:10,304
I wish you had exploded.

553
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,543
That way, I wouldn't have to
see your stupid face anymore!

554
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:13,607
Did you happen to notice

555
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:16,711
I created a whole fake life
just so I could get away from you?

556
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:18,488
Your mother's sick, by the way.

557
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,115
I don't believe you.

558
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,492
They don't know how long she's got.

559
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:25,858
What is that, nunchucks?

560
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:29,359
I told her you would
visit her up at the prison.

561
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:35,804
I'm kind of thinking you're the kind of guy
who would pull through for Mumsie.

562
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:37,604
Know what I'm saying?

563
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:39,666
She'd do the same for you.

564
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:41,335
Really?

565
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:45,105
Yeah. Saturday's the last visiting day
before the big surgery, so...

566
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,543
So let me get this straight.

567
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,780
You want me to go visit my "sick mom"

568
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:50,981
that I haven't talked to in years, in prison,

569
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,523
the day before my wedding.

570
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:53,849
Correct.

571
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:55,291
Not happening, asshole.

572
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:57,454
What the fuck did I do to you

573
00:26:57,518 --> 00:26:58,656
to make you hate me so much?

574
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,221
I am fucking baffled right now.

575
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,200
Well, maybe you don't remember,
but you were basically the worst parent ever.

576
00:27:03,257 --> 00:27:05,396
Me? I did everything for you, buddy,

577
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,962
and I never gave you
an ounce of shit about nothing.

578
00:27:08,228 --> 00:27:09,673
You never gave me nothing.

579
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:11,003
I gave you a snake.

580
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,670
Yeah, and then it died
after it ate all your Quaaludes.

581
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:18,006
That was the only time
anybody's ever seen a king cobra laugh.

582
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:20,841
And I take pride in that, so fuck you.

583
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:22,681
Yeah, great. You know what?

584
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:24,814
I basically had to raise myself, Donny.

585
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:26,255
I never learned how to swim.

586
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:27,815
I don't even know how to ride a bike.

587
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:29,360
You know how fucking humiliating that is?

588
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,460
What about Mr. Mitty? Remember him?

589
00:27:32,252 --> 00:27:33,822
What? No. What's that?

590
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:35,867
Mr. Mitty. I used to put
an oven mitt on my hand.

591
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:38,403
He would cheer you up
all the time when you were sad.

592
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,096
"Don't be upset, young man.

593
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,003
"I'm your best friend.

594
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:43,735
"Even though I'm an oven mitt."

595
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:45,642
No, I don't remember that, okay?

596
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:46,734
You know what I do remember?

597
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:49,045
You making me
drive you home from the beach

598
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:50,172
'cause you got too drunk.

599
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:51,741
It makes sense to me.

600
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:54,115
When somebody's hammered,
they have another guy drive home.

601
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:55,475
I was eight!

602
00:27:55,976 --> 00:27:58,684
Well, you looked 14
'cause you were such a huge fat fuck.

603
00:27:58,745 --> 00:27:59,746
I'm sorry.

604
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,359
You are such an asshole.

605
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:03,757
Dude, you're a millionaire now,

606
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:05,854
and you're marrying that hot chick.

607
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:09,325
I must have done
a pretty decent job as a dad, don't you think?

608
00:28:09,623 --> 00:28:12,160
Oh, yeah? You want to check in
on your pretty decent job?

609
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:13,630
Oh, my God.

610
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:16,470
You're a junkie? 'Who's your supplier?

611
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:18,367
'Cause I'll smack that motherfucker around.

612
00:28:18,498 --> 00:28:20,136
It's insulin, you dick.

613
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,773
I'm a diabetic 'cause you let me eat
cake and lollipops for breakfast every day.

614
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:25,477
But that's what you fucking asked for.

615
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:27,313
Yeah, you're supposed to say no.

616
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:30,580
You know, I weighed 400 pounds
by the time I was 12.

617
00:28:30,644 --> 00:28:32,419
You know how hard it was
to take that weight off?

618
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:33,987
All right, all right.

619
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:37,385
I didn't know what I was doing.
I had no one helping me.

620
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:40,062
Grandpa was a psycho. You know that.

621
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:42,463
Han Solo, don't be like this.

622
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:43,728
I'm a good person.

623
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,269
Okay, don't call me that, all right?

624
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:46,463
My name's Todd now.

625
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:49,029
Call yourself Han Solo.
You're dressed like him.

626
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,604
Good one.

627
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:54,441
I'm just saying, buddy, give me a chance.

628
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:55,946
Do you have any Axe body spray?

629
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,643
No, Donny, I don't have any Axe body spray.

630
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,847
Because I'm not a fucking douche bag.

631
00:29:05,512 --> 00:29:06,616
That's a douche bag thing?

632
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,455
When did that become a douche bag thing?

633
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:10,654
Todd, the guests are arriving. Let's go!

634
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:12,888
All right, can you lighten up a little bit?

635
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:14,193
We got a party to attend.

636
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,255
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

637
00:29:15,722 --> 00:29:18,134
Good person, how about
you put on a tie, okay?

638
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:20,262
It's a cocktail party, not a Quiznos opening.

639
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:24,539
'What? I haven't worn a tie
since my mother's funeral when I was three.

640
00:29:24,598 --> 00:29:25,872
I'm not going to start that up again.

641
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,339
That's great. Put on a tie.

642
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:29,841
- No.
- Put on a tie!

643
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:31,346
I'll never sell out.

644
00:29:32,739 --> 00:29:34,013
I'll give you 100 bucks.

645
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:35,474
Where's the tie?

646
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:37,551
Look at this.

647
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:40,114
Jamie is going to have it all.

648
00:29:42,582 --> 00:29:43,686
By the way, Mr. Spirou,

649
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,821
I read the OPEC report, and I was thinking,

650
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:47,797
if we hedge our position on oil,
we could really...

651
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,403
If we were to short the euro, we could...

652
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:56,972
Come on, Todd.
This is your wedding weekend.

653
00:29:57,197 --> 00:29:59,336
You are marrying a real workaholic.
You do know that.

654
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:02,136
Yeah, but isn't that
what you want in a partner?

655
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,339
She's good, this one.

656
00:30:04,404 --> 00:30:05,712
She's good.

657
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:09,578
All right, all right.

658
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:10,917
I haven't made that decision yet,

659
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:12,449
but I love this kid.

660
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,986
You lost your dad in that explosion,

661
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:16,454
and I lost my son.

662
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:18,854
I thought your son
was a ski instructor in Vail.

663
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:21,465
He's a pot-smoking bum!

664
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:23,632
Not like you, Todd. Oh, no.

665
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,567
You're the type of boy
a father can be proud of.

666
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:27,064
Yeah, we'll never know, will we?

667
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:30,808
- Who's that?
- I'm not here.

668
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,244
That's Donny.

669
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:37,671
Donny, come on. Say hi to everyone.

670
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:40,175
Oh, God, hang on.

671
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,742
Let me swing these free.

672
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,746
Glad all the children saw that.

673
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:46,219
Donny.

674
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:47,758
This is Steve Spirou, Todd's boss.

675
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:52,593
'Wassup!

676
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:56,059
Is that back?

677
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,230
Because I've been dying
for that to come back.

678
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:01,328
'Wassup!

679
00:31:01,495 --> 00:31:02,667
Yeah!

680
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,502
That's my boy! Look at him!

681
00:31:04,564 --> 00:31:05,804
He ain't a tight-ass.

682
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:06,970
'Wassup!

683
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:09,572
-'Wassup!
-'Wassup!

684
00:31:09,636 --> 00:31:11,081
-'Wassup!
-'Wassup!

685
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:12,745
-'Wassup!
-'Wassup!

686
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,676
'Wassup!

687
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:18,685
What's up?

688
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:23,992
Boo!

689
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:26,398
That was terrible, Todd.

690
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,222
So, I see the train coming,

691
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:31,326
and something
kind of like takes over me, you know?

692
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,696
- Here you go, Abigail.
- Thank you.

693
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:37,901
And so, I decide to jump
off the platform, right?

694
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,935
Snaps my legs in two.

695
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:43,504
What did I expect?
It was a 25-foot drop, you know?

696
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:45,077
Twenty-five feet?

697
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:47,409
So I grab Burrito Bandito over here,

698
00:31:47,507 --> 00:31:48,815
and I just roll him out of the way.

699
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,116
The train missed our skulls by inches.

700
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:53,349
Why would you do
something like that, Todd?

701
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,157
You know, I really don't know, Steve.

702
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,395
I mean, why wouldn't you
just buy another burrito?

703
00:31:57,717 --> 00:31:59,094
Yeah, no, I know.

704
00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:00,790
I don't know what I could have been thinking.

705
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:04,164
Maybe he was high on the hashish.

706
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,466
Hey, how about I
get you another beer, huh, Donny Boy?

707
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:08,929
Twenty's my limit.

708
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,531
No! No, no.

709
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:13,373
But, Donny Boy
has got to go to bed, though, right?

710
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:16,407
Oh, fiddlesnatch.

711
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:18,073
It's the afternoon.

712
00:32:18,338 --> 00:32:21,046
Remember you told me
you wanted to get to bed early?

713
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:23,610
Oh, okay. Yeah, no, no, no.

714
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:24,678
Todd's right.

715
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:25,745
Oh, my God.

716
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,490
You're right, it is him.

717
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:29,049
- You're Donny Berger.
- It's him.

718
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:31,796
Do you remember that kid who got
his teacher pregnant in Somerville?

719
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:33,521
Wait a minute, that is you.

720
00:32:33,587 --> 00:32:34,759
Donny Berger.

721
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:37,026
Didn't you and your teacher have a kid?

722
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,535
Wait a minute. What was his name?

723
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:40,333
Indiana Jones, huh?

724
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:42,529
It was something fantastic like that.

725
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:43,904
Yeah, Han Solo Berger.

726
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,201
Yeah, Han Solo, Han Solo.
What ever happened to him?

727
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,603
What happened to him?

728
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,340
He actually became a dick.

729
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:53,281
A private eye, I mean.

730
00:32:53,607 --> 00:32:56,144
One of the biggest
and hairiest dicks in the world.

731
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,711
Okay.

732
00:32:58,078 --> 00:33:01,218
Hey, look, this might seem weird,
but do you think you would ever...

733
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:03,792
Bone your wife? Yeah, I mean, I'd love to.

734
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,588
She's a hot little number.

735
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:09,625
'Well, you know, I was just
going to ask you for an autograph, but...

736
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:12,169
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. On her tits or...

737
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:14,867
- Or a piece of paper would be fine.
- Yeah, or a photo.

738
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:16,570
Okay, well, this has been fun.

739
00:33:16,897 --> 00:33:18,877
- But, Donny...
- Not to toot my own horn,

740
00:33:18,932 --> 00:33:20,605
but I got kind of close once.

741
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,045
Mrs. Weiss, freshman geometry.

742
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:24,446
And I think she would have done it, too.

743
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:26,279
I just didn't know how to make the move.

744
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,018
You know what? I would have killed

745
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:30,816
to bang my eighth grade
biology teacher, Mrs. Cohn.

746
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:33,653
I used to dream of
dissecting her with my penis.

747
00:33:33,747 --> 00:33:37,593
It's so weird what goes on upstairs
when you hit puberty.

748
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:42,398
I actually stole
my middle school librarian's glasses

749
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:44,696
to wear while I masturbated.

750
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,459
What is that about?

751
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,138
In my day, when I got into trouble,

752
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:52,309
the headmaster would
slap your hand with his dick.

753
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:54,907
She wins.

754
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,011
You know, Todd was working at the cubicle

755
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:02,485
next to mine one year,
12 weeks and one day ago

756
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,886
when he met a pretty girl
at the gym named Jamie.

757
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:07,550
How many days is that, Todd?

758
00:34:07,781 --> 00:34:09,158
Computing, Steve.

759
00:34:10,116 --> 00:34:11,356
451.

760
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,157
It's actually 450.

761
00:34:16,656 --> 00:34:18,135
Battle of the brainiacs!

762
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:20,735
Yeah, this guy forgot
about leap year, I guess.

763
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:24,236
He's smarter than Todd!

764
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:27,944
Okay, we're talking a lot about numbers,
but let's get back to love.

765
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:29,569
What's the matter, hot stuff?

766
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:30,671
Where do you think you get it from?

767
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:31,976
Your mother was a math teacher,

768
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:33,847
and I was pretty much a whiz kid myself.

769
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:36,512
The ability to make a bong
out of a Taco Bell cup

770
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:37,919
doesn't make you a whiz kid, Donny.

771
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:40,789
Leap year, motherfucker.

772
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:43,891
I think it's kind of a magical moment.

773
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:47,591
You know, Todd's oldest friend, Donny,
miraculously appearing like this.

774
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:48,655
What?

775
00:34:48,722 --> 00:34:52,329
So I am graciously
going to step aside and allow Donny

776
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:54,328
to take over as the best man.

777
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:55,429
Give it up for Donny!

778
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:56,905
Oh! no; no,

779
00:34:56,963 --> 00:34:58,567
Phil, you don't have to do that.

780
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:00,774
No music. No, no, no, no.

781
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:03,139
Kill the music. Phil, Phil, you...

782
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,940
That's so nice of you,
but you don't have to do that.

783
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,342
Oh, I don't mind. You two are very close.

784
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:09,717
We are. We are very close,
but you and I are close, too.

785
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:13,488
Well, we work together,
but I wouldn't call us close.

786
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:17,861
I mean, I was actually kind of surprised
when you asked me to be your best man.

787
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:19,555
Made me feel a little sorry for you.

788
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:22,292
That's true. He had no idea who he was.

789
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:23,595
No.

790
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:25,862
I accept. I do. I love it. It's an honor.

791
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,700
- Way to go, Donny!
- Are you kidding me?

792
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:29,763
You got Fenway Park in your backyard?

793
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:32,070
I had that built
when my son started Little League.

794
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,202
He never used it.

795
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,973
The little douche bag
just sat in his room listening to reggae.

796
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:38,579
Well, let's lose these ties
and hit some dingers.

797
00:35:38,738 --> 00:35:40,081
What do you say? Come on!

798
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:44,912
No, no, no.
Please, don't let this be happening.

799
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:48,084
Don't let this be happening, please.

800
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:49,593
No sports.

801
00:35:49,883 --> 00:35:51,419
All right, guys,
let's see what we got out there.

802
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:54,727
Please don't hit it to me. Please don't
hit it to me. Please don't hit it to me.

803
00:35:55,455 --> 00:35:56,559
Get under it, kid.

804
00:36:00,694 --> 00:36:01,866
Yeah!

805
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,831
Moron.

806
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:06,675
Here we go! Taking down two there!

807
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,777
All right, Gerald, kid! Here we go, guy!

808
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:10,339
Stay on it!

809
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:13,315
Oh. my God!

810
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:17,587
Grandma, what's up, honey?
Are you awake, sweetheart?

811
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:18,850
Here we go.

812
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:21,119
Get under it! Get dirty!

813
00:36:21,715 --> 00:36:22,989
What the fuck?

814
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:26,590
- Got it.
- Nice catch, Mama!

815
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:28,957
Let's let Todd-0 get this one, huh?

816
00:36:29,222 --> 00:36:30,599
Oh, no, that's okay.

817
00:36:30,824 --> 00:36:32,201
Todd, come on!

818
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:33,996
No, no. Hit one to that two-year-old.

819
00:36:34,127 --> 00:36:35,504
He hasn't gotten one yet.

820
00:36:35,562 --> 00:36:36,836
Here you go, big man.

821
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:40,510
- What?
- Quit showing off

822
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,342
for the girls, buddy. They're mine.

823
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:45,207
Come on, now.

824
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:49,984
You got it. You got it.

825
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:55,417
Okay, Todd, you all set, buddy?

826
00:36:55,548 --> 00:36:56,720
Don't hit it to me.

827
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,885
Coming to you, homie.

828
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:05,692
Holy shit.

829
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:10,930
Oh, my God. Are you all right, guy?

830
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,405
Come on. You're fine.

831
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:16,042
Throw it in there, guy.

832
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:17,940
I think the ball's broken.

833
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:19,672
Throw it in, Todd.

834
00:37:19,806 --> 00:37:20,910
Todd, throw the ball.

835
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:22,647
Come on, Todd!

836
00:37:22,776 --> 00:37:24,653
Throw it, you big vagina. Do it.

837
00:37:24,878 --> 00:37:26,551
Todd, we want to keep playing, buddy.

838
00:37:26,613 --> 00:37:27,751
We need a ball, kid.

839
00:37:27,814 --> 00:37:28,849
Just throw it.

840
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:29,950
Such a pussy.

841
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:33,286
On a rope!

842
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:34,627
Holy fuck!

843
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:41,862
We now return to The Donny Berger Story,
starring Ian Ziering.

844
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:43,233
- Yo!
- Donny.

845
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:46,102
- I'm in a Jacuzzi. Hang on one sec.
- Yeah.

846
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,338
Fucking... Here.

847
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,777
- Who'll take the cigar?
- Oh, no.

848
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:49,903
- Donny.
- Keep that lit for me.

849
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:51,175
Take my fucking shades.

850
00:37:51,237 --> 00:37:52,511
- Wear them if you want.
- Yeah!

851
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:53,744
All right. So, hang on.

852
00:37:53,807 --> 00:37:54,808
I want to wear them.

853
00:37:54,874 --> 00:37:56,012
I'll be back.

854
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:01,448
All right.

855
00:38:01,514 --> 00:38:02,515
My goodness!

856
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:03,920
Yeah, what's going on?

857
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:05,761
Guess what's on TV?

858
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:07,726
Hey, there, little buddy.

859
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:09,457
I'm Mr. Mitty.

860
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:13,496
I will always love you.

861
00:38:13,993 --> 00:38:15,768
What is that, The Donny Berger Story?

862
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:16,830
Hell, yeah.

863
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:19,134
Don't you get money
every time that shit is shown?

864
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:21,303
This could be your "get out ofjail free" card.

865
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:24,378
Last check I got for that was 85 cents.

866
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:27,049
Is Han Solo gonna do
the show at the women's prison with you?

867
00:38:27,273 --> 00:38:30,846
You know, I haven't
discussed any particulars with him yet.

868
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,891
I am actually just trying
to be a dad right now.

869
00:38:34,347 --> 00:38:35,917
You're gonna go to prison on Tuesday.

870
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:37,859
You have got to get that money somehow.

871
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:40,756
Kenny, what the fuck?

872
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:42,423
I thought this was a bathroom!

873
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:43,523
Fuck you!

874
00:38:44,057 --> 00:38:45,661
- Honk!
- Oh, nobody squeezes my titty

875
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:46,863
for free, honey!

876
00:38:46,926 --> 00:38:48,633
Okay, good luck with that.

877
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:50,635
God, you're such an idiot!

878
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:52,768
Todd, you already messed up my flowers!

879
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:55,042
- I'm sorry.
- Just get the cake!

880
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,576
No walnuts! No fucking excuses!

881
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:00,076
I love you! Do you love me?

882
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:02,378
What?

883
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,987
"You screwed up my cake!

884
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:07,251
"You screwed up my cake!"

885
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:08,485
What?

886
00:39:08,548 --> 00:39:10,221
It's me, it's me. Can I come in?

887
00:39:10,283 --> 00:39:11,660
- Yeah, sure.
- What's up, buddy?

888
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:14,665
What was she yelling at?
What'd you do wrong?

889
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:17,093
She's just stressed out
'cause of the wedding.

890
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,567
Oh, really?

891
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:21,105
You sure she's not stressed out
about maybe sex or something?

892
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,935
Have you been going down on her?

893
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:24,874
- What?
- No, I'm just saying,

894
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:27,002
a lot of times, girls I've met over the years,

895
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:29,307
when they've been
ragging on me and yelling at me and shit,

896
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,815
if I kiss their pussies, they kind of go,

897
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,010
"You're right, you're a good guy."

898
00:39:34,774 --> 00:39:36,515
Yeah, that's personal, Donny.

899
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,518
Yeah,no,no.
You know her better than me, fine.

900
00:39:39,245 --> 00:39:40,349
So...

901
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:43,658
You wear a bathing suit in the shower?

902
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,462
- You know that's fucking nuts, right?
- Are you serious?

903
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:49,090
I can't even take my shirt off
in front of other people because of you.

904
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,562
Because of me. What did I do this time?

905
00:39:51,925 --> 00:39:53,461
Let me jog your memory.

906
00:39:59,532 --> 00:40:00,977
The New Kids on the Block!

907
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:02,404
Holy shit!

908
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,607
Their heads are all warped now!

909
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:06,116
Oh. my God!

910
00:40:06,172 --> 00:40:08,379
Yeah, it's 'cause I got it
when I was in third grade.

911
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:09,545
My body grew.

912
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:11,714
I'm sorry. It's fine, it's fine.
Let me see it again.

913
00:40:13,313 --> 00:40:15,088
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

914
00:40:15,181 --> 00:40:17,354
You got a back tattoo

915
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,226
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

916
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:21,060
Their heads are fucking warped

917
00:40:21,721 --> 00:40:23,530
- You suck.
- Come on, dude.

918
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:24,795
Why you getting so serious?

919
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:26,995
I still got the tattoo I got when I was...

920
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,802
'When I was a teenager.
And I'm fine with it, you know.

921
00:40:31,898 --> 00:40:34,469
"De plane! De plane!"

922
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:36,372
"De plane!"

923
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:39,409
Yeah, I remember it.
I still don't know who that is.

924
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:41,447
It's fucking...

925
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:43,714
"De plane, de plane" guy
from Fantasy Island.

926
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,811
Tattoo.

927
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:46,823
I got a tattoo of Tattoo.
I thought that was funny.

928
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,284
Well, it's not.

929
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:49,889
Lighten up, dude. Come on.

930
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:51,360
-"De plane!"
- Don't. Donny, don't.

931
00:40:51,751 --> 00:40:52,889
- I'm serious.
-"De plane!"

932
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:53,987
- No.
- You're still ticklish.

933
00:40:54,053 --> 00:40:55,657
No, I'm not ticklish!

934
00:40:58,491 --> 00:40:59,936
- Come on, now!
- The tickle monster.

935
00:40:59,993 --> 00:41:02,234
- I tickle you like that.
- No.

936
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:03,433
Stop! No, stop it!

937
00:41:03,496 --> 00:41:04,907
Watch yourself.

938
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:07,107
Stop it! Stop it, no!

939
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:09,407
Give me that, Hansie.

940
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,376
Why is your dick in my face?

941
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:13,144
And why is it kind of hard?

942
00:41:13,272 --> 00:41:15,752
What are you two homos doing?

943
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:21,553
Just rasslin'.

944
00:41:22,248 --> 00:41:23,283
All right.

945
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:25,386
'Cause you're looking at an all-state
fucking wrestling champion,

946
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:26,691
and I got the winner.

947
00:41:26,853 --> 00:41:28,161
Okay. Well, he won.

948
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:29,632
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did. You won.

949
00:41:29,689 --> 00:41:30,724
What? No, I didn't.

950
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,497
You're gonna love it, buddy. Wrestle him.

951
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:34,060
- Yeah, Chad.
- No, no.

952
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,568
It's actually a funny story.

953
00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:36,766
We were having a tickle fight.

954
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:37,864
We weren't wrestling at all.

955
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,739
I was losing, admittedly.

956
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:42,405
Aw, God, I got to start doing
some crunches or something.

957
00:41:42,468 --> 00:41:43,606
Look at this.

958
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:46,615
Oh, you don't like him?

959
00:41:46,773 --> 00:41:48,218
Oh, we don't like you.

960
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:50,750
He's talking to his dick, buddy.

961
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:53,784
Now he's hitting it.

962
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,415
No! Why?

963
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:58,152
You got to puff that fucker up!

964
00:41:58,551 --> 00:41:59,621
Oh, what? No.

965
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:01,665
You don't have to puff that fucker up.

966
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:02,926
Let's do this.

967
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:05,002
Chad, I'm sure you're very athletic... Okay!

968
00:42:05,058 --> 00:42:06,230
Okay!

969
00:42:06,526 --> 00:42:08,631
I tap out. You win, you win. I tap out.

970
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:11,174
Do you like fucking my sister, Todd?

971
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:14,237
I mean, do you like
sticking your dirty booger fingers in her?

972
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:16,403
Whoa, what was that?

973
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,107
Let's all just keep our heads, okay?

974
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:19,479
We've all been drinking a lot tonight.

975
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,550
I'm gonna skull-fuck you...

976
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,287
And that is the end of that.

977
00:42:28,815 --> 00:42:30,692
What, you're mad at me?

978
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:33,094
How am I the fucking bad guy right now?

979
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:36,532
You're gonna fucking give me shit
with that tattoo on your back?

980
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:38,569
Look at that stupid fucking thing.

981
00:42:38,825 --> 00:42:40,625
Good buddy, he'll be fine.

982
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:43,400
Yeah, so we got Chad
all tucked in, safe and sound.

983
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:45,507
I never heard of him
passing out drunk before.

984
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:46,735
Yeah, it was crazy. It was like,

985
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:49,040
one second, he was with us, totally awake.

986
00:42:49,102 --> 00:42:50,809
Next thing you know, he's face down,

987
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,474
birds a-chirpin'.

988
00:42:54,307 --> 00:42:55,843
What do you think?

989
00:42:56,476 --> 00:42:57,546
You look amazing.

990
00:42:57,877 --> 00:42:59,151
Oh, wait! Isn't it bad luck

991
00:42:59,212 --> 00:43:00,987
for me to see the dress
before the wedding, though?

992
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:03,550
This is a $12,000 Vera Wang dress.

993
00:43:03,683 --> 00:43:04,855
I'm gonna wear it whenever I want.

994
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:08,561
You'd look hot in a $12 Wang Chung dress.

995
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:10,859
That sounds like a line Donny would say.

996
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,264
Yeah, except he'd say,

997
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:15,534
"You'd look friggin' hot
in a Wang Dang Sweet Poontang dress."

998
00:43:15,995 --> 00:43:18,805
Just think he's, like,
trailer park-y or something, you know?

999
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,533
- Yeah.
- That's probably why his son ran off.

1000
00:43:20,867 --> 00:43:22,175
His what? What? Who? His son about...

1001
00:43:22,368 --> 00:43:24,006
What'd he say?
What did you hear? Did he say something?

1002
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,949
Just look at the first page of that book
he's been handing out to everyone.

1003
00:43:27,006 --> 00:43:28,644
He has? What? No.

1004
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:31,584
Head in the Class?

1005
00:43:31,878 --> 00:43:35,553
He said it's like Head of the Class,
only with blowjobs.

1006
00:43:36,315 --> 00:43:37,589
It's gross.

1007
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,659
Yeah, it's gross. Blowjobs are gross.

1008
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:40,857
We don't do those.

1009
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:43,434
"Dear Jamie,
I know you'll make Todd very happy

1010
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:44,991
"if you bleach your little brown eye."

1011
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:46,866
Oh, no, not this part.

1012
00:43:57,036 --> 00:43:58,879
Wow, that's sad.

1013
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,249
That weirdly got me.

1014
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,519
I don't know why it got me, but it just got me.

1015
00:44:10,016 --> 00:44:11,290
Can I get a hug right now, or...

1016
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:13,691
No, no, no, no! We can't wrinkle the dress.

1017
00:44:13,786 --> 00:44:15,697
Hey, if you don't want to wrinkle the dress,

1018
00:44:15,755 --> 00:44:17,632
may I suggest we just remove it?

1019
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:19,029
Did you take two Xanax?

1020
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:21,469
I actually took three Xanax.

1021
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:23,734
And you know that the Xanax makes me

1022
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:27,170
"H" to the "O" to the "R" To the "N" to the "Y"

1023
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:28,303
So horny for my fiancée

1024
00:44:28,367 --> 00:44:30,040
No! Down.

1025
00:44:30,903 --> 00:44:32,940
I don't want to have sex
with my family in the house.

1026
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:34,240
No, I know.

1027
00:44:34,307 --> 00:44:36,685
I don't want to have sex
with your family, either.

1028
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:38,016
In the house.

1029
00:44:38,578 --> 00:44:39,852
Came out weird.

1030
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,320
Possibly my last night of
spanking the hell out of it

1031
00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:46,056
without having a roommate
watching me, so...

1032
00:44:46,419 --> 00:44:47,955
What do we got to work with here?

1033
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:54,794
Rich people magazines.

1034
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:58,909
Let's see what we got.

1035
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:04,608
If I hadn't partied with her husband
so many times, I would.

1036
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,513
But it's disrespectful to him.

1037
00:45:07,406 --> 00:45:08,885
I don't know.

1038
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:13,980
Hello.

1039
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:18,522
Jeezum Crow, you really were a model,
weren't you, Grandma?

1040
00:45:19,218 --> 00:45:24,031
Yeah, old Mr. Woolworth really, really knew
how to pick them, didn't he?

1041
00:45:25,157 --> 00:45:27,865
I love that old-time bathing suit.

1042
00:45:29,428 --> 00:45:31,806
I could take you
to the speakeasy, and we could,

1043
00:45:32,098 --> 00:45:34,135
we could do the naked Charleston.

1044
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,906
I have to ship out in the
morning to fight the Nazis,

1045
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:40,917
so you better give me
something to remember.

1046
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:43,045
What's that?

1047
00:45:43,843 --> 00:45:44,844
Oh, my God.

1048
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:48,824
Old lady Grandma wants to
get in on the action, too.

1049
00:45:49,615 --> 00:45:50,923
Should we let her?

1050
00:45:50,983 --> 00:45:53,259
I think we should.

1051
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:54,963
Oh, my God.

1052
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:58,159
Why do I like her better right now?

1053
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:00,098
Oh, you bad...

1054
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:01,866
What have you done to me?

1055
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:03,770
What have you done to me?

1056
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:09,872
We got to go for round two,
but give me a little bit of time.

1057
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:12,513
Give me a little bit of time.

1058
00:46:15,508 --> 00:46:17,249
Oh, lovely.

1059
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,221
Just lovely.

1060
00:46:26,752 --> 00:46:27,890
Goodness.

1061
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:35,432
Oh, my word.

1062
00:46:39,498 --> 00:46:42,536
Best man, wedding rehearsal in an hour.

1063
00:46:43,602 --> 00:46:45,582
There's so many tissues.

1064
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:52,150
Oh, God. You know,
don't touch those, okay? Let's...

1065
00:46:52,311 --> 00:46:53,756
Okay.

1066
00:46:53,913 --> 00:46:55,449
I'm gonna just clean that up.

1067
00:46:55,781 --> 00:46:56,987
Yeah, Donny's sick.

1068
00:46:57,483 --> 00:46:59,292
You don't want to touch these
'cause you'll get sick.

1069
00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:01,555
He's got post-nasal drip, so...

1070
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:11,174
The tissue's stuck to my picture.

1071
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,436
Here, let me.

1072
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:15,776
I'll grab that from you. I got it.

1073
00:47:16,936 --> 00:47:19,542
Oh, look at that!
There's a little tissue beard there.

1074
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:21,744
No, don't touch it, please.
Don't worry about it.

1075
00:47:21,807 --> 00:47:23,286
Oh, that poor dear.

1076
00:47:23,609 --> 00:47:25,714
I'll just get him some nice, fresh juice.

1077
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:27,647
Juice. That's a great idea.

1078
00:47:27,713 --> 00:47:29,249
Thank you, Grandma D. Thanks.

1079
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:33,296
You know, hon,
if he's really under the weather,

1080
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:36,629
maybe it's best
if he doesn't masturbate so much.

1081
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,498
That's good advice.

1082
00:47:39,558 --> 00:47:41,128
I'll tell him that, thank you.

1083
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,510
Okay, you can stop
pretending to sleep, Sir Jizz-a-lot.

1084
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:51,506
The old broad knew I was whacking to
her the whole time, didn't she?

1085
00:47:51,837 --> 00:47:52,872
That's so funny.

1086
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:56,283
But your improves were awesome.
"Post-nasal dick," or whatever you said.

1087
00:47:56,509 --> 00:48:00,753
You know, I can't believe
your balls produce that much stuff.

1088
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:02,851
Dude, at least I got balls.

1089
00:48:03,115 --> 00:48:04,355
What's that supposed to mean?

1090
00:48:05,518 --> 00:48:08,692
Let me just crack open
some happiness first, yeah.

1091
00:48:09,822 --> 00:48:11,392
All I'm saying is the Chad thing,

1092
00:48:11,457 --> 00:48:13,198
when that dude came at you last night,

1093
00:48:13,459 --> 00:48:15,461
you kind of, like,
looked like a deer in headlights.

1094
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:18,808
Your whole aura is actually that of a pussy.

1095
00:48:18,864 --> 00:48:20,070
Or a kiss-ass.

1096
00:48:20,132 --> 00:48:21,475
It is not.

1097
00:48:22,535 --> 00:48:23,570
It is, too.

1098
00:48:24,303 --> 00:48:25,805
What the fuck am I doing?

1099
00:48:25,871 --> 00:48:28,181
No, I'm just saying
you got to stand up for yourself

1100
00:48:28,274 --> 00:48:30,515
every once in a while, buddy,
or she's never gonna bang you.

1101
00:48:30,876 --> 00:48:33,447
I'll have you know, she bangs me all the time.

1102
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:35,158
All right? She bangs.

1103
00:48:35,848 --> 00:48:38,294
Does she live the Ia vida Ioca, too, or...

1104
00:48:38,851 --> 00:48:40,118
Very funny.

1105
00:48:44,857 --> 00:48:45,892
Well, good day, everyone.

1106
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,062
Father.

1107
00:48:47,126 --> 00:48:49,402
Father McNally, thank you so much
for coming out to the Cape.

1108
00:48:49,595 --> 00:48:50,596
My honor.

1109
00:48:50,663 --> 00:48:51,733
Very cool.

1110
00:48:51,797 --> 00:48:52,798
Oh, yes.

1111
00:48:53,399 --> 00:48:54,503
Chad.

1112
00:48:55,468 --> 00:48:57,106
You'll excuse me, won't you?

1113
00:48:57,436 --> 00:48:59,746
While you're in this church,
you'll show the proper respect.

1114
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:02,141
No e-mailing, no texting,

1115
00:49:03,142 --> 00:49:06,783
no Facebooking,
no Skyping and no Angry Birds.

1116
00:49:07,413 --> 00:49:08,756
That one hurts.

1117
00:49:09,482 --> 00:49:11,393
No, no. I get it.

1118
00:49:11,817 --> 00:49:13,353
It's the 2010s.

1119
00:49:13,752 --> 00:49:15,698
Everyone's having sex and drinking lattes.

1120
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:17,457
No, Father.

1121
00:49:18,257 --> 00:49:20,567
But, you see, this is my world.

1122
00:49:21,527 --> 00:49:23,564
We'll abide by my rules while we're here.

1123
00:49:24,897 --> 00:49:27,844
Maybe we should start
with the father of the groom.

1124
00:49:30,703 --> 00:49:32,080
His father passed away.

1125
00:49:32,338 --> 00:49:34,011
He died in an explosion.

1126
00:49:34,874 --> 00:49:37,821
Sounds fishy, but it really happened.

1127
00:49:41,514 --> 00:49:43,289
I'm truly sorry to hear that, son.

1128
00:49:43,716 --> 00:49:45,753
Thank you, but it's fine.

1129
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:47,420
He deserved it.

1130
00:49:47,753 --> 00:49:49,096
So...

1131
00:49:49,154 --> 00:49:50,565
What is that supposed to mean?

1132
00:49:50,923 --> 00:49:52,834
Oh, I didn't mean anything by it.

1133
00:49:52,892 --> 00:49:55,031
He just, you know, wasn't a great dad.

1134
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,282
So your father, he abused you, did he?

1135
00:50:07,907 --> 00:50:09,250
No, nothing like that.

1136
00:50:09,642 --> 00:50:11,747
Was he a murderer? Rapist?

1137
00:50:13,379 --> 00:50:14,790
No. Father, I'm sorry, I...

1138
00:50:14,847 --> 00:50:18,795
My father beat me every day with a rake.

1139
00:50:20,419 --> 00:50:23,696
But you don't hear me smack-talking him
like some baby little princess.

1140
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:25,531
Not here in the house of the Lord.

1141
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:39,673
You know, I can't hear a word you're saying.

1142
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:44,881
All I can focus on is your shit breath.

1143
00:50:50,316 --> 00:50:53,388
I'd like to show you the garden for a minute.

1144
00:51:00,926 --> 00:51:01,996
Now, then.

1145
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:03,401
Okay, you know what? Let's just...

1146
00:51:09,368 --> 00:51:10,403
Fucking old guy's got

1147
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:11,812
-a cannon on him.
- What happened?

1148
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,872
What happened
is I think he's having a mini-meltdown.

1149
00:51:14,273 --> 00:51:16,116
- Yeah, he's taking his shirt off now.
- Oh, my God.

1150
00:51:16,175 --> 00:51:19,622
And he's pretty ripped for an old fuck,
so we're in trouble right now.

1151
00:51:20,112 --> 00:51:21,318
What is going on here?

1152
00:51:21,447 --> 00:51:22,619
All right, all right.

1153
00:51:22,681 --> 00:51:23,716
Go time, go time.

1154
00:51:23,782 --> 00:51:24,852
No, think about what you're doing!

1155
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:26,156
Be careful.

1156
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:27,927
He bit me!

1157
00:51:28,187 --> 00:51:29,359
Did you see that? That was amazing!

1158
00:51:29,455 --> 00:51:30,490
This could get ugly.

1159
00:51:30,556 --> 00:51:32,695
The Father actually killed a guy in the ring.

1160
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,066
That's why he became a priest.

1161
00:51:34,927 --> 00:51:36,270
Just keep your hands up, kid!

1162
00:51:36,328 --> 00:51:37,363
Get 'em down!

1163
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:38,908
Hang in there, guy!

1164
00:51:39,698 --> 00:51:41,006
He keeps punching him!

1165
00:51:43,235 --> 00:51:44,407
Come on, guy.

1166
00:51:46,305 --> 00:51:47,375
That's my boy!

1167
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:50,352
Why, you came right back
with your own shit. Nice, kid.

1168
00:51:54,146 --> 00:51:55,147
What the fuck is that?

1169
00:51:55,247 --> 00:51:57,284
Okay, he's going to
a whole other place right now.

1170
00:52:00,653 --> 00:52:01,825
You know what? Maybe just run.

1171
00:52:01,887 --> 00:52:03,992
Get the fuck out of here. Go, go, go, go, go.

1172
00:52:04,757 --> 00:52:05,792
No.

1173
00:52:06,592 --> 00:52:07,662
I'm not gonna run.

1174
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:09,238
Finish him, Father McNally!

1175
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:10,671
Finish him!

1176
00:52:24,243 --> 00:52:27,349
Geez. He went down
like a sack of potatoes, huh?

1177
00:52:30,883 --> 00:52:32,590
What is the matter with you?

1178
00:52:32,718 --> 00:52:35,096
You know, we've known
Father McNally for 30 years.

1179
00:52:35,154 --> 00:52:36,656
- Thirty years! Thirty years.
- Thirty years.

1180
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:38,093
I ought to rip off your head!

1181
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:40,626
Gerald!

1182
00:52:40,693 --> 00:52:41,933
I'm sorry.

1183
00:52:41,994 --> 00:52:44,634
Sorry's not gonna keep you
from burning in hell, Todd.

1184
00:52:44,897 --> 00:52:46,467
Hey, this is all my fault.

1185
00:52:46,532 --> 00:52:48,375
I shouldn't have hit the guy with the bottle.

1186
00:52:48,434 --> 00:52:49,811
I'm, like, a moron over here.

1187
00:52:50,002 --> 00:52:52,004
No, now, Donny,
I will not let you take the blame for this.

1188
00:52:52,071 --> 00:52:54,278
You had to do it. You saved his life again.

1189
00:52:54,707 --> 00:52:56,584
And you looked very sexy doing it.

1190
00:52:58,377 --> 00:53:00,755
Why was the sound of that bottle so familiar?

1191
00:53:00,913 --> 00:53:02,756
Todd is such a loser.

1192
00:53:03,282 --> 00:53:04,488
Here comes your girl. Here we go.

1193
00:53:05,217 --> 00:53:06,355
Jame, I'm sorry, but, look,

1194
00:53:06,418 --> 00:53:07,954
you got to admit,
I stood up for myself back there.

1195
00:53:08,153 --> 00:53:10,292
Do you have fucking rocks
in your head, Todd?

1196
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:11,790
No.

1197
00:53:11,857 --> 00:53:12,858
Well, where are we gonna get married now?

1198
00:53:12,925 --> 00:53:14,302
We got kicked out of the church!

1199
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:15,565
Jame...

1200
00:53:15,928 --> 00:53:17,100
What is everybody's problem?

1201
00:53:17,162 --> 00:53:18,937
You were awesome out there.
You kicked ass.

1202
00:53:18,997 --> 00:53:20,772
- You should be proud of yourself.
- Proud of myself?

1203
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,406
For what?

1204
00:53:22,468 --> 00:53:24,948
I got my ass kicked,
and everyone's pissed off at me.

1205
00:53:25,003 --> 00:53:27,415
And, by the way,
thanks for the fatherly advice, guy.

1206
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,781
That's the last time I listen to you.

1207
00:53:34,513 --> 00:53:35,583
- I'm gonna choke him out!
- He's an asshole!

1208
00:53:35,714 --> 00:53:37,022
I'm gonna choke him out.

1209
00:53:37,082 --> 00:53:38,584
I'm just gonna choke him out.

1210
00:53:38,817 --> 00:53:39,989
Hey, guys, guys?

1211
00:53:40,052 --> 00:53:42,794
Can I just say
something before we all turn on Todd?

1212
00:53:43,756 --> 00:53:45,599
Churches freak the kid out,

1213
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:47,534
ever since his father's funeral.

1214
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,305
After the explosion,

1215
00:53:49,895 --> 00:53:56,210
all that was left of his dad was, like,
a kneecap and a little bit of nut sack.

1216
00:53:57,936 --> 00:54:00,212
It was supposed to be a closed casket,

1217
00:54:00,272 --> 00:54:02,479
but there was a foul-up at the mortuary,

1218
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:04,543
and he actually saw a squirrel

1219
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:07,716
run into the coffin and kind of

1220
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,992
squeak out of there with his
dad's ball bag in his mouth.

1221
00:54:11,049 --> 00:54:13,120
You know, that's gonna
fuck any of us up, so...

1222
00:54:14,086 --> 00:54:15,724
So you actually knew Todd's father?

1223
00:54:16,088 --> 00:54:17,624
Of course I knew the guy.

1224
00:54:17,689 --> 00:54:19,498
He was handsome, he had fucking great hair,

1225
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:21,666
a Jedi with the chicks.

1226
00:54:22,394 --> 00:54:25,375
Went down on girls
for a wicked long time 'cause he was a giver

1227
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,966
and he wanted to see others be happy.

1228
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,272
I wish I could have met him.

1229
00:54:30,669 --> 00:54:31,875
Sounds like a gentleman.

1230
00:54:33,238 --> 00:54:34,979
Was he there enough for the kid?

1231
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,314
No, maybe not. But,

1232
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:39,055
you know, he probably felt bad about it.

1233
00:54:39,411 --> 00:54:42,324
You know, and there's nothing
he can do about it now, so...

1234
00:54:43,382 --> 00:54:44,486
Toddsy.

1235
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,661
Oh, Todd.

1236
00:54:46,718 --> 00:54:48,163
I had no idea.

1237
00:54:48,687 --> 00:54:49,859
Poor thing. Are you okay?

1238
00:54:49,922 --> 00:54:50,923
Yeah, yeah.

1239
00:54:51,223 --> 00:54:52,224
It's fine, but

1240
00:54:52,691 --> 00:54:54,602
sometimes I do still have nightmares.

1241
00:54:54,693 --> 00:54:55,694
Oh, boy.

1242
00:54:55,894 --> 00:54:58,465
That squirrel and its demonic eyes.

1243
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:01,842
Tiny piece of skin flapping in its mouth.

1244
00:55:02,868 --> 00:55:04,779
One lone scraggly hair.

1245
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:07,206
A pubic hair.

1246
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:09,744
I mean, maybe this is
a blessing, though, guys.

1247
00:55:09,808 --> 00:55:11,845
Do we really want
Father McNutty to be the one

1248
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,947
who brings these two guys together?

1249
00:55:14,012 --> 00:55:15,286
I mean, I don't think so.

1250
00:55:15,614 --> 00:55:17,787
I'm pretty tied into the church crowd

1251
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:19,727
Rageaholics Anonymous and whatnot.

1252
00:55:19,785 --> 00:55:21,162
I could find a priest for you.

1253
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,528
I mean, what type are we looking for?

1254
00:55:22,688 --> 00:55:23,928
Maybe a younger guy.

1255
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:24,990
Younger guy.

1256
00:55:25,057 --> 00:55:26,161
How about a black guy?

1257
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:27,860
Now, I like that.

1258
00:55:27,926 --> 00:55:29,803
It's very urban, very street.

1259
00:55:30,128 --> 00:55:31,129
Okay.

1260
00:55:31,296 --> 00:55:33,333
But that still doesn't get us a church.

1261
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:37,341
Well, I'll tell you where I would tie the knot
if I was these two sexy kids.

1262
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:45,419
Donny, this is just such a great idea.

1263
00:55:45,477 --> 00:55:46,922
- Thanks.
- Don't you love the pergola?

1264
00:55:46,979 --> 00:55:48,185
They're gorgeous!

1265
00:55:48,247 --> 00:55:51,126
You know what,
maybe a little more girly shit up on the arch.

1266
00:55:51,216 --> 00:55:52,320
You know, you're right.

1267
00:55:52,384 --> 00:55:55,388
Excuse me, sir,
put some more girly shit up there.

1268
00:55:55,454 --> 00:55:56,694
Calling all ladies!

1269
00:55:56,755 --> 00:55:58,735
The bus for the bachelorette party is here!
Come on!

1270
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:01,802
Honey, you guys have fun
at the bachelor party!

1271
00:56:01,994 --> 00:56:03,064
Okay.

1272
00:56:03,128 --> 00:56:04,835
Don't get too crazy. Know your limits.

1273
00:56:05,597 --> 00:56:07,736
- Okay.
- We're having a bachelor party?

1274
00:56:07,933 --> 00:56:09,071
That's, like, my thing, man.

1275
00:56:09,568 --> 00:56:12,208
Hookers, blow, balloons filled with piss.

1276
00:56:12,271 --> 00:56:14,308
I mean, the sky's the limit, kid.

1277
00:56:14,606 --> 00:56:16,415
No, no, no. Donny, we're all set.

1278
00:56:16,475 --> 00:56:19,285
I have arranged
a very special evening for us tonight.

1279
00:56:20,178 --> 00:56:22,215
This is gonna be awesome!

1280
00:56:23,115 --> 00:56:25,391
I read about this place in Oprah's magazine.

1281
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:29,626
I don't know if she writes the articles herself,
but there's some real good stuff in it.

1282
00:56:29,688 --> 00:56:32,168
Hi, we're for the Todd Peterson party, please.

1283
00:56:32,424 --> 00:56:33,528
Good evening, gentlemen.

1284
00:56:33,759 --> 00:56:35,329
Mrs. Ravensdale.

1285
00:56:35,394 --> 00:56:36,839
Phil, what a blessing.

1286
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:41,673
Welcome to your bachelor party package
here at He Time Spa For Men.

1287
00:56:41,867 --> 00:56:43,540
Woo-hoo, motherfucker!

1288
00:56:43,602 --> 00:56:45,741
Okay. All right.

1289
00:56:45,804 --> 00:56:48,045
We're gonna set you up
with some nice plush robes,

1290
00:56:48,106 --> 00:56:50,177
and then we have
a wonderful full evening planned

1291
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:52,449
with massage, facial and nail treatments,

1292
00:56:52,911 --> 00:56:55,084
and then we're going to send you home

1293
00:56:55,147 --> 00:56:59,926
with a special gift
of our house-made lavender scrub.

1294
00:57:01,186 --> 00:57:03,666
Confucius say,
"What the fuck are you talking about?"

1295
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:05,459
No, Donny,

1296
00:57:05,991 --> 00:57:07,993
Phil thought
it would be nice before the wedding

1297
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,597
for us to all take a little time
to just chill and mellow.

1298
00:57:10,896 --> 00:57:13,740
My wife and I have been
burning it on both ends all week

1299
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:15,278
with the preschool applications,

1300
00:57:15,334 --> 00:57:17,109
and I am ready to be pampered!

1301
00:57:19,638 --> 00:57:22,016
All right, all right. Now we're talking.

1302
00:57:22,074 --> 00:57:23,985
Hey, thanks, honey.
What the fuck's your name?

1303
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:25,453
- Jessica. All right.
- Yeah.

1304
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,784
Hey, come on. Here's to the kid.

1305
00:57:26,845 --> 00:57:29,849
He's fucking getting all fucked up tonight!

1306
00:57:29,915 --> 00:57:30,950
Last night!

1307
00:57:31,016 --> 00:57:33,360
Fucking last night of poontang for this kid.

1308
00:57:38,156 --> 00:57:39,658
What the fuck is this?

1309
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:44,402
It's water infused with cucumber,
rose petal and harvest sandalwood.

1310
00:57:45,197 --> 00:57:48,178
It tastes like fucking dick infused with balls.

1311
00:57:49,735 --> 00:57:51,976
And a side of fucking Rod Stewart's jizz.

1312
00:57:53,538 --> 00:57:57,577
Wait a minute. What are we drinking
water at a fucking bachelor party for, Phil?

1313
00:57:58,276 --> 00:58:00,256
You got to show my son your tits later.

1314
00:58:00,312 --> 00:58:02,690
Promise me. Promise me.

1315
00:58:05,617 --> 00:58:07,597
That's nice. Yeah, good.

1316
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,431
This is great, sweetheart.

1317
00:58:10,022 --> 00:58:11,126
Really good.

1318
00:58:11,189 --> 00:58:12,862
Nice work. You're going deep on us, huh?

1319
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:15,604
That's it.

1320
00:58:16,328 --> 00:58:17,398
What's this, sir?

1321
00:58:17,462 --> 00:58:21,808
That's just a little tip, you know,
if you give me a full package.

1322
00:58:22,286 --> 00:58:24,994
Okay. That's a $150 additional charge.

1323
00:58:25,823 --> 00:58:27,166
You're talking to the wrong guy.

1324
00:58:27,224 --> 00:58:28,362
That's a little out of my price range.

1325
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:31,269
It includes scalp treatment, reflexology.

1326
00:58:31,328 --> 00:58:33,205
How much is it to tickle my pickle?

1327
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:36,768
To yank my crank?
To give me a ho-jo to go?

1328
00:58:37,801 --> 00:58:39,974
Sweetheart, I'm not asking
for a finger up the ass.

1329
00:58:40,037 --> 00:58:42,313
I just want you to just jerk it a little bit.

1330
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:45,185
Donny, this isn't a brothel.

1331
00:58:46,009 --> 00:58:49,547
Then I'm completely confused
what the fuck we're doing here right now!

1332
00:58:49,813 --> 00:58:52,054
So, what, you're just going to
get a hand job in front of all of us?

1333
00:58:52,683 --> 00:58:53,753
I don't know. Am I?

1334
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:57,130
I guess not!

1335
00:58:57,621 --> 00:59:00,625
You know, I have worked
very hard on this night, Don,

1336
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:02,900
and you're being just plain rude.

1337
00:59:03,327 --> 00:59:05,398
- Phil, no! Phil!
- No, no. Don't do this.

1338
00:59:08,198 --> 00:59:10,542
Nice. That's nice.

1339
00:59:10,934 --> 00:59:14,006
That's good. That's good.

1340
00:59:14,972 --> 00:59:16,212
It tickles.

1341
00:59:16,273 --> 00:59:18,048
Just fight through it, man. It's worth it.

1342
00:59:18,108 --> 00:59:20,748
If you stop, I swear I will kill you.

1343
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:28,494
You know what,
if I don't see a tit in five minutes,

1344
00:59:28,552 --> 00:59:29,860
I'm going to strangle this motherfucker.

1345
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:33,860
You should be ashamed of yourself
for fucking arranging this bullshit!

1346
00:59:34,324 --> 00:59:35,894
Well, I feel very relaxed,

1347
00:59:35,959 --> 00:59:38,235
and I think this was
a good use of a Groupon.

1348
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:40,065
You fucked us, buddy!

1349
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:43,268
Five more minutes till you
get to choose amongst four

1350
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,677
artisanal house-blended
chocolates, gentlemen.

1351
00:59:47,638 --> 00:59:49,174
We can't let tonight end like this, boys.

1352
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:50,309
We got to go out.

1353
00:59:50,407 --> 00:59:52,546
I'm telling you, I can't let my son have a...

1354
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:56,317
My son of a gun best friend
have his bachelor party be this.

1355
00:59:56,647 --> 00:59:59,491
You fucking... You guys got your
face covered in leprechaun shit.

1356
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:01,822
We should be getting whacked off,

1357
01:00:01,885 --> 01:00:03,887
all of us, as a fucking team!

1358
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:07,692
Donny, I think
we've had enough excitement for one night.

1359
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:11,004
Besides, it's not like you can throw
together a whole other party this late.

1360
01:00:11,094 --> 01:00:15,099
I could have six chicks making out
with each other on our laps in 10 minutes.

1361
01:00:15,933 --> 01:00:17,344
I could stay out a little later.

1362
01:00:17,968 --> 01:00:18,969
Bam!

1363
01:00:19,436 --> 01:00:22,110
We gonna get our dicks sucked.

1364
01:00:23,006 --> 01:00:24,076
There it is.

1365
01:00:24,174 --> 01:00:26,677
Unless, Mrs. Ravensdale,
you want to whip them knockers out?

1366
01:00:26,743 --> 01:00:27,778
We'd love to see them.

1367
01:00:27,911 --> 01:00:28,946
All right, you know what?

1368
01:00:29,012 --> 01:00:32,050
You are an imbecilic,
immature, asinine, childish,

1369
01:00:32,115 --> 01:00:34,652
caveman-like, hairy-knuckled,
single-chromosomal,

1370
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:37,221
obnoxious, uneducated, ignorant asshole

1371
01:00:37,287 --> 01:00:40,063
who I would like to fuck hard and long!

1372
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:42,869
So, I'm going to go put a dent in that.

1373
01:00:42,926 --> 01:00:44,530
You guys get that green jizz off your face.

1374
01:00:44,595 --> 01:00:45,665
I'll be back in 20.

1375
01:00:46,029 --> 01:00:47,133
We're going out, boys!

1376
01:00:47,698 --> 01:00:49,405
Hey, this is the shit,
this place, I'm telling you.

1377
01:00:49,466 --> 01:00:51,810
The hottest chicks, the best Denver omelets.

1378
01:00:51,868 --> 01:00:53,040
- You have to eat one.
- All right.

1379
01:00:53,103 --> 01:00:55,105
- Donny!
- Yeah, this is who I was telling you about!

1380
01:00:55,172 --> 01:00:56,708
- What's up? Give me that.
- I'm so happy to see you.

1381
01:00:56,773 --> 01:00:58,616
- You look so fucking cute!
- I know, right?

1382
01:00:59,443 --> 01:01:02,617
And you brought a military man.

1383
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:04,249
What's your name, soldier?

1384
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:06,951
Chad Martin, private first class,
United States Marine Corps.

1385
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:10,425
You think you can keep that dick
at attention for a couple hours?

1386
01:01:10,487 --> 01:01:11,625
That's an order!

1387
01:01:12,723 --> 01:01:13,827
Already on it.

1388
01:01:14,658 --> 01:01:15,796
Look at my man!

1389
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:18,169
You guys, let me get in here
and introduce myself.

1390
01:01:18,228 --> 01:01:20,401
Hello. I'm Phil.
I'm married with four children,

1391
01:01:20,464 --> 01:01:23,411
and I have actually
only seen three vaginas in my entire life:

1392
01:01:23,467 --> 01:01:24,673
my wife's, my baby's

1393
01:01:24,735 --> 01:01:27,875
and my aunt's once by accident
on the back of a tandem bike.

1394
01:01:28,338 --> 01:01:30,477
Well, here's number four, baby!

1395
01:01:31,408 --> 01:01:33,979
I'm going to count that
as numbers four and five.

1396
01:01:55,065 --> 01:01:57,238
Champale would like to dedicate this

1397
01:01:57,301 --> 01:01:59,508
to Mr. Todd Peterson.

1398
01:02:01,238 --> 01:02:02,774
- Yeah, baby. Yeah.
- Here you go.

1399
01:02:04,241 --> 01:02:05,311
Oh, hey.

1400
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:06,479
Do you want any eggs?

1401
01:02:06,543 --> 01:02:08,853
No. I really have to watch what I eat.

1402
01:02:08,912 --> 01:02:10,550
No fatty foods. But thank you.

1403
01:02:10,781 --> 01:02:12,021
I'm Brie.

1404
01:02:12,082 --> 01:02:13,493
I'm Todd. Nice to meet you.

1405
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:16,429
I know who you are, Han Solo.

1406
01:02:17,788 --> 01:02:19,028
No, you can't...

1407
01:02:19,089 --> 01:02:20,864
Don't worry, your secret's safe.

1408
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:53,859
Who did that?

1409
01:03:26,623 --> 01:03:28,432
- Gerald, get in the car.
- I love you, Donny!

1410
01:03:28,492 --> 01:03:29,562
Yeah, I love you. Get in there.

1411
01:03:29,626 --> 01:03:31,071
Man, you got to give me the recipe, man.

1412
01:03:31,128 --> 01:03:32,698
Can't buy everything, Spirou!

1413
01:03:32,763 --> 01:03:34,333
Bro, but they use olive oil, not butter.

1414
01:03:34,398 --> 01:03:35,468
That's the big secret.

1415
01:03:35,532 --> 01:03:36,840
Okay, Chris, get him in there.

1416
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,210
Be gentle, he's protecting our country.

1417
01:03:39,302 --> 01:03:40,372
All right, good night, guys!

1418
01:03:42,205 --> 01:03:44,515
Gerald, you're a sick man, buddy!

1419
01:03:44,674 --> 01:03:45,948
Whoa.

1420
01:03:46,042 --> 01:03:48,147
Hey, what... Where's everybody going?

1421
01:03:48,211 --> 01:03:49,781
I sent them home, guy.

1422
01:03:49,846 --> 01:03:51,951
I thought we could have a little

1423
01:03:52,015 --> 01:03:54,723
best man/groom alone time.

1424
01:03:55,185 --> 01:03:56,493
But shouldn't I go with them?

1425
01:03:56,553 --> 01:03:58,396
'Cause Jamie's gonna get mad at me.

1426
01:03:58,755 --> 01:03:59,927
Easy,guy.

1427
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:04,132
You're gonna have plenty of time
for her to be mad at you when you're married.

1428
01:04:05,695 --> 01:04:08,676
I got you a wedding gift,
and I want to give it to you alone, all right?

1429
01:04:08,732 --> 01:04:09,802
You got me a gift?

1430
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,174
Of course I got you.

1431
01:04:11,234 --> 01:04:13,737
And I think you might dig it.

1432
01:04:18,842 --> 01:04:19,877
An earring.

1433
01:04:20,343 --> 01:04:24,723
Yeah, I know, but that's an earring
that your mom gave me,

1434
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:27,227
and I thought maybe we could
keep it in the family, you know?

1435
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:30,561
Just kind of keep it going,
generation to generation, actually.

1436
01:04:32,556 --> 01:04:34,832
Yeah, but I don't have a pierced ear, Donny.

1437
01:04:35,659 --> 01:04:36,865
Yeah.

1438
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:39,232
No.

1439
01:04:39,863 --> 01:04:41,069
Yeah.

1440
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,306
All right, fuck it, fuck it.

1441
01:04:45,368 --> 01:04:46,574
Do it, just do it.

1442
01:04:47,204 --> 01:04:48,239
It's not gonna hurt, buddy.

1443
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:49,579
You got a nice buzz going.

1444
01:04:49,639 --> 01:04:50,947
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

1445
01:04:51,007 --> 01:04:52,247
Hang on.

1446
01:04:52,542 --> 01:04:53,782
Yeah.

1447
01:04:53,877 --> 01:04:54,878
Liquor it up.

1448
01:04:54,945 --> 01:04:56,253
Fuck!

1449
01:04:56,313 --> 01:04:57,656
Come here. Come here.

1450
01:04:58,915 --> 01:05:00,758
Hang in there! Go ahead, just sit still, homie.

1451
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,226
Yeah!

1452
01:05:06,056 --> 01:05:07,330
How we doing?

1453
01:05:07,724 --> 01:05:08,725
Oh, God.

1454
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:10,703
That's it. That's the way to man up.

1455
01:05:11,228 --> 01:05:12,969
- That wasn't so bad.
- Let me see it.

1456
01:05:13,563 --> 01:05:15,167
Am I bleeding?

1457
01:05:17,133 --> 01:05:18,407
- I don't think so.
- No?

1458
01:05:18,869 --> 01:05:20,109
Does it look good?

1459
01:05:20,203 --> 01:05:22,945
You look like you could be playing
drums for Foreigner or some shit.

1460
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:24,110
You look like a bad-ass.

1461
01:05:24,407 --> 01:05:25,943
- Really?
- Yeah.

1462
01:05:26,142 --> 01:05:28,452
'Cause it makes me feel kind of...

1463
01:05:29,412 --> 01:05:30,652
Dangerous.

1464
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:34,089
There he is, man!

1465
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,892
That's your personality,
like when you were seven years old,

1466
01:05:36,987 --> 01:05:40,230
me and Uncle Vanny used to
laugh our asses off from you.

1467
01:05:40,857 --> 01:05:42,666
Uncle Vanny, that's right.

1468
01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:44,467
What happened to that guy?

1469
01:05:45,128 --> 01:05:47,074
Dude, you know what it's time for?

1470
01:05:47,464 --> 01:05:50,274
To get you back together with the old gang.

1471
01:05:51,568 --> 01:05:52,808
Come on.

1472
01:05:52,903 --> 01:05:54,883
I just hope the guy will talk to me.

1473
01:05:55,338 --> 01:05:56,442
Phil!

1474
01:05:56,506 --> 01:05:58,713
Come on, you're gonna get arrested, buddy.

1475
01:05:59,442 --> 01:06:01,479
I shouldn't be doing this.

1476
01:06:02,345 --> 01:06:04,120
No, don't stop, don't stop.

1477
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:19,402
All right, look.
I came here to tell you I'm sorry

1478
01:06:19,496 --> 01:06:21,942
about what happened
with me and your mother.

1479
01:06:22,465 --> 01:06:25,309
It was an accident,
and it will never happen again.

1480
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:29,980
That's all I've been waiting for
all these years, man, a simple apology.

1481
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,246
It's water under the bridge.

1482
01:06:31,308 --> 01:06:32,685
Don't sweat it. Holla.

1483
01:06:34,010 --> 01:06:35,921
Wait, are you Vanilla Ice?

1484
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,390
Was Uncle Vanny Vanilla Ice this whole time?

1485
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:40,721
'Who did you think I was?

1486
01:06:40,784 --> 01:06:44,129
I don't know, a friend of my dad's
that wore a lot of parachute pants?

1487
01:06:44,955 --> 01:06:46,025
Man.

1488
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,693
I want to be honest with you, too.

1489
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:50,527
I never did knock boots with your mother.

1490
01:06:50,927 --> 01:06:52,031
- No?
- No.

1491
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:53,699
I think she whacked me off outside the pants.

1492
01:06:54,331 --> 01:06:55,935
- No.
- But I didn't finish.

1493
01:06:55,999 --> 01:06:57,706
- Vanny, I didn't finish. I couldn't.
- Yeah?

1494
01:06:57,968 --> 01:06:59,675
- Mom.
- Yeah.

1495
01:06:59,736 --> 01:07:01,010
You know, she did like to fuck.

1496
01:07:01,471 --> 01:07:02,541
That's fucking... Look at him.

1497
01:07:02,606 --> 01:07:04,313
Back to it. Fuck, yeah.

1498
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:06,020
Hey, Han Solo, you're looking great, man.

1499
01:07:06,076 --> 01:07:07,111
Thank you.

1500
01:07:07,177 --> 01:07:08,485
- You lost some weight.
- Is this kid all right?

1501
01:07:08,545 --> 01:07:10,354
- You're not a little fat kid no more.
- No, no, no.

1502
01:07:10,413 --> 01:07:11,551
- Remember this one?
- No,no.

1503
01:07:11,615 --> 01:07:13,185
Yeah, we used to do this to you all the time.

1504
01:07:13,249 --> 01:07:14,990
- Remember, back in the day?
- Hey, nugget pocket.

1505
01:07:15,051 --> 01:07:16,860
- Nugget pockets.
- No, I'm not a nugget pocket.

1506
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,797
- What's up, nugget pocket?
- No.

1507
01:07:19,322 --> 01:07:20,630
No, but seriously, Iceberg,

1508
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,431
me and my boy got a little head start on you,

1509
01:07:22,492 --> 01:07:25,132
but you got any desire
to get wasted with us?

1510
01:07:25,195 --> 01:07:26,970
More than life itself.

1511
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:29,476
In fact, I might have
a little head start on you guys.

1512
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:31,969
What?

1513
01:07:33,036 --> 01:07:34,572
- Yeah.
- It's so illegal.

1514
01:07:34,904 --> 01:07:36,713
I don't want to do that in front of my kid.

1515
01:07:36,773 --> 01:07:38,650
Turn around for a minute. Just turn around.

1516
01:07:38,908 --> 01:07:40,387
Give me that fucking shit.

1517
01:07:41,778 --> 01:07:43,121
What?

1518
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,055
Hey, let's get out of here.

1519
01:07:46,116 --> 01:07:47,288
I did not do that.

1520
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:49,261
- Let's go have some fun.
- Hey!

1521
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:51,656
Hey, where you think you're going,
Mr. Vanilla Ice Cream?

1522
01:07:52,022 --> 01:07:53,262
I'm going out for the night, man.

1523
01:07:53,323 --> 01:07:56,270
Hell no, man! You know I don't know
how to fry no damn chicken nuggets!

1524
01:07:56,326 --> 01:07:57,396
It's Todd Bridges.

1525
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:58,996
Yeah, yeah, watch this.

1526
01:07:59,062 --> 01:08:00,564
What you talking 'bout, Willis?

1527
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:02,141
You come back and say that to my face,

1528
01:08:02,198 --> 01:08:03,871
you fake white rapping motherfucker!

1529
01:08:04,067 --> 01:08:05,375
Todd, seriously, though, you look great.

1530
01:08:05,435 --> 01:08:07,108
How's Mr. Drummond doing, huh?

1531
01:08:08,071 --> 01:08:09,641
Mister... Fuck you!

1532
01:08:09,706 --> 01:08:11,083
"Mr. Drummond. Mister..."

1533
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:13,684
Man, I... What you want?

1534
01:08:13,743 --> 01:08:14,847
Bowl of chili nuggets.

1535
01:08:14,911 --> 01:08:15,912
A what?

1536
01:08:15,979 --> 01:08:18,050
You know, that shit ain't on the menu, man!

1537
01:08:19,616 --> 01:08:21,289
Shit, it is. Damn it.

1538
01:08:22,018 --> 01:08:24,430
Fucking skate! Just fucking skate!

1539
01:08:25,055 --> 01:08:26,500
The Berger boys are here!

1540
01:08:26,556 --> 01:08:28,229
Come on, look out! Look out, now!

1541
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:29,463
What the fuck?

1542
01:08:33,096 --> 01:08:35,702
Hey! Give me my hat back!

1543
01:08:37,734 --> 01:08:39,509
- Do it, do it!
- Give it back!

1544
01:08:41,905 --> 01:08:44,385
Hey, it's a fucking lovely night, ain't it?

1545
01:08:44,474 --> 01:08:45,612
Oh. my God!

1546
01:08:47,844 --> 01:08:49,687
You fucking assholes!

1547
01:08:56,086 --> 01:08:57,258
Go, go!

1548
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:02,094
What the... Go!

1549
01:09:02,726 --> 01:09:03,898
Go, go, go!

1550
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,598
What the fuck? Get out of here!

1551
01:09:06,329 --> 01:09:07,433
Holy shit!

1552
01:09:09,999 --> 01:09:13,242
You know, they seem like fun guys.

1553
01:09:14,838 --> 01:09:16,340
We're all gonna dive! Let's go!

1554
01:09:17,507 --> 01:09:18,611
What are you doing?

1555
01:09:27,117 --> 01:09:28,425
Oh. my God!

1556
01:09:28,485 --> 01:09:30,624
I didn't... I didn't spill my beer!

1557
01:09:30,687 --> 01:09:32,030
I fucking love it.

1558
01:09:33,456 --> 01:09:35,163
- Fuck!
- You fucking hard-ons!

1559
01:09:50,206 --> 01:09:51,844
"You fucking hard-ons."

1560
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:00,421
Fucking...

1561
01:10:01,151 --> 01:10:03,688
- What are you doing?
- No, no, no, no!

1562
01:10:06,456 --> 01:10:09,460
- You don't fucking do that, you fucking idiot!
- Yeah!

1563
01:10:10,527 --> 01:10:12,370
Look at this, fuck face. Look at this.

1564
01:10:13,163 --> 01:10:14,733
What the fuck?

1565
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:16,333
Come on.

1566
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:18,310
- You fucking guy. I say, take it.
- I can't.

1567
01:10:18,401 --> 01:10:19,436
- Just go, go, go, go, go.
- No, wait, wait.

1568
01:10:19,502 --> 01:10:20,776
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

1569
01:10:20,837 --> 01:10:23,147
I changed my mind. I'm scared.
I don't want to do it.

1570
01:10:23,206 --> 01:10:24,583
- Oh, man.
- I can't do it.

1571
01:10:24,974 --> 01:10:26,453
You're rubbing your underwear.

1572
01:10:26,776 --> 01:10:28,585
What is that? Why are you doing that?

1573
01:10:28,778 --> 01:10:30,553
I suppose I'm the reason.

1574
01:10:30,847 --> 01:10:33,225
Yeah. Yeah. Remember in first grade

1575
01:10:33,283 --> 01:10:34,819
when you were supposed
to pick me up after school,

1576
01:10:34,884 --> 01:10:36,363
you left me waiting for five hours?

1577
01:10:36,419 --> 01:10:38,899
I had detention myself, guy.

1578
01:10:38,955 --> 01:10:40,491
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

1579
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:43,270
- Yeah, well, I shit in my pants.
- All right.

1580
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:45,966
- Then I had to walk all the way home alone.
- All right.

1581
01:10:46,029 --> 01:10:47,133
With shit in my pants.

1582
01:10:47,263 --> 01:10:50,210
Dude, I promise you,
I'll never forget you again.

1583
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,677
I swear to God.

1584
01:10:51,734 --> 01:10:52,804
Throw the fucking things away.

1585
01:10:52,902 --> 01:10:54,904
- Don't fuck with me
- Throw them away.

1586
01:10:55,905 --> 01:10:59,216
Throw them away. Throw them away.

1587
01:10:59,275 --> 01:11:01,152
Get rid of the fucking underwear,
you don't need that.

1588
01:11:01,244 --> 01:11:02,518
You're better than that, guy.

1589
01:11:02,979 --> 01:11:04,481
Okay, fuck it. Okay, fuck it.

1590
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:06,622
Squeeze it out and fucking... Yeah.

1591
01:11:10,153 --> 01:11:11,291
You're a good kid.

1592
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:14,130
Come on, fucking hit this thing
and let's get it rocking.

1593
01:11:14,624 --> 01:11:15,932
- All right. All right?
- Here we go.

1594
01:11:15,992 --> 01:11:17,596
- Come on. Push, push. I got you.
- Okay.

1595
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,298
- I'm not good at it.
- All right.

1596
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:20,636
It's balance, it's just balance.

1597
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:22,267
You got this, kid. You're an athlete.

1598
01:11:22,332 --> 01:11:24,278
You got it. No, it's in you, buddy.

1599
01:11:24,334 --> 01:11:25,369
- Straight.
- I don't know how.

1600
01:11:25,435 --> 01:11:26,607
I got you. I ain't gonna let you fall.

1601
01:11:26,669 --> 01:11:28,342
- Don't let me go.
- I won't let you fall.

1602
01:11:28,404 --> 01:11:29,644
- Don't let go.
- All right, I'm still with you.

1603
01:11:29,706 --> 01:11:30,707
- Okay.
- I'm still with you.

1604
01:11:30,773 --> 01:11:32,912
Let's pick up some speed, though.
I'm with you, guy.

1605
01:11:32,976 --> 01:11:34,284
I'm with you. I'm with you.

1606
01:11:34,344 --> 01:11:35,482
- I'm not letting go.
- Don't let me go.

1607
01:11:35,545 --> 01:11:37,718
I'm not letting go. I'm with you, my boy.

1608
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:39,316
- Wait...
- I'm with you, my boy!

1609
01:11:39,382 --> 01:11:41,828
- Yeah, that's all you!
- I'm doing it!

1610
01:11:42,185 --> 01:11:44,187
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, baby!
- I'm doing it!

1611
01:11:45,521 --> 01:11:47,057
Oh. my God!

1612
01:11:49,659 --> 01:11:50,797
Are you...

1613
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:51,895
Kid, are you...

1614
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:53,304
Are you all right, buddy?

1615
01:11:53,496 --> 01:11:54,668
Sorry.

1616
01:11:54,731 --> 01:11:56,642
- Dude, I'm trying to make love to my wife!
- What the fuck?

1617
01:11:56,699 --> 01:11:58,474
- No!
- Fucking naked people.

1618
01:11:58,534 --> 01:12:00,138
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1619
01:12:00,203 --> 01:12:01,546
Oh, my God, they're chasing me!

1620
01:12:01,604 --> 01:12:02,878
What the fuck? Get off him!

1621
01:12:03,139 --> 01:12:04,140
Go!

1622
01:12:04,207 --> 01:12:05,447
- Oh, my God! Look out!
- Go!

1623
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:08,621
Keep going, guy!

1624
01:12:08,678 --> 01:12:10,157
Donny!

1625
01:12:12,115 --> 01:12:13,321
- Yeah!
- You're the best.

1626
01:12:13,383 --> 01:12:14,623
- You are, Jay.
- Good luck!

1627
01:12:14,684 --> 01:12:16,129
I like your fucking hairdo!

1628
01:12:16,185 --> 01:12:18,665
Good luck with the taxi business!

1629
01:12:18,721 --> 01:12:20,723
- Love that guy.
- Classic. Classic.

1630
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:22,264
Classic.

1631
01:12:22,358 --> 01:12:23,769
It's a classic night.

1632
01:12:23,826 --> 01:12:26,466
No way! Party's not over!

1633
01:12:26,863 --> 01:12:28,240
Come on!

1634
01:12:31,034 --> 01:12:32,513
Dude, Uncle Vanny's fucked up.

1635
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:36,114
I love you, son.

1636
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:41,780
I do.

1637
01:12:41,844 --> 01:12:43,152
I've always loved you, all right?

1638
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:46,621
Sorry to spring that on you like that.

1639
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:48,051
It's all right.

1640
01:12:48,117 --> 01:12:50,188
It's cool, Donny. That's nice, thank you.

1641
01:12:50,253 --> 01:12:51,664
Hansie, Hansie.

1642
01:12:52,755 --> 01:12:56,430
Why don't you not call me
"Donny" when no one's around.

1643
01:12:56,492 --> 01:12:58,028
You can call me "Dad."

1644
01:12:59,295 --> 01:13:00,672
Yeah, I know, I know.

1645
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:01,936
It's...

1646
01:13:03,299 --> 01:13:05,438
I don't know if I'm ready for that, Donny.

1647
01:13:05,501 --> 01:13:06,844
- You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

1648
01:13:08,604 --> 01:13:09,674
No prob.

1649
01:13:23,252 --> 01:13:24,424
Sorry.

1650
01:13:24,821 --> 01:13:27,495
Sorry if you fucking don't like me.

1651
01:13:32,028 --> 01:13:34,975
I probably would've fucked my teacher, too.

1652
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:39,478
Yeah.

1653
01:13:39,936 --> 01:13:41,279
But...

1654
01:13:52,115 --> 01:13:55,062
So, what time are we gonna
go to the prison tomorrow?

1655
01:13:56,586 --> 01:13:58,657
Wait, you'll go to the prison?

1656
01:13:59,188 --> 01:14:00,895
Yeah, I'll go.

1657
01:14:02,425 --> 01:14:04,200
No.No,no,no,no,no

1658
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:06,763
That's... They canceled that.

1659
01:14:06,829 --> 01:14:12,871
I talked to the warden, and he says
that your mother was just pulling our leg.

1660
01:14:12,935 --> 01:14:14,744
She's only got the chicken pox.

1661
01:14:15,371 --> 01:14:17,510
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

1662
01:14:17,573 --> 01:14:19,484
She said she was dying because

1663
01:14:19,542 --> 01:14:22,352
they give you better food
if you're wicked sick like that,

1664
01:14:22,412 --> 01:14:26,724
like Beefaroni or microwave pizza
or some shit, so...

1665
01:14:28,251 --> 01:14:29,821
That just made me hungry.

1666
01:14:30,453 --> 01:14:32,023
Well, check your pockets.

1667
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:39,972
A treasure!

1668
01:14:40,463 --> 01:14:41,498
Come on, eat it.

1669
01:14:41,564 --> 01:14:43,134
- No, it's nasty.
- Come on, I'm telling you.

1670
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,201
Fucking Todd Bridges
worked hard on that thing.

1671
01:14:45,268 --> 01:14:47,009
Yeah. You like that.

1672
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:48,140
Pretty good.

1673
01:14:49,505 --> 01:14:52,008
Look at me, I'm a fountain!

1674
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:53,486
Throw a penny in here!

1675
01:14:53,543 --> 01:14:55,545
Make a wish, motherfucker!

1676
01:15:12,728 --> 01:15:14,105
What the...

1677
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:16,767
Grandma D, what's going on?
What are you doing here?

1678
01:15:17,033 --> 01:15:19,104
Well, you've had the fantasy,

1679
01:15:19,969 --> 01:15:23,143
so now it's time that you try the real thing.

1680
01:15:27,376 --> 01:15:29,652
No, no, no, I can't do that.

1681
01:15:29,712 --> 01:15:31,055
I'm sorry.

1682
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:32,718
I appreciate the offer.

1683
01:15:33,883 --> 01:15:35,362
No, no, no, don't.

1684
01:15:35,418 --> 01:15:37,898
I can't. Don't you... I shouldn't.

1685
01:15:39,822 --> 01:15:42,098
Oh, God.

1686
01:15:42,892 --> 01:15:45,236
You got the old-timey bathing suit on.

1687
01:15:48,097 --> 01:15:49,405
Okay, I'm in.

1688
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:54,243
I'm going to ride you like a Model T.

1689
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:02,889
Yeah.

1690
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:13,757
Jamie.

1691
01:16:14,724 --> 01:16:16,670
You're wearing your dress again.

1692
01:16:17,894 --> 01:16:19,805
You look beautiful.

1693
01:16:20,796 --> 01:16:22,469
I want you so bad.

1694
01:16:23,232 --> 01:16:24,734
Be nice to me.

1695
01:16:25,201 --> 01:16:27,010
Make me feel good.

1696
01:16:31,874 --> 01:16:33,683
All right, all right.

1697
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:37,287
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1698
01:16:49,926 --> 01:16:51,872
Oh. my God!

1699
01:16:52,261 --> 01:16:53,433
Help me!

1700
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:55,665
What happened?

1701
01:16:55,731 --> 01:16:56,766
Are you okay?

1702
01:16:57,166 --> 01:16:58,804
Do I sound okay?

1703
01:16:59,101 --> 01:17:01,604
You puked all over my wedding dress!

1704
01:17:02,338 --> 01:17:04,079
Prepare to get fucked up, motherfuckers!

1705
01:17:05,841 --> 01:17:08,082
Sorry, I heard you scream.

1706
01:17:08,144 --> 01:17:09,987
I thought Jamie was getting murdered,

1707
01:17:10,046 --> 01:17:11,957
so I was gonna fucking
smack someone around.

1708
01:17:12,415 --> 01:17:13,985
- What happened?
- I don't know!

1709
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:16,853
I just found my wedding dress
covered in barf!

1710
01:17:16,919 --> 01:17:20,196
And something else, something sticky.

1711
01:17:38,674 --> 01:17:39,744
It's jizz.

1712
01:17:41,644 --> 01:17:44,488
You puked on my dress and then fucked it!

1713
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:48,395
You're a madman.

1714
01:17:48,451 --> 01:17:50,192
No, no, no, no. No.

1715
01:17:50,486 --> 01:17:52,124
- Sweetheart, it wasn't my boy.
- You shut up.

1716
01:17:52,188 --> 01:17:53,258
Donny, just shut up!

1717
01:17:53,322 --> 01:17:54,665
Who wants a piece of this, huh?

1718
01:17:54,724 --> 01:17:56,465
- Who wants a piece?
- Whoa, no, no, no!

1719
01:17:56,626 --> 01:17:57,696
It's okay, buddy.

1720
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,467
Todd just fucked the dress.

1721
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:01,000
It's under control.

1722
01:18:02,131 --> 01:18:03,872
What is Vanilla Ice doing in our room?

1723
01:18:04,934 --> 01:18:08,313
He's my other best friend.

1724
01:18:08,604 --> 01:18:10,140
Yeah. And a wicked good rapper.

1725
01:18:10,206 --> 01:18:11,913
Give it up for him. Come on, now.

1726
01:18:12,308 --> 01:18:14,345
- Let's give it up.
- My boy.

1727
01:18:14,577 --> 01:18:15,612
I don't know what's going on here,

1728
01:18:15,678 --> 01:18:17,157
but I don't have time to deal with this, so...

1729
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,787
Okay, this is what's gonna happen.

1730
01:18:19,849 --> 01:18:21,851
I'm gonna go take a shower.
I'm gonna go to Pilates.

1731
01:18:21,917 --> 01:18:23,863
You're gonna take that dress
to the dry cleaners!

1732
01:18:23,919 --> 01:18:25,660
And then we're gonna have
rehearsal dinner tonight,

1733
01:18:25,721 --> 01:18:27,667
and you're gonna be
the normal Todd from three days ago, right?

1734
01:18:27,923 --> 01:18:31,336
And you can start by taking out
that stupid Duran Duran earring!

1735
01:18:31,661 --> 01:18:33,004
I was thinking it's more Foreigner.

1736
01:18:33,062 --> 01:18:35,406
No? No, no,
Duran Duran's a good call, though.

1737
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:41,876
Guess I'm gonna go
finish up with Grandma Delores.

1738
01:18:41,937 --> 01:18:43,007
- Yeah.
- Is that all right?

1739
01:18:43,072 --> 01:18:44,142
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Have fun, buddy. Have fun.

1740
01:18:44,206 --> 01:18:45,344
Not too much, though. Don't hurt her.

1741
01:18:45,408 --> 01:18:46,819
No, no. I get it right and keep it tight.

1742
01:18:46,876 --> 01:18:48,287
Okay.

1743
01:18:49,345 --> 01:18:51,347
Look, I need a couple hours to fix this.

1744
01:18:51,414 --> 01:18:54,918
Hey, we've all been in that situation,
and you'll be fine, kid.

1745
01:18:55,217 --> 01:18:57,663
I'll whip up some pancakes
for everyone else, all right?

1746
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:59,063
- All right.
- I love it.

1747
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:03,092
You jizzed on a mannequin.

1748
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:04,399
Respect it.

1749
01:19:06,162 --> 01:19:08,369
But you were only 13.

1750
01:19:08,864 --> 01:19:10,468
She took advantage of you.

1751
01:19:10,533 --> 01:19:13,104
No, all right.
That's what the law says, Su-Jin,

1752
01:19:13,336 --> 01:19:15,942
but I don't know...
We were kind of like soul mates.

1753
01:19:16,005 --> 01:19:17,678
You know, there was...
There was a connection there.

1754
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:19,242
I never had it with anyone else.

1755
01:19:19,775 --> 01:19:21,516
I'm getting a call. I'm sorry, guys.

1756
01:19:21,577 --> 01:19:23,579
Do not touch these plates. I'm cleaning them.

1757
01:19:23,646 --> 01:19:24,647
Okay, Su-Jin?

1758
01:19:25,681 --> 01:19:26,785
Go for Donny B.

1759
01:19:27,149 --> 01:19:28,560
'Wassup!

1760
01:19:28,984 --> 01:19:31,692
Hey, big man. What's going on?

1761
01:19:31,754 --> 01:19:32,755
How'd it go with the lady?

1762
01:19:32,822 --> 01:19:34,324
You patch things up?

1763
01:19:34,724 --> 01:19:36,226
Yeah, pretty much. It was amazing.

1764
01:19:36,292 --> 01:19:40,138
The dry cleaner said they've
definitely seen that combo of fluid before.

1765
01:19:40,196 --> 01:19:43,268
You see? Yeah, those things
go together like gin and tonic.

1766
01:19:43,933 --> 01:19:45,674
Hey, listen, while I got you,

1767
01:19:45,735 --> 01:19:48,045
I left you a little
best man gift on your dresser.

1768
01:19:48,104 --> 01:19:49,344
I think you'll get a kick out of it.

1769
01:19:49,638 --> 01:19:51,982
You did not. Oh, my God.

1770
01:19:52,041 --> 01:19:55,113
My whole body, like,
got a shocked feeling over that.

1771
01:19:55,177 --> 01:19:56,656
Buddy, no one gets me a gift.

1772
01:19:56,846 --> 01:19:58,848
- Where are you, anyways?
- I'm in the car.

1773
01:19:58,914 --> 01:20:00,825
I decided to go see Mom after all.

1774
01:20:01,884 --> 01:20:02,954
You did what?

1775
01:20:04,487 --> 01:20:05,864
Oh, my God. Dukes of Hazzard!

1776
01:20:24,573 --> 01:20:25,847
Hansie.

1777
01:20:25,908 --> 01:20:27,615
Donny, what are you doing here?

1778
01:20:27,676 --> 01:20:29,246
We got to get out of here now.

1779
01:20:29,545 --> 01:20:30,853
What? What are you talking about?

1780
01:20:30,913 --> 01:20:32,358
It's your wedding weekend, dude.

1781
01:20:32,415 --> 01:20:33,416
You come here after the wedding.

1782
01:20:33,482 --> 01:20:34,722
You show your mother your new ring.

1783
01:20:34,784 --> 01:20:36,161
That would make her happy.

1784
01:20:36,452 --> 01:20:38,261
Wait, are you nervous to see her?

1785
01:20:38,487 --> 01:20:42,162
Hansie, can we just blow this place off
and have a beer, please? I'm begging you.

1786
01:20:42,224 --> 01:20:43,328
Look. Is that her?

1787
01:21:12,621 --> 01:21:14,294
Oh, my God.

1788
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:16,392
There you are.

1789
01:21:17,259 --> 01:21:20,069
My little Hansie, you're all grown up.

1790
01:21:20,729 --> 01:21:21,833
Hi, Mom.

1791
01:21:22,198 --> 01:21:23,939
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

1792
01:21:24,366 --> 01:21:26,004
I know. I'm sorry I stopped visiting.

1793
01:21:26,068 --> 01:21:27,069
It just got too hard.

1794
01:21:27,136 --> 01:21:29,343
No, I totally understand.

1795
01:21:30,473 --> 01:21:31,816
Wow.

1796
01:21:32,007 --> 01:21:33,213
You still have my eyes.

1797
01:21:34,543 --> 01:21:38,650
Is that the earring
that I gave you after the Loverboy concert?

1798
01:21:41,884 --> 01:21:43,921
Yes, it is, Miss McGarricle.

1799
01:21:44,153 --> 01:21:46,963
You know, I think about you every day.

1800
01:21:47,022 --> 01:21:50,003
Fuck, I love you so much, Miss McGarricle.
I never stopped.

1801
01:21:50,726 --> 01:21:52,364
I love you, too.

1802
01:21:53,963 --> 01:21:55,101
Do you remember...

1803
01:21:55,664 --> 01:21:56,699
Oh, God, here we go.

1804
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:01,238
...all the nasty things
that I taught you, Donny?

1805
01:22:02,905 --> 01:22:05,351
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course I do, Miss McGarricle.

1806
01:22:05,674 --> 01:22:08,314
Are you still my dirty boy?

1807
01:22:09,245 --> 01:22:13,193
Yeah, I'm the dirtiest boy
you'll ever know, Miss McGarricle.

1808
01:22:13,983 --> 01:22:15,155
Donny.

1809
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:18,327
Oh, fuck, yeah.

1810
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:27,363
I'm hard right now. I'm hard.

1811
01:22:27,897 --> 01:22:30,138
Okay. Yeah, I'm hating that, so...

1812
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,674
But it is really good to see you, Mom. I...

1813
01:22:33,736 --> 01:22:34,908
It's good to see you, too, baby.

1814
01:22:35,738 --> 01:22:38,514
Can you describe
what you're feeling right now, Han?

1815
01:22:38,908 --> 01:22:40,512
TV's Randall Morgan?

1816
01:22:41,243 --> 01:22:42,722
What are you doing here?

1817
01:22:42,778 --> 01:22:45,816
Must be quite emotional
for you to be face-to-face

1818
01:22:45,881 --> 01:22:48,327
with the woman
who molested your father, isn't it?

1819
01:22:48,617 --> 01:22:50,927
- What is going on right now?
- Who is this dude?

1820
01:22:50,986 --> 01:22:52,897
Listen, before you get mad at me...

1821
01:22:52,955 --> 01:22:54,628
This is why you came to see me?

1822
01:22:54,957 --> 01:22:56,834
For some reality TV ambush?

1823
01:22:56,926 --> 01:22:58,701
- No.
- How much they paying you, Donny?

1824
01:22:58,794 --> 01:23:00,398
Nothing, I swear to God. I'm not getting...

1825
01:23:00,462 --> 01:23:03,909
Fifty thousand dollars
to deliver you to this prison.

1826
01:23:04,233 --> 01:23:06,770
All right, it was 50 grand, but I'm not...
I'm not...

1827
01:23:06,835 --> 01:23:08,405
I'm not going to do it. I swear to God.

1828
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:09,949
I'm not... I would never take his money.

1829
01:23:10,005 --> 01:23:11,211
Donny Berger, what have you done?

1830
01:23:11,507 --> 01:23:12,918
Hansie, dude, it's me.

1831
01:23:13,275 --> 01:23:14,549
It's the guy from last night.

1832
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:15,953
We had fun. Don't fuck it.

1833
01:23:16,011 --> 01:23:17,115
I'm telling you, this is...

1834
01:23:17,179 --> 01:23:18,249
This is something that can be fixed.

1835
01:23:18,614 --> 01:23:19,888
- You're unreal.
- Hansie.

1836
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:21,951
What...

1837
01:23:22,017 --> 01:23:24,520
You go after him, Donny,
and you take care of our son.

1838
01:23:24,853 --> 01:23:27,697
- Hansie.
- Come on, he is pissed. Fuck!

1839
01:23:28,023 --> 01:23:30,162
- Take care of our baby, Donny!
- Hansie!

1840
01:23:30,526 --> 01:23:32,403
Hansie, please, let me explain to you...

1841
01:23:32,461 --> 01:23:34,338
I can't believe I let you
back into my life again.

1842
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:36,706
Guy, guy, just come on. Listen to me.

1843
01:23:37,066 --> 01:23:38,909
I owe the IRS a lot of money.

1844
01:23:38,968 --> 01:23:41,209
- Of course you do.
- I know, I know. I'm a fuck-up.

1845
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:44,479
But if I don't give them 43 G's by Tuesday,
I'm going to prison.

1846
01:23:44,807 --> 01:23:46,548
Wait, so you're telling me,

1847
01:23:46,609 --> 01:23:48,919
if I give you 43 grand,
you don't have to go to jail?

1848
01:23:50,179 --> 01:23:52,159
I will pay you back, I swear to God.

1849
01:23:52,214 --> 01:23:53,625
Would you loan me the money?

1850
01:23:53,816 --> 01:23:55,420
No! Fuck you!

1851
01:23:55,484 --> 01:23:57,521
- Get your shit out of my boss's house!
- Okay!

1852
01:23:58,554 --> 01:23:59,862
No! Don't do that.

1853
01:23:59,922 --> 01:24:01,902
That's my boy there.

1854
01:24:03,926 --> 01:24:05,132
No.

1855
01:24:05,194 --> 01:24:06,935
I think he just shit his pants.

1856
01:24:06,996 --> 01:24:08,669
Tell me you got that on camera.

1857
01:24:08,931 --> 01:24:10,911
You made me throw out my extra underwear!

1858
01:24:10,966 --> 01:24:14,175
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were going to shit yourself again.

1859
01:24:14,403 --> 01:24:15,609
That was awesome.

1860
01:24:15,938 --> 01:24:17,212
That was awesome.

1861
01:24:17,539 --> 01:24:19,815
Donny, couldn't have gone any better.
Loved it.

1862
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:21,616
You know what I need from you, Todd,
is I need you

1863
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:23,986
-to sign the release form right...
- Fuck you!

1864
01:24:24,847 --> 01:24:25,917
Get away from me!

1865
01:24:25,981 --> 01:24:27,483
Get those cameras off me!

1866
01:24:29,284 --> 01:24:31,992
I hate you, Dad.

1867
01:24:35,924 --> 01:24:37,301
Hansie!

1868
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:41,200
I can't pay you a dime
unless I got a release form.

1869
01:24:41,964 --> 01:24:43,409
Fuck.

1870
01:24:43,465 --> 01:24:45,035
Did I get any shit on me?

1871
01:25:13,896 --> 01:25:16,570
Let me off here. Let me off.
Let me get off. I'll fucking run up.

1872
01:25:16,899 --> 01:25:18,105
Keep it running.

1873
01:25:18,167 --> 01:25:19,544
I got to pick my shit up.

1874
01:25:40,222 --> 01:25:41,724
You're so adorable.

1875
01:25:42,691 --> 01:25:44,967
No, I know, but I told you
not to call me on this line.

1876
01:25:45,027 --> 01:25:46,529
What if Todd picks up?

1877
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:51,170
No, no, no, I want to.

1878
01:25:53,035 --> 01:25:54,241
No, Steve.

1879
01:25:54,303 --> 01:25:55,907
Todd doesn't know anything.

1880
01:25:56,071 --> 01:25:58,608
I don't care if he finds out after the wedding.

1881
01:25:58,707 --> 01:26:00,084
There's nothing he can do
about it then anyway.

1882
01:26:01,243 --> 01:26:02,688
You're so sweet.

1883
01:26:02,745 --> 01:26:04,383
Steve, huh?

1884
01:26:05,514 --> 01:26:08,984
Well, Steve Spirou, I'm going to fuck you up.

1885
01:26:09,718 --> 01:26:12,790
I'm going to fuck you up!

1886
01:26:15,491 --> 01:26:17,528
Well, I got some great news.

1887
01:26:17,793 --> 01:26:20,137
I've made my decision
on who my new partner is.

1888
01:26:22,431 --> 01:26:23,774
Phil!

1889
01:26:23,832 --> 01:26:25,778
Phil, I knew you could do it.

1890
01:26:25,834 --> 01:26:27,313
Look at Phil's face.

1891
01:26:27,369 --> 01:26:29,815
I'm just busting your balls, Phil.

1892
01:26:29,872 --> 01:26:31,545
No, I'd never pick you.

1893
01:26:31,607 --> 01:26:32,847
Oh, no.

1894
01:26:32,941 --> 01:26:35,444
It's you, Todd. Partners.

1895
01:26:36,745 --> 01:26:37,883
Partner.

1896
01:26:37,946 --> 01:26:38,947
Oh, my gosh.

1897
01:26:39,014 --> 01:26:41,324
It's going to be a lot more hours
and a lot more responsibility.

1898
01:26:41,383 --> 01:26:42,589
You know that, right?

1899
01:26:42,651 --> 01:26:44,995
And a lot more money!

1900
01:26:48,791 --> 01:26:50,532
- Somebody's going shopping!
- Yeah!

1901
01:26:52,528 --> 01:26:53,836
I thought he left.

1902
01:26:53,896 --> 01:26:55,603
Yeah, that's what you wish, Steve.

1903
01:26:55,664 --> 01:26:57,701
I need to talk to you, homeboy. Yeah.

1904
01:26:57,766 --> 01:26:58,801
Hey, Jamie.

1905
01:26:59,468 --> 01:27:00,538
Listen. Listen.

1906
01:27:00,602 --> 01:27:03,446
Dude, this is not about you and me, all right?

1907
01:27:04,006 --> 01:27:05,508
You're not marrying the right girl.

1908
01:27:05,574 --> 01:27:06,678
She is cheating on you.

1909
01:27:07,242 --> 01:27:08,619
You are unbelievable.

1910
01:27:08,677 --> 01:27:09,747
Can't you just let it go?

1911
01:27:09,812 --> 01:27:11,120
This is my last chance to be normal.

1912
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:12,454
Are you determined to ruin my life?

1913
01:27:13,148 --> 01:27:14,923
- Honey, what's going on?
- Nothing.

1914
01:27:14,983 --> 01:27:17,361
Don't "honey" him,
you little snake in the grass.

1915
01:27:17,719 --> 01:27:19,221
I heard your phone call.

1916
01:27:19,288 --> 01:27:22,235
"Steve, why'd you call on this line?

1917
01:27:22,291 --> 01:27:23,702
"Todd could have picked up."

1918
01:27:23,926 --> 01:27:24,996
That's right, sonny boy.

1919
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:26,937
Your wife-to-be's fucking your boss.

1920
01:27:27,229 --> 01:27:28,299
Right there.

1921
01:27:28,664 --> 01:27:29,768
Fuck you, buddy.

1922
01:27:30,032 --> 01:27:31,909
You are an idiot!

1923
01:27:31,967 --> 01:27:33,105
Is that right, sweetheart?

1924
01:27:33,168 --> 01:27:34,613
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah, yeah. Why?

1925
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:37,048
I was on the phone with Steve.

1926
01:27:37,306 --> 01:27:41,379
Steve Goldstein,
the Boston Herald wedding reporter.

1927
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:44,657
Yeah, he's doing a piece on
the most beautiful places to get married,

1928
01:27:44,713 --> 01:27:47,216
and I didn't want Todd to know
because he doesn't like being in the paper.

1929
01:27:47,316 --> 01:27:50,422
So, I am sorry
that I wanted everyone in the world

1930
01:27:50,485 --> 01:27:52,487
to know I married the perfect guy.

1931
01:27:52,554 --> 01:27:56,730
Honey, do you think you can forgive me
for keeping such a big secret from you?

1932
01:27:59,294 --> 01:28:02,741
Okay, due to this newfound evidence,

1933
01:28:03,732 --> 01:28:06,679
the conclusion might be that I'm an asshole.

1934
01:28:07,736 --> 01:28:08,806
Bye.

1935
01:28:10,906 --> 01:28:12,476
Fine.

1936
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:13,679
Have a good wedding.

1937
01:28:15,844 --> 01:28:17,380
I'll leave with pride.

1938
01:28:17,946 --> 01:28:19,289
I'm a good person.

1939
01:28:21,483 --> 01:28:23,656
Bye! I'll see you tomorrow!

1940
01:28:28,523 --> 01:28:30,059
Wow, what a stressful day, huh?

1941
01:28:30,492 --> 01:28:32,096
- Can't wait to get back to the beach house.
- Thank you.

1942
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:34,140
- Bye.
- Just the two of us, you know?

1943
01:28:34,463 --> 01:28:36,807
No, honey.
I'm staying in the city tonight, remember?

1944
01:28:37,032 --> 01:28:38,705
- What? No.
- Yeah, the bride and groom,

1945
01:28:38,767 --> 01:28:41,043
they're supposed to sleep separate
night before the wedding.

1946
01:28:41,103 --> 01:28:42,343
So see you tomorrow, big guy.

1947
01:28:42,404 --> 01:28:44,281
I'm going to drop Jamie
at the Fairmont Copley.

1948
01:28:44,406 --> 01:28:46,443
Mom and Dad,
you guys got the hedgehog. Okay!

1949
01:28:46,742 --> 01:28:47,812
- Love you.
- Watch the door.

1950
01:28:47,876 --> 01:28:49,651
- Love you. Okay.
- Sleep well.

1951
01:28:50,012 --> 01:28:51,787
Wait, but don't they not have a car?

1952
01:28:57,586 --> 01:28:59,725
All right, Donny, go.
There's your chance. Go.

1953
01:28:59,788 --> 01:29:01,699
I ain't got no more chances, buddy.

1954
01:29:01,757 --> 01:29:03,464
The kid hates my guts.

1955
01:29:03,725 --> 01:29:05,329
Right? 'Cause you guys don't have a car.

1956
01:29:05,394 --> 01:29:06,930
I'm not talking about him, Donny.

1957
01:29:07,596 --> 01:29:09,234
- Wake up, man.
- What?

1958
01:29:09,631 --> 01:29:11,736
Jamie's the gatekeeper for your son.

1959
01:29:12,034 --> 01:29:15,447
- Yeah?
- Win her over, then she'll convince Han

1960
01:29:15,771 --> 01:29:17,808
to give you another chance. Boom!

1961
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:22,213
How am I ever going to get her trust?
She freaking hates me.

1962
01:29:22,711 --> 01:29:25,157
Donny, you want to know
what all women love?

1963
01:29:26,114 --> 01:29:27,559
Ice cream.

1964
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:38,536
Hi. I'm Todd Peterson.

1965
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:40,938
No, you're not. You're Donny Berger.

1966
01:29:40,996 --> 01:29:42,907
You fucked your teacher
in the seventh grade.

1967
01:29:46,201 --> 01:29:47,942
Hi. I'm Todd Peterson.

1968
01:29:48,003 --> 01:29:49,710
Hi, Mr. Peterson. What can I do for you?

1969
01:29:50,105 --> 01:29:52,085
What room was my fiancée in again?

1970
01:29:52,207 --> 01:29:54,483
Let me check. 641.

1971
01:29:54,843 --> 01:29:56,049
You're a fucking stud.

1972
01:29:57,879 --> 01:29:59,825
Hey, when the legendary
Donny Berger comes in here

1973
01:29:59,881 --> 01:30:01,952
using a fake name, you go with it!

1974
01:30:02,017 --> 01:30:03,553
All right, I will.

1975
01:30:08,757 --> 01:30:11,363
641. 641.

1976
01:30:11,426 --> 01:30:13,497
All right, come on, sweetheart.

1977
01:30:13,595 --> 01:30:15,472
Oh, yeah!

1978
01:30:17,766 --> 01:30:18,870
What, did Todd come out here?

1979
01:30:18,934 --> 01:30:20,743
You're half the size of Todd

1980
01:30:20,802 --> 01:30:23,510
but you use it so much better!

1981
01:30:23,572 --> 01:30:25,711
I guess not.

1982
01:30:25,774 --> 01:30:26,844
Oh. my God!

1983
01:30:26,908 --> 01:30:28,387
Oh, my God.

1984
01:30:28,443 --> 01:30:29,820
Oh. my God!

1985
01:30:29,878 --> 01:30:31,585
Oh, my God.

1986
01:30:32,647 --> 01:30:34,251
Fucking shit!

1987
01:30:34,316 --> 01:30:35,624
Fucking shit.

1988
01:30:35,684 --> 01:30:36,754
Fucking shit!

1989
01:30:36,818 --> 01:30:37,853
Fucking shit.

1990
01:30:39,755 --> 01:30:41,132
Yeah. Okay.

1991
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:43,433
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1992
01:31:05,914 --> 01:31:07,359
Okay.

1993
01:31:09,951 --> 01:31:11,760
Yeah!

1994
01:31:12,287 --> 01:31:14,358
You do not deserve these treats.

1995
01:31:16,858 --> 01:31:17,962
Are you finished, sweetheart?

1996
01:31:18,794 --> 01:31:19,932
Oh, my God.

1997
01:31:21,830 --> 01:31:23,468
Your fiancé's at home, you know.

1998
01:31:23,899 --> 01:31:25,537
This really gets me upset.

1999
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,011
You know why?

2000
01:31:27,069 --> 01:31:28,707
'Cause he's too good for you.

2001
01:31:29,237 --> 01:31:30,944
He is.

2002
01:31:31,006 --> 01:31:33,953
And you're sitting here gallivanting with...

2003
01:31:34,009 --> 01:31:36,080
I think I know who.

2004
01:31:36,178 --> 01:31:39,682
Don't I, Mr. Steve Goldstein?

2005
01:31:44,986 --> 01:31:47,296
Wait. Are you...

2006
01:31:48,156 --> 01:31:49,499
What am I seeing?

2007
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:51,498
No... It...

2008
01:31:52,828 --> 01:31:53,898
With each other?

2009
01:31:55,297 --> 01:31:57,072
Am I... This is...

2010
01:32:00,202 --> 01:32:03,012
Is he your stepbrother at least

2011
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:05,312
or adopted or something?

2012
01:32:06,608 --> 01:32:07,814
No reply.-

2013
01:32:07,876 --> 01:32:08,877
So it's real.

2014
01:32:08,944 --> 01:32:10,184
Oh, my God.

2015
01:32:10,245 --> 01:32:11,690
Donny, Donny, you don't...

2016
01:32:11,746 --> 01:32:13,157
You don't understand what's going on here.

2017
01:32:13,215 --> 01:32:16,594
I don't think Charlie Sheen
would understand what's going on here.

2018
01:32:16,918 --> 01:32:20,695
Look, I love Todd,
and we're going to get married,

2019
01:32:20,755 --> 01:32:22,564
and we're going to have a great life together.

2020
01:32:22,657 --> 01:32:26,298
And yes, I've had sex with Chad
from time to time.

2021
01:32:27,729 --> 01:32:29,003
It's what good-looking people do.

2022
01:32:29,064 --> 01:32:31,169
They have sex with
other good-looking people.

2023
01:32:31,466 --> 01:32:33,070
You know? Just so happens that

2024
01:32:33,135 --> 01:32:36,776
this one particular good-looking person
is my little brother.

2025
01:32:36,838 --> 01:32:38,442
Okay.

2026
01:32:38,507 --> 01:32:40,418
It's all making sense to me now.

2027
01:32:43,078 --> 01:32:46,287
I know that sounded bad, but, Donny,
this was going to be the last time.

2028
01:32:46,381 --> 01:32:48,622
I would never carry on
with a married woman.

2029
01:32:48,884 --> 01:32:51,387
I've got better morals than that, Donny.

2030
01:32:52,821 --> 01:32:55,859
Chad, adultery is bad,

2031
01:32:57,759 --> 01:33:01,502
but incest is fucked up!

2032
01:33:03,498 --> 01:33:06,604
Please don't let him tell Mommy
about our secret tickle time.

2033
01:33:06,801 --> 01:33:08,644
"Secret tickle time"?

2034
01:33:08,703 --> 01:33:10,774
You got a name for it?

2035
01:33:12,407 --> 01:33:16,253
And with a United States
military man, no less.

2036
01:33:16,578 --> 01:33:19,115
You are a disgrace to that uniform!

2037
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:20,626
No, he's not a Marine.

2038
01:33:20,682 --> 01:33:21,990
He buys those uniforms on eBay

2039
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:24,587
so Dad doesn't find out
he's a modern jazz dancer.

2040
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,058
What?

2041
01:33:26,121 --> 01:33:28,658
That's possibly worse than the incest thing.

2042
01:33:29,157 --> 01:33:31,603
This is an abomination. I'm telling Todd.

2043
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:33,970
- No, he won't believe you.
- Yeah, he will.

2044
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:37,233
No, he bought that Steve Goldstein story.

2045
01:33:37,532 --> 01:33:40,445
Come on, you think he got
that partnership on his own?

2046
01:33:40,502 --> 01:33:41,879
With that "beep boop beep" shit?

2047
01:33:41,937 --> 01:33:42,972
No, I gave him a boost.

2048
01:33:43,738 --> 01:33:45,877
How many people have you fucked?

2049
01:33:46,474 --> 01:33:48,579
Well, maybe he'll believe this.

2050
01:33:51,947 --> 01:33:53,824
Nice. Save.

2051
01:33:55,784 --> 01:33:57,320
You two have fun together.

2052
01:33:57,953 --> 01:33:59,125
Sickies.

2053
01:33:59,187 --> 01:34:00,666
All right, how much?

2054
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:02,395
I'm going to be a very rich woman.

2055
01:34:02,457 --> 01:34:03,993
I can write you a big fat check.

2056
01:34:04,359 --> 01:34:06,270
What's it going to take for this to go away?

2057
01:34:06,695 --> 01:34:10,142
Todd has to pop a Xanax
when he loses a contact lens.

2058
01:34:11,066 --> 01:34:13,512
What do you think he's going to do
when he finds out about this?

2059
01:34:14,169 --> 01:34:15,978
Todd's happy.-

2060
01:34:16,037 --> 01:34:17,880
You really want to take that away?

2061
01:34:38,193 --> 01:34:39,433
Hey, buddy.

2062
01:34:40,695 --> 01:34:43,141
I got something to tell you, and...

2063
01:34:44,266 --> 01:34:46,542
I'm not expecting you to believe this, but...

2064
01:34:48,703 --> 01:34:50,239
I got the money.

2065
01:34:50,338 --> 01:34:51,578
That's great, Donny.

2066
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:53,544
Your son came through for you, didn't he?

2067
01:34:53,742 --> 01:34:57,656
Yeah. His fiancée gave me $50,000

2068
01:34:57,712 --> 01:35:01,125
to keep quiet about her
having sex with her brother.

2069
01:35:01,182 --> 01:35:02,820
Yeah, I've been there.

2070
01:35:02,951 --> 01:35:04,191
We've all been there.

2071
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:07,200
She said it was her last time, so...

2072
01:35:08,356 --> 01:35:09,596
Maybe things will work out.

2073
01:35:10,358 --> 01:35:12,497
Then how come I feel like shit right now?

2074
01:35:13,328 --> 01:35:14,966
Yeah, it's kind of a moral thicket.

2075
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:16,573
But the good news is

2076
01:35:16,631 --> 01:35:19,202
you stay out of the slammer, right, Donny?

2077
01:35:20,769 --> 01:35:21,941
Donny?

2078
01:35:33,982 --> 01:35:35,518
"Go do something."

2079
01:35:37,085 --> 01:35:40,532
I don't know, Mr. Mitty.
I don't know if I can fucking handle it.

2080
01:35:42,424 --> 01:35:44,836
"Be a good person."

2081
01:35:46,828 --> 01:35:47,995
Donny?

2082
01:35:55,403 --> 01:35:56,814
- No, no, don't hit me.
- No, no.

2083
01:35:56,871 --> 01:35:59,647
Just give me a moment, please, Todd.
Just a moment. Relax.

2084
01:36:00,275 --> 01:36:02,312
You know, after praying with the monsignor,

2085
01:36:02,777 --> 01:36:07,055
I realize that I committed the sin
of prideful anger in the church,

2086
01:36:07,749 --> 01:36:10,389
and I hope that you'll accept my apology

2087
01:36:10,452 --> 01:36:14,161
and allow me the honor
of being a part of this joyous day.

2088
01:36:14,756 --> 01:36:16,429
Well, what about Father Shakalu?

2089
01:36:18,093 --> 01:36:19,470
Stupid bird.

2090
01:36:19,527 --> 01:36:20,972
Come on, fly!

2091
01:36:21,596 --> 01:36:23,576
Well, he's cool.

2092
01:36:24,532 --> 01:36:25,977
Great. Sounds good.

2093
01:36:27,502 --> 01:36:28,810
By the way, Todd

2094
01:36:29,771 --> 01:36:31,648
was it you that hit me in the head
with the bottle?

2095
01:36:33,108 --> 01:36:34,178
No.

2096
01:36:34,609 --> 01:36:36,646
Well, then, who, then?

2097
01:36:38,046 --> 01:36:39,116
It was Chad.

2098
01:36:39,881 --> 01:36:41,258
Interesting.

2099
01:36:42,317 --> 01:36:43,921
Two, three, four.

2100
01:36:43,985 --> 01:36:45,123
Fosse, and Fosse,

2101
01:36:45,787 --> 01:36:47,323
-and Fosse.
- Interesting.

2102
01:36:49,391 --> 01:36:51,337
Yo! Donny Berger! All right!

2103
01:36:51,393 --> 01:36:54,602
I'd sign something for you, buddy,
but I got no time right now.

2104
01:36:54,662 --> 01:36:56,005
Ice!

2105
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,566
Ice, you in there, buddy? I need you!

2106
01:36:59,401 --> 01:37:00,539
You still got the 5.0?

2107
01:37:02,871 --> 01:37:05,215
What does that mean? Is that a yes or no?
I don't understand the pose.

2108
01:37:05,273 --> 01:37:07,116
Yeah? Let's go, let's go!

2109
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:19,863
Go. baby, go!

2110
01:37:53,254 --> 01:37:54,426
No!

2111
01:38:20,014 --> 01:38:21,186
Look at this fucking guy!

2112
01:38:23,184 --> 01:38:24,219
Man!

2113
01:38:36,831 --> 01:38:39,437
No, no, no, no, no! We're stuck! We're stuck!

2114
01:38:39,501 --> 01:38:41,606
To hell with the 5.0. Let's run for it, man.

2115
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:43,910
- But we need great tunes!
- Come on, let's get them!

2116
01:38:44,839 --> 01:38:46,318
Right here, I got a Walkman.

2117
01:38:46,374 --> 01:38:47,682
- The Walkman!
- Yeah, baby.

2118
01:38:49,811 --> 01:38:50,846
Let's go!

2119
01:38:54,415 --> 01:38:55,894
- Damn it, man!
- Come on! Let's go!

2120
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:57,054
Oh. my God!

2121
01:38:59,854 --> 01:39:01,356
Hey!

2122
01:39:11,466 --> 01:39:13,912
You forgot to pay!

2123
01:39:14,135 --> 01:39:17,378
So, Jamie, do you promise
to provide Todd here

2124
01:39:17,438 --> 01:39:20,885
with unending empathy,
encouragement and honesty,

2125
01:39:21,743 --> 01:39:22,949
till death do you part?

2126
01:39:23,478 --> 01:39:24,548
I do.

2127
01:39:28,917 --> 01:39:30,692
Hey, Donny. Come on!

2128
01:39:37,659 --> 01:39:39,036
What are you doing, guy?

2129
01:39:39,427 --> 01:39:40,929
You jumped?

2130
01:39:40,995 --> 01:39:42,838
There was a door right here!

2131
01:39:42,897 --> 01:39:44,899
Come on, we got to get there!

2132
01:39:47,402 --> 01:39:49,006
And you, Todd, do you promise to love,

2133
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:52,779
honor and protect this special lady
for the rest of your life?

2134
01:39:55,009 --> 01:39:57,182
Don't answer that question!

2135
01:40:03,084 --> 01:40:04,256
Oh, shit.

2136
01:40:07,388 --> 01:40:10,665
We ran well over a mile.

2137
01:40:23,471 --> 01:40:25,542
I object to these two getting married.

2138
01:40:27,408 --> 01:40:30,719
No, we're past that part already.

2139
01:40:31,546 --> 01:40:32,752
What are my options, then?

2140
01:40:32,814 --> 01:40:33,849
How about leaving?

2141
01:40:33,982 --> 01:40:36,656
You shut the hell up, you satanic hose-bag!

2142
01:40:36,918 --> 01:40:37,919
Hey!

2143
01:40:37,986 --> 01:40:40,398
Gerald! I'm sorry it sounded so harsh,

2144
01:40:40,455 --> 01:40:42,833
but you'll understand
why I said that in a few minutes.

2145
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:44,267
There ain't gonna be a few minutes,

2146
01:40:44,325 --> 01:40:45,998
-you goddamn son of a bitch!
- Calm down!

2147
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:47,164
Calm down!

2148
01:40:48,763 --> 01:40:50,299
Let the boy talk.

2149
01:40:50,398 --> 01:40:52,207
I can't let you marry this chick.

2150
01:40:52,533 --> 01:40:53,568
I can't believe you're doing this.

2151
01:40:53,635 --> 01:40:55,137
Listen to me, buddy.

2152
01:40:55,637 --> 01:40:57,378
You don't love this girl.

2153
01:40:57,438 --> 01:40:59,679
I'm telling you. I had love, it's different.

2154
01:40:59,741 --> 01:41:01,414
It's a different feeling.

2155
01:41:01,743 --> 01:41:03,347
Love is like...

2156
01:41:04,112 --> 01:41:06,854
It just leads you to a special connection.

2157
01:41:06,914 --> 01:41:10,452
It's full of, like, feelings of awesomeness.

2158
01:41:10,551 --> 01:41:13,555
And the feelings you...

2159
01:41:13,621 --> 01:41:15,191
That wrap around you.

2160
01:41:15,723 --> 01:41:17,794
It's deep in your stomach.

2161
01:41:17,859 --> 01:41:20,032
It's in your head.
It's in your fucking nut sack.

2162
01:41:21,162 --> 01:41:22,698
It's in your dick when it gets hard.

2163
01:41:22,764 --> 01:41:24,243
There's still love at the tip.

2164
01:41:24,432 --> 01:41:26,275
And it fucking sprinkles out

2165
01:41:27,068 --> 01:41:30,174
like morning dew
shooting all over the grass.

2166
01:41:30,672 --> 01:41:32,948
Okay, I've had just about enough of this.

2167
01:41:33,074 --> 01:41:35,577
Phil, sit down before I tell your wife
what you did at the strip club.

2168
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:36,814
Okay.

2169
01:41:38,613 --> 01:41:42,959
Son, I'm sorry, I just...
I can't let you marry this skank.

2170
01:41:43,217 --> 01:41:44,218
"Son?"

2171
01:41:44,652 --> 01:41:46,131
- Your son?
- Son?

2172
01:41:46,387 --> 01:41:47,764
What is he talking about?

2173
01:41:48,222 --> 01:41:51,101
Honey? You can tell me.

2174
01:41:51,926 --> 01:41:53,599
I'll forgive you.

2175
01:41:54,195 --> 01:41:56,835
That's what love's about, right? Forgiveness.

2176
01:41:58,266 --> 01:41:59,643
All right, fine.

2177
01:42:01,402 --> 01:42:03,473
Donny's not my best friend.

2178
01:42:04,038 --> 01:42:05,278
He's my father.

2179
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:06,775
Oh'

2180
01:42:06,841 --> 01:42:09,651
My parents didn't die in an explosion.

2181
01:42:09,711 --> 01:42:11,315
I lied because I'm the product of

2182
01:42:11,379 --> 01:42:14,087
an inappropriate
teacher-student relationship.

2183
01:42:14,148 --> 01:42:16,355
Teacher-student relationship?

2184
01:42:18,019 --> 01:42:19,396
Do you know how gross that sounds?

2185
01:42:19,454 --> 01:42:20,455
You're disgusting!

2186
01:42:20,988 --> 01:42:22,729
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

2187
01:42:23,024 --> 01:42:24,867
She can still cancel that check, Donny!

2188
01:42:25,026 --> 01:42:26,027
Chad.

2189
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:27,534
Cancel what check?

2190
01:42:27,595 --> 01:42:28,596
I don't...

2191
01:42:28,663 --> 01:42:31,303
She gave me 50 grand
to keep my mouth shut.

2192
01:42:32,667 --> 01:42:34,476
Fifty grand? Jamie.

2193
01:42:34,535 --> 01:42:37,277
Yeah, it was... I was gonna hold on to it,

2194
01:42:37,338 --> 01:42:39,375
you know, to get me out ofjail, but...

2195
01:42:40,274 --> 01:42:42,083
Yeah, yeah. That's what I think of that.

2196
01:42:42,143 --> 01:42:43,884
That's how much I hate this fucking whore.

2197
01:42:43,945 --> 01:42:45,788
Wait. Keep your mouth shut about what?

2198
01:42:45,847 --> 01:42:46,985
Todd, don't listen to him.

2199
01:42:47,215 --> 01:42:48,990
He's a liar and he's crazy!

2200
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:51,052
Father McNally, please continue.
I promise to do

2201
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:52,826
all that shit you mentioned
and so does Todd, right?

2202
01:42:52,887 --> 01:42:54,457
Wait, what is going on?

2203
01:42:54,522 --> 01:42:55,557
Tell him.

2204
01:42:56,958 --> 01:42:58,835
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't tell him, don't tell him.

2205
01:42:59,093 --> 01:43:01,369
You tell him or I'll tell everybody here.
It's up to you.

2206
01:43:07,735 --> 01:43:08,770
Come on.

2207
01:43:22,450 --> 01:43:23,895
Okay. Well, that's not that bad.

2208
01:43:24,152 --> 01:43:27,292
What? You didn't tell him,
you fucking lying piece of shit!

2209
01:43:27,355 --> 01:43:29,961
Get on it now or I'll fucking crush you!

2210
01:43:30,024 --> 01:43:31,059
No.

2211
01:43:31,659 --> 01:43:34,572
Jame, you can tell me.

2212
01:43:34,629 --> 01:43:36,267
I mean, how bad could it be?

2213
01:43:59,854 --> 01:44:00,889
What?

2214
01:44:00,955 --> 01:44:02,366
Okay, she told him.

2215
01:44:04,292 --> 01:44:05,828
What?

2216
01:44:11,065 --> 01:44:12,874
You fuck your brother?

2217
01:44:13,167 --> 01:44:14,737
Oh. my God!

2218
01:44:16,704 --> 01:44:18,911
Fucking white people.

2219
01:44:21,442 --> 01:44:24,446
I'm not looking so bad now, am I, Dad?

2220
01:44:25,179 --> 01:44:26,487
I'm out of here.

2221
01:44:26,547 --> 01:44:29,153
Mom, she started all this.

2222
01:44:29,217 --> 01:44:31,629
I didn't want to. I'm still your little soldier, I...

2223
01:44:31,819 --> 01:44:33,958
- Fuck!
- Take that uniform off.

2224
01:44:34,021 --> 01:44:35,898
You're insulting us all.

2225
01:44:35,957 --> 01:44:37,664
No, no, no. Don't you see?

2226
01:44:38,192 --> 01:44:39,694
It's gonna be even better now.

2227
01:44:40,461 --> 01:44:42,338
You're a mess, I'm a mess.

2228
01:44:42,663 --> 01:44:45,473
Come on. Doc Shakalu, get your ass up here!

2229
01:44:45,533 --> 01:44:47,240
I got to be part of this shit?

2230
01:44:47,401 --> 01:44:48,471
Todd?

2231
01:44:48,836 --> 01:44:50,213
Please.

2232
01:44:56,611 --> 01:44:58,955
Come on, baby. Come on, Todd, let's do this.

2233
01:44:59,013 --> 01:45:00,048
Yeah, yeah.

2234
01:45:00,414 --> 01:45:03,224
No! Let's not do this.

2235
01:45:03,651 --> 01:45:04,959
Okay?

2236
01:45:05,419 --> 01:45:09,026
And for the record,
my name's not Todd Peterson.

2237
01:45:09,523 --> 01:45:11,434
It's Han Solo.

2238
01:45:11,492 --> 01:45:15,463
Named after the man who made
the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.

2239
01:45:15,529 --> 01:45:18,635
And I am a Berger, like my father before me.

2240
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:21,403
Also, I want to tell everyone here
that I've got a pretty huge

2241
01:45:21,469 --> 01:45:23,506
New Kids on the Block tattoo on my back.

2242
01:45:23,571 --> 01:45:25,812
The heads are warped,
but fuck you guys, it's funny.

2243
01:45:25,973 --> 01:45:27,680
It is fucking hilarious.

2244
01:45:27,875 --> 01:45:28,910
And Steve?

2245
01:45:29,343 --> 01:45:32,881
Nothing personal, man, but I quit!

2246
01:45:33,247 --> 01:45:35,591
No, no. Come on, Todd, don't be like that.

2247
01:45:36,884 --> 01:45:38,557
We quit, too.

2248
01:45:38,619 --> 01:45:39,689
Fuck you!

2249
01:45:40,087 --> 01:45:41,293
Good call, Han Solo,

2250
01:45:41,355 --> 01:45:43,494
'cause your fiancée banged him, too.

2251
01:45:43,557 --> 01:45:44,558
What?

2252
01:45:44,625 --> 01:45:46,536
I didn't know
about the brother thing, though.

2253
01:45:46,594 --> 01:45:48,972
I am as sickened as you, believe me.

2254
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:50,805
You know what? It's all right, Steve.

2255
01:45:50,865 --> 01:45:52,003
'Cause guess what?

2256
01:45:52,066 --> 01:45:54,603
Donny and Vanilla Ice fucked your mom!

2257
01:45:55,836 --> 01:45:57,941
Vanilla Ice banged Grandma?

2258
01:45:58,005 --> 01:46:00,315
That's fucking awesome!

2259
01:46:02,977 --> 01:46:04,456
Donny, look out!

2260
01:46:08,716 --> 01:46:10,457
Word to your mother, brotherfucker!

2261
01:46:11,185 --> 01:46:13,131
I'm sorry.
I know I'm not supposed to hit a chick,

2262
01:46:13,187 --> 01:46:15,030
but I got to tell you, it felt good.

2263
01:46:15,089 --> 01:46:16,693
I mean, I wouldn't do it again,

2264
01:46:16,757 --> 01:46:18,998
but with this psycho, you know,
it was warranted.

2265
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:20,664
Donny! I'm gonna kill you!

2266
01:46:24,465 --> 01:46:25,967
At ease, bitch.

2267
01:46:26,033 --> 01:46:28,570
Dude! That's it! Nice!

2268
01:46:28,636 --> 01:46:29,808
Hang on, though. Hang on.

2269
01:46:29,870 --> 01:46:31,315
No, don't hurt me.

2270
01:46:35,576 --> 01:46:37,078
Even Steven.

2271
01:46:37,611 --> 01:46:40,148
Father, take off the collar.

2272
01:46:40,982 --> 01:46:43,155
That's right. You're not meant for this.

2273
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:45,729
- Well...
- Yeah.

2274
01:46:46,087 --> 01:46:47,430
Nicely done.

2275
01:46:47,488 --> 01:46:48,933
All right, come on.

2276
01:46:49,490 --> 01:46:50,798
Let's get out of here, Dad.

2277
01:46:51,993 --> 01:46:54,405
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

2278
01:46:54,462 --> 01:46:56,499
My son called me "Dad!"

2279
01:46:57,131 --> 01:46:58,439
He called me "Dad!"

2280
01:46:58,499 --> 01:47:00,945
That's right!
The Berger boys are back, bitches!

2281
01:47:01,002 --> 01:47:02,845
Wassup?

2282
01:47:03,137 --> 01:47:04,309
Wassup?

2283
01:47:04,572 --> 01:47:06,176
Wassup...

2284
01:47:14,348 --> 01:47:15,554
Shut up.

2285
01:47:15,616 --> 01:47:17,926
His boss and her brother?

2286
01:47:17,985 --> 01:47:19,589
It sounds like a Rodney Dangerfield joke,

2287
01:47:19,653 --> 01:47:21,655
but it actually happened to my boy here!

2288
01:47:22,056 --> 01:47:24,627
Now we got to find Han Solo
one of them new girls.

2289
01:47:24,692 --> 01:47:26,638
One that don't care about
all that money he make.

2290
01:47:26,694 --> 01:47:29,140
- No, no.
- Yeah, like a girl version

2291
01:47:29,196 --> 01:47:31,301
-of Todd Bridges would be perfect.
- That's right!

2292
01:47:31,365 --> 01:47:32,708
Female version of me. That's right.

2293
01:47:32,767 --> 01:47:35,611
Well, you know, I actually might be
doing okay in that department, so...

2294
01:47:35,870 --> 01:47:36,905
What's that?

2295
01:47:36,971 --> 01:47:38,143
What the fuck... What the heck?

2296
01:47:38,205 --> 01:47:41,186
Todd and Brie, sitting in a tree.

2297
01:47:41,442 --> 01:47:43,922
I have balls down to my knee!

2298
01:47:44,378 --> 01:47:46,449
- What?
- He said it! Yeah!

2299
01:47:46,914 --> 01:47:48,587
- Donny!
- Yeah, buddy?

2300
01:47:48,916 --> 01:47:51,487
You're my best friend. I'm gonna miss you.

2301
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,199
I know, I know.

2302
01:47:54,255 --> 01:47:55,325
But there's good news.

2303
01:47:55,389 --> 01:47:57,460
You know what,
Miss McGarricle gets out in three years,

2304
01:47:57,525 --> 01:48:00,938
so the timing's kind of perfect
for us to start our lives together.

2305
01:48:01,195 --> 01:48:02,435
Dad, let me just give you the money.

2306
01:48:02,696 --> 01:48:04,505
No. No. I'm not gonna do that.

2307
01:48:04,565 --> 01:48:08,536
It's time for Donny Berger
to take responsibility for his screw-ups.

2308
01:48:08,869 --> 01:48:11,406
I made my bed, now I got to lie in it.

2309
01:48:11,672 --> 01:48:13,674
Donny! Donny! Are you watching?

2310
01:48:13,741 --> 01:48:15,379
Turn on the TV! Turn it on!

2311
01:48:15,643 --> 01:48:19,352
There he is, the fat guy we've been
talking about all day, Tubby Tuke,

2312
01:48:19,413 --> 01:48:22,986
actually gaining on the Ethiopians
here in the final stretch.

2313
01:48:23,050 --> 01:48:25,326
Is this the fat guy I put the money on?

2314
01:48:25,386 --> 01:48:27,332
Twenty bucks at 8,000-to-1.

2315
01:48:28,456 --> 01:48:30,060
- A hundred and sixty grand?
- A hundred and sixty grand?

2316
01:48:30,124 --> 01:48:31,626
Come on, you fat shit, move it!

2317
01:48:31,759 --> 01:48:33,295
Go, Tubby! Go, Tubby!

2318
01:48:33,694 --> 01:48:35,196
Keep running! Keep running!

2319
01:48:36,130 --> 01:48:37,871
Pass those Ethiopians!

2320
01:48:38,165 --> 01:48:40,270
Pass them skinny fucking Ethiopians!

2321
01:48:42,336 --> 01:48:45,476
This defies every law of science,
but it's happening!

2322
01:48:49,009 --> 01:48:50,682
Get the fuck up!

2323
01:48:50,744 --> 01:48:52,018
Get the fuck up!

2324
01:48:54,715 --> 01:48:56,353
He's up! He's up! He's up!

2325
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:01,891
- That'll replenish him! That'll replenish him!
- No!

2326
01:49:03,057 --> 01:49:04,536
Listen to the roar of that crowd.

2327
01:49:04,592 --> 01:49:06,071
Fat guy! Fat guy!

2328
01:49:06,127 --> 01:49:07,970
Fat guy! Fat guy!

2329
01:49:08,162 --> 01:49:09,732
Can he possibly win it?

2330
01:49:09,964 --> 01:49:10,999
He's gonna do it!

2331
01:49:13,033 --> 01:49:14,444
Tubby Tuke has won!

2332
01:49:20,941 --> 01:49:23,581
Tubby Tuke wins! Tubby Tuke wins!
