1
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,060
I didn't think she was his type.
-Neither did I.

2
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,900
When did they get together?
-Last weekend.

3
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,180
Where was that?

4
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,980
Jonas said that she gave him a blowjob on the toilet.

5
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,400
Since when are you together after a blowjob?

6
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,380
You're not together after that.

7
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,080
They were already together in the 10th grade or something.
-Yeah.

8
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,240
Who is this about?
-Eva, why?

9
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,480
It's so sick that they got together.

10
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,200
<i>[You look freaking hot in that shirt.]</i>

11
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,520
One of the prettiest girls in Pepsi Max has a boyfriend.

12
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,060
They fall in the same category as the Penetrator-boys.

13
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,800
You guys! I have fantastic news.

14
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,660
Are you ready?
-Say it.

15
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,520
Are you excited?

16
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,240
I have acquired "Brun og Blid" as a sponsor.

17
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,380
What did you say?

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,960
It's Norway's largest tanning salon chain.

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,600
I know what "Brun og Blid" is.

20
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,040
We will not be sponsored by them, no.

21
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,180
Why's that?

22
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,860
Because they contribute to the most speculative
and sexist marketing in Norway.

23
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,860
Have you even seen their commercials?

24
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,700
It's a tanning salon..

25
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,300
.. it's difficult to promote it without
showing tanned bodies.

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,760
Noora, I worked really hard to get them to sponsor us.
You're just being really ungrateful.

27
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,060
Can't you see how difficult it was to persuade them?

28
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,500
So you think we should promote "Brun og Blid"?

29
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,820
And contribute to a completely inhumane body pressure?

30
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,600
I don't feel too much of that body pressure.

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,540
I say we milk those sexist motherfuckers 
for every penny they have!

32
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.. Oh my god, fucking cool.
Go for it.

33
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,780
But then I'm not joining the bus anymore.

34
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,440
Huh? Are you kidding right now?

35
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,200
Noora, oh my god.
Just because things don't go your way?

36
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,920
Now you're being really childish.
 -It's just because I refuse to contribute to that inhumane body pressure.

37
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,180
The logo is this small. Here.

38
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,720
I don't understand how that will 
contribute to body pressure.

39
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,220
Yeah well, whatever.
I give up.

40
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,640
Should we go as a gå-russ then? 
(= graduate not participating in the bus/van activities)

41
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,880
Vilde, it might come as a shock to you..

42
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:18,960
.. but Russebuss is not important to me.
I just wanted to get to know Eva and Sana.

43
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,400
Wow, thanks for that!
-No! You too, Chris.

44
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,780
This discussion isn't over!

45
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,880
Yeah?

46
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,700
Did you eat my pasta?
-No.

47
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,020
Can you ask Eskild to turn down the music?

48
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,320
Eskild!

49
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,780
Eskild!

50
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,580
Sorry!

51
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,280
Noora?

52
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,260
Can you lend me 200 Kroner until Monday?

53
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,560
Yeah, okay.

54
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,280
Hi!
-Hey.

55
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,620
Do you need help?
-No, never.

56
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,220
Hello.
-Hello. What's up?

57
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,420
Netflix. Just Netflix..

58
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,660
Do you have some food?
-Yeah, of course.

59
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:29,260
I didn't have a chance to eat at home.
Too much guy-on-guy BJ action.

60
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,280
No, what the fuck? Your parents, or what?

61
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,080
I live in a shared apartment with roommates.
-Ah, okay.

62
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,160
But I have actually seen my parents
in BJ action.

63
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,500
No way! Seriously?

64
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,400
I would have been scarred for the 
rest of my life.

65
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,080
What did she reply?
-"Come to my house and show me."

66
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,160
Are you kidding?
She is stalling.

67
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
What should I answer, then?

68
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,920
Who is this?
A 00'er Jonas is involved with.

69
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,560
I haven't even kissed her.
-But it's going to happen.

70
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,180
I never want to hook up
with a 00'er!

71
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,880
Then why are you chatting with her?

72
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,260
Because she has a good body.

73
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:31,760
Okay so.. Jonas is flirting with a girl
and you're helping him?

74
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,460
Eh.. yeah.

75
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,500
Wow! How is that working out for you?

76
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,720
We're friends, so it works out just fine.

77
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,620
Okay..

78
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,780
What the fuck? She sent boobs!

79
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,140
Are you kidding?
-No, look!

80
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,680
Hey, you can't show that to us!
-Why not?

81
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,000
Let me see! Screenshot it!

82
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,240
Fucking hell, they are really nice.

83
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:12,040
And she's a 00'er?
I bet she took a screenshot from a magazine or something.

84
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,300
No, I don't think so. She got it to look
like this with a good black and white filter.

85
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,380
I know the tricks. Shit!
Fuck. They are really big!

86
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,480
One is a little higher up than the other.

87
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,620
Now it's your turn. I'm sorry.

88
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,840
Should I go and send stuff to people?

89
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,240
You should send loads of dick pics, of course.

90
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,920
I keep it real.

91
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:48,300
It's not hard to do this.
-But it's hard to take screenshots?

92
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,080
Set it as your background!
What school does she go to?

93
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,500
We should talk about our sponsors.

94
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,240
Because everyone should feel like they 
have a say in the Russebuss.

95
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,720
We are very different girls.
At the same time it's also important that we are strong and independent.

96
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:17,160
But we have to have money.
I suggest a Russebuss meeting on Friday.

97
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,220
Then everyone can talk properly
about the image and the concept.

98
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,440
We'll drink wine and just enjoy ourselves.

99
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,240
It's been so long that it was just us.

100
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,040
For me, we don't really need to do this.

101
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,120
It's not important to me.

102
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,400
I have a party in Elvebakken on Friday, so..

103
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,040
With who?
-With Jonas.

104
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,640
I promised I would go with him.

105
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,660
Come on! We're friends, okay?

106
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,100
Why is it so hard to understand that you
can be friends with your ex?

107
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,820
When you're a couple, it's the same thing as being 
best friends. You just also have sex.

108
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,960
We ended the sex part.
That doesn't mean we can't still be best friends.

109
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,040
Did you hear William beat up someone 
from Hansen this weekend?

110
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,160
Who was it?
-A 98'er. He was properly destroyed.

111
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
He ended up in the emergency room.

112
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,620
Oh my god, so cool!

113
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,220
I think William is very sensitive.

114
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,680
He knows what it's like to lose someone.

115
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,720
I think he's a fuckboy.
-What do you mean by losing someone?

116
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,940
His little sister.

117
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,060
He lost his little sister?
-Yeah, didn't you know?

118
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,660
She's dead.

119
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,420
A dead little sister. It's so tragic.

120
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,960
When did this happen?
-A long time ago.

121
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,700
Something like that really stays with someone.

122
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,740
<i>[I like that you're sitting there looking at me.]</i>

123
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,820
It's' so sad for him. I think that's why
he's a fuckboy.

124
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,520
Because he knows what it's like to lose someone. 
He doesn't want to lose anyone again.

125
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,840
<i>[I'm not looking at you.]</i>
Because he knows what it's like to lose someone. 
He doesn't want to lose anyone again.

126
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:20,880
Because he knows what it's like to lose someone. 
He doesn't want to lose anyone again.

127
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,000
He's really a good guy. I noticed that
during Christmas.

128
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,000
Right, Eva?
-What?

129
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,720
That he's a really good guy.

130
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,340
It seemed like he was really keen.

131
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,400
Why else would he say you were hot?

132
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,480
<i>[You still owe me a date. Friday?]</i>

133
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,040
I actually don't remember what he said to me.
<i>[You still owe me a date. Friday?]</i>

134
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,020
I actually don't remember what he said to me.

135
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,540
Do you?

136
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,000
Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

137
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,520
<i>[Unfortunately, can't on Friday. Got something important.]</i>
Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

138
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,360
Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

139
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,740
<i>[What's that?]</i>
Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

140
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,500
<i>[What's that?]</i>

141
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,820
Then he said: "Whoever gets you, is fucking lucky."
<i>[What's that?]</i>

142
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,100
Then he said: "Whoever gets you, is fucking lucky."

143
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,800
<i>[Buss meeting. Russetiden preparation. 
Most important thing in the world.]</i>
Then he said: "Whoever gets you, is fucking lucky."

144
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,140
"Every guy that gets you is so fucking lucky."

145
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,800
"Remember when I said you weren't good enough?
That was bullshit."

146
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,820
"And every guy that gets you is fucking lucky."

147
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,360
He's totally random though.
He came up to Noora and..

148
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,180
Came up to Noora and then?

149
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,400
Nothing.

150
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,320
Vilde, it's never going to happen between me and William.

151
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,440
He's the most unsympathetic, selfish person
I've ever met.

152
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,900
I would never touch him.

153
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,240
And you shouldn't either.

154
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,160
You don't know him like I do.

155
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,800
If you had just heard him at Chrismtas.

156
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,520
How long can we talk about Christmas? 
It's March!

157
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,160
Just because he came over and apologised, 
because he behaved like an asshole..

158
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,540
.. doesn't mean he's a good person.

159
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,920
And it doesn't mean he's keen on you.

160
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,700
I'm not the one who said he was keen on me.
It was Eva who said that.

161
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,940
I just don't want you to get your hopes up and-

162
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,940
It's from William!

163
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,100
"Penetrator party on Friday. Bring your bus group and come."

164
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,740
Don't we have a bus meeting on Friday?

165
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,680
I thought that wasn't important to you.

166
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,880
I thought it was important to you
to be strong and independent?

167
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,620
Yeah, but I can be strong and independent
at the Penetrator party.

168
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:09,780
So we'll just drop all our plans,
because a guy calls.

169
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,000
Can't we have a bus meeting first,
and then go to the party afterwards?

170
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,000
That's exactly what we'll do.

171
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,860
"We're coming." Heart.. heart?

172
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,800
So then we'll have the bus meeting and the party,
and then you can go to that party with your best friend.

173
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,480
<i>[You lose.]</i>

174
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,340
Eskild!

175
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,020
Eskild!

176
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,700
Do you still need money?

177
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,580
I need help with something.
-500 Kroner.

178
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,600
200 Kroner.
-200 Kroner?

179
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,660
400 Kroner.
-300!

180
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,760
350! Last offer.
-350. Great.

181
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,660
You have to make a move on one of my friends.

182
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,760
Eh, yeah. Okay.

183
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,060
Don't you think I'm gonna set off
some gaydars?

184
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,160
No, oh my god. No stress.
She doesn't even know what gay is.

185
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
She's so naive.

186
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,980
Yeah great, okay.
Whatever.

187
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,360
What do you want me to do?

188
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,420
I'm having a bus party here tomorrow,
and you just walk in randomly.

189
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,420
Is there alcohol for me?

190
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,820
Sure! 
Just be home around 7, okay?

191
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,580
Do I have to make out with her?
-No, no, no. Oh my god.

192
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,220
She just needs some attention.
Just some compliments and stuff.

193
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,740
Because she's crazy obsessed with a guy
who isn't interested in her.

194
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,100
So that's why I need you
to help her forget him.

195
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:15,100
Okay. He'll be forgotten.
-Great!

196
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,080
For 500 Kroner.
-No! I said 350!

197
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,340
If I make out with her,
we'll say 500 Kroner.

198
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,480
You don't need to make out with her!
-For 390 I'll touch her boobs.

199
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,300
350! No making out and no boob touching.

200
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,920
Just a little attention.
-350 and boob stroking.

201
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:43,440
No. 350 and a little attention.
-If it goes well, I can touch her boobs a little.

202
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,400
Oh my god, what the fuck?

203
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,260
It's nothing. Just to know how it feels!

204
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,780
.. with this here.
I thought something like..

205
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,940
Up here it's classy, but here it's a little slutty.

206
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,100
Didn't the bottles break?

207
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,840
A white top is just stressful. If you spill something, it becomes transparent.

208
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,280
Yes..
-Ah you'd like that, don't you?

209
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,140
No Vilde! Take this.
That one was super pretty. Now you have to stop.

210
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,960
I think I'm going to sleep with William tonight.

211
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,760
Don't forget a condom.

212
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,480
Are you going to sleep with Jonas tonight?
No, we're just friends.

213
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,340
<i>[Where are you? Come home NOW!!]</i>

214
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,900
So you guys haven't had sex
after you broke up?
<i>[Where are you? Come home NOW!!]</i>

215
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,980
So you guys haven't had sex
after you broke up?

216
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,200
No, I promise.
Last time we had sex was when we broke up.

217
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,500
That's when you broke up?

218
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm serious, you have to try that once.
Fuck. The best sex I ever had.

219
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,420
It was really amazing.

220
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,500
Shouldn't you be sad after you've broken up?

221
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:55,140
Well yeah, we were. But that was what made
it so hot. So intense.

222
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,320
What?
-Are you sure it happened?

223
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,900
That it wasn't a dream
or a flashback?

224
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,840
Hey guys, can I ask something?

225
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,340
Has anyone ever gone down on you?
-No.

226
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,640
Yeah! Someone went down on me 
in Gran Canaria last summer.

227
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,880
Are you kidding me?
How was it?

228
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
It was fucking nice.

229
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,560
I sat there and just..

230
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,940
Then it couldn't have been very..

231
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,180
I'm really scared William will try
to go down on me.

232
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,600
Vilde, there's no Norwegian guy
who will do it.

233
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,460
It's true, while we suck
dick for dear life.

234
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,820
Snapchat from William!
He's wondering when we're coming.

235
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:54,240
When are you gonna go to Jonas?
-We were supposed to call. I can call him.

236
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,640
<i>[That snapchat to Vilde was
directed towards you.]</i>

237
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,760
Can't we go in half an hour?

238
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,400
<i>[You can't use Vilde this way.]</i>

239
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:10,540
No, oh my god! Now we're going to talk
about image, concept.

240
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,540
That's why we're here. Right?

241
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,560
Yes. What kind of concept would you like?

242
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,080
Jonas' phone is turned off or something.

243
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,440
Hi!
-There you are!

244
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,260
I'm having a bus party tonight.

245
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:46,300
It's nice that you're here. These are my friends.
This is Eskild. He lives with me.

246
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,120
Yeah, hi. Eskild.
Hi. Vilde.

247
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,240
Eva, if you could..
I have some tomatoes..

248
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,540
I'll sit here. Hi.

249
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,720
Here.

250
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:11,760
But eh.. don't you have some wine?
-Yeah!

251
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,700
Oh, Chabli! Hmm.
-From 19.. eh 2010.

252
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,940
Okay. Cheers!
-Cheers!

253
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,760
Noora, what should I do with the tomatoes?
-You have really pretty eyes.

254
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,960
You think so?

255
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,840
You have a lot of eye make-up.

256
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,240
It was Eva who did that.

257
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,340
You shouldn't let her do it. 
She's not really good at it.

258
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,620
You're not a virgin, right?

259
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,580
No I'm not.

260
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,320
Can you see it?
-I might be a little direct now..

261
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:00,280
I can see it from your breasts.
Once you've had sex..

262
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,160
What's wrong with your phone?
Why is it turned off?

263
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,160
Call me when you get this.

264
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,500
This wine is good.
-Hello? Music?

265
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,140
I want to put on some music! 
Which phone is it?

266
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,940
Let's dance!
Yes!

267
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,940
It's Britney, bitch.

268
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,540
It's William! 
Hi?

269
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,840
Yeah..

270
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,860
Okay..

271
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,660
It's William.
He wants to talk to you.

272
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,220
Eh.. To me?

273
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,960
Yeah hello.

274
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,120
I can't stop using Vilde
when you don't answer your phone.

275
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
What is it?

276
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,620
We wouldn't have been in this situation
if you had kept your promise.

277
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,720
No. I don't have his number.

278
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Whose? Maybe I have it.

279
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:12,180
You go on a date with me,
and then I'll stop using Vilde.

280
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,820
Okay?

281
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,400
Okay.
-Good!

282
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,480
Let me speak to Vilde.

283
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,680
He wants to talk to you.

284
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,100
Hi!

285
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,480
What a shame.
Yeah, I understand.

286
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,820
Ok. Bye!

287
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,180
There's no Penetrator party.
-Chris' parents came home.

288
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,120
Can't we come along to your
Elvebakken party?

289
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,820
Jonas doesn't answer. He turned off his phone.
-Can we at least dance and have a party?

290
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,800
Whose number did he want?

291
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,960
<i>[Next Friday. 19.00h. I'll pick you up.]</i>

292
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,160
Aren't you gay?
