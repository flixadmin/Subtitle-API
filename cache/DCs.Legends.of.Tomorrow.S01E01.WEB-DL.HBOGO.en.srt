1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
Please!

2
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,760
<i>Vandal Savage.</i>

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,960
<i>An evil dictator blessed
with immortality.</i>

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,320
<i>He has achieved what no one
in human history ever has.</i>

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,640
<i>He has conquered the entire planet.</i>

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,720
What's your name, son?

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,680
Jonas.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,360
Your mother was brave,
just as your father was foolish.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Which are you?

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,280
So you take after your mother, huh?

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Or not.

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Caesar.

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Hitler.

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,960
Per Degaton.

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,840
Rank amateurs compared to Savage.

16
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,880
{\an5}His forces have already
claimed the lives of billions.

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,720
{\an5}And if we possess
the means to stop him

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,720
{\an5}and again do nothing...

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,240
{\an5}then their blood is on our hands.

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,160
As a Time Master of long standing,

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,360
{\an5}you seem to forget.
Our responsibility

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,240
{\an5}is to protect the timeline,
not humanity.

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,360
{\an5}You wish to engage in the very
sort of manipulation of time

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,720
that we are sworn to prevent.

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,560
{\an5}And yet, if we allow humanity
to perish

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
{\an5}at the hands of evil,
then what universe

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,400
are we custodians of?

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,760
{\an5}What if, in trying
to save the world from Savage,

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,760
{\an5}you make it vulnerable to
another, more terrible despot?

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,280
{\an5}We are not warriors,
Captain Hunter.

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,600
We possess no army.

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,120
And I'm not asking for one.

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
Just a single time ship...

34
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,760
{\an5}and your permission
to change history

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,080
before Vandal Savage
puts an end to it.

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,800
I'm not appealing to you
as Time Masters...

37
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,800
but as humans, please.

38
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,360
{\an5}Grant me the authority
to change the timeline

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,520
just this once.

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,360
{\an5}<i>How did the council meeting go,
Captain Hunter?</i>

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,040
Exactly as expected, Gideon.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,800
{\an5}<i>- So we are proceeding?</i>
- Indeed.

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,920
{\an5}Prepare the Waverider for takeoff.

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
Set a course.

45
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
United States.

46
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,200
Star City. January, 2016.

47
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,800
<i>The early second millennium A.D.</i>

48
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,240
<i>The golden age of gasoline engines,</i>

49
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
<i>online pornography,</i>

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,680
<i>and those silly little smartphones.</i>

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,320
<i>What are we going to retrieve,
Captain?</i>

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,560
Oh, not what.

53
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Who.

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,640
I need you to pull up some files,
Gideon.

55
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
The eight men and women
who'll be joining us

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,680
on our little crusade.

57
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,400
<i>You usually prefer
to work alone, Captain.</i>

58
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,840
This time, I'll need a team.

59
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,160
<i>First recruit, Dr. Raymond Palmer.</i>

60
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,000
<i>Also known as the Atom.</i>

61
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,160
This feels good,
being back in the field.

62
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,280
Not that this is a field, but...

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Ray, are you up for this?

64
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,240
<i>Oh, too late to turn back now.</i>

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,800
Huh. Someone removed
the central processing unit.

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
<i>Are you sure?</i>

67
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,640
I designed the computer's CPU,
so, yeah, pretty sure.

68
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,600
Well, HIVE would only
remove it if they knew...

69
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,840
You had me shrink down and fly
into their secret computer lab?

70
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,600
My night's about to get
a whole lot worse, isn't it?

71
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,320
Oh, you can take them.

72
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,560
They have guns.

73
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,720
You have a super-suit.

74
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
<i>It's time to start growing.</i>

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
This is gonna get a little rough.

76
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,080
Oh, I am not one of your adversaries.

77
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,720
<i>Next recruit, Sara Lance.</i>

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,640
<i>Former member of the League
of Assassins, also formerly dead.</i>

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,800
Miss Lance?

80
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,240
Join me for a drink?

81
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,920
I have come quite a long way
to meet you.

82
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
{\an5}<i>Firestorm, the merged super-form</i>

83
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,440
{\an5}<i>of one Jefferson Jackson
and Professor Martin Stein.</i>

84
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,880
<i>Caution, Jefferson,
83 percent of the chemicals</i>

85
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,440
<i>in this factory are combustible.</i>

86
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,080
Yeah? Tell that to Rambo.

87
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,440
<i>Thought I told you to be careful.</i>

88
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,040
What's the use of sharing
my intelligence if you won't listen?

89
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,200
Stop bossing me around

90
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,760
like I'm one of your
snot-nosed undergrads.

91
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,440
- Excuse me.
- Who are you?

92
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,120
{\an5}<i>Kendra Saunders and Carter Hall.</i>

93
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,400
{\an5}<i>The latest reincarnations
of Hawkman and Hawkgirl.</i>

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
Kendra.

95
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,520
- You, my love, almost got us killed.
- Thank you.

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Your flying is still clumsy

97
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,040
- like a bird just out of the nest...
- Well maybe that's because

98
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,840
up until two months ago,
I was a barista,

99
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,640
not some damn winged
demi-goddess.

100
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,520
Have you two considered
couples counseling?

101
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,840
I hear it's quite popular
in this century.

102
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,200
{\an5}<i>There seems to be an error, Captain.</i>

103
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,480
{\an5}<i>These candidates,
Leonard Snart and Mick Rory,</i>

104
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,640
<i>are a pair of criminals.</i>

105
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,680
- There's no error, Gideon.
- Drop your weapons!

106
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,960
Oh, fry, you little piggies!

107
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,600
A minivan?

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,720
Really, Snart?

109
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
Cops'll never hassle a dad

110
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
buying diapers
in the middle of the night.

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
- What the...
- Watch it!

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
What a headache!

113
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Stein?

114
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,440
What the hell are you doing here?

115
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,840
I'm as ignorant as you, for once.

116
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,400
Where are we?

117
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,160
{\an5}Why don't you ask the dude who
knocked us out and kidnapped us?

118
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,920
British dude with a flashy thing?

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,880
{\an5}- Ring any bells?
- The name's Rip Hunter.

120
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,320
I'm from East London.

121
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,280
Oh, and the future.

122
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,640
Nice to meet you, Rip.

123
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,680
Oh, while you were incapacitated

124
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,800
{\an5}I may have tampered
with your weapons.

125
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,640
I've assembled you all
because I need your help.

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,400
The future of the world is in peril

127
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,760
because of a man by the name

128
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,800
of Vandal Savage.

129
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
That can't be.

130
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,160
We destroyed him.

131
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,520
Yeah, the Green Arrow
and Flash helped us do it.

132
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,880
And therein lay the problem.

133
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,200
Unless you or Mr. Hall
deliver the death blow,

134
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,520
Savage can be restored
from but a single cell.

135
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,360
What the hell are you talking about?

136
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,640
{\an5}Vandal is immortal.
Kendra and I reincarnate.

137
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,680
Yeah, I've done that.

138
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,960
{\an5}And what the hell does
this Randall guy got to do with us?

139
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Vandal.

140
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,360
In the future, he will employ

141
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,200
the evil he's perfected over
his long life

142
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,080
and the power he has amassed
throughout history

143
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,160
to finally... conquer the world.

144
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,440
I've been tasked with assembling
an elite team to stop him.

145
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,760
- How?
- To travel through time.

146
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,560
To capture Savage
before he grows into

147
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,680
the monster he becomes.

148
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
You got the wrong guy.

149
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,920
- "Hero" ain't on my resume.
- Or mine.

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,520
I know it's difficult
for you to fathom.

151
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,720
But where... when I'm from...

152
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
the year 2166,

153
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,800
you and everyone on this roof

154
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,600
aren't just considered heroes...

155
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
You're legends.

156
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,120
Legends?

157
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,120
I... I hate to nitpick

158
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,760
but doesn't a legend have to be dead?

159
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,080
Yeah, see, that's a
deal breaker for me.

160
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,200
So I'm gonna pass.

161
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,360
It's dangerous for any of you

162
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,680
to know too much
about your own futures.

163
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,800
But I am here because each of you

164
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,920
as individuals,
is destined for greatness.

165
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,760
I could get behind that.

166
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,080
And, because if you don't follow me,

167
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,200
this is what is in store
for your world

168
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,040
150 years from now.

169
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,000
I could have chosen
any time and any place.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,560
Of all the people who ever lived,

171
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,200
I chose you eight.

172
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,880
I certainly hope
that you won't let me...

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,440
and the world, down.

174
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,520
If your answer is yes, meet
me at this address in 36 hours.

175
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
- I had that.
- I know.

176
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,000
It's fun to watch you kick and punch
and skewer bad guys, but...

177
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,320
I need a minute of your time.

178
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,560
I'm sure Captain Hunter
will return me

179
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
to the moment I left. But I thought

180
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,960
you know, just in case, someone
should I know I was gone.

181
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,280
We went up against Savage.

182
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,880
He does not go down easy.

183
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,120
That's why Hunter's recruited a team.

184
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,640
A team that includes
Leonard Snart and Mick Rory.

185
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,840
So, what do you know
about Captain Hunter?

186
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,040
He's a Time Master
from the 22nd century.

187
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
It's a little hard to Google.

188
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,280
So you know nothing...

189
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,920
and yet you trust him?

190
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,360
I'm as trusting as you are cynical.

191
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,520
Well, I'm cynical

192
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,800
and it's difficult for me
to trust anyone.

193
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,280
But that has kept me alive.

194
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
I died once.

195
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,600
At least, the world thought I did.

196
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
You know what happened?

197
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
Nothing.

198
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,360
All the money, all the buildings,

199
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,520
all the inventions...

200
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
the world didn't care.

201
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,200
My life, ultimately, didn't matter.

202
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,760
Rip is giving me the chance
to help save the world.

203
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
I have to take it.

204
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Keep your head on a swivel
while you're at it.

205
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,080
206 times.

206
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,640
Savage has killed both of us
206 times!

207
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,880
Yeah, and I'm not too eager
about making it 207.

208
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,160
So what?

209
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,320
You just going to run away?

210
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,640
We've tried that before.

211
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,760
Look, I know you don't remember
your past lives yet.

212
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,240
But I remember so much of it.

213
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,000
God, if you only knew
how I loved you

214
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
and how much...

215
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,040
How much it hurt every time
he took you away from me.

216
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,600
Have you ever stopped to think

217
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,560
that maybe, just maybe,
we can't actually beat him?

218
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,400
But this time, we wouldn't
be facing him alone.

219
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,400
And, we almost defeated him
with help before.

220
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
Yeah, almost.

221
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,160
Kendra, this is our best chance

222
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,400
to stop him forever.

223
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,440
The woman I've loved for millennia
wouldn't be scared of it.

224
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
Look.

225
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,080
Past lives we'd fight, argue.

226
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,400
A lot.

227
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,880
But, we'd settle matters as warriors.

228
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
What?

229
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,160
Like I beat you...

230
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,040
and you give up this plan
to follow Hunter?

231
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah. Except you won't be able
to beat me.

232
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,800
But you can absolutely try.

233
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,640
Winner gets to decide, little lady.

234
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,640
I remember when you told
Mom and Dad

235
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,240
that you wanted to go to
sleep away camp.

236
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,040
This'll be a little different.

237
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Time travel.

238
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,320
I can't believe we're talking
about it like it's something real.

239
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
I know.

240
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
I think you should go.

241
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,840
Laurel, I died.

242
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,080
I'm still picking up those pieces.

243
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,840
The Lazarus Pit brought me back

244
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,720
but it left me with this...

245
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,800
need to take.

246
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
To kill.

247
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,840
I'm dangerous.

248
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,440
After you died,

249
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,280
I needed a channel for my grief.

250
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,440
I found it in becoming
the Black Canary.

251
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,360
I found it in you.

252
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,160
For me, being the Canary
was never that positive.

253
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,200
Then don't be the Canary.

254
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,280
Do what Oliver's been doing.

255
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,200
Do what this Rip Hunter
is offering you

256
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,560
the chance to do and...

257
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,640
Be a hero in the light.

258
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,040
Be the White Canary.

259
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,960
Where did you get this?

260
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,480
I have a resourceful friend
named Cisco.

261
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,960
Where's the mask?

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,080
You don't need it anymore.

263
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,600
You've lived in the shadows
long enough.

264
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,960
I can't believe you're thinking of
hooking up with the Englishman.

265
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,120
We're thieves. Crooks. Criminals.

266
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,040
I have no desire to save the world.

267
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,400
Especially a hundred years
after I'm dead.

268
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,880
He said across time, Mick.
What about the years before?

269
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,160
Before fingerprints
and surveillance cameras

270
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,360
and DNA analysis.

271
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,000
Why did we become criminals?

272
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,480
Because we hate working
and we love money.

273
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,160
We could steal the Mona Lisa
straight off Da Vinci's easel.

274
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,960
Snatch the Hope Diamond
before it was discovered.

275
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,600
This is everything we got into
thieving for in the first place.

276
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,720
More than everything.

277
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,800
You want me in? I'm in.

278
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,480
But I'm not gonna be anyone's hero.

279
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,480
Jefferson, it's imperative
we remain together

280
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,920
for our powers to work.

281
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
In case you haven't noticed,

282
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,720
I'm still getting used
to the whole powers thing.

283
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,560
And now that's you're adding
time travel to the mix...

284
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,840
Do you have any idea
what an extraordinary

285
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,360
opportunity we've been given?

286
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,960
A chance to get murdered
by an immortal psychopath.

287
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,280
No thanks.

288
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,120
Look, I'm a 20-year-old
auto mechanic.

289
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,000
The world is better off without
me trying to save it.

290
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,880
I don't understand your decision.

291
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,520
But, I respect it.

292
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,480
Perhaps I can persuade Mr. Hunter

293
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,280
that he needs my knowledge
as a physicist

294
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,560
and not my abilities as Firestorm.

295
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,640
So I propose we have a toast...

296
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,360
to my grand and solo adventure.

297
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,160
To saving the world.

298
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Knock yourself out.

299
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,640
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

300
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
Professor!

301
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,280
This is the place.

302
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,480
I think we're being punked.

303
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,560
- Do people still say "punked"?
- No.

304
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,200
I see your buddy threw himself
a going away party.

305
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,200
Yes, I believe he drank something

306
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,120
that didn't quite agree with him.

307
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,360
You don't look too happy
to be here.

308
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,640
Perceptive.

309
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,560
Well, I see you've all decided
to come.

310
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,000
Well then, we can be on our way.

311
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,520
I ain't footing it anywhere.

312
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,240
A Time Master's sacred charge

313
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,760
is to do no harm to the timeline.

314
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,160
Can you imagine what a time ship
would look like

315
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,080
in, say, Victorian England?

316
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,960
Holographic indigenous
camouflage projection.

317
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Indeed.

318
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,520
It's called the Waverider.

319
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,120
It's been my ship for over a decade.

320
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Shall we?

321
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,960
Excuse me, would you mind?

322
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Thank you.

323
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,280
I bet it uses ionic propulsion.

324
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,440
I doubt that very much,

325
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,480
given that even advanced technology

326
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,960
wouldn't be able to sustain
an ionic reaction.

327
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,120
It's possible if you stabilize
the quantum flux.

328
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,160
You know, we actually covered
this before, Professor Stein,

329
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,520
when I was your student,
many moons ago?

330
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,000
Perhaps you remember my paper
on subspace field mechanics?

331
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,240
I don't remember you, Mr. Palmer.

332
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,920
Whatever you roofied him with,
I'd like some.

333
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,160
I did not roofie him.

334
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,400
Oh, I ain't judging.

335
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,320
I have never seen anything
like this before.

336
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,960
Neither have I. And considering

337
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,280
I have 4,000 years
worth of memories,

338
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,480
that's saying something.

339
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,400
How does a vessel of this size
function without a crew?

340
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,680
I don't need one.

341
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
I have Gideon.

342
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,040
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

343
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,280
<i>I am Gideon.</i>

344
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
<i>An interactive
artificial consciousness</i>

345
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,200
<i>programmed to operate
this vessel's critical systems</i>

346
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,080
<i>and aid Captain Hunter
in his mission.</i>

347
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,280
Captain?

348
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,920
Gideon's been working on
helping me locate Vandal Savage.

349
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,080
I thought you said he's pretty
active in the 22nd century.

350
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,320
Perhaps engaging Savage
at the height of his powers

351
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,520
isn't the best strategy.

352
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Indeed.

353
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,480
Unfortunately, Savage
has kept his movements

354
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,640
hidden throughout history.

355
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,960
Not even Gideon can determine

356
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,240
where or when we can find him.

357
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,920
But, I have the next best thing.

358
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
The man who can.

359
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,600
Professor Aldus Boardman.

360
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,960
Professor Boardman is the
world's leading well, only...

361
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,160
expert on Vandal Savage.

362
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,960
We're gonna pay him a little visit.

363
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,480
<i>Course plotted
for St. Roch, New Orleans.</i>

364
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,920
- St. Roch?
- <i>October 17, 1975.</i>

365
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,680
I suggest you
all strap yourselves in.

366
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,080
Temporal navigation isn't
something one wants to be

367
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,200
standing up for.

368
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,960
Time travel.

369
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
Cool.

370
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,600
Some of you may experience
some slight discomfort.

371
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,920
In very rare instances,
there will be some...

372
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,360
bleeding from the eyeballs.

373
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,560
I'm sorry, what?

374
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,840
The human body is used
to time unfolding linearly.

375
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,280
Jackson, I'm so glad you're awake.

376
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,560
I didn't want you to miss this.

377
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,840
Miss what?

378
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,160
What the...

379
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,800
Oh, no. I wouldn't unfasten
those if I were you.

380
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,640
Get me off this...
whatever this thing is!

381
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,440
Good luck explaining this.

382
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,920
I did him a favor.

383
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,880
He doesn't look all that grateful.

384
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,920
Just hang on and remain calm.

385
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,120
All your worlds are about to change.

386
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,440
Seriously.

387
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,560
- That was insanity!
- God!

388
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,960
That is some serious
Darth Vader going on there.

389
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,400
Chronos to Command.

390
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,720
I am closing in
on Captain Hunter's position.

391
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Hey, what you doing there, bro?

392
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,680
I am determining whether you
are integral to the timeline.

393
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,800
Okay.

394
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
You are not.

395
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,040
Oh, I should have mentioned it
before.

396
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,880
Nausea is one of the
side effects of time travel,

397
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
along with...

398
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Vertigo.

399
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
I can't see.

400
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,880
And temporary blindness.

401
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,120
Oh, it should only last a minute.

402
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,640
After all, that was a mere jaunt.

403
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,000
The further back in time you go,
the worse the side effects.

404
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,320
- Better?
- It's all relative.

405
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,440
Good.

406
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,280
I can't believe you kidnapped me.

407
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,520
- Hey, I want to go home.
- Good news, then.

408
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,960
2016 will be around in 41 years.

409
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,920
Now, you three, feel free
to make yourselves comfortable

410
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,680
back here on the ship,
while the rest of you

411
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,440
are coming with me to find
Professor Boardman.

412
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

413
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,560
- You're benching us?
- I thought we were a team.

414
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,600
This mission doesn't require
your particular skill set.

415
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Yet.

416
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,840
Meaning you don't need anyone
killed, maimed, or robbed.

417
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,160
Precisely.

418
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,360
Sure it's a good idea
to leave these two

419
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,920
unsupervised on a time machine?

420
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,360
Hey, haircut.

421
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,280
Deafness wasn't
one of the side effects.

422
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
We better hurry up.

423
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,080
Professor Boardman will die
in less than 24 hours.

424
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,520
What's the point in cutting it
so close?

425
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,800
Because if he's destined to die,

426
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,760
then he doesn't have a timeline
for us to disrupt

427
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,240
and his impact on the future
will be minimal.

428
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,440
How brilliant.

429
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,920
And depressing.

430
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,040
How does he die?

431
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Oh, he's found dead in his university

432
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,440
from unknown causes.

433
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Come on.

434
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,160
- Are you coming?
- I'll stay put.

435
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,920
You'd rather stay with them?

436
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,480
They didn't drug me.

437
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Point taken.

438
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,640
This is unbelievable, 1975.

439
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,960
Imagine all the wondrous
applications of this technology.

440
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,480
A chance to witness
the construction of the pyramids,

441
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,040
the end of the dinosaurs.

442
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,240
I've never been to 1975.

443
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,520
It's rather colorful.

444
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,120
So, where can we find
Professor Boardman?

445
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
In his lecture hall.

446
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,680
<i>No matter who you are</i>

447
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,880
<i>Shining bright to see</i>

448
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,520
<i>What you can truly be</i>

449
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
<i>You're a shining star</i>

450
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,760
Oh, man. We're too late.

451
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,160
This is... I'm... I'm sorry.

452
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
You.

453
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,880
Both of you.

454
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,200
You know who we are?

455
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,840
I've been studying you my whole life.

456
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,720
Ever since, as a child

457
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,120
I first heard the story of Chay-Ara,

458
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,160
High Priestess of Horus,
the Hawk God,

459
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,440
and her lover, Price Khufu.

460
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,360
I hoped and prayed
this day might come.

461
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,160
Well, then, looks like
we've come to the right place.

462
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,520
I'm sorry. Who are you?

463
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,280
A fellow historian,

464
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,240
here to discuss another passion
of yours...

465
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,920
Vandal Savage.

466
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,840
There's no way of telling your story

467
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,520
without telling his also.

468
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
<i>Okay...</i>

469
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,360
Why does this stupid station
play nothing but reruns?

470
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,520
Don't even bother trying to explain.

471
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,360
Am I the only one on this ship
who could really use a drink?

472
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,240
I say we go get weird in the '70s.

473
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,800
Excellent idea.

474
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,360
I got the perfect outfit.

475
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,960
<i>Perhaps Captain Hunter
was unclear</i>

476
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,240
<i>with his instructions
to remain onboard.</i>

477
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,360
Shut it, metal mouth.

478
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,560
Oh, you're not quite ready
to run with this crew.

479
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Sorry, kid.

480
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,240
Wait, you're just gonna
leave me here?

481
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,720
I said I'd take care of you.

482
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,360
4,000 years ago...

483
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,800
Vandal Savage
was an Egyptian priest

484
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,480
secretly in love with a priestess.

485
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,880
You.

486
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Or, rather...

487
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,440
you in your first life.

488
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,280
But you were in love with another.

489
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,520
Prince Khufu.

490
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,920
Savage, or Hath-Set as he
was then known,

491
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,120
learned of the affair and was
consumed with jealous rage.

492
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,680
You believe me yet?

493
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,040
Which drove him to murder you both.

494
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,840
And prayed for the hawk god, Horus,

495
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,800
to damn the objects of his hate
for all eternity.

496
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,520
But Chay-Ara had a prayer of her own.

497
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
That Horus would protect them
forever.

498
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,560
But another life was bound
to theirs by accident.

499
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,760
Savage's.

500
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,800
That's why he wants us both dead.

501
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,440
My theory is that the three of you

502
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,840
were exposed to the same
radiation by the meteorites.

503
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,360
We all share the same power.

504
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,480
And every time he kills you,
it passes to him.

505
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,640
That's what maintains
his immortality.

506
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,080
That's impossible.

507
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,480
Unless the meteorites
contained a mutative element.

508
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,400
Like the particle accelerator
that caused your powers.

509
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,120
But without evidence,
you're asking us

510
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,280
to take you at your word?

511
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,480
It's not my word.

512
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
It's theirs.

513
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,000
But you still don't remember me,
do you?

514
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,720
We knew you in our past lives.

515
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,040
You've told me your entire story,

516
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,080
stretching back through the ages.

517
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,520
But when I first knew you,

518
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,920
it was after World War I

519
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,600
and your names were Joe and Edith.

520
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,680
Edith Boardman.

521
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,320
Wait, I... we were related?

522
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,400
I don't remember you. I'm so sorry.

523
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,720
Don't be.

524
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,000
You always warned me
that if I ran into you

525
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,360
in your next life,

526
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,040
you might have forgotten me.

527
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,600
That's us at the World's Fair.

528
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,440
You're just as beautiful
as I remember you.

529
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Mother.

530
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,640
How old were you when...

531
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,880
You two were murdered?

532
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
Ten.

533
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,280
My whole life, you taught me
to be careful.

534
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,400
To keep moving,

535
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,280
always one step ahead of Savage.

536
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,640
But after tracking you
for 4,000 years,

537
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,800
he'd gotten good.

538
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
He found us
in the middle of the night

539
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,600
at a fleabag motel in North Carolina.

540
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,400
You hid me in the closet,

541
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,960
made me promise
that no matter what I heard,

542
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,800
I'd stay put.

543
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
And I did.

544
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,840
Sorry to interrupt your family time

545
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,400
but we were hoping you could
tell us a bit more

546
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,560
where to locate
Savage's present whereabouts.

547
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,160
He hides in the shadows,

548
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,120
never drawing too much attention.

549
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,960
But every lifetime,

550
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,360
placing himself near
the seat of power,

551
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,360
sowing seeds of destruction.

552
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,880
Who remembers
the name of the man

553
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,240
who whispered in the ear
of Gavrilo Princip,

554
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,920
and convinced him to start
World War I?

555
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,080
Why? What does he get out of that?

556
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,240
The more the world is focused
on destroying itself,

557
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,840
the less it notices an immortal
psychopath in its midst.

558
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,960
With the ultimate goal
of subjugating the entire planet.

559
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,920
He killed your parents,
Professor Boardman.

560
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,200
Something tells me you know
where to locate Vandal Savage.

561
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,240
I have an educated guess.

562
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,880
Dollar beers.

563
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
You got to love the '70s.

564
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,160
Who wants to listen to some
Captain and Tennille?

565
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,360
My mother played it.

566
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
A lot.

567
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,600
Wow, you guys are really far out.

568
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,080
- You want to dance, Leonard?
- You go right ahead.

569
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,240
I'll watch.

570
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,560
<i>- Love will keep us together</i>
- Suit yourself.

571
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,560
<i>Think of me, babe, whenever</i>

572
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,840
<i>Some sweet talking girl comes along</i>

573
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,040
Can I help you?

574
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,160
How about you join me
in the parking lot?

575
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,120
Tempting, but you're not my type.

576
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,600
But your lady, on the other hand,

577
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,640
well, she looks just my speed.

578
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,600
Maybe you didn't understand
my request, bitch.

579
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,880
Son of a...

580
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,080
I got this.

581
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,840
<i>You belong to me now</i>

582
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,560
<i>Ain't gonna set you free now</i>

583
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,040
<i>When those girls start hanging around</i>

584
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,600
<i>Talking me down</i>

585
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,800
<i>Hear with your heart
And you won't hear a sound</i>

586
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,480
Now I could stand for a little help.

587
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,720
<i>'Cause I really love you</i>

588
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,480
<i>Stop, I'll be thinking of you</i>

589
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,360
<i>Look in my heart and let</i>

590
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,440
<i>Love keep us together</i>

591
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,920
<i>Whatever</i>

592
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,640
I love the '70s.

593
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,160
Gideon. That is your name, right?

594
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,600
<i>How may I help you?</i>

595
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,040
I assume this ship has a,
autopilot or something?

596
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,080
<i>- You assume correctly.</i>
- Great.

597
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,560
In that case, I'm a need you
to take me back to 2016.

598
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,960
See, me being here?
It's all a big mistake.

599
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,280
<i>Captain Hunter told me
you'd try to do this.</i>

600
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,440
<i>And he also told me not to
listen to anything you say.</i>

601
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,320
Well, you are a computer.

602
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,480
You have to listen to me!

603
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,040
<i>You seem overwrought,
Mr. Jackson.</i>

604
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,400
<i>If you'd like to go to the MedBay,</i>

605
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,720
<i>I'd be happy
to prescribe you a sedative.</i>

606
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,960
I do not need another roofie!

607
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,160
What was that?

608
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,440
<i>A thermite grenade.</i>

609
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,240
<i>It seems someone is trying
to breach the hull.</i>

610
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,160
<i>His name is Chronos.</i>

611
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,800
<i>He's a temporal bounty hunter.</i>

612
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,920
<i>The ship is taking heavy fire.</i>

613
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I know!

614
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,760
Aren't we supposed to be
invisible or something?

615
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,680
You need to get us
out of here now!

616
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,840
A lifetime of research
on Vandal Savage

617
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,360
that all points in this direction.

618
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,000
This should help you find him

619
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,800
and the vengeance that has
eluded me all these years.

620
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,040
Jefferson... Something's
happening to Jefferson!

621
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,240
We seem to have a little
problem back at the vessel.

622
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,040
There's an intruder.
We really must be going now.

623
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,840
Thank you for everything.

624
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,920
Wait.

625
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
We can't just leave him here.

626
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,680
We have to get back now.

627
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,320
You said he's going to die
in 24 hours.

628
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
And we can stop it.

629
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,720
Are either of you a Time Master?

630
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,400
I didn't think so.

631
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,920
I've spent years studying
the implications

632
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,240
of chronological alteration.

633
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Good for you...

634
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,560
but we're not going anywhere

635
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,960
unless our son's coming with us.

636
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,760
Why is Chronos attacking us?

637
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,280
<i>Perhaps Captain Hunter
is best suited to answer that query.</i>

638
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,080
Fire photon torpedoes
or something!

639
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,600
<i>Only Captain Hunter is authorized.</i>

640
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,080
Where is Captain Hunter?

641
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,760
Dr. Palmer, please tell me...

642
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,600
I didn't leave my exo-suit
on the ship?

643
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,160
Okay, but I'd be lying.

644
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,680
Who the hell is this guy?

645
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,040
Is that a laser gun?

646
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,840
Got to get back to the ship
and bond with Jefferson.

647
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
Cover me!

648
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Cover me too.

649
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,760
Oh, you crazy old man.

650
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,000
Thank you, Mr. Palmer.

651
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,600
Seriously? It's Dr. Palmer.

652
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,880
Get down!

653
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,160
We need to merge!

654
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,600
We go out for one lousy drink

655
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,560
and you guys somehow manage
to pick a fight with Boba Fett.

656
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,120
- Aldus!
- We'll get you out of here!

657
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
You're doing good.

658
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,280
<i>Professor Boardman has sustained
severe internal injuries.</i>

659
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,040
Prepare the MedBay to receive
Professor Boardman

660
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
and get us out of here!

661
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
<i>Course heading?</i>

662
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Anywhere but here!

663
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,200
<i>Our cloaking shield and aft entrance</i>

664
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,120
<i>have been significantly
compromised, Captain.</i>

665
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,800
Yes, I can see that, Gideon.

666
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,360
Station us in the temporal zone
while I work on repairs.

667
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
Temporal zone?

668
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,680
Yeah, it's essentially a time limbo.

669
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,800
We can hide out there for a bit.

670
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,320
Another temporal jump would risk
revealing our position.

671
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,040
A time limbo? Astonishing.

672
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,080
Oh, there's something you people
don't know about time travel?

673
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,200
That's surprising, isn't it?

674
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,200
Considering none of you have
ever time traveled before.

675
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,200
Bringing a family member
from the past onto a time ship?

676
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,480
Breaking out and carousing
around the 1970s?

677
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
We've barely begun,
and already this is the worst,

678
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,760
unmitigated disaster of my career.

679
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,080
I see why you got the hots
for that one.

680
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
My son is hurt because of you.

681
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,200
Who attacked us?

682
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,320
Something of a long story.

683
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,680
Better tell it fast, Rip,
'cause it doesn't look like

684
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,280
the lady's in a patient mood.

685
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,240
Neither am I.

686
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,240
His name is Chronos.

687
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,400
He works for
the Council of Time Masters.

688
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,880
My former employers.

689
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,960
I thought you were a Time Master.

690
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,360
As I've expressed,
time's not a linear thing.

691
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,320
At some point I was, in fact,
a Time Master.

692
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,640
Will you people please
stop hitting me?

693
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,120
Start telling the truth!

694
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,640
I relinquished my position
as a Time Master

695
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,000
when I commandeered the Waverider.

696
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,840
Chronos was clearly sent
to bring me in.

697
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,480
- You lied to us.
- Of course I lied to you.

698
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,000
I needed your help you all
barely said yes as it was.

699
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,320
What about the "legends" part?

700
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,320
Oh, you lied about that too,
didn't you?

701
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,880
I chose you all because
a hundred years from now,

702
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,840
your lives have minimal effect
on the recorded timeline.

703
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,160
I needed your help without
disturbing the history of 2166.

704
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,120
So, we're
like the opposite of legends.

705
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,720
Give me one good reason
why we shouldn't kill you.

706
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,360
Ditto the arsonist.

707
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,760
Because Gideon wouldn't
listen to your commands

708
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,320
and you'd be stuck here forever.

709
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
Great. So we're not
an elite team of heroes

710
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,120
on a sanctioned mission,
sent to rid the future

711
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,360
of its most horrific bad guy.

712
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,640
Just a collection of nobodies

713
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,400
who time really doesn't
give a damn about.

714
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,480
I didn't lie
about the mission itself.

715
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,840
Or the brutality
and ruthlessness of Savage.

716
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,200
Or my need for your help.

717
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,680
I don't imagine
you're the kind of guy

718
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,120
who quits his job
and takes on this kind of threat

719
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,760
for altruistic reasons.

720
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,280
So Rip, why don't you tell us?

721
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,800
What did Vandal Savage
do to you?

722
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,440
The Time Masters discourage marriage.

723
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,960
They urge against procreation
even more.

724
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,440
A Time Master should be free
of any personal entanglements

725
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,040
that might compromise him.

726
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
But...

727
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,520
I fell in love

728
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,240
and we had a child.

729
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
A boy.

730
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
Jonas.

731
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,360
Savage killed your family.

732
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,160
He slaughtered my family.

733
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,400
And thousands of other families.

734
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
And that body that I swore
an oath to serve

735
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,280
turned a blind eye.

736
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,400
They continue to turn a blind eye.

737
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,840
I won't.

738
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,680
The last thing that my child
saw in this world

739
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,040
was that monster's face.

740
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,000
You can be damn well sure
that when Savage dies,

741
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,560
the last face he sees will be mine.

742
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,400
I understand,
given the circumstances,

743
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,680
if you wish to return home.

744
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,360
We can make the jump
once the repairs are done,

745
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,400
if and when
Professor Boardman stabilizes.

746
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
I think we all need a little time

747
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,080
to consider our options.

748
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,800
Just get some rest.

749
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,520
There's something
I've wanted you to have.

750
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,840
It's around my neck.

751
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,800
It was my mother's.

752
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Yours.

753
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,680
It's beautiful.

754
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,240
I remember it.

755
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Thank you.

756
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,600
Rip wouldn't have allowed me
to bring Aldus onboard

757
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,840
- if you hadn't said so...
- Of course.

758
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
Chay-Ara...

759
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,120
sorry.

760
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Kendra.

761
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,880
No, it's okay.

762
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,920
Chay-Ara is fine.

763
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,280
Seems an apology is in order.

764
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,080
What I did was wrong.

765
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,520
I should never have forced
you to come along.

766
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,000
But, for me, the opportunity

767
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,520
to travel through time...

768
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,840
see the mysteries
of the universe revealed,

769
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,120
notions I've spent my whole
life studying...

770
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,560
Please do not geek out on
quantum physics right now.

771
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,400
Mr. Hunter was offering
grand adventure.

772
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,320
And at my age, you never know

773
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,760
how many adventures
you have left.

774
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,040
Hey...

775
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,200
I saw your 40-yard dash onto the ship

776
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,440
with that Chronos guy
shooting at you.

777
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,440
I think you got plenty
of adventures left.

778
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,400
Yes, perhaps you're right.

779
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,880
Back home. As Firestorm.

780
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,760
What if I don't want to go home?

781
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,920
Yet, I mean.

782
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,000
Why the change of heart?

783
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,160
You ever play football?

784
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,960
Yeah, I didn't think so.

785
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,200
Anyway... the best feeling

786
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,840
I ever got from being on the field

787
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,400
wasn't when I made a great play

788
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,840
or we won some game.

789
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,040
It was when one of my teammates
took a tackle for me

790
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,240
and I knew they were gonna
make sure I was safe,

791
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,480
that nobody got to me.

792
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,120
Watching all of you rush back
to the ship,

793
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,000
even those two knuckleheads,

794
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,320
to take on Chronos?

795
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,920
Made me feel the same way.

796
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,200
I like being part of a team, man.

797
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Me too.

798
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,400
Watch it!

799
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
Sorry.

800
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Sorry.

801
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,640
What's the point of us even
giving this a second thought?

802
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,760
Rip has already seen the future.

803
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,960
He knows exactly what's in store
for each of us.

804
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,560
Might as well have stayed dead,

805
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,200
'cause the world doesn't need
any of us.

806
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,600
You're just a lost assassin.

807
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,640
You're just a pair
of good-for-nothing criminals.

808
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,360
I can live with that.

809
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,040
Well, I can't.

810
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,960
Can't live with somebody
putting a cap on my destiny.

811
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Spent my whole life
working to be something greater

812
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,160
by becoming something smaller.

813
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,200
Then, some guy
comes along and tells me

814
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,200
that being the Atom
is as insignificant

815
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,400
as an actual atom.

816
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,600
That's not what he said.

817
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Rip said that in his future

818
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,800
we're nobodies.

819
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,480
But this mission
is about changing the future.

820
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,920
I mean, if we have the power
to change the world...

821
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,040
don't you think we have
the power to change our own fate?

822
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,320
For better or for worse.

823
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,720
That's a very good point.

824
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
What do you think, Gideon?

825
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,840
<i>I calculate
a less than six percent likelihood</i>

826
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,520
<i>that they decide
to go on with the mission.</i>

827
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,840
I meant about the repairs.

828
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,920
<i>And there has been another
unfortunate consequence</i>

829
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,080
<i>of Chronos's attack.</i>

830
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,760
<i>- Care to hear about it?</i>
- Not really.

831
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,640
He's gone.

832
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,600
Our son... or, our son
from our previous life.

833
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,040
It's all too confusing.

834
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,240
I'm very sorry.

835
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,960
Actually, you don't
get the blame for this.

836
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,080
This was my fault.

837
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,760
If I hadn't insisted
on bringing him back here,

838
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,160
he might have died peacefully,
in his sleep maybe.

839
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,440
Don't torture yourself
with recriminations.

840
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,760
One of the great lessons
of time travel

841
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,360
is that many things
cannot be changed.

842
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,920
Time wants to happen.

843
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,760
Chronos, even Vandal,
won't be the only enemy we face.

844
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,560
Very often, it will be time itself.

845
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,320
Whether it wants to happen
or not,

846
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,440
we're gonna change time,

847
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,720
erase Savage's future,

848
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,000
and earn our rightful place
in history.

849
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,280
Dr. Palmer is correct.

850
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,760
We may not be legends
in your time, Captain.

851
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,480
But we are going to decide
our own fates.

852
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,280
I don't give a damn
about being a legend,

853
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,240
as long as we end Savage
once and for all.

854
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,480
I can get down with that.

855
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,680
And our malcontents?

856
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,840
I like killing people.

857
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,920
We're in...

858
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,600
for now.

859
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,480
So how do we find this guy?

860
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,480
Professor Boardman
had a theory about that.

861
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,040
I've already had Gideon
plot a course.

862
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,840
You know what this is?

863
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,560
An instrument to make this world
a better place.

864
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,440
History teaches us
that the cause of humanity

865
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,040
is only advanced through strife.

866
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,320
There's no Renaissance without
the Dark Ages.

867
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,680
Man had no interest
in splitting the atom

868
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,000
until World War II.

869
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,120
I'm just trying

870
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,280
to make this world
a better place...

871
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,200
one war at a time.
