1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,082
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,766
Got an ID on your not-so-secret
but very crazy admirer.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,564
Carrie Cutter. She's former SCPD.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,484
Love is a bullet in the brain.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,681
My hero.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,201
I'm Cupid, stupid.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,401
And if I don't help you?

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,689
I think I made it abundantly clear,
you don't have a choice.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,006
Are you working for Damien Darhk?

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,527
I did what I had to do to keep you safe!

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,691
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,524
- Who's William?
- He's my son.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,645
Oliver, we need to talk. I can't do this.

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,882
Felicity...

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,082
Oh, my God!

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,965
<i>Let me call you sweetheart</i>

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,049
It's okay. It's okay.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,609
<i>I'm in love with you</i>

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,487
<i>That you love me too</i>

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,163
Whatever you're thinking of doing,
you don't have to.

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,283
Please. Just let us go.
We won't tell anyone.

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,204
No one. Absolutely not. Right?

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,291
Wonderful! Agreement.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,643
The mortar that holds together
the bricks of love.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,602
So how much do you love each other?

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,680
With everything that I have.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,886
And the missus?

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,406
How much does she love her mister?

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,765
More than anything in the world.

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,650
How sweet. And pathetic.

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,561
What?

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,842
"Love is a bullet to the brain."

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,447
Or an arrow to the heart.

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,486
Please be seated.

35
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,361
First, I'll hear the parties
on the question of bail.

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,802
Your Honor,
the defendant wishes to waive bail

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,448
so that the court can focus its attention
on our motion to dismiss.

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,321
Your Honor, the defendant was apprehended
at the site of a child abduction.

39
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,847
Because he was being held captive himself.

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,486
Your Honor, these documents will confirm

41
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,208
my client's identity as Kenneth Bender,
citizen of Markovia.

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,967
Your Honor, this is ridiculous.
The defendant's name is Damien Darhk.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,447
According to whom? You?
Oliver Queen? The media?

44
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,644
Your Honor,
there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,121
<i>to suggest that my client
is this Damien Darhk,</i>

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,209
much less prove beyond a reasonable doubt

47
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,290
that he committed these acts
that Damien Darhk is even accused of.

48
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,564
Your Honor, we have evidence
and we will present it at trial.

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,844
During which time,
what, my client just rots in jail?

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,003
<i>I mean, fortunately,
he's no longer in Markovia, right?</i>

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,201
Because in America...

52
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,363
We have preliminary hearings to determine

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,528
whether the State can meet
its burden of proof.

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,247
Your Honor...

55
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,124
<i>You say you have evidence, Ms. Lance.</i>

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,010
Get ready to present it.

57
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,602
Mr. Darhk, or Mr. Bender
or whatever he's calling himself,

58
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,804
<i>is hereby remanded to the custody
of the Department of Corrections,</i>

59
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,408
to be held until disposition
of defendant's motion to dismiss.

60
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,610
I worked out a system to maximize
the efficiency of the moving process.

61
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,442
The densest, heaviest boxes
are put into the moving truck first,

62
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,324
creating a solid foundation
for the rest of the boxes,

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,522
and providing maximum recovery time

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,609
during the most physical moments
of moving.

65
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,169
There's, um, less chance for injury, too.

66
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,441
I hired a mover.

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,081
And I would never want to step on the toes
of professionals,

68
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,731
but proper distribution of the mass

69
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,922
and density of the boxes
inside the moving truck

70
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,929
could have a cost-saving effects
for the moving company

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,610
in the form of improved gas mileage.

72
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,283
Okay. Great.

73
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,442
So, you're doing great.

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,768
It's just amazing how much progress
you've made in such little time.

75
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,089
Paul must be just
a physical therapy genius.

76
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,930
Yeah, like a symphony of the talents,

77
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,407
you know, Curtis and Paul,
they're kind of the perfect team.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,765
You know, marrying tech...

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,530
Poor choice of words.
My bad. My specialty.

80
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,331
It's okay. That's fine. l...

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,129
You see, it's not like, um...
I don't know what it's like.

82
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,010
We were engaged.
And now we're not together.

83
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,086
That's what it's like.

84
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,051
Could you cancel the venue, please?

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,527
Uh...

86
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,728
Yes, I will get around
to canceling the venue.

87
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,405
Great. Thank you.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,002
And I will un-invite the guests.

89
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,001
Okay.

90
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,924
The movers will swing by
whenever you want.

91
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,321
<i>Just give them a call.</i>

92
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,651
I'll see you when I see you.

93
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,085
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

94
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,846
Yeah, tonight I, uh...

95
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,607
I mean, I guess we didn't talk about it,

96
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,320
but I was a part of the team
before we were together. I just assumed...

97
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,407
Oh! Tonight.
Like every night. Um...

98
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,724
Of course. You are a part of the team.
Forever and always.

99
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,526
Keep movin'!

100
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,441
Stop here. This is it.

101
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,206
<i>Okay, well, now that you've found
what you're looking for,</i>

102
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,601
you don't need us, so we can just...

103
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,286
No. This isn't the end, Mr. Queen.

104
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,046
- It's the beginning.
- Of what?

105
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,282
<i>I grew up in a small village in Africa.</i>

106
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,207
A country whose name has changed
a dozen times over the years.

107
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,444
One day, bandits came to my village.

108
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,647
They wanted water and gold and women.

109
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,370
<i>Once they left with them,</i>

110
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,122
the only thing remaining of my village
was ash.

111
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,484
My home and everyone I loved
was wiped from the earth.

112
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,122
And I was helpless to stop it.

113
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,483
And I swore I would never feel
helpless again.

114
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,168
So killing all the people you're holding
hostages can help you not feel helpless?

115
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,487
How does that make you any different than
the people who destroyed your village?

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,922
Oh...

117
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,164
it makes me very different.

118
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,567
Let me show you.

119
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,925
How'd it go out there tonight?

120
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,731
It was quiet.

121
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,363
Yeah, this city hasn't had a quiet night
in four years.

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,530
Yeah, I can't believe HIVE is silent
just because Damien Darhk's in jail.

123
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,927
- Not for long.
- What are you talking about?

124
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,049
The law's pesky need for evidence.

125
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,285
The Ghosts who took William also took
their cyanide escape plans.

126
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,568
- There's no one to testify against Darhk.
- What about my brother?

127
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,081
You mean the one that was declared
legally dead five years ago?

128
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,523
It should be fun walking him into court.

129
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,206
What about us?

130
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,205
Yeah, Damien kidnapped us
over the holiday.

131
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,044
- We're all witnesses.
- Actually, that's good.

132
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,931
The fiancé to the city's
beloved mayoral candidate,

133
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,964
it makes for a compelling story.

134
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,961
What's wrong?

135
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,611
Oliver and I aren't engaged anymore.

136
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,881
Um, or living together.

137
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,201
Or together together.

138
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,721
- Felicity...
- It's fine.

139
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,721
Which is universal code for
"I don't wanna talk about it."

140
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,566
- Pieces of Darhk's idol, huh?
- Yeah.

141
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,881
How're you holding up?

142
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,249
Felicity tell you guys?

143
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,085
How're you holding up?

144
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,721
Is this about your son?

145
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,090
The fact that I lied to her about him,
yeah.

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,641
Well, you got a kid, man.
That's a whole lot to handle.

147
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,245
But don't worry, she'll come around.
Give her time.

148
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,483
I mean, she wants to stay on the team.

149
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,243
That's a good sign.

150
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,686
- I think.
- Hey.

151
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,289
Lance just called. It's trouble.

152
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,766
HIVE?

153
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,004
He said it was an old friend.

154
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,124
All right, you guys take five.

155
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,287
Hey, you okay?

156
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,284
You do look a little more grim than usual.

157
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,762
Just let me know who did this.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,126
Look familiar?

159
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,441
Cupid.

160
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,803
She's supposed to be in custody
at A.R.G.U.S.

161
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,201
Yeah?

162
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,360
Tell that to them.

163
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,847
What was there?

164
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,281
She left a note for us.

165
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,485
"Love is dead."

166
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,168
So, is nobody else going to say it?
"It's Cupid, stupid."

167
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,165
Well, she's changed up her M.O. a little.
"Love is dead."

168
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,328
Ah! Maybe she's not so insane after all.

169
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,528
I thought she was locked up
in some A.R.G.U.S sub-basement?

170
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,721
Yeah, not anymore.

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,684
Just talked to Lyla,
turns out Waller was serious

172
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,003
about prisoners like Cupid
working their way off of Task Force X.

173
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,169
- She's out.
- Then we start with her victims.

174
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,164
- Did CSU ID them?
- They're running prints.

175
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,883
Like, seriously? None of your crime
tech guys read gossip websites?

176
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,483
Uh... Let's assume they don't.

177
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,523
'Cause this is Blaine and this is Shannon.

178
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,841
Okay?

179
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,367
Really, guys? Come on,
it's the wedding of the decade.

180
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,006
Why would Cupid wanna ice
Star City's most high-profile couple?

181
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,641
Well, we figure that out, we figure out
who her next targets might be.

182
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,171
How do you know
there's gonna be a next target?

183
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,647
I don't think that Carrie Cutter
has changed that much.

184
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,807
We got to get to court.

185
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,202
I'm gonna stay here,
work up some leads on Cupid.

186
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,005
It was the Oliver Queen
Campaign holiday party.

187
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,881
There was gunfire.

188
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,884
The security that we had on site
was killed.

189
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,041
And then he walked in.

190
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,204
Let the record reflect that
the witness is pointing to the defendant.

191
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,720
And why did the defendant walk
in to Oliver Queen's campaign office?

192
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,405
He was the leader of the gunmen.

193
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,087
He took myself, Thea Queen,
and Felicity Smoak hostage.

194
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,044
And while you were held hostage...

195
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,047
Damien Darhk, or whatever
he calls himself, was there,

196
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,684
calling the shots, the entire time.

197
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,206
Pass the witness.

198
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,201
This, uh, holiday party.
Were you there as a guest?

199
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,449
No, sir. I work security,
personal security for Mr. Oliver Queen.

200
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,966
I have been for the past three-plus years.

201
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,403
Even after Mr. Queen lost his job
as CEO of Queen Consolidated?

202
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,246
I mean, how much does he pay you?
Ten cents an hour?

203
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,243
Objection. Relevance.

204
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,768
Sustained. Move faster, Mr. Fitzmartin.

205
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,081
<i>Of course, Your Honor.</i>

206
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,447
All right, well, let's talk about
your alleged co-captive, Thea Queen.

207
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,771
Isn't it true that five months ago,

208
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,567
you helped her buy
$74,000 worth of cocaine?

209
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,921
<i>And before you answer that,</i>

210
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,885
you should know that I have a signed
affidavit from Ms. Queen's dealer,

211
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,121
right here.

212
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,725
Which means nothing
because it is irrelevant.

213
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,281
Well, it goes to credibility, Your Honor.

214
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,807
<i>Oliver Queen publicly slandered my client</i>

215
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,804
<i>by accusing him
of ordering a terrorist drone strike.</i>

216
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,129
Now, if Mr. Diggle can work
for Mr. Queen for free,

217
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,807
<i>to help Ms. Queen buy illegal drugs,
I mean,</i>

218
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,805
<i>is it really that much of a stretch to
believe that he'd also perjure himself</i>

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,128
in support of Mr. Queen's campaign
of character assassination?

220
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,970
You watched me swear an oath!

221
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,923
And then I saw you break it.

222
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,809
No further questions, Your Honor.

223
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,603
I don't have a law degree,
but I don't think that went well.

224
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,801
It could've been worse.

225
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,804
If Fitzmartin kept pulling
on those threads,

226
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,162
then everything that we've done
for the city could've been exposed.

227
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,606
Worth it to put Darhk away.

228
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,131
Except it wouldn't put him away.

229
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,004
Because vigilantes
don't make good witnesses?

230
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,886
No, but they make excellent inmates.

231
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,321
Yeah.

232
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,606
Okay, so where does this leave us?

233
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,001
We can't just let Darhk walk.

234
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,051
Well, unless I come up with a witness
who Fitzmartin can't tear apart,

235
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,321
then that's what's going to happen.

236
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,846
Then put me on the stand.

237
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,841
<i>I don't have a secret identity.</i>

238
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,009
And I can testify about Darhk
and his connection to HIVE.

239
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,850
And spend the rest of your life in jail.

240
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,685
If it's in a cell next to Darhk,
it'd be worth it.

241
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,042
No. We'll find another way.

242
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,527
- It's Felicity.
- Uh...

243
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,881
Put her on speaker.

244
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,690
Felicity, we have the whole team here.
What's up?

245
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,325
Good news is, I've got Cupid's location.

246
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,521
<i>Good. Where is she?</i>

247
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,331
That's the bad news. Looks like she's
kidnapped another celebrity couple.

248
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,851
<i>Allison Lee and Robert Joyce.</i>

249
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,081
Allibert.

250
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,810
Track the GPS in their phones.

251
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,520
When I said I had their location,
how did you think that I got it?

252
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,842
Okay, Felicity, what's next?
Where are we going?

253
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,760
They're on the move
headed towards Pennytown.

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,002
- Got it.
- I'd suit up with you...

255
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,170
No, what you're doing here
is more important. Get Darhk.

256
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,850
Get Cupid.

257
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,566
"'Till death do us part."

258
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,040
Don't worry.
You won't have to wait that long.

259
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,845
Wedding crashers. Hold on tight.

260
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,281
Speedy, look out!

261
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,921
She's in the center.

262
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,124
- I'm okay.
- Stay with Speedy.

263
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,608
<i>- Let them help</i> you.
<i>- I'll get Cupid.</i>

264
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,602
I'd say enjoy the afterlife,

265
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,446
but we both know
that's just eternal nothingness.

266
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,763
I was in love with the Arrow,
but you're not him.

267
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,204
Although I do like the sleeveless.

268
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,046
Got her.

269
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,290
I guess you didn't have her.

270
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,848
Really brings a whole new meaning
to crazy ex-girlfriend,

271
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,567
and you didn't even get to enjoy
the fun parts.

272
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,166
Sorry.

273
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,970
Well, Cutter fell for Floyd Lawton
last year.

274
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,486
Lucky QUY-

275
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,085
She was heartbroken when he was blown up.

276
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,165
No, Thea's right though.
Cutter is pathological.

277
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,050
I mean, targeting happy couples? Come on!

278
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,686
Well, it makes sense
if you look at it from her perspective.

279
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,767
Love betrayed her
and now she wants to go to war against it.

280
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,890
And then that's making sense?

281
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,003
It makes sense to her.

282
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,040
Okay.
She's not just targeting regular couples.

283
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,050
She's targeting celebrity couples.

284
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,527
Probably to bring attention
to her anti-love crusade.

285
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,762
Lance is getting the word out,
he assigned a protective detail.

286
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,764
I'm gonna run forensics on this.

287
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,731
We're gonna hit the streets,
see if we can get a line on Cutter.

288
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,605
Okay. You wanna talk about
the other obvious problem?

289
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,241
- Yeah, the elephant in the room?
- Felicity and I are fine.

290
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,124
If you were
listening to her little asides,

291
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,361
you would know that was not true.

292
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,564
John, you were the one
who told me to give her time.

293
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,240
Okay. Do you want to get back together
with her?

294
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,283
- I do.
- Then tell her that.

295
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,125
Even if you fall on your face, Oliver,
she needs to know where you stand.

296
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,931
She needs to know
that you're willing to say the words.

297
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,930
- I am willing to say the words.
- That's <i>good.</i>

298
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,121
So what's stopping you?

299
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,565
- Why did you do that?
- Don't! Let him die.

300
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,564
What? You're insane!

301
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,329
The difference between insanity and belief
lies only in the number of believers.

302
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,642
This is the power of a single life.

303
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,810
Above us, I have dozens under my control.

304
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,684
The prisoners are gathered topside.
The men are in position.

305
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,525
Tell them to shoot.

306
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,602
Come on! Come on! Go, go, go, go!

307
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,281
Hey-

308
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,969
So how'd the rest of the day in court go?

309
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,680
If it went well,
I wouldn't be here still doing this.

310
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,890
Listen, I was thinkin',

311
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,889
what about all the rest of the people
at the holiday party?

312
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,525
- All right? 'Cause they all saw Darhk.
- Yeah.

313
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,729
It's probably
why they're all too frightened to testify.

314
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,967
We could subpoena 'em.

315
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,040
I did that this afternoon.

316
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,131
One lied,

317
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,840
one in jail
because they refused to testify,

318
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,203
and one actually tried pleading the Fifth.

319
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,002
Well, I told you,
there's one guy willing to take the stand.

320
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,245
Dad, I went to my boss and I asked him
to give you immunity from prosecution.

321
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,640
He said he'd prefer to be re-elected.

322
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,803
- I don't care about immunity.
- But I do.

323
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,082
Dad, I'm not gonna let you
incriminate yourself.

324
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,801
You wouldn't be doing anything.
It'd be me. And it'd be right.

325
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,291
I'm the one who got into bed with Darhk.
But I made those decisions

326
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,369
and I should pay the consequences
to 'em, honey.

327
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,005
And, listen,
it's the only way to bring him down.

328
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,808
Okay. Okay.

329
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,085
If we do this, you will also testify
that you acted under duress.

330
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,241
- That Damien threatened my life.
- Yeah.

331
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,288
'Cause that way I get to say on record
how much I love my baby girl.

332
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,841
Okay.

333
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,086
Felicity Scissorhands.

334
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,328
Struck out
trying to find a line on Cutter.

335
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,567
What's this?

336
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,809
I couldn't exactly fit the entire sleeve
into the gas chromatograph.

337
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,771
Speak of the devil.

338
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,283
The sleeve contains fibers from at least
60 different types of white silk lace.

339
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,364
- White lace. Like in wedding dresses?
- That would be ironic.

340
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,927
And also traces of acid-free
polypropylene.

341
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,731
- What do they use that for?
- Long term storage of fabrics.

342
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,764
Well, maybe Cutter's holed up in a spot
where they store wedding dresses.

343
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,521
Colao Wedding Dress Services is the only
long-term storage facility in the city

344
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,200
that uses polypropylene.
Twenty-eighth and Hamilton.

345
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,528
That is two blocks
from where she posed the first victims.

346
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,081
The only movement
I'm tracking in that building is you guys.

347
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,606
Stay alert.

348
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,287
Got something.

349
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,407
Whoa!

350
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,682
<i>She does love her shrines, doesn't she?</i>

351
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,730
Now we know how she's picking her targets.

352
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,891
The first two couples,
they're both recently gotten married.

353
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,441
Cutter abducted the second couple
after their wedding.

354
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,041
Yeah.

355
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,486
Yeah. But Blaine and Shannon, "Blannon",

356
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,490
had a secret wedding 48 hours
before they were killed.

357
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,685
Now we have to figure out what celebrity
couple in the city's getting married next.

358
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,888
I think I found one we can rule out.

359
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,684
So, by calling off the engagement,

360
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,689
we took ourselves
out of Cupid's crosshairs.

361
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,848
I knew there had to be
at least one silver lining.

362
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,929
Well, if she keeps on targeting
high-profile weddings,

363
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,765
we just got to stake out
whatever the next one is.

364
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,008
That's a big risk
to run with an innocent couple.

365
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,402
We're not gonna take that risk
with an innocent couple.

366
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,167
Hey-

367
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,483
We need to get married.

368
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,001
How romantic.

369
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,568
- It's, Felicity...
- This is the worst idea you've ever had!

370
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,040
Actually, it's not the worst.

371
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,281
<i>Et tu, John'?</i>

372
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,926
We lost our leads on Cutter, Felicity.
This might draw her out.

373
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,326
Oh, so she can kill me?

374
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,766
- Pass. No, thank you.
- Okay.

375
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,720
No, John and I will have your back.

376
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,411
Guess it's too bad I already sent out
all those "un-invitations."

377
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,921
Clearly, none of you guys spend any time
on gossip sites.

378
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,250
Okay, look,

379
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,887
these bloggers love nothing
more than a private, secret wedding.

380
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,604
I leak the news, saying you guys
wanted to keep it under radar...

381
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,363
it becomes the top story on their website.
It's Catnip for Cupid.

382
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,602
Okay, look,
we have to do this quickly, okay?

383
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,929
So Cupid doesn't change her M.O.
and start killing more innocent couples.

384
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,770
- Can we do this tomorrow?
- Tomorrow will work.

385
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,089
The venue still has our deposit, though.
We'll be able to move up the date.

386
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,964
I thought you said you were
gonna cancel that?

387
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,044
I did say that I was gonna cancel,
and I am going to cancel,

388
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,924
but I haven't canceled yet.

389
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,607
Because when I picked up the...

390
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,962
When I pick up the phone to do that,
it means it's over.

391
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,525
It is over.

392
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,367
Hey. Taiana, wait. I think we lost them.

393
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,323
Look. Reiter is not gonna issue kill order
if he doesn't have that thing nearby.

394
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,404
You grabbing it, you saved us.

395
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,042
If that's true,
then we should destroy the damn thing.

396
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,967
- Oliver Queen.
- You took his radio?

397
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,401
<i>I know you're still down here, Mr. Queen.</i>

398
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,445
You should have studied those maps
more closely.

399
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,843
The only way out of these tunnels
is back the way you came.

400
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,565
Which means going through me.

401
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,848
<i>You can either return of your own accord,</i>

402
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,001
or you can force me to come and find you.

403
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,011
<i>But don't bother trying to fight
your way out of this.</i>

404
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,526
After all, I'm the only one of us
who has men and guns.

405
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,323
Last August,
Darhk asked me for the vacation plans

406
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,204
for the Chief of the Fire Department.

407
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,447
Objection.

408
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,326
Darhk. Bender.
Whatever he wants to call himself.

409
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,251
I told him where Chief Reynolds was
staying, the next day the place blows up.

410
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,965
Objection. Conjecture.

411
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,642
Something you're free to challenge
on cross examination. Continue, Ms. Lance.

412
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,762
What else did you do for the defendant?

413
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,885
He wanted me to give him access
to the SCPD computer network.

414
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,481
I did it.

415
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,642
He wanted me to give him
the departmental patrol schedules.

416
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,046
I did that.

417
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,286
He wanted me to break into a federal
server farm to install a computer virus,

418
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,481
and I did that.

419
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,561
He wanted me to give him information
on the city's leadership, and I...

420
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,446
I did that.

421
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,402
And three days later,
the city leadership were all dead.

422
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,843
You did all of these things
for the defendant?

423
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,731
The defendant and the organization
he works for. He called it HIVE.

424
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,843
Objection. Your Honor, it's hearsay.

425
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,644
Statement against interests, Your Honor.

426
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,921
Overruled.

427
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,728
Captain Lance,
why would you do these things?

428
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,924
At first, I didn't know his intentions.

429
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,770
Like with the Fire Chief.

430
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,761
But when I confronted Darhk about it,

431
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,969
he told me that if I didn't do
everything he asked,

432
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,610
everything he told me to do,

433
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,200
he'd have you killed.

434
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,211
No more questions, Your Honor.

435
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,645
Mr. Fitzmartin, your witness.

436
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,962
Captain Lance,
have you ever personally witnessed

437
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,646
my client commit any illegal act?

438
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,769
Well, I'm pretty sure that threatening
the daughter

439
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,927
of a police captain
isn't legal, counselor.

440
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,246
- Objection.
- Overruled.

441
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,164
You know, the fact of the matter is,

442
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,127
I've seen your client in his
little hidey-hole, with his little men.

443
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,401
Ghosts, he calls 'em.

444
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,167
And I've heard him say repeatedly
how he wants to destroy this city.

445
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,441
And that if I didn't help him do it,
then he'd kill my daughter.

446
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,849
By saying all these things,
I'm setting a match to my career.

447
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,685
Maybe my life.

448
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,846
So why would I be doin' that
if everything I'm saying isn't true?

449
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,001
In position.

450
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,527
In position.

451
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,367
There's no psychopaths here
other than paparazzi.

452
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,844
I'm tapped into the security cameras.
All clear.

453
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,885
Everything okay?

454
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,800
Yes. Yeah.

455
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,724
You look perfect.

456
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,561
Thanks.

457
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,682
I'd like to assure you I won't breathe
a word of what goes on here to the press.

458
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,729
- I'm just thrilled to be part of your day.
- Thank you.

459
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,041
- Can we get this over with?
- Hmm.

460
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,887
Can't wait to be
married to this guy!

461
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,691
In that case,
I know you've written your own vows.

462
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,402
- Felicity.
- Vows?

463
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,681
Yeah.

464
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,921
Okay.

465
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,161
Um...

466
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,320
Oliver, you have many qualities.

467
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,244
Many astonishing qualities.

468
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,364
And I, for one, cannot wait
to move on to the next chapter.

469
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,889
All right. Oliver?

470
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,689
Felicity...

471
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,286
Before I met you, I had a plan.
I had a way that it was gonna be.

472
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,563
But then you walked into my life,
all right.

473
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,927
I showed up in your cubicle
and you changed everything.

474
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,605
I was in darkness.

475
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,529
But with your kindness,

476
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:31,484
your generosity, your compassion, your
intelligence, your wit, and your trust,

477
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,244
you brought me into the light.

478
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,127
And you let me know that I deserved it.

479
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,803
You were that light.

480
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,124
And I don't know
if I still deserve that trust.

481
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,171
If I deserve you.

482
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,845
I probably don't.

483
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,686
But whatever's happened,
whatever will happen,

484
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,847
the way that you make me feel,
is the best part of my life.

485
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,967
You could ask me to say
that I don't love you.

486
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,003
And I will never lie to you again.

487
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,691
You are my always.

488
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,847
And I just want the chance to be yours.

489
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,885
Oliver...

490
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,205
Hello, lovers.

491
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,526
Run!

492
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,681
We have eyes on?

493
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,887
Copy that. I'm here.

494
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,730
Yeah, we got that. Hold tight.

495
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,243
Your little speech
was only off by a little.

496
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,528
See, she isn't the best thing in your life
because that means you love her.

497
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,367
And love means you're soft.

498
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,042
And soft, means death.

499
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,241
<i>Here, let me show you.</i>

500
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,047
Oh, sorry I didn't check
your gift registry.

501
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,288
Was an explosion that would bring down
this whole building on your list?

502
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,127
Your engagement, that horrible shooting,

503
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,931
your miracle recovery,

504
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,043
that was all just a fairy tale.

505
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,449
Camelot in Star City.

506
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,641
Thank you.

507
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,050
But once Camelot dies,
everyone will know my truth.

508
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,765
That love is a bullet to the brain.

509
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,122
No. No, it's not.

510
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,487
Kevlar under the tux.
My bodyguard insisted.

511
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,610
What was his plan for C-four?

512
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,127
That's a damn good question.

513
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,921
- You know, you don't have to do this.
- I do.

514
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,130
The two words that start every marriage.

515
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,601
<i>"I'll do."!</i>

516
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,482
True love. People need to see it,
they need to know what a joke that is.

517
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,001
It's not.

518
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,962
I have loved two men in my life.

519
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,766
With all my soul.

520
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,810
They're both dead now.

521
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,327
No matter what, love always ends in death.

522
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,484
<i>That's why it's in the vows.</i>

523
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,802
I'm just cutting out the middle man.

524
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,207
Love is death.

525
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:53,326
It's not.
You saw all those people outside, right?

526
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,571
They're out there because love is real,

527
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,002
because love is life itself.

528
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,845
And if I die tonight, it'll be okay,

529
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,325
because I was one of those people
lucky enough to have experienced it.

530
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,047
From the moment he walked into my life,
everything changed.

531
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,529
I became a person that I didn't even know
I was capable of becoming.

532
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,202
I became the very best version of myself.

533
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,568
That would have never have been possible
without our love.

534
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,410
Our love gives my life meaning,
it gives my life a purpose,

535
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,928
and it brings us more joy
than you can ever take away from us.

536
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,567
And it's worth living for.

537
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,366
All of it.

538
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,370
You really know how to make a girl
believe in love again.

539
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,007
Are you all right?

540
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,481
Yeah.

541
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,521
Step back, please.

542
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,171
<i>"REPORTER". What happened inside there?</i>

543
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,648
You two give the rest of us hope.

544
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,209
- You okay?
- Yeah.

545
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,963
About what you said in there to Cutter...

546
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,286
Maybe we could meet up and talk about it.

547
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,281
Tonight? Or...

548
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,210
Not tonight.

549
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,526
I think we're both exhausted
from whatever that was.

550
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,881
Tomorrow?

551
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,970
<i>"THEA". Hey, guys. Laurel just texted.</i>

552
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,962
Guess Judge Sakow's holding court late.
And she's making her decision.

553
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,841
I should probably change.
This outfit is a bit of a focus-puller.

554
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,081
Mmm-hmm.

555
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,923
Not for nothing, Oliver.
But I heard what Felicity said in there.

556
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,845
No one likes an "I told you so", John.

557
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,010
I'm just saying, she needs some time.

558
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,368
Watch it. Could be a trap.

559
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,081
They just left it behind?
Why would they do that?

560
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,526
Drop the weapon.

561
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,888
- Maybe you should radio Reiter.
- Why?

562
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,091
Now we have guns, too.

563
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,725
The standard of proof
for a preliminary hearing

564
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,048
<i>is much less severe than one for a trial.</i>

565
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,290
Even so, the evidence against
the defendant is exceedingly thin.

566
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,881
There is no forensic
or circumstantial evidence

567
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,208
that points to the defendant's guilt.

568
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,081
<i>But I found Quentin Lance's testimony
to be particularly compelling.</i>

569
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,081
<i>His credibility is bolstered
by his status as a police captain,</i>

570
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,405
but the fact that he was willing to
incriminate himself to see justice done

571
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,245
makes his testimony especially believable.

572
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,484
<i>On the strength of it,</i>

573
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,326
I am denying
the defense's motion to dismiss

574
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,801
<i>and binding the defendant over for trial.</i>

575
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,767
Mr. Darhk will be held without bail
or possibility of release.

576
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,930
<i>"MAN". The defendant will rise.</i>

577
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,450
<i>Officers, please escort the defendant
from the courtroom.</i>

578
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,600
All right, next step.
Convicting the son of a bitch.

579
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,125
Next step, right.

580
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,841
Are we okay? I wasn't exactly
pulling punches on the stand.

581
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,845
I'm glad you didn't. 'Cause of that,
Darhk's defense is blown to shreds.

582
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,810
He's gonna spend the rest of his life
behind bars.

583
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,288
Hey, Quentin. You have a minute?

584
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,527
Yeah.

585
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,968
Lieutenant Pike,
if I could just talk to you before...

586
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,811
It's all right, sweetheart.
We both knew this was coming. Frank?

587
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,651
You're being suspended
pending an l.A.B. investigation.

588
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,885
I'll need your badge and your weapon.

589
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,326
Yeah.

590
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,565
I'm sorry about this, Quentin.

591
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,130
I'm sure your union rep'll make it clear
to l.A.B.

592
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,691
that you were acting under duress.

593
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,121
Yeah, I'm good either way, Frank. Truly.

594
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,646
It's a temporary setback.
I'll represent you in front of l.A.B.

595
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,328
You just focus on nailing Darhk
to a cross, all right?

596
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,011
I'm proud of you, baby.

597
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,089
<i>We have the results
of the high-profile</i>

598
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,521
<i>preliminary hearing against...</i>

599
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,841
Hi.

600
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,687
Hi.

601
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,928
- Thought you'd be asleep by now.
- Oh, I can't sleep.

602
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,765
What are you doing here?

603
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,931
I just came to pick up a few things.

604
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,322
It's not exactly
how I pictured our wedding day.

605
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,767
I don't know.
Being kidnapped by psychotic criminals

606
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,928
has sort of been a theme
in our relationship.

607
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,842
I want you to know that...

608
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,884
What I said today during the ceremony,

609
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,848
I meant every single word of it.

610
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,809
I love you.

611
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,928
With everything in me.

612
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,924
But what I said doesn't apply to us.

613
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,929
I can't be with you. I can't marry you.

614
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,009
Yes, you can.

615
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,443
Yes, you can,
because that's what both of us want.

616
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,325
You know, things can be different.

617
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,891
I can be different.

618
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,085
And I'm promising you,
I'm swearing to you,

619
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,969
there will be no more lies.

620
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,288
You know, no matter how much you love me,

621
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,846
there's always gonna be a part of you

622
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,283
that defaults to the man
who was on the island, alone.

623
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,641
Who came back to save the city. Alone.

624
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,131
And sooner than we both think,
you're going to be stuck in a situation

625
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,284
where you have to make a decision that
requires you to hide things from me again.

626
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,970
See, you can't know that...

627
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,680
I do know that. And you know that.

628
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,486
That's this life.

629
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,561
I'm sorry.

630
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,001
You know, five months ago,
I convinced you that we could have it all.

631
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,524
We could come here to this job
and have each other, I was wrong.

632
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,041
And then I thought we could just go back
to the way things were,

633
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,720
before we left for Ivy Town.

634
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,846
God, that was as crazy as Cupid is.

635
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,760
So what does that mean?

636
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:54,200
It means it is too hard to be here
with you every night and not be with you.

637
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,521
That's not fair to either of us.

638
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,001
You told me how you worked some tech magic

639
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,771
to return all the money that Adam Hunt
swindled out of people.

640
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,885
You don't need me. You'll be fine.

641
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,041
You don't give up.

642
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,890
You know, that's what makes you a hero.

643
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,723
But there's no fixing this.

644
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,284
We have to let each other go.

645
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,405
I want you to keep it for good this time,
please.

646
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,563
I don't wanna let you go.

647
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,844
I don't wanna let you go.

648
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,605
But I'm already gone.

649
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,801
