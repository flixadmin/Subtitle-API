1
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,054
- Sure you got the right keys ?
- It's the right key.

2
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:21,225
- Okay, then, open the door.
- It shouldn't be taking so long, man.

3
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:27,231
- Twenty, 19, 18...
- Rocky, those are very slow seconds.

4
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,066
- ...17, 16...
- Yo, kill that already.

5
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:33,529
- Dude, come on.
- ...15, 14, 13, 12...

6
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:37,992
- This is what I'm talking about.
- ...11, 10, nine....

7
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,788
I told you this was gonna be fancy.

8
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:47,334
All right, so just like last time. No cash.

9
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,754
- The total take has to fall below 10 G's.
- Yeah, whatever, Judge Judy.

10
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,798
- Come on.
- Let's do this.

11
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,331
Okay, let's get out of here.

12
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,577
Hey, Rocky, did you hear
that Kopecky's moving away ?

13
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,621
Everybody's leaving.

14
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,210
You know, we keep hitting houses
like today's, Rocky, and....

15
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,420
Bye-bye, Detroit.

16
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,216
And <i>hola</i>, California.

17
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:22,388
- Wait, wait. You're going away, Rock ?
- Yeah, as soon as I can.

18
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,767
When are you--
When are you coming back ?

19
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,352
Never.

20
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,731
You should come with us.

21
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,984
What ?

22
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,902
Everyone else is gone.

23
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,988
I got my dad here.

24
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,741
I'll miss you, then.

25
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,976
Dad ?

26
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,271
You're home ?

27
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,735
Yo, this is it, man ?

28
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,321
Minus my 40 percent.

29
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,572
Take it or leave it.

30
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,617
- There's a fucking Rolex in there, bro.
- What do you think...

31
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:09,453
...I'm gonna put it up
for auction at Sotheby's ?

32
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:16,502
You know how much people
on the street pay for a hot Rolex ?

33
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,962
You want money ?

34
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,549
- Then steal money.
- Fucking bullshit, bro.

35
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,804
You want this new tip or not ?

36
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,351
All right, let's hear it.

37
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:36,688
1837 Buena Vista Street. House
is with your dad's security company.

38
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,273
I already checked.

39
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,652
Guy who owns it
is an Army vet loner.

40
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:42,820
No family.

41
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,113
Just him in the house.

42
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,907
- That part of the city is a ghost town.
- Looks like a dump.

43
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,325
That's actually good news.

44
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,785
How is that good news ?

45
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,286
Well, the story goes...

46
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,706
...some preppy girl a few years ago
ran over this guy's daughter.

47
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,750
- Jesus.
- The daughter dies...

48
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,837
...and this preppy, rich-ass family...

49
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,840
...pays him off,
gives him a big-ass sediment.

50
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,716
Settlement.

51
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,343
Blow me, Your Honour.

52
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,098
All right, this guy
is sitting on at least...

53
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,268
...300K.

54
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,730
I mean, if I deliver
this stake to Raul, man...

55
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,399
...he will shit his pants.

56
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,734
Do you think the money's
in the house ?

57
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,987
I don't know. Let's go find out.

58
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,655
Guys, no. We don't do cash.

59
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,575
Above 10 K, it's major larceny.
Ten years if we get caught.

60
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,702
- We won't get caught.
- And then what ?

61
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,164
That amount brings a serious cop
presence. They'll do an investigation.

62
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,041
- My dad could get in trouble.
- I knew you'd bitch out, man.

63
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,418
- I just knew it.
- Alex...

64
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:42,838
...if we do this right,
we never have to do it again.

65
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,096
Where are you going ?

66
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,141
We're not doing this one.

67
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,268
Seriously ?

68
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,645
Give us the fucking keys, man.

69
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,063
- We'll fucking do it.
- Alex !

70
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,684
"Gulf War veteran reaches
six-figure settlement."

71
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,355
Six-figure settlement.

72
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,899
All right.

73
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,076
<i>The suspect was leaving</i>
<i>the rear entrance.</i>

74
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,203
You done, Diddy ?

75
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:02,334
Be a doll and get your mother
a large four-cheese from Tony's.

76
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,754
- So Trevor's living here now ?
- Don't be a bitch, Roxanne.

77
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,091
It's just a few months
till he can find a new job.

78
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,968
You have no money in here.

79
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,970
You pay for it then.

80
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,014
I know you're making money.

81
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,187
I'm done.

82
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,189
Your lips look sore.

83
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,650
That's how you're making
your cash out there ?

84
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,658
Okay, Diddy, let's go for a walk.

85
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,744
I want to go to the beach.

86
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,540
Yeah, well,
it's not summer, monkeyhead.

87
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,542
I want to be a surfer.

88
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,504
There's no surf in Michigan.

89
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,092
- Not fair.
- Yeah, well...

90
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,347
...some things
you can't change, baby.

91
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,974
No matter how unfair they are.

92
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,351
What a bummer.

93
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,191
Hey, you know
where there is surf ?

94
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:13,363
California. What do you say
you and I move there together ?

95
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,615
Would you like that ?

96
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,826
Okay. I promise, then.

97
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,447
Is that a new tattoo ?

98
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,699
Yeah.

99
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,033
I got it last night.

100
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,412
- Is it a... ?
- Ladybug.

101
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,580
Why a ladybug ?

102
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,753
What ?

103
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,134
When my dad left,
my mom started drinking...

104
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,761
...and she told me that...

105
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,473
...my dad's leaving was all my fault.

106
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,770
And I missed him a lot, so I'd cry.

107
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,481
She got so fed up with the crying...

108
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,484
...that she would lock me
in the trunk of her car.

109
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,737
Sometimes for hours.

110
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,157
But there was this....

111
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,286
A little hole in the trunk...

112
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,663
...and one time a ladybug flew in...

113
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,040
...kept me company.

114
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,210
It made me feel safe.

115
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,298
When I reach California,
I'll colour this tat...

116
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,301
...and that's the last time
I will mark my body.

117
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,644
If we get this money,
I'm going away with you guys.

118
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,441
I know you will.

119
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,074
At least four blocks around,
houses aren't occupied.

120
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,953
No people means no Five-0 on patrol.

121
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,498
It's gonna be a piece of cake.

122
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,501
The guy's a shut-in,
hasn't left his house in like five days.

123
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,296
I say we do it with him in the house.
I'll get a chloro-bomb.

124
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,717
- Jesus.
- Get off my fucking car, dog shit !

125
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,144
Shit, that's our guy.

126
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,946
Wait, is he blind ?

127
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,366
He lost his sight in Iraq or something.

128
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,868
Kind of fucked up to rob a blind guy,
isn't it ?

129
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,038
Just because he's blind
don't mean he's a fucking saint, bro.

130
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,917
We do this tonight.

131
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,069
The whole neighbourhood
is fucking empty.

132
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,322
This guy's the last man standing.

133
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,244
The lights are out. He must be asleep.

134
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,329
He's blind.

135
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,957
- Lights off doesn't mean anything.
- It's 2 a.m.

136
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,959
He's sleeping.

137
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,629
Let's take care
of that dog first, yeah ?

138
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,779
Come on, man.

139
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,001
He's chewing it.
It'll be lights out in a sec.

140
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,385
There's four locks.
You got the other keys ?

141
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,513
- I only have the one.
- Fuck me.

142
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,809
Why wouldn't he give backup keys
to the security company ?

143
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,480
Because the money's in there and
the paranoid fuck doesn't trust nobody.

144
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,357
Let's check for a side door.

145
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,436
Sweet dreams, pup.

146
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,503
What's that ?

147
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,465
We point this in the general direction
of the master keypad, it'll kill the alarm.

148
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,342
Okay, open the fucking door, Dexter.

149
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,390
Yes. Got it.

150
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,641
Shit.

151
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,436
- What's wrong ?
- It won't open it.

152
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,116
This guy isn't messing around.

153
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,827
There's a bolt here.

154
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,912
I can feel it.

155
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,457
- Come on.
- That's too loud. That's too loud.

156
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:21,666
Fucking stop.

157
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:25,920
What about that window ?

158
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,131
There's no bars on it.

159
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,507
- I can fit in there.
- What ?

160
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,761
No, we're not sending you
in there alone.

161
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,471
Nobody's sending me anywhere.

162
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,639
I'm going myself.

163
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,103
- Help me up.
- Here, Rocky.

164
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,606
- You only got 30 seconds.
- Okay.

165
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,649
Here. Come here.

166
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,357
Slow your roll, fool.

167
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,735
She must have got it by now.
She's fine.

168
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,823
- Yeah, like you really give a fuck.
- What'd you say ?

169
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:01,159
That's my bitch in there.

170
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,244
Of course I give a fuck.

171
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,373
Let me give you some advice.
Be a good friend...

172
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,210
...and stay in the fucking
friend zone, all right ?

173
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,131
You okay ?

174
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,549
Yes.

175
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,468
Shoes off.

176
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:05,390
- What the fuck ?
- Hey.

177
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,773
Hey. Hey.

178
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,734
Okay.

179
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,565
<i>Just three seeds, right ?</i>

180
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,650
<i>Just three ?</i>

181
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,820
<i>One, two...</i>

182
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,531
<i>...and three.</i>

183
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,451
<i>Put three seeds in there...</i>

184
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:52,163
<i>...and the cup is all empty.</i>

185
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,750
<i>Now you water it ?</i>

186
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,086
<i>Okay, now we water it.</i>

187
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,505
<i>Okay, Mom.</i>

188
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,008
<i>Then it takes the water.</i>

189
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,559
<i>Just three seeds.</i>

190
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,561
<i>What are you doing ?</i>

191
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,147
<i>Planting a tree.</i>

192
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,652
<i>How big is the tree gonna get ?</i>

193
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,947
<i>As big as the sky !</i>

194
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,788
<i>What does a tree need to grow ?</i>

195
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,208
<i>Water, seeds, soil...</i>

196
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,585
<i>...and sun.</i>

197
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,504
<i>Sounds good.</i>

198
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,074
<i>Then it will grow.</i>

199
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,456
<i>Mom, can I have more water ?</i>

200
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,326
Done.

201
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,286
What the fuck, dude ?

202
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,537
The guy's gassed out.

203
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,998
He's out.
He's in Sleeping Beauty mode.

204
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,917
- It's fine.
- Guys.

205
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,839
That's a big-ass lock.

206
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,592
If the money's in the house...

207
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,802
...probably in there.

208
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,096
You think you can crack it open ?

209
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,640
Yeah, I got this.

210
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:26,943
Fuck.

211
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,490
Jesus.

212
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,411
- Do you have anything else ?
- Yeah.

213
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,539
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,124
I've got a more powerful tool.

215
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:46,212
- What the hell is that ?
- It's a 9 mm Beretta.

216
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,506
Gangster-style, bitches.

217
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:49,966
Why'd you bring a gun ?

218
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,094
This is a soldier's house.
Like I'm gonna come in here...

219
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:56,597
- ...without some chrome.
- Money, you've never shot a gun before.

220
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,641
Yeah, well, it's time
to pop that cherry.

221
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,643
I'm gonna pop that shit
like a tuna can.

222
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,646
Do you have any idea what
bringing a gun to a burglary means ?

223
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:07,316
Yeah, it gives me a better chance
to defend myself, Alex.

224
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,903
No, it means you just gave this guy
the legal right to shoot us.

225
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,197
Rocky, let's go.

226
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,575
No, no, no. I think we should stay.

227
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,827
We have to leave. This is not good.

228
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:22,790
You don't really think just because
you jerk off to her Instagram selfies...

229
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,292
...that makes you a Romeo ?

230
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,378
Think again, bitch.

231
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:41,934
Fuck, I'm so out.

232
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,272
Alex.

233
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,748
Who-- Who's there ?

234
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,220
Okay, man, just chill, all right ?

235
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,682
Look...

236
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,352
...I was wasted,
and I wandered in...

237
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,103
...so that was my bad, all right ?

238
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,231
So I'm just gonna--
I'm just gonna leave, okay ?

239
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,456
Stay right fucking there.

240
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,792
Don't you fucking move.

241
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,504
Yeah, that's right.

242
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:54,173
I know what's in there,
and I ain't leaving without it.

243
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,883
You got me ?

244
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,969
Now, you do as I say, all right ?

245
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,472
Don't take one single step, all right ?

246
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,437
Well, do you hear me or what ?

247
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,233
What, are you blind and deaf
all of a sudden ?

248
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,820
Motherfucker, I said stop.

249
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,988
I think you fucking heard me.

250
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,533
- Sorry.
- Don't you move.

251
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,370
What the fuck are you doing,
you old man ? I'll fucking shoot you.

252
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,332
Don't you fucking test me.

253
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,506
You're a fucking pussy.

254
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,760
What are you gonna do now, huh ?

255
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,804
You better fucking stop. Stop !

256
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:55,693
Don't make me fucking kill you, man.

257
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,745
Please. Please.

258
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,165
Please, just let me walk.

259
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,834
Let me walk. Leave me alive.

260
00:29:15,713 --> 00:29:20,134
- Please.
- How many of you are there ?

261
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,636
- What ?
- How many ?

262
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:33,939
It's just me, man, all right ?
It's just fucking me. Just let me go !

263
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,776
Please let me go.

264
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,987
Please.

265
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,327
Just let me go.

266
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,541
Okay. Okay.

267
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,835
Okay.

268
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,670
Okay, I swear to God....

269
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,585
Rocky, hey, are you okay ?

270
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,838
Are you okay ?

271
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:34,258
Maybe.... Maybe we should
call the cops before he does.

272
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,176
We'll come clean--

273
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,178
Wait.

274
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:41,098
What ?

275
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:07,249
Oh, my God.

276
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:28,604
There's a lot more than 300 grand.
That's got to be about a million dollars.

277
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,149
Okay, let's get out of here.

278
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:43,160
The storm cellar door.
The door's bolted from the inside.

279
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,329
That could be our way out.

280
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,206
Let's go.

281
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:42,005
Let's go.

282
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,010
This way.

283
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,346
What ?

284
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:51,890
Oh, shit. The phone died.

285
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,518
Fuck.

286
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,426
- Where's the door ?
- I don't know.

287
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,845
Where is it ? Do you see it ?

288
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,009
We need to get the fuck
out of here right now.

289
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:38,390
Come on. Let's go.
Look, the door's right here.

290
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,691
What ?

291
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:50,735
Rocky ? Rocky.

292
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,406
Rocky, listen. Hey, that's our exit.

293
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:57,409
The door's right fucking there.
We can leave right now.

294
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:06,126
She's the one who killed his daughter.

295
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:12,591
- We have to get her out of here.
- No, no, no. We don't have time.

296
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,801
We'll get out of here,
we'll call the cops...

297
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:17,137
...and then they'll come find her,
all right ?

298
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,683
The code from the safe upstairs.
You remember it ?

299
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:08,480
- 2-9-7-8. 7-8, 7-8. 2-9-7-8.
- 2-9-7-8.

300
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,775
Okay, got them.

301
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,696
He's coming.

302
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,407
- Hurry up.
- Okay, one more, one more.

303
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:21,576
Fuck, fuck !

304
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:24,621
I almost have it. Almost.... okay.

305
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:28,041
I don't care what you did.
I'll get you out of here.

306
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,250
Go. Go !

307
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,432
- There's the door.
- There it is.

308
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,731
You okay ? Okay.

309
00:44:58,488 --> 00:44:59,531
What's wrong ?

310
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,536
- What's wrong ?
- It's locked.

311
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,956
You have the keys.
Don't you have the keys ?

312
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,083
Fuck.

313
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,627
- One of these should open it.
- Come on.

314
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:17,215
Come on.

315
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,425
- Come on.
- Okay.

316
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:26,099
Oh, yes.

317
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:31,730
Come on.

318
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,456
He shot her.

319
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:05,865
No.

320
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,582
No.

321
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,544
No.

322
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:28,012
My baby.

323
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,729
No !

324
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,523
No !

325
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,694
No !

326
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:26,237
We have to go back upstairs.

327
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:28,406
Yeah, listen.

328
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:32,035
Listen, okay ? These keys, they match
the locks on the front door.

329
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:35,747
All right ? If we get up there,
we can get out.

330
00:48:35,914 --> 00:48:37,040
Okay ?

331
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:48,843
Let's go now.

332
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,985
Shit.

333
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:25,380
Alex ?

334
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,834
Rocky ?

335
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,439
Please don't....

336
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:11,903
No, please.

337
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,511
- Rocky ?
- Alex. Alex.

338
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,222
Rocky, Rocky. Let's go. Let's go.

339
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:42,934
This way. This way, come on.
This way, come on, come on, come on.

340
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:44,185
Okay.

341
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:46,854
Oh, come on. Where am I ?

342
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,147
Where is it ?

343
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,024
Light. I see light !

344
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:52,026
Come on, come on.

345
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,045
Don't...

346
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,131
...run.

347
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,052
Rocky...

348
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,098
...go to the door.

349
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,309
Try the blue key.

350
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,562
- Do it.
- Okay.

351
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:29,939
Easy.

352
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:32,024
Easy, buddy.

353
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,697
Fuck.

354
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:42,577
- Rocky ?
- Yeah.

355
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,581
- Come on.
- Easy, buddy.

356
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:47,874
Easy.

357
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,586
It's okay.

358
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:55,590
Okay, that's a good boy. That's good.

359
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,300
All right.

360
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:58,676
That's good.

361
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:02,180
That's good. That's good.

362
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:04,515
Fuck.

363
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,518
Rocky. Run, now. Go, go, go !

364
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,228
Upstairs, now. Go. Go, go !

365
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,858
Hurry, hurry !

366
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:17,028
Go ! There's a door ! Come on !

367
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:20,323
Let's go.

368
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,618
Hey, move this. Come on.

369
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,499
Damn.

370
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,502
- Are those blocked up too ?
- Yeah.

371
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:35,546
We're trapped in here.

372
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:59,403
Rocky, the remote.
Do you have it with you ?

373
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,530
Come on. Okay.

374
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:03,157
- What are you doing ?
- Pressing the panic button.

375
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,368
If I get in range,
the system will call 911.

376
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,703
- The police will come.
- No. We can't go to jail.

377
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:11,332
No. No, we won't. Okay ? This is robbery
versus kidnapping and murder.

378
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:13,834
The police won't care about us
or why we were here.

379
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:17,129
- We helped them get this guy.
- But then we wouldn't keep the money.

380
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:21,300
- We need to get out of this room.
- Up there.

381
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:27,723
Go !

382
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,650
Alex !

383
00:54:37,817 --> 00:54:39,819
What are you doing ? Go !

384
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,628
No ! No, no, no !

385
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:54,550
Hey !

386
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,531
Please, let me go.

387
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,035
Please, let me go !

388
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,207
I....

389
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,876
I understand you.

390
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,711
She killed your daughter.

391
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:42,379
You wanted her to pay.

392
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:43,547
I understand that.

393
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:45,299
I won't tell anyone.

394
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,093
You understand nothing.

395
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:52,347
Only a parent could know...

396
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:56,643
...the bond between
a father and his child.

397
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:02,900
She should have gone to prison, but...

398
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:05,777
...rich girls don't go to jail.

399
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,366
None of this is gonna
bring your daughter back.

400
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,958
That's not really true.

401
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:28,467
Cindy took my child away from me.

402
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,220
I thought...

403
01:05:33,347 --> 01:05:35,641
...it's only fair...

404
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,562
...that she give me a new one.

405
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:46,902
She was pregnant with my baby.

406
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:52,449
You killed them both.

407
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:54,618
- No.
- Well, they would be alive...

408
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:58,372
...if you hadn't broken into my home.

409
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,875
No.

410
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,386
You have to be held accountable.

411
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:24,184
Please.

412
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:29,064
- Please, God.
- God ?

413
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,317
There's no God.

414
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,363
It's a joke.

415
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:39,491
It's a bad joke.

416
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:44,287
You tell me what God
would allow this.

417
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,502
What are you doing ?

418
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,842
I'm not a rapist.

419
01:08:58,218 --> 01:08:59,970
I never forced myself on her.

420
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:02,806
Stop.

421
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:05,308
I promised I would set her free...

422
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,644
...just as soon
as she gave me a child.

423
01:09:14,276 --> 01:09:16,570
But now she's gone.

424
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:19,239
But I'm done waiting.

425
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:22,909
No. No, no.

426
01:09:58,403 --> 01:09:59,779
You can't do this to me.

427
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:01,698
There's nothing a man cannot do...

428
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:05,410
...once he accepts the fact
that there is no God.

429
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:07,954
No ! No !

430
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,789
No, no, no !

431
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,875
No !

432
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:15,545
- No !
- You're strong.

433
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:19,883
- You're young.
- No.

434
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,343
You'll breed well.

435
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:23,470
No. Get away from me.

436
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:26,932
No ! No !

437
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:29,059
No !

438
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:33,772
No.

439
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,400
Stop.

440
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:40,862
Nine months...

441
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:42,948
...and I will give you your life back.

442
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:25,573
Are you okay ? Rocky. Okay, yeah.

443
01:11:26,658 --> 01:11:28,326
Rocky, did he-- ? Did he hurt you ?

444
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:30,287
Rocky ?

445
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:33,665
You fucking bastard.

446
01:11:39,087 --> 01:11:40,130
Fuck you !

447
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:52,058
Hey, Rocky. Rocky. Rocky.
Rocky, it's over. Come on.

448
01:11:52,851 --> 01:11:53,893
How's that taste ?

449
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:01,985
- Now what ?
- Come on.

450
01:12:09,576 --> 01:12:12,495
You're gonna rot in prison
for what you've done.

451
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:15,165
Rocky, we can't involve the cops now.

452
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:17,959
If we steal a million in cash,
then lead the cops here...

453
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,712
...he'll tell them about us.
Our blood is all over.

454
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:25,967
- They'll get to us in a second.
- You got what you came for.

455
01:12:28,595 --> 01:12:30,638
Now take it.

456
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:33,141
Get out of my house !

457
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:38,188
Look, he's buying our silence.

458
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:39,939
He needs us to take the money.

459
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:42,859
It's one or the other.

460
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,238
Whatever you choose, I'm with you.

461
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:58,792
- Okay.
- This one.

462
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:00,919
Let's get out of here.

463
01:13:01,086 --> 01:13:02,545
I have to find the key.

464
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:03,880
All right.

465
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,094
That key won't....

466
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,054
I got it.

467
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:02,897
You're worthless out here.

468
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:09,154
Fuck.

469
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:17,996
Shit !

470
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:43,831
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck !

471
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:45,625
Fuck !

472
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:51,853
I'm sorry, Alex.

473
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:54,188
I'm so sorry.

474
01:19:31,768 --> 01:19:33,436
No !

475
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,189
Don't !

476
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:42,361
No. No.

477
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:55,166
Don't....

478
01:20:02,757 --> 01:20:03,966
No !

479
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:11,933
No.

480
01:21:57,705 --> 01:21:59,373
What is that ?

481
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:02,543
You and me at the beach.

482
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:12,511
<i>--will be boarding shortly</i>
<i>on Platform 6.</i>

483
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:16,515
<i>This house behind me on Buena Vista</i>
<i>belongs to a retired Army vet...</i>

484
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,768
<i>...who fought for our country in Iraq...</i>

485
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:22,563
<i>...and lost his sight as a result</i>
<i>of a grenade splinter.</i>

486
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:25,107

487
01:22:25,274 --> 01:22:27,735
