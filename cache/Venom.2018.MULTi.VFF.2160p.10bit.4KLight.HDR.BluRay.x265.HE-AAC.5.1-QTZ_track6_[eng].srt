I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

15
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:48,189
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

16
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:50,190
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

17
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:51,781
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

18
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:53,582
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

19
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:55,951
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

20
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:59,588
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

21
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,591
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

22
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:03,793
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

23
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:05,595
No. We have
three of them.

24
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:07,563
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

25
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:10,635
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

26
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:25,682
What is she saying?

27
00:03:25,684 --> 00:03:27,820
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

28
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,825
That's Jameson.

29
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:00,113
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

30
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:01,550
I'm awake.

31
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:03,984
Missed me.

32
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:05,685
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

33
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:07,920
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

34
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:10,957
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

35
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,459
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

36
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:15,762
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

37
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:18,031
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

38
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,667
My meeting?

39
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:21,534
Oh, shit. Yeah.

40
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,438
My meeting.

41
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:29,944
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

42
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:31,846
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

43
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,748
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

44
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,582
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

45
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:38,519
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

46
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:40,955
And please do not forget
your helmet.

47
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:42,523
Oh, I'm glad
that you like it,

48
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:44,025
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

49
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:45,760
That's hot.

50
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,662
Feed the cat.

51
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:48,963
I will.

52
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:50,497
I love you!

53
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,100
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

75
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:03,807
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

76
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:05,808
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:21,293
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

Height's not really my thing.

84
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:26,765
But, uh...
What's the deal?

85
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,134
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

- The man's a visionary.

He wants to talk
about his rockets,

89
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:37,709
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

Uh...

92
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:42,780
I'm gonna level with you.

93
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:45,183
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

94
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:48,620
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

95
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:51,623
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

96
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,027
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

97
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,963
He's a crook.

98
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:02,167
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

99
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:04,338
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

100
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:07,273
There isn't a better investigative

So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

103
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:13,813
All right, all right.

104
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:18,184
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

105
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:19,852
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

106
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:21,654
It's not...
It's not what I do.

107
00:08:21,656 --> 00:08:23,189
Well, my mother
always told me

108
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:26,158
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

109
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,361
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

110
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,795
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

111
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:31,230
- Oh.
- That's you...

112
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:32,899
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

113
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,101
- Nah.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:35,302
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

115
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:37,304
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

116
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:39,773
That's what my mom told me.

117
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:41,807
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

118
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,045
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

119
00:08:45,047 --> 00:08:47,114
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

120
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:48,982
The guy you work for
is a complete...

121
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:51,051
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

122
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:52,686
and my firm works for him.

123
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:55,155
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

124
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:58,259
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

125
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:01,027
- A repeat?
- Of the <i>Daily Globe</i> incident.

126
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:02,763
Ow! Really?

127
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:04,565
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

128
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:05,866
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

129
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:07,268
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

130
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,804
No, I still have
currency in New York.

131
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:12,106
I was going places.

132
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:13,207
I wasn't running.

133
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:14,976
I was going places.

134
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:16,811
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

135
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:19,680
- Me?
- You are my home.

136
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:22,418
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

137
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:28,090
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

138
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:29,358
Let's just get the check.

139
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:59,089
I'm gonna get a drink.

140
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:44,770
Shh.

141
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:03,354
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

142
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:05,923
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

143
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:09,193
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

144
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:11,895
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

145
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:14,031
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

146
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:16,301
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

147
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:18,503
to go out there
and create things that others

148
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:20,905
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

149
00:11:20,907 --> 00:11:23,975
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

150
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:25,910
Come here. What's your name?

151
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:27,946
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

152
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:29,588
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

153
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:32,217
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

154
00:11:32,219 --> 00:11:34,287
But you know what?
In the end,

155
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:37,222
we're the ones
who change the world.

156
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:40,159
Take good care
of that, Allie.

157
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:41,926
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

158
00:11:41,928 --> 00:11:43,295
- Say hi.
- Hi.

159
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:44,497
Hello, kids.

160
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:46,532
Um, sorry to interrupt,

161
00:11:46,534 --> 00:11:48,900
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

162
00:11:48,902 --> 00:11:51,103
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

163
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:53,406
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

164
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:56,876
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

165
00:11:56,878 --> 00:11:58,757
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

166
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:00,582
<i>What do you say,
Mr. Drake,</i>

167
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:02,549
we just start
at the beginning?

168
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:04,586
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

169
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:08,120
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

170
00:12:08,122 --> 00:12:10,923
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

171
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:12,426
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

172
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:14,493
it tripled their
life expectancy.

173
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:16,163
But it's okay.

174
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:19,199
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

175
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:21,200
All right, you create

176
00:12:21,202 --> 00:12:22,903
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

177
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:24,572
- And then...
- Rockets.

178
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:26,576
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

179
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,578
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

180
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,111
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

181
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:32,946
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

182
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:34,549
is crucial
in our quest to cure

183
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:36,484
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

184
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:38,051
But if you think about
everything we've found...

185
00:12:38,053 --> 00:12:39,486
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

186
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:41,422
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

187
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:43,925
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

188
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:45,425
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

189
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:47,261
from your pharmaceutical
companies

190
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:49,062
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

191
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:50,263
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

192
00:12:50,265 --> 00:12:51,600
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

193
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:53,901
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

194
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:55,503
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

195
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,505
How does it...
How does it, um...

196
00:12:57,507 --> 00:12:59,440
I don't know,
how does it go about,

197
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:02,510
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

198
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:04,346
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

199
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:06,347
I'm talking
about the allegations.

200
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:07,950
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

201
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:09,450
your entire empire
has been built

202
00:13:09,452 --> 00:13:11,521
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

203
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:13,956
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

204
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,158
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

205
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,493
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

206
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,060
end up killing people.

207
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:20,563
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

208
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:21,930
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

209
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:23,365
Right. What about
the legal cases?

210
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,932
Sorry?

211
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:27,069
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

212
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:29,004
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

213
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:30,339
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

214
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:31,940
And they're just some
of the people who walked

215
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:33,942
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

216
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:35,612
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

217
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,312
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

218
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:38,581
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

219
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,383
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

220
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:41,251
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

221
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,117
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

222
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:42,985
Is that a threat?

223
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:44,623
Have a nice life.

224
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:50,292
I know what
you're going to say, but...

225
00:13:50,294 --> 00:13:52,962
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

226
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,997
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

227
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,537
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

228
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,974
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

229
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:06,713
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

230
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:09,680
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

231
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,247
We do the work.

232
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:13,720
We substantiate
our accusations.

233
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,020
We provide evidence.

234
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,356
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumbass.

235
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,297
You're fired, Eddie.

236
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,300
I can't trust you.

237
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,705
Have a nice life.

238
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,819
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

239
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,575
Hey.

240
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:38,577
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

241
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,110
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

242
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,145
Your ego requires
constant attention,

243
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,214
and you're stubborn as hell.

244
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,449
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

245
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,621
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

246
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,658
What you did
got me fired.

247
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,495
You used me.

248
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,539
Annie? Annie.

249
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:39,174
Oh, my God.

250
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,312
You're beautiful.

251
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:43,366
Test 36.

252
00:17:43,368 --> 00:17:44,902
Biological interactions

253
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:47,237
between two different organisms.

254
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:49,841
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

255
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:51,876
in order to survive
for any amount of time

256
00:17:51,878 --> 00:17:53,711
in an oxygen-rich environment.

257
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:54,914
Well, why are
all these hosts

258
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:56,682
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

259
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:58,651
That's what
we're trying to find out.

260
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:02,890
The bonding process
is starting.

261
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:09,395
It's equalizing.

262
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:18,469
But why? Why this rabbit?

263
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:20,942
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

264
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:23,909
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

265
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:26,477
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

266
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:30,348
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

267
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,653
but also we would
be able to survive there.

268
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,354
"We"?

269
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:38,490
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

270
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,458
to even begin to think
about something like...

271
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,894
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

272
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:44,396
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

273
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:46,078
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

274
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:47,934
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

275
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:49,804
Hey, how are your kids?

276
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,339
Let's begin human trials.

277
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,476
Good work.

278
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,933
Hey, Jack.

279
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:21,902
Do you ever feel
like your life

280
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:25,539
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

281
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,251
<i>Here at the Life Foundation,</i>

282
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:29,309
- <i>we've always believed...</i>
- Isn't that your buddy?

283
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:30,779
<i>...in finding the lessons
in our disappointments.</i>

284
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:32,478
<i>In the months
since our rocket failed,</i>

285
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,015
<i>we've learned so much.</i>

286
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:37,019
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

287
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:38,720
Some people
are trying to watch that.

288
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:40,023
Oh, you are, are you?

289
00:19:40,257 --> 00:19:42,626
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

290
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:46,029
I used to be.

291
00:19:46,263 --> 00:19:47,929
<i>We take
the same view of progress.</i>

292
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:50,565
<i>Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation</i>

293
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:53,536
<i>has now begun preparations
on its next launch.</i>

294
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:54,936
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

295
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:56,906
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

296
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:58,940
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

297
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:00,942
playing hard to get.

298
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:06,414
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

299
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,051
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

300
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:11,055
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

301
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,423
Cost you $5.

302
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:17,560
$5 for a paper that's free?

303
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:19,562
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

304
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:22,364
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

305
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:24,835
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

306
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:25,902
You did that for me?

307
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:27,504
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

308
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,575
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

309
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:34,010
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

310
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:35,678
I'll throw in the paper.

311
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,413
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

312
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:39,885
but not to sing,
all right?

313
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:41,651
Deal.

314
00:20:41,653 --> 00:20:43,553
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

315
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:47,389
No. You're welcome.

316
00:20:47,391 --> 00:20:49,693
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

317
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:51,962
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

318
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:53,964
you know, aches and pains.

319
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:55,133
You look like shit.

320
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:57,534
Excuse me?

321
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:58,904
You look like shit.

322
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:03,107
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

323
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:05,842
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

324
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:07,712
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

325
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:09,714
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

326
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:11,848
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

327
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:15,052
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

328
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:17,855
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

329
00:21:17,857 --> 00:21:19,590
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

330
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:20,758
That is the problem.

331
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:28,633
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

332
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:31,035
Please.

333
00:21:31,037 --> 00:21:32,502
Let's go.

334
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:34,184
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

335
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,045
The full payment is due.
Now.

336
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:42,147
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

337
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:43,851
I don't like to wait.

338
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:03,138
Life hurts, Eddie.

339
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:05,139
It just does.

340
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:25,490
I gotta go.

341
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:29,563
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

342
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:34,201
What a dick.

343
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:05,567
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

344
00:23:05,569 --> 00:23:07,101
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

345
00:23:07,103 --> 00:23:08,569
I can use a pseudonym.

346
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:10,038
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

347
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,039
I could be a woman.
Have you seen <i>Tootsie?</i>

348
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,946
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

349
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:20,817
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

350
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:32,260
<i>Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.</i>

351
00:23:32,262 --> 00:23:36,097
<i>Make the now the primary
focus of your life.</i>

352
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:38,566
<i>Any action is often better
than no action,</i>

353
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:40,202
<i>especially if you
have been stuck</i>

354
00:23:40,204 --> 00:23:43,939
<i>in an unhappy situation
for a long time.</i>

355
00:23:43,941 --> 00:23:46,942
<i>If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,</i>

356
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,577
<i>in which case
it's no longer...</i>

357
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,833
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

358
00:24:10,835 --> 00:24:15,272
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

359
00:24:15,274 --> 00:24:16,941
History starts now.

360
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,643
This is day one.

361
00:24:19,645 --> 00:24:22,913
This is first contact.

362
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:25,282
Let's get to work.

363
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,266
<i>Establishing subject baseline.</i>

364
00:24:42,301 --> 00:24:44,603
<i>All vital signs are normal.</i>

365
00:24:51,211 --> 00:24:53,344
Put me through.

366
00:24:53,346 --> 00:24:55,181
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

367
00:24:57,617 --> 00:24:58,983
There's no need.

368
00:24:58,985 --> 00:25:02,019
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

369
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:04,055
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

370
00:25:04,057 --> 00:25:06,190
<i>God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,</i>

371
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:08,926
<i>"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing</i>

372
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:12,096
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

373
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:14,165
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

374
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:17,238
<i>It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.</i>

375
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:24,776
<i>Now, I don't know what kind of
God would ask that of someone,</i>

376
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:26,111
<i>but it doesn't change
anything for me.</i>

377
00:25:26,113 --> 00:25:30,916
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

378
00:25:30,918 --> 00:25:33,819
Look around you.
Look at the world.

379
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:35,287
<i>What do you see?
War, poverty,</i>

380
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:37,424
<i>a planet on the brink
of collapse.</i>

381
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:40,726
<i>I would argue that God
has abandoned us.</i>

382
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:42,361
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

383
00:25:42,363 --> 00:25:45,397
<i>so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.</i>

384
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:47,935
<i>And this time, Isaac,
we can.</i>

385
00:25:52,307 --> 00:25:53,939
We will.

386
00:25:53,941 --> 00:25:57,012
<i>This time,
I will not abandon us.</i>

387
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:00,415
<i>Yes.</i>

388
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,319
Open it.

389
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,399
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

390
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:21,135
<i>Please let me... No.</i>

391
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:23,304
Oh, please, please, please!

392
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:43,457
His vitals are holding steady.

393
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:46,161
- Where the hell did it go?
<i>- Incredible.</i>

394
00:26:46,163 --> 00:26:47,731
<i>Where did it go?</i>

395
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:53,901
<i>Where is it?</i>

396
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:33,211
Bring in the next volunteer.

397
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:04,975
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

398
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:06,376
I was...

399
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:09,112
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

400
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:13,283
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

401
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:18,592
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

402
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:20,390
I mean...

403
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:22,195
You have to know
how to disappear.

404
00:28:23,896 --> 00:28:27,265
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

405
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:29,202
Whoever you are, you suck.

406
00:28:30,203 --> 00:28:32,169
Okay.

407
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:34,238
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

408
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,574
I need your help.

409
00:28:35,576 --> 00:28:37,275
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

410
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:39,010
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

411
00:28:39,012 --> 00:28:41,012
We're done.

412
00:28:41,014 --> 00:28:42,614
No...

413
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:45,950
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

414
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,019
Everything that you
accused him of,

415
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:49,354
you were right.
It's all true.

416
00:28:49,356 --> 00:28:50,888
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

417
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,957
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

418
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:55,293
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

419
00:28:55,295 --> 00:28:57,129
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

420
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,198
and they are dying.

421
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,299
They are all dying.

422
00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:02,870
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

423
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,039
Come here.

424
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:08,273
Why would I believe you?

425
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:09,441
Because it's true.

426
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:11,210
I believed in him, and I...

427
00:29:11,212 --> 00:29:13,145
I told myself
that it was worth it

428
00:29:13,147 --> 00:29:15,315
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

429
00:29:15,317 --> 00:29:16,677
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

430
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:18,183
I can't do that.

431
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:19,986
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

432
00:29:19,988 --> 00:29:21,621
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

433
00:29:21,623 --> 00:29:23,289
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

434
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,958
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

435
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,160
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

436
00:29:27,162 --> 00:29:29,530
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

437
00:29:29,532 --> 00:29:32,297
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

438
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:34,603
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

439
00:29:36,037 --> 00:29:38,138
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

440
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,440
genuinely,
and you have proof,

441
00:29:40,442 --> 00:29:43,510
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

442
00:29:43,512 --> 00:29:45,546
I am.

443
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:47,548
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

444
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,015
because I am done.

445
00:29:49,017 --> 00:29:50,385
I am done
with all of this shit.

446
00:29:51,254 --> 00:29:52,620
What shit?

447
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:55,589
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

448
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:57,160
All right? Good night.

449
00:30:16,345 --> 00:30:17,346
Eddie?

450
00:30:18,414 --> 00:30:19,716
Well, hey. Whoa.

451
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,983
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

452
00:30:22,985 --> 00:30:24,318
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

453
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,087
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

454
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,691
Eddie...

455
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:29,525
This is Dan.

456
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,561
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

457
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,295
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

458
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:34,937
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

459
00:30:34,965 --> 00:30:36,030
- Really?
- Yeah.

460
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,033
I'm a big fan of your work.

461
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:40,368
- Thank you.
- Really?

462
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,574
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

463
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,008
Yeah, I was one of them.

464
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:48,544
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

465
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,266
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

466
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:54,051
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

467
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:03,261
He has a key. You know he has a key?

468
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,630
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

469
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:12,101
Yeah. Well, uh...

470
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,504
So, uh, what you up to?

471
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:17,708

from being any of your business, right?

you know.

473

So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

474
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,281
No, he's a doctor.

475
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,319
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

476
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,319
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

477
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,756
I would say
that he misses you,

478
00:31:31,758 --> 00:31:33,524
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

479
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:35,225
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

480
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,628
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

doing here, Eddie?

483
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:41,279
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

484
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:44,267
A lot.

485
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,670
You know, we were gonna
get married.

486

That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

487

I can't really believe
that we're not...

No, we can't.

502
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:46,494
Yeah, got it, right.

503
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,531

away from an uninhabitable Earth.

504
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:52,366
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

505
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:54,468
to scout real estate.

506
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,337
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

507
00:33:56,339 --> 00:33:58,473
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

508
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:01,543
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

509
00:34:01,545 --> 00:34:04,379
On the way back,
they found a comet.

510
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:06,683
A comet?

511

Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

512

Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

513
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,488
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

514
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,926
You're talking about aliens?

515
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,560

Yes.

519
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,401
But we don't
call them that.

520
00:34:26,236 --> 00:34:28,270
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

521
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:30,941
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

522
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:35,411
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

523
00:34:35,413 --> 00:34:38,280
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

524
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:42,753
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

525
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:44,252
So they can live in space?

526

We call them hosts.

527
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,491
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:01,201
This is dead.

627
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:03,169
Dead.

628
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:04,803
Eddie, sit down.

629
00:43:04,805 --> 00:43:06,772
Okay, all right. Okay.

630
00:43:06,774 --> 00:43:08,340
- Hey, hey, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Stop that.

631
00:43:08,342 --> 00:43:09,976
- Sir, sir, sir, I'm so sorry.
- Eddie, quit it.

632
00:43:09,978 --> 00:43:11,110
Put it down. Eddie!

633
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:13,146
Snap out of it!

634
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:16,182
No.

635
00:43:16,184 --> 00:43:17,950
All right. It's no good.

636
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:19,385
Bobby,
are you all right?

637
00:43:19,387 --> 00:43:20,522
- Hey!
- Whoa!

638
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:22,421
Hey, hey, hey.

639
00:43:22,423 --> 00:43:23,503
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

640
00:43:25,126 --> 00:43:27,059
I'm hot.
Is anyone else hot?

641
00:43:27,061 --> 00:43:28,261
Are you hurt?

642
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:29,496
- Sir, excuse me.
- No! Shh!

643
00:43:29,498 --> 00:43:31,197
Wait,
where are you going? Eddie?

644
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,798
This is unacceptable.
I'm gonna call the police.

645
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,234
What are you doing?
No, please don't.

646
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,802
- No.
- Eddie, please.

647
00:43:35,804 --> 00:43:36,903
Oh, my God.

648
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,172
Ah.

649
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,379
- Now I'm gonna call the police.
- No, no. Please don't call the police.

650
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:47,459
Here, call an ambulance. I'm a doctor.
This man is my, um...

651
00:43:47,483 --> 00:43:49,149
Patient.

652
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:50,817
Oh, it's much better.

653
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:52,219
You are insane.

654
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:53,734
- He's killing people.
- Who's killing people?

655
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:55,155
- Carlton Drake.
- Oh, God, Eddie,

656
00:43:55,157 --> 00:43:56,323
- not this again.
- Yes, he is. He is!

657
00:43:56,325 --> 00:43:58,859
And I have proof!

658
00:43:58,861 --> 00:44:00,093
Ugh.

659
00:44:06,368 --> 00:44:09,005
- Hey, Eddie...
- Hmm?

660
00:44:14,144 --> 00:44:15,345
Eddie.

661
00:44:16,547 --> 00:44:17,946
Eddie?

662
00:44:19,082 --> 00:44:20,417
Eddie, can you hear me?

663
00:44:21,885 --> 00:44:23,005
This is Dan speaking to you.

664
00:44:24,254 --> 00:44:26,921
Hey, Dan.

665
00:44:26,923 --> 00:44:28,390
- <i>Welcome back.</i>
- Where am I?

666
00:44:28,392 --> 00:44:29,858
<i>Uh, you're in the MRI.</i>

667
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,426
<i>Okay, we've given you
a little sedative.</i>

668
00:44:31,428 --> 00:44:34,196
- Where is Anne?
- <i>Anne is not here right now.</i>

669
00:44:34,198 --> 00:44:35,600
<i>We're gonna run
some tests, okay?</i>

670
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,099
<i>It's gonna be completely
painless.</i>

671
00:44:37,101 --> 00:44:38,934
<i>So, you know,
just try to stay still.</i>

672
00:44:38,936 --> 00:44:40,605
<i>Uh, relax, and, um...</i>

673
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:42,905
<i>Yeah, here we go.</i>

674
00:44:49,113 --> 00:44:50,446
Eddie, what's happening
in there?

675
00:44:50,448 --> 00:44:52,047
<i>Eddie, you okay?</i>

676
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,053
Shut it down.

677
00:44:58,055 --> 00:45:01,123
Hey, hey, hey.

678
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,324
You're okay. Yeah.

679
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:04,461
Coming out. You all right?

680
00:45:04,463 --> 00:45:06,061
- Yeah.
- Here, look at me, look at me.

681
00:45:06,063 --> 00:45:07,564
- You okay?
- Yeah.

682
00:45:07,566 --> 00:45:09,499
- All right.
- Just take a deep breath. Okay? You're okay.

683
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:11,501
Yeah.

684
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:13,302
<i>Now, listen, you're not the
first person to freak out in there.</i>

685
00:45:13,304 --> 00:45:15,138
I get claustrophobic, too.

686
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,642
Dr. Lewis?

687
00:45:16,874 --> 00:45:19,008
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

688
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,578
Oh, I just saw Morris.

689
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,649
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

690
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:25,828
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

691
00:45:25,852 --> 00:45:27,917
Yeah, my pleasure.

692
00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:29,620
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

693
00:45:29,622 --> 00:45:31,221
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

694
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:33,290
Sorry. Gemini.

695
00:45:33,292 --> 00:45:34,924
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

696
00:45:34,926 --> 00:45:36,359
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

697
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:37,928
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

698
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,263
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

699
00:45:39,265 --> 00:45:40,905
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

700
00:45:43,002 --> 00:45:44,401
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

701
00:45:44,403 --> 00:45:45,636
Did you have
the same reactions

702
00:45:45,638 --> 00:45:47,304
regardless
of the temperature...

703
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,911
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

704
00:45:57,116 --> 00:45:59,250
The creature
and the host are one.

705
00:45:59,252 --> 00:46:00,687
Everything was fine.

706
00:46:00,921 --> 00:46:03,523
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

707
00:46:03,525 --> 00:46:06,525
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

708
00:46:06,527 --> 00:46:08,059
But the organism
is unaffected?

709
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:09,428
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

710
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,631
But once again,
it's killing the host.

711
00:46:11,633 --> 00:46:12,673
It's consuming his organs.

712
00:46:14,001 --> 00:46:15,335
Oh, watch this.

713
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:21,994
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

714
00:46:23,243 --> 00:46:26,244
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

715
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:28,684
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

716
00:46:30,184 --> 00:46:31,983
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

717
00:46:31,985 --> 00:46:33,425
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

718
00:46:34,288 --> 00:46:36,221
We're gonna need another host.

719
00:46:36,223 --> 00:46:38,257
Such poor design.

720
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:41,092
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

721
00:46:41,094 --> 00:46:42,362
Sorry to interrupt.

722
00:46:45,133 --> 00:46:46,735
Thought you'd like
some good news.

723
00:46:46,967 --> 00:46:48,671
I'm sorry.

724
00:46:59,414 --> 00:47:00,749
<i>Hungry!</i>

725
00:47:00,983 --> 00:47:03,149
Oh, goddamn.

726
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:05,051
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

727
00:47:05,053 --> 00:47:07,253
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

728
00:47:07,255 --> 00:47:08,555
Thank you.

729
00:47:08,557 --> 00:47:10,122
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

730
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:12,696
Until the cable car stops.

731
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:19,734
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

732
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,737
Excuse me.

733
00:47:27,076 --> 00:47:28,141
Oh, hey, Anne.

734
00:47:28,143 --> 00:47:31,112
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

735
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,782
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

736
00:47:33,015 --> 00:47:36,116
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

737
00:47:36,118 --> 00:47:37,754
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

738
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:39,721
but it would
explain the fever.

739
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,321
<i>That would make sense.</i>

740
00:47:41,323 --> 00:47:45,193
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

741
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,094
<i>Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.</i>

742
00:47:47,096 --> 00:47:48,463
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

743
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,098
<i>I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.</i>

744
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,333
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

745
00:47:52,335 --> 00:47:54,235
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

746
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:56,170
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

747
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:59,307
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

748
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,342
but super, super fast?

749
00:48:01,344 --> 00:48:03,111
<i>Yes. We just did.</i>

750
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,479
<i>Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like</i>

751
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,347
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

752
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:08,517
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

753
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:11,419
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

754
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,388
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

755
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,723
and we are gonna
clear that out.

756
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,292
- Yes.
<i>- Never gonna happen.</i>

757
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:18,797
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

758
00:48:19,031 --> 00:48:20,696
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- <i>I know.</i>

759
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:23,232
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

760
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,701
Who are you talking to?

761
00:48:24,703 --> 00:48:26,603
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

762
00:48:26,605 --> 00:48:29,505
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

763
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,256
Yeah?

764
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:47,898
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

765
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,794
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

766
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:51,294
Whatever.

767
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,232
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

768
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:58,674
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

769
00:49:00,673 --> 00:49:03,175
I was troubled by

770
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:05,811
what we've been doing.

771
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:07,612
I get it.

772
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:08,881
I get it.

773
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:11,583
We've all been troubled.

774
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:14,153
It's the nature
of what we do.

775
00:49:15,788 --> 00:49:18,859
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

776
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,861
I need that from you.

777
00:49:24,865 --> 00:49:27,398
I can't do that.

778
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,838
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

779
00:49:31,705 --> 00:49:33,139
your friend.

780
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:36,207
The person who was here.

781
00:49:36,209 --> 00:49:38,209
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

782
00:49:38,511 --> 00:49:40,747
You know that, right?

783
00:49:40,749 --> 00:49:43,247
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

784
00:49:43,249 --> 00:49:45,520
where you can help
to keep them alive.

785
00:49:48,555 --> 00:49:50,190
Hey. Dora.

786
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:54,663
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

787
00:49:57,899 --> 00:49:59,199
Will you trust me?

788
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,740
Eddie Brock.

789
00:50:07,742 --> 00:50:08,910
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

790
00:50:18,553 --> 00:50:20,255
You were our best.

791
00:50:20,855 --> 00:50:22,589
Open it.

792
00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:27,928
No! No!

793
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,932
No! No! No!

794
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,539
<i>Do not open that door.</i>

795
00:50:38,174 --> 00:50:39,372
Huh?

796
00:50:51,854 --> 00:50:53,922
Stay put.

797
00:50:53,924 --> 00:50:55,790
- Hey, Eddie.
<i>- Who the hell is this guy?</i>

798
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,994
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

799
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,928
Whoa.

800
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,697
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- I'm, uh...

801
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:04,398
I'm putting my hands up.

802
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,701
<i>You are making us
look bad.</i>

803
00:51:06,703 --> 00:51:09,671
I...
No, I am not.

804
00:51:09,673 --> 00:51:10,974
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

805
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,607
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Yes, you are!</i>

806
00:51:12,609 --> 00:51:14,309
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>

807
00:51:14,311 --> 00:51:16,310
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

808
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:18,512
- Eddie...
<i>- I will take care of this myself.</i>

809
00:51:18,514 --> 00:51:20,414
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

810
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,220
Take him down.

811
00:51:34,397 --> 00:51:35,800
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

812
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:47,011
- What is that?
<i>- Not "what." Who.</i>

813
00:51:48,713 --> 00:51:49,847
Oh.

814
00:51:59,357 --> 00:52:00,358
Shit.

815
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:24,614
<i>Outstanding.</i>

816
00:52:24,616 --> 00:52:26,650
<i>Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.</i>

817
00:52:26,652 --> 00:52:27,751
Why would we do that?

818
00:52:27,753 --> 00:52:30,557
<i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i>

819
00:52:37,797 --> 00:52:39,398
What the shit, man?

820
00:52:45,071 --> 00:52:47,006
No! No, no, no!

821
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:55,813
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

822
00:52:55,815 --> 00:52:58,084
Apparently, I have a parasite.

823
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,096
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

824
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:10,764
<i>Connecting you
to the feed now.</i>

825
00:53:15,936 --> 00:53:17,636
He's achieved symbiosis.

826
00:53:17,638 --> 00:53:19,072
Are you seeing this?

827
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:21,075
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

828
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,076
Treece...

829
00:53:24,078 --> 00:53:26,081
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

830
00:53:34,556 --> 00:53:35,790
<i>Eddie.</i>

831
00:53:45,466 --> 00:53:47,834
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

832
00:53:47,836 --> 00:53:49,936
It's not real.
You're in my head.

833
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:51,504
'Cause you're just a parasite.

834
00:53:51,506 --> 00:53:52,541
"Parasite"?

835
00:53:59,749 --> 00:54:01,817
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

836
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:07,788
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

837
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:09,590
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

838
00:54:09,592 --> 00:54:11,992
We can discuss this
like two men.

839
00:54:11,994 --> 00:54:13,495
What is that? What is that?

840
00:54:21,938 --> 00:54:24,005
What?

841
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:26,472
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

842
00:54:26,474 --> 00:54:29,009
<i>Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.</i>

843
00:54:29,011 --> 00:54:30,112
Launch the drones.

844
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:01,609
<i>Duck.</i>

845
00:55:02,981 --> 00:55:04,613
Whew!

846
00:55:04,615 --> 00:55:06,517
- Thank you.
<i>- You are welcome.</i>

847
00:55:12,557 --> 00:55:14,726
Oh!

848
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:25,347
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

849
00:55:32,077 --> 00:55:33,811
Oh, God, no!

850
00:55:56,035 --> 00:55:57,834
Holy shit!

851
00:56:05,077 --> 00:56:07,111
Treece, do not
let him get away.

852
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,582
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

853
00:56:15,687 --> 00:56:17,824
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

854
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,627
Oh, God! Do something!

855
00:56:28,168 --> 00:56:29,169
What the...

856
00:56:35,843 --> 00:56:38,145
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

857
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,316
No, no, no! No, no!

858
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:47,807
No! You're out of your mind!

859
00:56:49,757 --> 00:56:52,093
No!

860
00:57:11,947 --> 00:57:13,915
- That is a dead-end!
<i>- Not for us.</i>

861
00:57:15,617 --> 00:57:17,719
Whoa!

862
00:57:23,892 --> 00:57:24,893
Yeah!

863
00:57:54,857 --> 00:57:56,025
Whoa!

864
00:58:02,865 --> 00:58:04,298
I am going to die!

865
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,736
<i>You are not
going to die!</i>

866
00:58:17,814 --> 00:58:20,117
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

867
00:58:29,661 --> 00:58:30,926
I got him.

868
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:31,993
<i>- Bring him home.</i>
- Copy that.

869
00:58:31,995 --> 00:58:33,931
This is incredible.

870
00:58:40,237 --> 00:58:43,139
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

871
00:58:43,141 --> 00:58:46,177
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

872
00:58:57,989 --> 00:59:01,958
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

873
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,429
So many snacks,
so little time.

874
00:59:15,074 --> 00:59:17,006
SFPD. Don't move!

875
00:59:17,008 --> 00:59:18,176
Get off the car!

876
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,996
My legs.

877
00:59:38,265 --> 00:59:40,130
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

878
00:59:40,132 --> 00:59:42,535
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

879
00:59:57,884 --> 00:59:59,817
What the hell
are you?

880
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:02,287
I am Venom.

881
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:05,056
And you are mine.

882
01:00:05,058 --> 01:00:07,425
You bit somebody's head off.

883
01:00:07,427 --> 01:00:09,495
Fuel in the tank.

884
01:00:09,497 --> 01:00:11,532
Listen carefully, Eddie.

885
01:00:11,767 --> 01:00:13,999
You did not find us.

886
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:16,571
We found you.

887
01:00:16,804 --> 01:00:18,837
Think of yourself
as my ride.

888
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:20,105
Where are you going?

889
01:00:20,107 --> 01:00:23,208
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

890
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:25,177
You remember him.

891
01:00:25,179 --> 01:00:26,578
How do you even know
about that?

892
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,081
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

893
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,916
- Everything about you.
- How?

894
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:33,352
I am inside your head.

895
01:00:33,354 --> 01:00:35,922
You are a loser, Eddie.

896
01:00:40,494 --> 01:00:43,263
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

897
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:44,564
Most likely.

898
01:00:44,566 --> 01:00:46,031
Oh, God.

899
01:00:46,033 --> 01:00:49,035
That is why we are here.

900
01:00:49,037 --> 01:00:52,341
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

901
01:00:53,508 --> 01:00:55,611
That is the deal.

902
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:00,447
<i>Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

903
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:02,349
<i>Welcome to San Francisco.</i>

904
01:01:02,351 --> 01:01:04,391
<i>For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...</i>

905
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:27,074
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

906
01:01:27,076 --> 01:01:28,908
<i>- Where's Eddie?</i>
- Why? What's happening?

907
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,980
I got Eddie's labs back,

908
01:01:32,382 --> 01:01:34,315
and it's worse than I thought.

909
01:01:34,317 --> 01:01:37,485
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

910
01:01:37,487 --> 01:01:39,220
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

911
01:01:39,222 --> 01:01:41,021
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

912
01:01:41,023 --> 01:01:42,659
- You need to get him here.
- <i>My God.</i>

913
01:01:46,631 --> 01:01:48,464
- <i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i>
- Shit.

914
01:01:55,005 --> 01:01:58,340
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

915
01:01:58,342 --> 01:02:00,509
- Where was he?
- I was...

916
01:02:00,511 --> 01:02:04,516
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

917
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:06,584
The arrogance.

918
01:02:12,322 --> 01:02:16,560
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

919
01:02:16,562 --> 01:02:18,696
not until we find
another suitable host.

920
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:23,331
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

921
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:30,339
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

922
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:32,442
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

923
01:02:32,444 --> 01:02:33,509
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

924
01:02:33,511 --> 01:02:35,445
Found another one, Bill.

925
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:37,346
Get off the streets.
Go home.

926
01:02:37,348 --> 01:02:39,048
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

927
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:40,084
Bodies?

928
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,488
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

929
01:02:46,491 --> 01:02:48,458
<i>Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.</i>

930
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,394
That is none of your
goddamn business.

931
01:02:50,396 --> 01:02:52,732
<i>Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.</i>

932
01:02:52,964 --> 01:02:54,531
<i>We have no secrets.</i>

933
01:02:54,533 --> 01:02:56,166
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

934
01:02:56,168 --> 01:02:57,669
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

935
01:02:57,671 --> 01:03:01,205
<i>Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.</i>

936
01:03:01,207 --> 01:03:03,006
Shit. Yeah?

937
01:03:03,008 --> 01:03:04,952
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

938
01:03:04,976 --> 01:03:06,711
No, no, you can't see me.

939
01:03:06,713 --> 01:03:09,012
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

940
01:03:09,014 --> 01:03:10,582
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

941
01:03:10,584 --> 01:03:13,151
You cannot come
near me right now.

942
01:03:13,153 --> 01:03:14,753
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
<i>- No!</i>

943
01:03:14,955 --> 01:03:16,453
- Eddie?
<i>- No, I gotta go up there.</i>

944
01:03:16,455 --> 01:03:17,488
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

945
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:18,758
I got to get up there, man.

946
01:03:18,992 --> 01:03:21,058
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

947
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,427
There's no such thing
as can't.

948
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:23,598
I'm sorry, man.

949
01:03:24,531 --> 01:03:27,031
Okay, okay... Uh...

950
01:03:27,033 --> 01:03:29,334
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

951
01:03:29,336 --> 01:03:32,270
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

952
01:03:32,272 --> 01:03:34,573
<i>- Let's eat his brains.</i>
- No! You do not touch him!

953
01:03:34,575 --> 01:03:36,575
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

954
01:03:36,577 --> 01:03:38,644
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

955
01:03:38,646 --> 01:03:40,144
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

956
01:03:40,146 --> 01:03:41,680
<i>- "We"?</i>
- Yeah.

957
01:03:41,682 --> 01:03:43,762
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

958
01:03:45,452 --> 01:03:47,287
Yeah.

959
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:55,596
- Shit.
<i>- You want up?</i>

960
01:03:59,367 --> 01:04:01,703
<i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i>

961
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:14,816
Hmm.

962
01:04:15,049 --> 01:04:18,250
- It is peaceful up here.
<i>- I'm not very good with heights.</i>

963
01:04:18,252 --> 01:04:22,455
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

964
01:04:22,457 --> 01:04:24,794
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

965
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,192
<i>What does that mean?</i>

966
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:36,168
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

967
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:48,481
<i>I got us.</i>

968
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:49,586
Whoa.

969
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:58,627
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

970
01:04:58,629 --> 01:05:00,762
<i>You die, I die.</i>

971
01:05:00,764 --> 01:05:03,164
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

972
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:05,667
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

973
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:07,569
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

974
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,572
<i>You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.</i>

975
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:12,741
<i>Plus, I am starting
to like you.</i>

976
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:14,210
<i>You and I
are not so different.</i>

977
01:05:14,812 --> 01:05:15,879
Thank you.

978
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,784
Okay.

979
01:05:22,754 --> 01:05:24,253
Here's your evidence.

980
01:05:28,191 --> 01:05:29,392
<i>Jump.</i>

981
01:05:32,196 --> 01:05:33,563
<i>Pussy.</i>

982
01:05:43,675 --> 01:05:44,809
Hands!

983
01:05:46,745 --> 01:05:48,479
On the ground! Now!

984
01:05:52,885 --> 01:05:55,718
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

985
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,787
- Mask!
- Copy!

986
01:05:57,789 --> 01:06:00,288
All right,
have it your own way.

987
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,927
- Mask!
<i>- Copy.</i>

988
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,694
What the hell
is that thing?

989
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,468
What the hell?

990
01:06:11,704 --> 01:06:13,302
Hold your fire!

991
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:15,438
Flares!

992
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,540
He's there!
He's there!

993
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:17,743
Reload!

994
01:06:18,844 --> 01:06:20,577
Anybody see him?

995
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:33,424
Does anyone have eyes on him?

996
01:06:35,161 --> 01:06:37,263
<i>Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.</i>

997
01:06:50,877 --> 01:06:52,610
I don't have
eyes on him.

998
01:06:54,313 --> 01:06:55,381
Where is it?

999
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:03,488
Flash grenade!

1000
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:05,891
Throw them!

1001
01:07:05,893 --> 01:07:07,424
Flash grenade!

1002
01:07:18,472 --> 01:07:19,739
He's in the rafters!

1003
01:07:19,741 --> 01:07:20,806
Above!

1004
01:07:26,247 --> 01:07:27,280
There he is!

1005
01:07:31,919 --> 01:07:33,354
Move, move, move!

1006
01:08:03,318 --> 01:08:05,018
<i>No! We do not
eat policemen!</i>

1007
01:08:11,393 --> 01:08:12,894
Annie! Annie, wait!

1008
01:08:12,896 --> 01:08:14,728
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1009
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:17,397
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1010
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:19,867
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1011
01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:21,468
- "He"?
- Yes.

1012
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:23,905
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1013
01:08:23,907 --> 01:08:26,609
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1014
01:08:28,978 --> 01:08:31,681
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1015
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:36,451
Right now.

1016
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:42,455
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1017
01:08:42,457 --> 01:08:43,526
Get in the car, Eddie.

1018
01:08:45,629 --> 01:08:48,699
- In the back.
<i>- I like her. Get in.</i>

1019
01:08:55,773 --> 01:08:57,875
I'm out of control.

1020
01:08:59,543 --> 01:09:01,044
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1021
01:09:01,046 --> 01:09:02,880
<i>- No MRI.</i>
- No. No. No MRI.

1022
01:09:03,582 --> 01:09:05,082
What? Why?

1023
01:09:05,316 --> 01:09:07,415
<i>Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.</i>

1024
01:09:08,986 --> 01:09:12,755
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1025
01:09:12,757 --> 01:09:15,558
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1026
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,129
- Not all sounds.
<i>- And fire.</i>

1027
01:09:18,361 --> 01:09:21,398
Fire. And fire.
He's talking to you?

1028
01:09:23,001 --> 01:09:24,435
Always.

1029
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:27,705
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1030
01:09:27,707 --> 01:09:30,405
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1031
01:09:30,407 --> 01:09:32,709
I'm hungry all the time.

1032
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:36,048
<i>And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?</i>

1033
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,048
Get out of my head, man.

1034
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,518
<i>You never apologized.</i>

1035
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,123
<i>You might not live
to get another chance.</i>

1036
01:09:49,996 --> 01:09:51,828
Annie.

1037
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:55,498
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1038
01:09:55,500 --> 01:10:01,504
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1039
01:10:01,506 --> 01:10:03,109
I am truly, truly sorry.

1040
01:10:04,509 --> 01:10:06,579
And that I love you.

1041
01:10:07,147 --> 01:10:09,780
Oh, Eddie...

1042
01:10:09,782 --> 01:10:12,884
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1043
01:10:12,886 --> 01:10:15,520
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>

1044
01:10:18,725 --> 01:10:23,628
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1045
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:26,831
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1046
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:27,901
Thank you.

1047
01:10:46,521 --> 01:10:47,555
Hello?

1048
01:10:58,766 --> 01:11:00,102
What are you doing here?

1049
01:11:03,805 --> 01:11:04,807
Are you lost?

1050
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:08,977
I'm not lost.

1051
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:18,051
Thanks for coming in.

1052
01:11:18,053 --> 01:11:21,555
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1053
01:11:21,557 --> 01:11:24,225
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

1054
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:26,960
<i>Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.</i>

1055
01:11:26,962 --> 01:11:28,263
I don't want you to fix it.

1056
01:11:28,496 --> 01:11:29,830
<i>I can heal you.</i>

1057
01:11:32,034 --> 01:11:33,735
Can you fix it?

1058
01:11:33,737 --> 01:11:35,669
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1059
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:37,871
- This parasite, whatever this is...
<i>- "Parasite"?</i>

1060
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:39,172
It's eating you
from the inside.

1061
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:40,808
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1062
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:42,910
- You're using him up.
<i>- No. She is wrong.</i>

1063
01:11:42,912 --> 01:11:45,946
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1064
01:11:45,948 --> 01:11:48,548
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
<i>- No!</i>

1065
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,151
You're killing him.

1066
01:11:50,153 --> 01:11:51,619
<i>They do not know
what they are talking about.</i>

1067
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:53,186
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1068
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:54,748
- Oh, God!
<i>- We have to get out of here.</i>

1069
01:11:56,059 --> 01:11:57,125
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1070
01:11:57,127 --> 01:11:58,287
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1071
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:03,833
No! Don't do that!

1072
01:12:19,016 --> 01:12:22,050
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1073
01:12:22,052 --> 01:12:23,320
What is that?

1074
01:12:30,294 --> 01:12:33,262
You were killing me?

1075
01:12:33,264 --> 01:12:36,333
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1076
01:12:38,169 --> 01:12:42,840
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1077
01:12:44,075 --> 01:12:45,209
We're done.

1078
01:12:47,578 --> 01:12:49,946
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1079
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:51,714
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1080
01:12:51,716 --> 01:12:53,796
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1081
01:12:56,654 --> 01:12:58,188
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1082
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:02,092
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1083
01:13:02,094 --> 01:13:04,327
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1084
01:13:04,329 --> 01:13:07,298
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1085
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:11,034
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1086
01:13:11,036 --> 01:13:12,769
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1087
01:13:12,771 --> 01:13:14,904
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1088
01:13:14,906 --> 01:13:16,174
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1089
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:20,979
Dan.

1090
01:13:27,819 --> 01:13:29,054
Where is it?

1091
01:13:54,982 --> 01:13:56,984
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1092
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:26,811
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1093
01:14:26,813 --> 01:14:31,416
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1094
01:14:31,418 --> 01:14:35,456
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1095
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:37,990
Whoo!

1096
01:14:39,662 --> 01:14:43,330
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1097
01:14:52,908 --> 01:14:54,975
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1098
01:14:54,977 --> 01:14:58,010
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1099
01:14:58,012 --> 01:15:01,915
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1100
01:15:01,917 --> 01:15:03,849
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1101
01:15:03,851 --> 01:15:05,319
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1102
01:15:05,321 --> 01:15:07,087
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1103
01:15:07,089 --> 01:15:10,257
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1104
01:15:10,259 --> 01:15:12,826
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1105
01:15:12,828 --> 01:15:14,261
It can't go on.

1106
01:15:14,263 --> 01:15:16,798
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1107
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,799
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1108
01:15:18,801 --> 01:15:20,470
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1109
01:15:20,704 --> 01:15:24,404
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1110
01:15:24,406 --> 01:15:26,207
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1111
01:15:28,143 --> 01:15:30,410
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1112
01:15:30,412 --> 01:15:32,914
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1113
01:15:32,916 --> 01:15:37,418
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1114
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,854
Man and Symbiote combined.

1115
01:15:39,856 --> 01:15:42,423
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1116
01:15:42,425 --> 01:15:45,493
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1117
01:15:45,495 --> 01:15:48,896
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1118
01:15:48,898 --> 01:15:50,198
It's not a lot of fun.

1119
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,801
And then I find out,
all along,

1120
01:15:52,803 --> 01:15:54,203
that they're killing you.

1121
01:15:54,205 --> 01:15:55,937
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1122
01:15:55,939 --> 01:15:58,474
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1123
01:15:58,476 --> 01:16:01,010
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1124
01:16:01,012 --> 01:16:02,513
Where's Venom?

1125
01:16:02,747 --> 01:16:06,314
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1126
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:16,191
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1127
01:16:16,193 --> 01:16:18,861
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1128
01:16:18,863 --> 01:16:23,098
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1129
01:16:31,343 --> 01:16:36,549
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1130
01:16:36,783 --> 01:16:40,183
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1131
01:16:40,185 --> 01:16:42,387
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1132
01:16:44,423 --> 01:16:46,189
Where we lead.

1133
01:16:46,191 --> 01:16:47,924
Yes, "we."

1134
01:16:47,926 --> 01:16:51,196
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1135
01:16:52,565 --> 01:16:54,133
I can take care of that.

1136
01:16:59,171 --> 01:17:02,173
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1137
01:17:02,175 --> 01:17:03,176
Shut up.

1138
01:17:07,013 --> 01:17:08,615
Not so tough
without your friend.

1139
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,188
Did your mama not love you?

1140
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:19,558
God damn it!

1141
01:17:21,427 --> 01:17:24,596
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1142
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,599
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1143
01:17:26,601 --> 01:17:28,366
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1144
01:17:28,368 --> 01:17:29,568
in this world than you and me.

1145
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:32,605
Much bigger than me.

1146
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:37,111
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1147
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,313
Karma's a bitch.

1148
01:17:41,315 --> 01:17:42,550
I don't believe in karma.

1149
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:46,286
Oh! Ooh!

1150
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:52,057
Hi, Eddie.

1151
01:17:52,059 --> 01:17:54,093
Whoa. Whoa...

1152
01:17:54,095 --> 01:17:56,928
Oh...

1153
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:57,931
Mmm...

1154
01:17:58,967 --> 01:18:00,168
Mmm!

1155
01:18:16,418 --> 01:18:17,586
Oh, no.

1156
01:18:19,187 --> 01:18:21,588
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1157
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:24,091
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1158
01:18:24,093 --> 01:18:26,695
<i>- The one with Drake is Riot.</i>
- Who's Riot?

1159
01:18:26,928 --> 01:18:29,429
<i>Riot is what you would call
a team leader.</i>

1160
01:18:29,431 --> 01:18:31,497
<i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i>

1161
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:33,819
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
<i>- He is unstoppable.</i>

1162
01:18:33,935 --> 01:18:35,501
- Oh, great.
<i>- We have got to go!</i>

1163
01:18:35,503 --> 01:18:37,204
Go where? Where we going?

1164
01:18:37,206 --> 01:18:38,640
- Well, I'm coming with you.
<i>- No!</i>

1165
01:18:38,642 --> 01:18:40,542
<i>It's going to get ugly.</i>

1166
01:18:40,544 --> 01:18:43,024
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1167
01:18:44,413 --> 01:18:45,981
Not today.

1168
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:49,051
Oh, that's bullshit!

1169
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:52,722
This is not a simulation.

1170
01:18:52,956 --> 01:18:55,122
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1171
01:18:55,124 --> 01:18:57,560
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1172
01:18:57,562 --> 01:18:59,293
- You?
- Yes, me.

1173
01:18:59,295 --> 01:19:00,995
How long?

1174
01:19:00,997 --> 01:19:02,697
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1175
01:19:02,699 --> 01:19:06,069
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1176
01:19:08,305 --> 01:19:09,406
I'm not alone.

1177
01:19:13,043 --> 01:19:16,344
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1178
01:19:16,346 --> 01:19:18,313
<i>It is not safe for her.</i>

1179
01:19:18,315 --> 01:19:19,717
<i>If we do not stop Riot,</i>

1180
01:19:19,951 --> 01:19:23,351
<i>he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.</i>

1181
01:19:23,353 --> 01:19:27,724
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1182
01:19:27,726 --> 01:19:29,966
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1183
01:19:29,994 --> 01:19:31,694
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1184
01:19:31,696 --> 01:19:33,462
- on a whole planet?
<i>- Yes!</i>

1185
01:19:33,464 --> 01:19:35,665
<i>But it is
different now, Eddie.</i>

1186
01:19:35,667 --> 01:19:38,234
- <i>I have decided to stay.</i>
- Wow!

1187
01:19:38,236 --> 01:19:41,269
<i>On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.</i>

1188
01:19:41,271 --> 01:19:43,775
- <i>But here, we could be more.</i>
- Excuse me?

1189
01:19:44,008 --> 01:19:45,742
<i>And I'm getting to
like it here.</i>

1190
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:48,410
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1191
01:19:48,412 --> 01:19:51,046
<i>However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.</i>

1192
01:19:51,048 --> 01:19:54,786
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1193
01:19:55,052 --> 01:19:57,152
- then it's back to "we."
<i>- It is "we."</i>

1194
01:19:57,154 --> 01:19:59,556
<i>Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.</i>

1195
01:19:59,558 --> 01:20:01,258
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1196
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:02,740
What really made you
change your mind?

1197
01:20:06,532 --> 01:20:09,501
You. You did, Eddie.

1198
01:20:11,503 --> 01:20:14,170
Scrub diagnostics.

1199
01:20:14,172 --> 01:20:16,543
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1200
01:20:23,248 --> 01:20:26,316
<i>T-minus
five minutes to launch.</i>

1201
01:20:26,318 --> 01:20:28,655
<i>Auto sequence has been
initiated.</i>

1202
01:20:41,366 --> 01:20:42,736
Oh, shit.

1203
01:20:52,312 --> 01:20:55,248
<i>T-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1204
01:21:02,723 --> 01:21:06,490
<i>Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?</i>

1205
01:21:06,492 --> 01:21:09,193
He has got shit
you have never seen.

1206
01:21:09,195 --> 01:21:11,295
<i>What does that mean?
What are our chances?</i>

1207
01:21:11,297 --> 01:21:14,733
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1208
01:21:14,735 --> 01:21:17,639
<i>Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.</i>

1209
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,744
<i>T-minus four minutes.</i>

1210
01:21:26,447 --> 01:21:29,249
<i>Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.</i>

1211
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:35,354
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1212
01:21:35,356 --> 01:21:39,492
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1213
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:40,828
Then die.

1214
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:53,574
<i>- Holy shit!</i>
- Told you.

1215
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:55,210
<i>T-minus three minutes.</i>

1216
01:22:07,657 --> 01:22:09,190
You have a strong host.

1217
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:12,795
But not strong enough.

1218
01:22:51,569 --> 01:22:54,301
<i>T-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1219
01:22:56,506 --> 01:22:57,642
Eddie.

1220
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,548
Drake, stop!

1221
01:24:09,817 --> 01:24:12,285
Told you I could fight ugly.

1222
01:24:19,425 --> 01:24:21,729
<i>T-minus one minute.</i>

1223
01:24:39,714 --> 01:24:41,412
You're too late.

1224
01:24:41,414 --> 01:24:42,415
This is the next stage...

1225
01:24:44,485 --> 01:24:46,721
You talk too much.

1226
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:58,065
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

1227
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,935
You are nothing.

1228
01:25:28,598 --> 01:25:29,899
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1229
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:31,801
<i>Nine...</i>

1230
01:25:32,635 --> 01:25:33,703
<i>Eight...</i>

1231
01:25:34,637 --> 01:25:35,638
<i>Seven...</i>

1232
01:25:36,404 --> 01:25:37,405
<i>Six...</i>

1233
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:38,975
<i>Five...</i>

1234
01:25:39,776 --> 01:25:41,407
<i>Four...</i>

1235
01:25:41,409 --> 01:25:42,943
<i>Three...</i>

1236
01:25:42,945 --> 01:25:44,812
<i>Two...</i>

1237
01:25:44,814 --> 01:25:46,817
<i>One...</i>

1238
01:25:48,618 --> 01:25:49,785
<i>Liftoff.</i>

1239
01:25:57,127 --> 01:25:58,760
Traitor!

1240
01:25:58,762 --> 01:26:00,529
Have a nice life.

1241
01:26:26,823 --> 01:26:28,191
<i>Goodbye, Eddie.</i>

1242
01:26:29,459 --> 01:26:30,895
Venom, no!

1243
01:27:18,944 --> 01:27:22,914
Thanks for sticking by me, Annie.
Thanks for saving me.

1244
01:27:22,916 --> 01:27:24,513
So, how you feeling
after all that?

1245
01:27:24,516 --> 01:27:26,252
I feel great. Awesome.

1246
01:27:26,485 --> 01:27:28,253
Wow.

1247
01:27:28,487 --> 01:27:30,154
Yeah, I'm thinking of suing, though.
You want to prosecute?

1248
01:27:30,156 --> 01:27:33,658
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1249
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:35,660
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1250
01:27:35,662 --> 01:27:37,627
You're a good person, Annie.

1251
01:27:37,629 --> 01:27:39,130
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1252
01:27:39,132 --> 01:27:40,965
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1253
01:27:40,967 --> 01:27:43,001
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1254
01:27:43,003 --> 01:27:45,103
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1255
01:27:45,105 --> 01:27:49,541
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1256
01:27:49,543 --> 01:27:51,643
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1257
01:27:51,645 --> 01:27:53,979
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1258
01:27:53,981 --> 01:27:56,615
Oh! Like everyone else.

1259
01:27:56,617 --> 01:27:57,618
Yeah.

1260
01:28:00,054 --> 01:28:02,289
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1261
01:28:03,990 --> 01:28:05,191
Hey, um...

1262
01:28:07,862 --> 01:28:09,695
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1263
01:28:09,697 --> 01:28:12,900
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1264
01:28:14,535 --> 01:28:18,271
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1265
01:28:18,273 --> 01:28:20,675
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1266
01:28:23,177 --> 01:28:25,547
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1267
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,614
I mean, the...

1268
01:28:27,616 --> 01:28:31,151
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1269
01:28:31,153 --> 01:28:32,719
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1270
01:28:32,721 --> 01:28:33,822
Okay.

1271
01:28:35,123 --> 01:28:36,723
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1272
01:28:36,725 --> 01:28:38,958
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1273
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,695
<i>Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.</i>

1274
01:28:42,697 --> 01:28:45,632
No, I don't think so.

1275
01:28:45,634 --> 01:28:48,101
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1276
01:28:48,103 --> 01:28:49,903
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1277
01:28:49,905 --> 01:28:52,307
- Nope.
<i>- You belong with us, Annie.</i>

1278
01:28:52,542 --> 01:28:54,075
Eddie, are you sure?

1279
01:28:54,077 --> 01:28:56,076
Good Lord, look at that.

1280
01:28:56,078 --> 01:28:58,213
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1281
01:28:59,982 --> 01:29:02,149
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1282
01:29:02,151 --> 01:29:04,286
You take care, all right?

1283
01:29:04,555 --> 01:29:06,355
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1284
01:29:10,293 --> 01:29:13,727
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1285
01:29:13,729 --> 01:29:14,897
Either of you.

1286
01:29:15,631 --> 01:29:16,997
We won't.

1287
01:29:16,999 --> 01:29:18,699
<i>- Who is that guy?</i>
- Okay.

1288
01:29:18,701 --> 01:29:21,268
<i>Wait.
This thing looks delicious.</i>

1289
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:23,938
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1290
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:26,874
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1291
01:29:26,876 --> 01:29:30,644
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1292
01:29:30,646 --> 01:29:32,382
<i>- I cannot?</i>
- No, you cannot.

1293
01:29:32,616 --> 01:29:34,315
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1294
01:29:34,317 --> 01:29:37,886
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1295
01:29:37,888 --> 01:29:40,188
And then there are bad people.

1296
01:29:40,190 --> 01:29:42,057
You have to tell
the difference.

1297
01:29:42,059 --> 01:29:45,927
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1298
01:29:45,929 --> 01:29:49,297
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1299
01:29:49,299 --> 01:29:51,733
eat very, very bad people,

1300
01:29:51,735 --> 01:29:54,404
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1301
01:29:54,638 --> 01:29:57,005
<i>- Fine.</i>
- Good.

1302
01:29:57,007 --> 01:29:58,774
<i>But how does one
tell the difference?</i>

1303
01:29:58,776 --> 01:30:00,876
Well, it's super simple.

1304
01:30:00,878 --> 01:30:03,779
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1305
01:30:03,781 --> 01:30:05,848
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1306
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:07,283
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

1307
01:30:07,285 --> 01:30:09,352
<i>But can we get something to
eat now?</i>

1308
01:30:09,354 --> 01:30:14,789
<i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i>

1309
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:17,095
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1310
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:20,965
Hey, Mrs. C.

1311
01:30:22,033 --> 01:30:23,733
How you doing, Eddie?

1312
01:30:23,735 --> 01:30:25,302
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1313
01:30:25,304 --> 01:30:28,271
No.

1314
01:30:28,273 --> 01:30:31,410
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1315
01:30:31,644 --> 01:30:33,309
<i>Tater tots
and chocolate.</i>

1316
01:30:33,311 --> 01:30:34,978
Right. Okay, no problem.

1317
01:30:36,248 --> 01:30:37,815
The payment's due, Chen.

1318
01:30:39,318 --> 01:30:41,317
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1319
01:30:41,319 --> 01:30:42,886
Now.

1320
01:30:42,888 --> 01:30:44,456
<i>- Bad guy, right?</i>
- Yep.

1321
01:30:51,997 --> 01:30:54,064
You come in here again...

1322
01:30:54,066 --> 01:30:58,735
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1323
01:30:58,737 --> 01:31:02,239
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1324
01:31:02,241 --> 01:31:04,241
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1325
01:31:04,243 --> 01:31:07,312
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1326
01:31:07,314 --> 01:31:09,214
- Please...
- Yes.

1327
01:31:09,216 --> 01:31:13,117
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1328
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:17,889
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1329
01:31:17,891 --> 01:31:20,260
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1330
01:31:22,162 --> 01:31:24,731
We are Venom.

1331
01:31:26,266 --> 01:31:28,335
- On second thought...
- Please.

1332
01:31:35,408 --> 01:31:37,809
Eddie? What was that?

1333
01:31:37,811 --> 01:31:39,210
Oh...

1334
01:31:39,212 --> 01:31:43,017
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1335
01:31:44,352 --> 01:31:45,884
<i>- "Parasite"?</i>
- Yeah.

1336
01:31:45,886 --> 01:31:47,886
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1337
01:31:47,888 --> 01:31:49,888
<i>- Apologize!</i>
- No.

1338
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:52,825
<i>- Apologize!</i>
- All right, fine.

1339
01:31:52,827 --> 01:31:55,531
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1340
01:31:55,763 --> 01:31:59,898
<i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i>

1341
01:34:27,186 --> 01:34:29,119
I need you
to stay quiet.

1342
01:34:29,121 --> 01:34:32,089
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1343
01:34:32,091 --> 01:34:35,227
- You got that?
<i>- Fine, but make it quick.</i>

1344
01:34:39,567 --> 01:34:41,132
Open on five.

1345
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:44,269
Go. Opening up.

1346
01:34:46,338 --> 01:34:49,040
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1347
01:34:49,042 --> 01:34:51,577
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1348
01:34:51,579 --> 01:34:53,310
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1349
01:34:53,312 --> 01:34:55,480
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1350
01:34:55,482 --> 01:34:58,116
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1351
01:34:58,118 --> 01:35:01,252
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1352
01:35:01,254 --> 01:35:04,692
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1353
01:35:04,926 --> 01:35:08,395
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1354
01:35:11,465 --> 01:35:14,368
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1355
01:35:34,523 --> 01:35:37,156
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1356
01:35:37,158 --> 01:35:41,595
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1357
01:35:41,597 --> 01:35:42,764
Sure, it's good with me.

1358
01:35:42,997 --> 01:35:45,331
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1359
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:52,204
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1360
01:35:52,206 --> 01:35:54,274
I bet you can.

1361
01:35:54,276 --> 01:35:56,746
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1362
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:58,615
Come on over.

1363
01:35:59,582 --> 01:36:01,049
All right.

1364
01:36:06,088 --> 01:36:07,387
I'm here.

1365
01:36:07,389 --> 01:36:11,125
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1366
01:36:12,461 --> 01:36:14,430
there's gonna be carnage.

1367
01:48:24,951 --> 01:48:27,119
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

1368
01:48:28,821 --> 01:48:30,888
I want to do what you asked.

1369
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:32,524
I really do.

1370
01:48:32,526 --> 01:48:34,825
But... I'm sorry.

1371
01:48:39,098 --> 01:48:41,499
I can't do this without you.

1372
01:48:42,969 --> 01:48:44,035
Hey, kid...

1373
01:48:44,037 --> 01:48:45,336
Whoa.

1374
01:48:45,338 --> 01:48:46,339
What was... Whoa!

1375
01:48:50,209 --> 01:48:51,210
What?

1376
01:48:53,247 --> 01:48:54,281
Huh?

1377
01:49:02,890 --> 01:49:03,891
No.

1378
01:49:08,162 --> 01:49:10,096
Who are you?

1379
01:49:10,098 --> 01:49:11,458
What are you
doing over there?

1380
01:49:12,334 --> 01:49:14,266
Freeze! PDNY.

1381
01:49:14,268 --> 01:49:16,268
Kid, freeze!

1382
01:49:19,907 --> 01:49:21,041
You're kidding me right now?

1383
01:49:23,111 --> 01:49:24,512
Hey, kid.
Drop the body.

1384
01:49:33,522 --> 01:49:34,921
Ow!

1385
01:49:34,923 --> 01:49:36,124
Somebody stop that train!

1386
01:49:48,571 --> 01:49:49,639
Aah!

1387
01:49:58,582 --> 01:50:00,080
Sorry.

1388
01:50:09,191 --> 01:50:11,559
<i>...looks like
a child dressed like Spider-Man,</i>

1389
01:50:11,561 --> 01:50:13,093
<i>dragging a homeless corpse</i>

1390
01:50:13,095 --> 01:50:14,395
<i>behind a train.</i>

1391
01:50:14,397 --> 01:50:15,843
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1392
01:50:15,867 --> 01:50:17,198
Why are you
trying to kill me?

1393
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,600
I'm not.
I'm trying to save you.

1394
01:50:38,221 --> 01:50:41,423
Hey, maybe you guys
can go around?

1395
01:50:41,425 --> 01:50:43,960
All right.
Thanks, New York.
