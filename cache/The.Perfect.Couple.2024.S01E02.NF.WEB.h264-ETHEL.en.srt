1
00:00:08,083 --> 00:00:09,875
It's all my fault.

2
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:11,666
It's all my fault.

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,750
It's all my fault.

4
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:20,333
<i>You okay?</i>

5
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:22,666
It just kind of hit me
all at once, you know?

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,958
-What hit you?
-That you're getting married.

7
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,791
You're the only family I have
and I don't want to lose you.

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,458
It's all my fault.

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:36,916
<i>You kept this from me!</i>

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,458
I know. I know how it looks.

11
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:40,166
Do you know how it feels?

12
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:43,833
No...

13
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,666
I can't fucking believe you!

14
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,625
It's all my fault.

15
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,250
It's all my fault.

16
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,458
It's all my fault.

27
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,666
ME called.

28
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,833
They found water in her lungs,
deep gash on her left foot,

29
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,083
bruising on both wrists.

30
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,625
You ever try to lift one of these?
It's heavier than it looks.

31
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,625
Yeah.

32
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,125
Where do you put your stuff?

33
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,333
There's a dry bag. It's usually...

34
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,416
Yeah. There it is.

35
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,583
It's for keys, sunglasses,
that kind of stuff.

36
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,708
Phone?

37
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,250
Yeah.

38
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,958
Tech found it tangled up
in seaweed down the beach.

39
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:17,875
Yeah.

40
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:19,583
Washed up with the tide.

41
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,291
You think she flipped?

42
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,833
This washed up about ten yards down.

43
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,041
Thanks.

44
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:30,250
- Is that a man's jacket?
- Yes, it is.

45
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:33,958
Maybe they flipped.

46
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,291
Maybe they did.

47
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,541
{\an8}Elizabeth, how are you?

48
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,333
{\an8}<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

49
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,041
{\an8}I know, it's such a shock,

50
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,583
and we're all
sort of devastated here, truly.

51
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,083
<i>-So distressing for you.</i>
-Very upset.

52
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,916
<i>-On your big day.</i>
-I know.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,750
Anyway, I do have to rush because
I have a lot to take care of right now.

54
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,083
<i>-Sure.</i>
-Thanks.

55
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,500
- All right, who do we have next?
- Miss Winfrey's office.

56
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,416
Fine.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,083
-How's it going?
-Oh!

58
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,791
-Abby, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

59
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,333
Quite a party last night.
You're still cleaning up?

60
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,583
Oh, caterers missed a few things.

61
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,875
They hire teenagers on summer break.
What do you expect?

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,583
Uh, do you mind?

63
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,958
Eh...

64
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:53,666
So, you first met Merritt
at their engagement party?

65
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,750
No, I'd met her a few times before then.

66
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,125
She was such a cool girl.

67
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:58,958
Really down to earth.

68
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:01,875
Like you?

69
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:07,125
We had a place on Lake Travis,
but I didn't grow up like this.

70
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,333
I bet you didn't either.

71
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,916
I hear she liked to party.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,541
-Merritt?
-Mmm-hmm.

73
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:16,791
Yeah, she was fun.

74
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,916
But I'm pregnant,
so I miss out on all the good stuff.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,666
Yeah, I used to fall asleep at my desk
every afternoon

76
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,875
when I was pregnant with my daughter, so...

77
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:30,250
Yeah, I... I don't really sit at a desk.

78
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,250
-What time did you go to bed?
-Uh...

79
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,041
Around 10:00? Maybe 10:30, maybe?

80
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,416
I sleep like the dead here.
I think it's the ocean.

81
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,833
I woke up a couple of times
when Thomas came to bed.

82
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,208
Mmm. So, people stayed late?

83
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,833
-Oh, yeah, open bar.
-Was Merritt one of them?

84
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,375
Yeah, I think so.

85
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,125
Do you know anyone else
who was in this late-night crew?

86
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,208
Not for sure.

87
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,708
Why? You don't think that someone...

88
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,083
Oh, no, I'm just checking all the boxes.

89
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:06,208
Uh... Shooter Dival.
Did he and Merritt have a connection?

90
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,375
Not that I know of.

91
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
But...

92
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,666
And I don't mean this in a judgy way,

93
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:22,458
it was my impression that Merritt
had connections with lots of guys.

94
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,375
Okay.

95
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:34,416
Thank you very much, and, uh...
congratulations.

96
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,166
Oh, thank you.

97
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,541
Please pass on our apologies

98
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,708
for the late-minute cancelation
of the wedding.

99
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,250
And I've sent a hamper of teas
with a proper note, so...

100
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,000
Listen, I do have to run.
I have a lot to do, obviously.

101
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,666
<i>Stephen wanted to know
if you could get lunch the next time?</i>

102
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,708
Yes. Hold on...

103
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,875
<i>-He'd love to pick your brain...</i>
-Hold on.

104
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,875
- What is it?
<i>- Ma'am, I've got 150 oysters on ice.</i>

105
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,291
Oysters? Come on.

106
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,333
<i>Cops are at the gate.
They won't let me through.</i>

107
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,916
At the gate? All right. Um...

108
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,875
Give me a sec.

109
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,666
Tatiana, give me a sec, I have to...

110
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,750
Tom?

111
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,541
Tom!

112
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,291
There are oysters at the gate!

113
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,125
Look, uh, we had a wrinkle,

114
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,750
so you're just gonna
have to take them all back.

115
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,041
-Take them back?
-Yeah.

116
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,291
I've got 12 dozen Pocomo back there.
What should I do with them?

117
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,916
Toss them in the fucking ocean.
We'll pay for them.

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,833
Just a sec.

119
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,541
Guys! The cruiser in the driveway,
it's totally unnecessary.

120
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,291
Do we really have to have that there?

121
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,666
Nothing on site
is supposed to be disturbed.

122
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,458
You're disturbing plenty.
This is a circus.

123
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,750
I'm sorry, miss.

124
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:47,000
Look, I would've thought our family's
contribution to the Nantucket Fund

125
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,208
would afford us a little more discretion.

126
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,750
That's not quite how it works.

127
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,791
Oh!

128
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,166
That's how it's gonna be? Huh? Okay.

129
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,708
All right, I'll bear that in mind

130
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:03,250
when I'm writing the next fucking check
at Christmas!

131
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,875
You've met Thomas?

132
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,583
-Yeah.
-He's extra.

133
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:15,208
Mr. Thomas got a puppy when he was little.

134
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:20,041
We gave it turkey burgers,
we gave it a bath.

135
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,916
But he didn't like to give it a walk.

136
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,416
Then, I got the puppy.

137
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:35,083
My cousin went to private school in D.C.
with Tom's college girlfriend,

138
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:39,875
and supposedly her nickname in high school
was Broken Doggy.

139
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,250
Because that's how she lost her virginity.

140
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,666
Doggy style.

141
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,625
Thank you, Elaine.

142
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,833
Anything even vaguely wedding-related,
please just make it go away.

143
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,625
Mr. Tag, what to do with the cake?

144
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,666
Oh, shit, the cake. Right.

145
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,333
Uh, the... Um...

146
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:15,791
I... I don't know. I suppose we could...

147
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,500
-Eat it.
-Donate it.

148
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,000
Donate it to who?

149
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,458
The last thing poor people need
is more sugar.

150
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,208
Um...

151
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,875
Do you think you could find some room
for it in the walk-in cooler, Go Go?

152
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,958
-Of course, Mr. Tag.
-Thank you.

153
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,583
What the hell is in here?

154
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,541
KitchenAid mixer. Pro 7 series.

155
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,541
You okay there, buddy?

156
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,583
Yeah. I'm fine.

157
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,666
-Hi.
-I'm sorry.

158
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,416
Real bummer.

159
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,333
Is this new?

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Um...

161
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,958
<i>I can't fucking believe you!</i>

162
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,916
He's gonna be my father-in-law!
Are you out of your fucking mind?

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,375
It's awful.
I can't believe it. It's so awful.

164
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,958
-Amelia.
-Hey. We're sorry.

165
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,500
Anything she needs,
just let me know, okay?

166
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,916
Oh! Oh...

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,125
You must be devastated.

168
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,625
-Thank you, Greer.
-It's all right.

169
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,458
-Anything that we can...
-I'm gonna go take a shower.

170
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,750
-And, uh, find my parents.
-Of course.

171
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,500
-Abby, some tea, darling?
-Yeah. Of course, of course.

172
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,416
Sweetheart.

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,750
Mama took one of her pills.

174
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,458
Yeah.

175
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:51,875
We should probably let her sleep, okay?
Let her rest.

176
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,791
-Yeah.
-Try to eat something.

177
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:55,875
Yeah.

178
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,208
We had a big fight last night.

179
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,666
Oh, no.

180
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,708
Oh...

181
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,416
I'll never get to tell her that I'm sorry.

182
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:36,791
I wasn't there for her.

183
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,000
Morning, Chief. I didn't know if you'd had
your fix yet, so I took the liberty of...

184
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,250
-Thank you.
-Hi.

185
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:10,208
Oh, I... I went to Downyflake, so I'm good.

186
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:25,125
Oh, no. If you could just not contaminate
the possible crime scene. Thanks.

187
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,708
I'm sorry. I don't think
we've been introduced. I'm Tag Winbury.

188
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:29,958
This is my home.

189
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,291
I'm Detective Nikki Henry.

190
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,291
This is my job.

191
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay.

192
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,708
I'm sorry. Is this...
Is this absolutely necessary?

193
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,500
You've already taped off my driveway.

194
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:47,125
There are cops
tromping through my wife's flower beds.

195
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,708
I know you don't get to take
the, uh, toy chest out very often,

196
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,958
but I think we can all agree it all feels

197
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,791
a little bit dramatic
for an accidental drowning.

198
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,791
Should I... Should I call Carl in here
to take this down?

199
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,208
Are you prepared
to make an official statement?

200
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,375
Mr. Winbury...

201
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:06,375
Um...

202
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,541
We just have to cover every possibility.

203
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,333
I understand completely.

204
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,333
It just seems like the most obvious
possibility is that there was a party.

205
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,041
It was hot, she went for a swim,

206
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,958
and she didn't realize
how strong the blackberry mojitos were.

207
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:20,958
No.

208
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,583
Or how strong
the currents are around here.

209
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,708
A lot of off-islanders don't know that.

210
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,875
-That's actually right.
-Yeah. Right.

211
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,583
Blackberry mojitos.

212
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,416
Yeah.

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,208
Greer's go-to move.

214
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:39,833
There's... There's another possibility
other than accidental drowning.

215
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,583
I think she hit it off
with one of your guests.

216
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,166
Groomsmen,
maybe one of your son's finance bros.

217
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,958
Two of them sneak away to the beach,
he makes his move,

218
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,833
but she has a change of heart,

219
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:54,125
and, uh, he strangles her,

220
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,625
but drags her by to the water
to make it look like she drowned,

221
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:01,833
you know, in the... In the strong current.

222
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:03,833
Was she strangled?

223
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,125
-No.
-No.

224
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,208
-No, no one was saying that.
-No, I just...

225
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,333
I thought
as long as we were writing fiction...

226
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,791
Oh, but that's... That's your wife's area.

227
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,333
Uh...

228
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,666
How's your, uh... How's your daughter?

229
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,625
-Good.
-School going well?

230
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:26,041
Very well. She's... She's happy.

231
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:27,958
Great.

232
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,833
Zoe, right?

233
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,458
Chloe.

234
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:35,875
Yeah.

235
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,875
Chloe? Mmm.

236
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,625
Sorry.

237
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,291
Mojitos? Really?

238
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,833
You catch more flies with honey.

239
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,041
-Didn't smell like honey.
-Yeah.

240
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:11,833
Hello, Miss Sacks.

241
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:17,000
For God's sake, Tag, what have
I told you about talking to the police?

242
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,500
We agreed on suicide.

243
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,375
Let's all stay on the same page here.

244
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,333
- Think she was on drugs.
- Stay calm.

245
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,291
- You can't say that.
- Where's Shooter?

246
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,958
I don't know. I'm texting him.

247
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:32,250
-It's fine. I'll fill him in. All right?
-Make sure you fill him in on all of it.

248
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,083
Hi.

249
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,166
Hi.

250
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,333
Should I not be here?

251
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:42,916
No.

252
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,000
Everything okay?

253
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,333
-Your mom?
-She's okay.

254
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,333
Good.

255
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,583
So we've been talking to my team,
and they feel we have to issue a statement

256
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,916
just to mitigate any of the press.

257
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,375
-Press?
-Yeah.

258
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,375
So they're suggesting...

259
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:04,333
I mean, it's awful, terribly sad, um...

260
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,625
and tragic when someone feels overwhelmed

261
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,833
to the point that they feel
there's no way out.

262
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,291
She would never do that.

263
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,083
There were things
she was looking forward to.

264
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,791
Well, we never know what's going on
in someone's mind, really,

265
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,458
no matter how close you are.

266
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,125
I'll... I'll call Marty about the statement.

267
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,583
Right.

268
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,916
Should we really be issuing statements
that aren't true?

269
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,875
Unfortunately,
given the state of what I do,

270
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,625
we do have to get ahead of things.

271
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:39,666
We're just filling in the blanks, Amelia,
taking control of the narrative.

272
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,833
Yeah. It's an important part of this...

273
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,916
All they're suggesting is that

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,833
we don't make any
unnecessary statements to the press.

275
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,500
Or the police. Okay?

276
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,083
For her sake.

277
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,750
Listen, I know you'd prefer I wasn't here.

278
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,791
I'd rather spend the weekend with my kids,
which is saying a lot

279
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,416
because we have passes to Water Wizz,

280
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,958
which, as it turns out,
is a very accurate name.

281
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,416
But I have a job to do,

282
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,416
and the sooner you decide
to help me do that job,

283
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,166
the better it's gonna be for both of us.

284
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:28,041
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have the techs
comb the beach again

285
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,708
in case anything washes in.

286
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,291
You're too easy on the locals.

287
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,875
Or do you just have a thing
for the insanely rich ones?

288
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,708
Oh, I have a thing for access.
Trust me on this.

289
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,375
Access to a new car every three years?

290
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,708
'Cause the ones in Fall River
still have cassette decks.

291
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,000
-Okay, yeah. We're pretty well-funded.
-Yeah.

292
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,833
And that's part of why
I wanted to come out here, but...

293
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,291
Listen, if you make
these people the enemy,

294
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,708
they will bring in their New York lawyers
so fast your head will spin.

295
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,791
You got to let them think
you work for them,

296
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,875
because the minute they feel
they're losing control,

297
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,208
they burn it all down.
I've seen them do it.

298
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,416
<i>Oh, my God, okay.
I'm here in Nantucket!</i>

299
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,250
<i>It's so cute.</i>

300
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:13,041
<i>There's, like, cobblestone roads,
and little ice cream shops.</i>

301
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,875
<i>Might not want to wear heels here,
just to avoid breaking an ankle.</i>

302
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,791
<i>It's so pretty and quaint.</i>

303
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:27,083
<i>The weather could not be more gorgeous.
It's gonna be an amazing weekend.</i>

304
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,583
<i>I think I live here now.</i>

305
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,833
- Hi.
<i>- I don't think I'm ever leaving.</i>

306
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:37,458
So, um... my mom talked to her lawyers

307
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,458
and obviously
she has your best interests at heart...

308
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,500
Well, I want you to keep that in mind
when I give you this.

309
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,208
She wants me to sign
a non-disclosure agreement?

310
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:04,708
It's just a boilerplate NDA,
nothing out of the ordinary.

311
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,041
Except that it's an NDA.

312
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,708
Look, she's a public figure.

313
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,000
She has people sign them all the time.

314
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,041
This isn't "all the time," Benji.

315
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,958
No, I know, it's not.

316
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:26,083
But, I mean,
you have the influencer thing.

317
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,333
And, I mean, it happened here.

318
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,541
My mom's just being careful.

319
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,083
Do... Do you really want
amateur Internet sleuths

320
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,041
doing fucking podcasts about this?

321
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:41,500
I'm not gonna go on some podcast
and talk about Merritt.

322
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,333
I'm not saying you would do that.

323
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,625
No one is.

324
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,333
But my mom's been burned in the past,

325
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:52,541
and this is just
something she does now. Okay?

326
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,750
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,291
Okay?

328
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,208
Please?

329
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,833
Fine.

330
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,583
Fine.

331
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,375
Thank you.

332
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,333
Okay.

333
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,041
-Hey.
-Hey.

334
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:04,500
I'm sorry about all this.
I can't believe she's gone. It's awful.

335
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,583
Yeah.

336
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,333
I'm sorry.

337
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,375
Amelia's really not good, you know?

338
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,166
Right.

339
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,750
It just, uh...

340
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,708
doesn't feel real, that's all.

341
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,791
Right.

342
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,416
Are you okay?

343
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,708
Yeah.

344
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,666
Yeah, I'll be in in a sec.

345
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Sure.

346
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:37,958
Okay.

347
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,166
-See ya.
-Yeah.

348
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:59,250
Hey, I really need to talk to you.
Just, uh, call me back, please.

349
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,083
Okay, so we got a group of night owls.

350
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,958
This group went to bed,
this little group stayed up.

351
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,666
- Okay, so Tag was there.
- Right.

352
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,625
What about Greer?

353
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,166
She said she went to bed at 1:30.

354
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,416
Okay. And Isabel Nall-et.

355
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,541
Nall-ey.

356
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,583
-That was very good.
-Four years of high-school French.

357
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,041
Oh! My daughter's taking Mandarin.

358
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:45,958
I had my choice

359
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,041
of wood shop or automotive.

360
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,250
Well, you probably use those
more than French.

361
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:54,083
Mmm. I don't know. How do you say,
"Freeze, motherfucker" in French?

362
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,000
Henry.

363
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:59,666
Yeah, got it.
Two sets of prints on her phone.

364
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:03,416
One of them belongs to Mr. Dival.
Thank you.

365
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,333
Looks like we need to have a chat
with Mr. Dival.

366
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:09,625
-All right.
-All right.

367
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,125
Mr. Dival?

368
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:22,583
Mr. Dival.

369
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,791
Police.

370
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:42,583
Ticket?

371
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,250
<i>Carl, you got anything?</i>

372
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:51,000
-Chief? He ain't here. He's gone AWOL.
<i>-All right, Carl. Copy.</i>

373
00:23:58,708 --> 00:23:59,541
Let me...

374
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,833
Excuse me. To the left!
To the left! To the left!

375
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,458
Excuse me.

376
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,583
Sorry. Excuse me.

377
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:15,500
Top side, top side!

378
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,083
Copy.

379
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,291
Excuse me, excuse me.

380
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,041
Sorry. Excuse me.

381
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,291
Backstairs. Backstairs.

382
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,375
Excuse me.

383
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:28,625
Hey, hey!

384
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,458
State Police.

385
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,250
Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go.

386
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,333
-Okay.
-You're not going to Hyannis today.

387
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,458
Come back with us, okay?

388
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,041
State Police.

389
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,125
-Okay.
-Yeah?

390
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,750
Shooter Dival?

391
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,625
I'd do him.

392
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:51,500
I dated Prince Andrew...

393
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:52,833
Oh, before.

394
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:54,416
Shooter?

395
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,541
I don't trust.

396
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:03,083
He makes his own bed like a poor person.

397
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,916
<i>Oh, that's good!</i>

398
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,333
<i>It's amazing.</i>

399
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,041
Mmm.

400
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,208
Did you bring Isabel her little candy?

401
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,041
Oh, yeah.

402
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,458
Good boy.

403
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:37,833
Mmm!

404
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,125
It's your little wife.

405
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,083
I think she knows.

406
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:53,666
Maybe I should just tell her.

407
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,041
Why would you do that?

408
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,541
Because I love you
and I want us to be together.

409
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,375
Thomas.

410
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:08,083
It's just an affair. Mmm?

411
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,541
Why does no one take me seriously?

412
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,625
Really.

413
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,291
You don't take me seriously. My parents.

414
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:18,916
My clients.

415
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,666
If you want your clients to respect you,

416
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,375
you have to stop
talking to them about crypto.

417
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,458
It was a crypto exchange.

418
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:27,708
And that was my money,
it wasn't even my client's.

419
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:30,583
This is exactly
what I'm talking about. It's...

420
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,125
What is it? Mmm?

421
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:37,333
No, it's fine.

422
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:38,708
- Tell me.
- Nothing.

423
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:39,958
-Tell me.
-Mmm.

424
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:40,875
No.

425
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:43,458
Mmm?

426
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:44,916
It's my fucking dad.

427
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,958
He won't give me a loan.

428
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,916
Oh, your dad.

429
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,625
Your dad was never a very generous man.

430
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:53,666
Except in bed.

431
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,416
-Can you not say that?
-Even then it was all about him.

432
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,291
That is so fucking weird.

433
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,583
Anything I can do?

434
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:13,750
Uh, no. Just tying up some loose ends.

435
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:24,625
I suppose it'll all just be
a distant memory in a couple of weeks.

436
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:34,166
<i>Tag?</i>

437
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,125
Oh.

438
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:40,291
Honey, he's just along for the ride.

439
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,583
It's a marriage of convenience.

440
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:47,458
He dimmed those cabin lights
a long time ago.

441
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,625
God damn it.

442
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:15,875
Uh, what's this?

443
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:19,333
I thought we'd get a jump
on the holiday traffic.

444
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,375
Can you help me?

445
00:28:20,458 --> 00:28:22,500
Uh... we can't leave.

446
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,041
The police said no one leaves.

447
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,458
I already talked to them.

448
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,875
Danielle at Sally Hershberger
had a last-minute cancellation

449
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,833
and I need some me time.

450
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:36,291
-Babe, your hair looks fine.
-Danielle has a five-month wait list, Tom.

451
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,208
I need a treatment.

452
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:42,375
Well, can't you get some of that oil
that you put in the glass?

453
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:44,541
You know?

454
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,333
That's what my girlfriend in college
used to do, and, uh...

455
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:51,166
Yeah, she always looked great.

456
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,750
Okay.

457
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,750
Your girlfriend in college was a skank.

458
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:00,166
But, yeah, sure.

459
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,375
If you want me to get some toxic chemicals
and slather them directly on my scalp

460
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,291
and poison our unborn daughter,

461
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,541
then, yeah, that'll work.

462
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,375
Clean that up?
There's half a Mexican pharmacy in there.

463
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:14,458
Wait, back up.

464
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:16,583
Uh, it's gonna be a girl?

465
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,000
It better be.

466
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:26,791
Huh.

467
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,250
Oh.

468
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:00,333
Bar car.

469
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,708
I thought we were out of Tanqueray.

470
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,041
I went to The Islander.

471
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:13,291
Pippa Childs is, uh,
painting her front door again.

472
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,583
Huh.

473
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:15,666
-No.
-Mmm-hmm.

474
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:19,375
Coral.

475
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:27,708
I honestly think
the HDC is gonna arrest her this time.

476
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:28,791
Good.

477
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:33,958
Anyone who wears flip-flops
outside of the confines of their own house

478
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:36,750
should be arrested.

479
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,083
<i>Cin-cin!</i>

480
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,750
It's gonna be a beautiful sunset.

481
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:22,041
Maybe.

482
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,291
Feel like going for a paddle?

483
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
No.

484
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:30,166
I have to work.

485
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,333
Can you clean this up?

486
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,125
I've been cleaning up after you all day.

487
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,708
Amelia, can I talk to you?

488
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,416
Have a seat.

489
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,125
No, I'm okay.

490
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,166
Sit.

491
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:37,166
I think you're great.

492
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,375
I think you're great for Benji,
I think you're great for the family.

493
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:41,583
I think you're just...

494
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,041
great.

495
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,541
I don't want things
to be awkward between us.

496
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,375
Awkward?

497
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,666
Merritt was a very special person.

498
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,208
Yeah, I know that.

499
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,083
Good.

500
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:58,875
Detective Henry.

501
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,750
Amelia Sacks is waiting
in the interrogation room.

502
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:04,833
Says she didn't want anyone
to see her here.

503
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,750
Okay. Um, tell the chief,
he's in the parking lot.

504
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:20,708
Miss Sacks?

505
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:22,708
Everything okay?

506
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,916
There's something I think you should know.

507
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,708
Merritt was sleeping with Tag Winbury.

508
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:41,750
Your fiancé's dad?

509
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,291
Yeah.

510
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:48,708
Wow.

511
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:52,916
Is that her?

512
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,458
Um...

513
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,958
It was clear
that there was some sort of struggle.

514
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,583
Do you know Mr. Winbury
to have a temper?

515
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,583
Violent outbursts, that sort of thing?

516
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,666
No, not like that.

517
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:13,375
So she was...

518
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:17,833
-Someone hurt her?
-Yeah.

519
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,750
We can't ignore that possibility.

520
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:24,708
How long
were she and Tag seeing each other?

521
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,250
Will there be hotel bills, receipts?

522
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:29,083
-Are there others who may have known?
-I don't know.

523
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,833
Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

524
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,125
<i>I can't fucking believe you!</i>

525
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,458
He's gonna be my father-in-law!
Are you out of your fucking mind?

526
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:48,250
I know. It can't just end.

527
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,583
Because you love him?

528
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,291
I'm...

529
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:03,875
You're pregnant?

530
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:06,583
Yeah.

531
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,666
Merritt, what were you thinking?

532
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:14,750
It kind of just happened.

533
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:17,833
Those things
don't just fucking happen, Merritt.

534
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,333
They don't fucking happen!

535
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:22,500
Listen to me for two seconds!
I didn't plan this!

536
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:23,791
Which part?

537
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:28,500
Fucking my fiancé's father
or getting pregnant?

538
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,791
I can't believe you just said that.

539
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:03,333
<i>Maid of honor in the house!</i>

540
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:10,833
No.

541
00:38:15,416 --> 00:38:19,375
<i>What the fuck?
What the fuck, Tag?!</i>
