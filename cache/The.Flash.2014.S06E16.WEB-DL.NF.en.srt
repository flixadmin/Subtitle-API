00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,391
or else Carver may come
after Jenna or you next.

came after me...

to him right now.

- I told you I don't know
where he's going.

00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,369
They...they left, what,
like 30 minutes ago?

823
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,621
They're probably still

With your speed, you can search

- It's not that simple.

828

- Yes, it is, Barry!
- No, it isn't!

Look, Iris, I'm...
I'm barely hanging on.

I'm getting dizzy.
My feet are numb.

I'm getting ripped in two.

00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,563

something else in common.

00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,700
We both lost our parents.

841

I hope that was worth it.
