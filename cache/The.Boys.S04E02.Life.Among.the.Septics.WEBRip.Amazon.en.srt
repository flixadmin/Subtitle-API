-Absolutely.

60
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,910

Thank you.

61
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:41,704
One more quick thing.

62
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,038
Let's sidebar here a little bit.

63

It feels like you're having
a little bit of trouble

65
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,003

66

Baby, this scene sings.
All right, look at me.

67
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:54,133
In the arc of your character,
this is your low point, right?

68
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,343
Everybody's given up on you,
you're all alone,

69
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:57,469
until the coach--

70
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,097
Swoops in and saves me from the ghetto?

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,348
No, no, no, you actually save each other.

72
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,225
It's a very balanced narrative.

73
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,812
All the sensitivity readers
that we hired, they all agreed.

74
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,939
-My brother was the only coach I ever had.
-Right.

75
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,025
He was a waiter at Buster Beaver,

76
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,610
not a fucking crack dealer.

77
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,738
And he must be so proud of you right now.

78
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,824
Let's get this train back on the tracks.

79
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,161
-Just give me a minute.
-Yeah, sure.

80
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,539
Wait, wait, you know what?
One more tiny little thing.

81
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:29,293
You said what I want "doesn't matter."

82
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,753
But as scripted, it's actually

83
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,923
what I want "don't matter," okay?

84
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,007
All right, good stuff.

85
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,301
All right, everybody,
let's get back to one!

86
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,261

00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,224
Hey, can we talk?

88
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,602
You don't talk. It's like your one thing.

89
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,312
Look, playing Noir has been
a meaningful challenge,

90
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,563

91

murdered anyone before.

And when does, do we just... do it?

94
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,741
Look, don't get me wrong,
I am stoked to be here

95
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,078
and I am down to ride the wave.
I'm just having trouble

96
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,371
with Noir's motivation, you feel me?

97
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,248
His motivation is being
a braindead maniac.

98
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,042

00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,655
-[phone chimes]
-Oh.

175
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,824
Starlight.

176
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,451
Work.

177
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,880
[door opens]

178
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,548
[Katrin] Your speech therapist Gloria

179
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,216
has filled me in on the work
you've been doing.

180
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,634
How's that been going?

181
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,856
You know, psychological mutism

182
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,318
is often a symptom of trauma
in one's past.

183
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,777
What do you think about that?

184
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,243
I couldn't agree more.

185
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,162
But sometimes you have
to confront your past

186
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,830
in order to be free of it.

187
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:19,875
Okay.

188
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,710
Why don't we start with something simple?

189
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:25,464
Tell me about your parents. [gasps]

190
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:32,012
[Muzak plays]

191
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,639
[Hughie] <i>Jesus.</i> 

192
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,973
You're just telling us now?

193
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,809
Have you seen any specialists,
have you, um...

194
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,102
So how long you got?

195
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,313
It's none of your fucking business.

196
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,773
-I'm not sure why I'm telling you at all.
-What's going on?

197
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,234
Let's just say I got
an angel on my shoulder.

198
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,194
And she's a right bloody nag.

199
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,905
Butcher, I tried to warn you
that that shit was poison.

200
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,406
You ain't one of us.

201
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,408
-Hey!
-All right!

202
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,453
A word.

203
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:09,591
You're done.

204
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,926
-What?
-Fired.

205
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,636
Grab your shit and get the fuck out.

206
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,680
I level with you lot
and this is the thanks I get.

207
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,181
Fuck me.

208
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,100
-See what being honest gets you?
-Honest?

209
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,602
Motherfucker, you've been lying to us
for the last six months.

210
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,104
Not telling ain't lying.

211
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,564
Look, you need all the help
you can get, mate.

212
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,192
Not from you. You're a liability, Butcher.

213
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,070
I ain't gonna let this stand, then.

214
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,780
The Boys is mine.

215
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,032
Says a dying man with one last bluff.

216
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,579
Now grab your shit and get the fuck out.

217
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,206
Or I'll throw you out.

218
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:43,834
[soft creaking]

219
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,961
-Just...
-I don't want to hear it.

220
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,130
He's out.

221
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,632
You can join him if you don't like it.

222
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,310
Small-town kid grows up on
a Montana ranch with his mom.

223
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:05,564
On the surface, he's an everyday
all-American boy.

224
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,233
But deep in his heart, he knows
he's different, special.

225
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,027
He's always asking himself, "Who am I?"

226
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,695
Then one day that question is answered

227
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,406
when Homelander flies down from the sky

228
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,408
and says with tears in his eyes--

229
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,659
No tears.

230
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:20,454
--and says, proudly,
"Son, it's time for you

231
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,122
to take your place by my side."

232
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,708
And for Ryan it feels surprising,
yet inevitable.

233
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,378
He always knew he
was destined for greatness.

234
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,547
Because he came from greatness.

235
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,798
[chuckling]

236
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,342
-Oh.
-[Homelander] Wow.

237
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,553
Oh, buddy, can you believe that?

238
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,555
W-What do you think?

239
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,142
It's cool, I guess.

240
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,394
You guess? [chuckles]

241
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:47,105
[stammers] I think it looks amazing.

242
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,776
-Oh, so amazing. Really marketable.
-So marketable.

243
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,028
The whole pitch blows.

244
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,822
It... does not blow.

245
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,575
It blows, harder than Nancy Reagan
on the MGM backlot.

246
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,786
I'm sorry, why are you here?

247
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,288
Vought got rid of most of the sidekicks
after Gunpowder.

248
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:04,539
The settlements exceeded profitability.

249
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,707
[Homelander] Yeah, but I don't think Ryan

250
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,044
is gonna file an HR complaint
against me. [laughs]

251
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,505
-[laughter]
-A what?

252
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,590
Ryan is the first natural-born superhero.

253
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,841
And his brand needs to reflect that.

254
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,636
He's not one of Vought's lab rat freaks.

255
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,139
He was chosen-- by fate, God, whatever--

256
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,058
to be the one who saves the world.

257
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,309
[Homelander] Yes.

258
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,436
But let's not forget

259
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,146
why he is special.

260
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,398
Shall we?

261
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,857
He's my son.

262
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,444
Chosen by God, sure, but, uh...

263
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,238
made by me.

264
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,616
The chosen one narrative
only works if he stands alone.

265
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,828
Harry Potter. Neo. Luke Skywalker.

266
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,621
Hollywood's trained people to fall in love

267
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,331
with white boy lone saviors.

268
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:49,751
So, America will want
to fall in love with Ryan.

269
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:53,755
What is this?

270
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,090
Uh, it's a crime itinerary.

271
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,634
Your first save. Congratulations, son.

272
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,428
[whispering] I'm not on the call sheet.

273
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,556
You wanted a kingdom for your son.

274
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,143
I'm helping you get it.

275
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,150
-Excellent.
-Mm.

276
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,609
Just as we discussed.

277
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,154
Feel free to move forward.

278
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,239
Thanks.

279
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,408
Ah, if you don't mind?

280
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,368
-[camera clicks]
-Hmm.

281
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,455
I'm here because Homelander wants me here.

282
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,081
Because he trusts me.

283
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,759
[elevator chimes]

284
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,139
[rapid footsteps approaching]

285
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,564
[chimes]

286
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,399
[doors close]

287
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,861
[sighs]

288
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,237
Listen.

289
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,990
I know you're the smartest
woman on earth--

290
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,742
Smartest person.

291
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,953
Let me give you some advice.

292
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,872
You know, girls supporting girls.

293
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,334
You cannot talk to Homelander like that.

294
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm telling him the truth.

295
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,213
You're so afraid of him,
you've plucked yourself bald.

296
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,423
If I were you, I'd make myself useful.

297
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,175
You know, get some lactation going,

298
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,760
let him suck on those titties.

299
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,637
Before you end up like Madelyn Stillwell.

300
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,057
[chimes, doors open]

301
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,726
Oh, Ashley, hey, what's up?

302
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,770
Just the girl boss I wanted to see.

303
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,939
I've been looking everywhere for you.

304
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,359
Hey, so I heard that Ryan's
doing his first solo save.

305
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,443
I want to talk to you about something.

306
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,861
I have this idea.

307
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:43,156
[clears throat] Okay, so, what if...

308
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,866
and just hear me out on this,

309
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,994
what if I was there?

310
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,582
That's it. That's the pitch.

311
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:56,169
Hmm. You want to join
a family-friendly PG save?

312
00:13:57,128 --> 00:14:02,717
While PETA still has you
on their bestiality watchlist?

313
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,178
I swear to God.

314
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,390
Stupid people who think they're smart

315
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,393
make me want to eat my own shit.

316
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,229
Why do you let her talk to you like that?

317
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,982
She's just a bitch.

318
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,608
It's probably that time of the month.

319
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,777
It's like a full moon thing, isn't it?

320
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,362
You're a genetically superior being,

321
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,198
and she's the evolutionary
equivalent of a capybara.

322
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:28,034
-Cappuccino...?
-It's a giant rodent from South America.

323
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,829
-Oh.
-You're better than her.

324
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,831
Act like it.

325
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,958
-And you should be at the save.
-[elevator chimes]

326
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,752
-[doors open]
-It's a good idea.

327
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,255
Thank you.

328
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,215
[doors close]

329
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:43,717
[Mother's Milk] 1:16,
Todd and the other Hometeamers

330
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,968
are seen going into Planet Vought.

331
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,511
And not seen again until...

332
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:51,182
2:09, when their dead bodies
magically appear at the rally.

333
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,226
Now, how do you think they got
there without anybody seeing?

334
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,187
A-Train. It had to be A-Train.

335
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,981
You promise? Like you promised Dad
for better or worse?

336
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,149
We boring you, Hughie?

337
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,402
Sorry. Sorry. I'm, um...
[clears throat] I'm here.

338
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,739
[Annie] But the Hometeamers died
of blunt force trauma.

339
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:06,990
Nothing said anything
about super strength.

340
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,451
[Mother's Milk] Because they're getting
a lot better at covering their ass,

341
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,453
probably because of her.

342
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,623
Sister Sage. 32 years old,
from Detroit, Michigan.

343
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,791
She cut ties with Vought a while back,

344
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:17,917
when they kicked her off of Teenage Kix.

345
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,586
[Annie] What are her powers?

346
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,504
Smartest person on the planet.

347
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,757
I've already tapped Sage's cell phones.

348
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,884
She made a reservation
at the Vought Garden

349
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,927
