1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,040
<i>Last season
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,720
I'm no longer the captain. You are.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,720
<i>Permission to depart, Captain Lance.</i>

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,760
I know that I'm supposed
to go back to 1942.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,680
I have to believe that time
is stronger than that.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,840
It's a timequake.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,560
The result of us
interacting with ourselves.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,120
And whose bright idea was it
to do the one thing

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,000
that could jeopardize all of time?

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
Yours.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,360
Guys.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,040
I think we broke time.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,560
I guess this means
we're not going to Aruba.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,720
You said you broke time.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,880
No, I said <i>we</i> broke time.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,760
Yep, but it was your idea.

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,600
No, my idea was to save
reality and save Amaya.

18
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,520
By violating the first rule
of time travel.

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,720
Never visit the same time
and place twice,

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,800
thereby breaking time.

21
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,360
Perhaps we should continue
this argument

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,040
somewhere there aren't dinosaurs.

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,280
Whoa. Big Ben.

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,560
So what?

25
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,520
- Guys.
- I always wanted to visit it.

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Guys!

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,520
Amaya, talk to it.

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
- She can talk dinosaur?
- Like you wouldn't believe.

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,920
Please speed up that conversation...

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,920
Y'all just saw that, right?

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
And that.

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,680
Well, you really have

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,520
buggered everything up this time.

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Her idea.

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,600
No matter. As you can see,

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
my agents are already hard at work

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,400
dealing with these Anachronisms.

38
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,560
Anachronisms?

39
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,880
People, places, and things

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,840
displaced from
their native time periods.

41
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,680
I told you. I was leaving to create

42
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,600
an organization to replace
the Time Masters.

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,920
- 15 minutes ago.
- For you.

44
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,360
Forming the Time Bureau
has been the work

45
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,320
of the last five years of my life.

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,000
I've gotten quite good at it,
I'd have to say.

47
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,920
You mean, you have
Time Agents at work

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,320
in the Cretaceous Period as we speak?

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,120
Indeed, and throughout
Los Angeles, making sure

50
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,120
no one retains any memory of this...

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,480
unfortunate incident.

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,880
Which is why your services
are no longer required.

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Whoa. What?

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,840
It seems only fitting,
since I was the one

55
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,040
who brought this team together

56
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,680
that I should be
the one to disband it.

57
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
So...

58
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,760
On behalf of the Time Bureau,

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,000
I hereby relieve
the Legends from duty.

60
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,000
This isn't auditions

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,800
for "American Ninja Warrior",
you know.

62
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
And how many times have I told you

63
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,800
not to play with the merchandise?

64
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,800
Oh, I know that look.

65
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,960
It's the look of someone who thinks

66
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,200
they could have gotten a better job.

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,440
Well, let me tell you
something, freckles.

68
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,840
You're lucky I even hired someone

69
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,280
{\an5}who had been reported dead...
twice.

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,720
Especially in this economy.

71
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,320
What?

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
No thank you?

73
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
Thank you.

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
That's better.

75
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,440
Now get over to Health and Beauty.

76
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,720
Somebody just spilled
a whole mess of conditioner.

77
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Alan...

78
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,920
Alan, I've had a breakthrough.

79
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,600
{\an5}I have told you not to interrupt me
when I'm plugged in.

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Yes. No, I know

81
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,160
that's very important to you, but,

82
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,560
Alan, I've been working
on this side project.

83
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
Not only have I managed
to shrink organic matter

84
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,280
{\an5}but I've also streamlined
the technology

85
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
so that you can wear...

86
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm not interested, brah.

87
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,600
{\an5}Look, I... I get it.
Once upon a time,

88
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,720
you were "Ray Palmer, tech mogul".

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,200
{\an5}But when you give your
company to a woman

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,600
who runs it into the ground,

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,320
you lose all side-project privileges.

92
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
Great news for you, though.

93
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,280
What we're doing here at Upswipz

94
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,440
is trying to change the world.

95
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,080
Upswipz is a dating app.

96
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,560
Just like Tinder, except you

97
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,920
swipe up-down instead of left-right.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,880
Which is far more intuitive.

99
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,920
And Upswipz isn't a dating app.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,880
- It's a holistic social networking
- Social networking platform.

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,200
Oh, but, Alan...

102
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,840
my miniaturization technology

103
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,280
has the potential to actually

104
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,800
make the world a better place.

105
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,760
If that were true,

106
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,200
it'd be an app.

107
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,680
If it doesn't live in a phone...

108
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,800
it's not the future, Ray.

109
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
{\an5}Well, I've actually been
to the future.

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,480
Like, three times.

111
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,440
Damn it, Wally.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What did I say?

113
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,200
Oh, I was supposed to save

114
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,400
some of the bad guys for you.

115
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,680
Just a few.

116
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,080
{\an5}You know what?
I'll make it up to you.

117
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,360
The first round is on me.

118
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,640
No. Thanks, man, we're good.

119
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,800
I actually
have a girl waiting for me.

120
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Next time.

121
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Hey.

122
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,640
Sorry I'm late. There was a...

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,760
kind of a work thing.

124
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
It's okay.

125
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,720
I know a really great coffee place...

126
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Alana.

127
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,120
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.

128
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Hey, idiot.

129
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,840
Either refill my margarita

130
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,040
or get out of my light.

131
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,720
This is a private beach.

132
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,320
Listen, pal, what did I...

133
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,680
And who the hell
are you supposed to be?

134
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,680
I am Gaius Julius Caesar
of Rome.

135
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,040
Thought I recognized you.

136
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,680
I knocked off one of your casinos
in Vegas.

137
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,360
I am here to conquer
all the known world.

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Right.

139
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,080
Wait a sec.

140
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,680
How did you get here?

141
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,280
I imagine through the mischief
of the goddess Ate.

142
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,880
But it matters
not the land I find myself in.

143
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,320
It is but a matter of time
before my banner flies over it.

144
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
Is that a fact?

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah?

146
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,240
<i>Boss.</i>

147
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,640
- Rory?
<i>- I got a situation.</i>

148
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,640
I think I bumped into one of those
mechanisms...

149
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,320
<i>- Mechanism?</i>
- A nagging-ism.

150
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
- Anachronism?
<i>- Yes.</i>

151
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,480
Julius Caesar...

152
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,920
is in Aruba.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,320
<i>- Seriously?</i>
- Seriously.

154
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,120
I got him tied up in my casita.

155
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,040
What do you want me to do?

156
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,640
<i>Just sit tight and keep him safe.</i>

157
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,440
If you screw up history,
the Bureau will be on your ass

158
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
before you can say...

159
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,720
Son of a bitch.

160
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,880
Are you taking a personal call

161
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,480
- during peak consumer traffic?
- No.

162
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,240
'Cause I quit.

163
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
All right.

164
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,720
What's so important
to make you catch a train

165
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
to Central City?

166
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
Where's Amaya?

167
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
We kind of broke up.

168
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,640
- What?
- It's not a big deal.

169
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
So what's going on?

170
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,960
Rory found an Anachronism.

171
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,560
Apparently, Julius Caesar
just wound up in Aruba.

172
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,840
Mick's got him all tied up.

173
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,400
Look, this is our chance

174
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,560
to get the Time Bureau
to deal us back in.

175
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,360
Look, if we pull this off,

176
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,200
Rip might give us
our old ship back.

177
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,640
Wow, I had no idea

178
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
you were so unhappy
with your new life.

179
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,960
Are you kidding me?

180
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,520
I'm... I'm... I'm loving it.

181
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm doing really good work.

182
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,000
It says you work at
Sink, Shower & Stuff.

183
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,880
Yeah, well...

184
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,880
even vigilantes
have to pay their bills.

185
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,400
What are you guys
so content with, huh?

186
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,600
What are you doing?

187
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,080
I'm doing pretty good.
Thanks for asking.

188
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,720
I am...

189
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,000
The second most popular
superhero in Central City.

190
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,520
So that's... pretty good.

191
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,400
Well, I am the first
most popular in Silicon Valley

192
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,920
when I'm not changing
the world with a...

193
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,760
holistic social networking platform.

194
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,880
- Let's go.
- Thank God.

195
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,440
You sure this is where they're at?

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,920
I bumped into one of Rip's
Time Agents a while back.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
He may have left his badge
at my place.

198
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,320
He left it at your place?

199
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,840
All right,
maybe I lifted it off of him

200
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
in the morning.

201
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,720
- Freeze!
- Hands in the air!

202
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Eyes on, eyes on!

203
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Hey, don't move!

204
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,600
Stay right there!

205
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,240
Hello, everyone.

206
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Welcome.

207
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,200
On the floor.
Hands behind your heads.

208
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,840
Oh, sorry, there must be
some kind of mistake.

209
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,240
We're the... we're the...

210
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Legends!

211
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,760
Oh, we know exactly
who you losers are.

212
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,040
Wow. This floor is,
like, super clean.

213
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,520
Lady, why are you so mean?

214
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,000
Maybe it's that poly-blend pantsuit

215
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,480
that's got her so grumpy.

216
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,560
I didn't know Men's Wearhouse
gave group discounts.

217
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,480
What's wrong with you people?
Do you want to get shot?

218
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
Totally rather get shot
than look like a Sears model.

219
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,120
Hold your fire!

220
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,920
Stand down! All of you.

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,040
Excuse me.

222
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,960
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

223
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,800
Hello. So good to see you all.

224
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,520
Next time, just call ahead.

225
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,080
You son of a bitch.

226
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,360
Eyes on, eyes on!

227
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,760
There's been a slight
misunderstanding,

228
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,640
- Dr. Heywood.
- Nate, what are you doing?

229
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,520
I want to hear Rip say it.

230
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,880
You told Amaya to go back to 1942.

231
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,680
Amaya went back to 1942?

232
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,400
It was her idea.

233
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,040
She wanted to go back home
to Zambesi.

234
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
What'd you say?

235
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,240
It was Amaya's idea
to go back to Zambesi.

236
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
No, I heard him, Ray.

237
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,080
I was just being rhetorical.

238
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,920
All right. This is just awkward.

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So...

240
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,240
what brings the rest of you
to the Time Bureau?

241
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,720
We found an Anachronism.

242
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,280
I wasn't aware any of you
were searching for Anachronisms.

243
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,400
We weren't.

244
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,880
Rory was on a bender

245
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,600
when Julius Caesar showed up.

246
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,760
Agent Sharp, have we seen
any activity that would match

247
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,400
such a massive historical
displacement?

248
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,720
Absolutely not, sir.

249
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,520
Well, I guess you must have
missed one then.

250
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,160
I find that very hard to
believe, and you know what...

251
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,800
Ready a go-team...

252
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,600
and we will meet you
at the Op-Center.

253
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Sir.

254
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
In the meantime...

255
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,840
Who fancies a tour?

256
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,320
Guess they're not used to seeing
famous people.

257
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,360
Yeah, kind of like
we're the Founding Fathers

258
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,520
of the Time Bureau.

259
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
In a way.

260
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
I suppose if you lot hadn't created

261
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
the greatest time paradox
the world had ever known...

262
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,880
all of these people
would have nothing to do.

263
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,240
- Unhand me, you knave!
- Is that...

264
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,600
Oh, yeah. King Arthur.

265
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,040
His displacement
into the Spanish Civil War

266
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,720
caused quite the Anachronism.

267
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,920
Oh, evil sorcerer!

268
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,520
I might have known you
were responsible for all of this.

269
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,880
Now when he's returned
to his original time,

270
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,720
he will have no memory
of his displacement.

271
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,720
All humility aside,

272
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,600
we are the most important
security organization...

273
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,400
That no one's ever heard of.

274
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Who somehow missed
the fact that Julius Caesar

275
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,360
is down in Aruba working on his tan.

276
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,960
I'm sure, our detection system

277
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,840
would have picked up
on his displacement.

278
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,680
Yeah, and we get that.

279
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,360
But all we're saying is,
if you wanted to give us

280
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,320
the old Waverider back,
we would be happy

281
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,320
to go down there
and take care of it for you.

282
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,200
Yeah, you know, for...
for old time's sake?

283
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,960
I'm sorry, but our old ship
has been put to new use.

284
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,280
You turned our ship
into a simulator?

285
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,400
The Command Module is heading
toward a meteoroid belt.

286
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,120
Apollo 13 astronauts will die
unless we do something.

287
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,360
Oh, that's cool, man.

288
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,680
They're teaching one
of our old missions.

289
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,920
I've got an idea.

290
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Why don't we swing around

291
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,240
and use our ship as a shield?

292
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,640
- Boom.
- Kidding.

293
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,160
I'm not a total idiot.

294
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,120
Target the Command Module's
oxygen tank with our photons

295
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,240
and fire.

296
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,040
Yes! The ruptured tank

297
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,040
propelled their capsule
out of harm's way, Captain.

298
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,160
Well done, class.

299
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,880
See you all tomorrow.

300
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,040
We'll see how you do

301
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,920
trying to stop an atomic torpedo

302
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,440
from blowing up New York City.

303
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,280
What are they doing here?

304
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,640
We are here to help you.

305
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,280
That's very gracious of you.

306
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,000
But whatever it is,
we have professionals

307
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,520
who can handle the matter.

308
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,920
Along with whatever damage
Mr. Rory causes.

309
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,640
Your salad sucks.

310
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,000
You should know
this is not the first time

311
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,840
I've been taken captive.

312
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,280
Oh, great, a story.

313
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,520
Once, when I was a young man...

314
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,960
I was kidnapped by pirates.

315
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,720
They ransomed me for 50 talents
of silver, a fortune.

316
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,440
My family paid the money, of course.

317
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,360
But I told my captors

318
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,400
they would be better off killing me.

319
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,960
Because if they did let me go...

320
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,640
I promised to come back one day...

321
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,720
and not only to take my silver...

322
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,160
but to crucify
the pirates one by one.

323
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
And that's exactly what I did.

324
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,120
You saying I should kill you?

325
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,280
You should believe me
when I make a promise.

326
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,600
The gold in this satchel...

327
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,520
is yours.

328
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Gold?

329
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,080
But I swear by my household gods...

330
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
it will cost you your life.

331
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,640
Do we have a location on Mr. Rory?

332
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,560
We followed a trail
of petty larceny reports.

333
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,960
He's been holed up on the beach...

334
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,400
running up a room service tab

335
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,920
and a serious collection of STDs.

336
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,200
- That's our Mick.
- He's been busy.

337
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,120
Locking in on coordinates now.

338
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,880
Is the go-team ready?

339
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,520
Locked and loaded, sir.

340
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Opening a portal.

341
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,280
You broke my nose.

342
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,280
Out of my way!

343
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,040
- Our team is under attack.
- Definitely Rory.

344
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,560
Alpha team,
do you have eyes on Caesar?

345
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,760
<i>He's got the target.</i>

346
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,320
What do you want us to do,
Command?

347
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
Get the hell out of there

348
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,560
before Mr. Rory causes
any more mayhem.

349
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,560
Roger that. Initiating extraction.

350
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,600
Get off me, you damn missionaries!

351
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,160
Get the hell off me, dude.

352
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,080
This is Julius Caesar?

353
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,400
Dude, my dad's a lawyer.

354
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,360
I'm going to totally sue
all of your asses.

355
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,600
What is this place?

356
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,960
An institution you will never

357
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,600
step foot in again, Mr. Rory.

358
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,960
Get them out of here!

359
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,960
Rip, look. I'm sorry.

360
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,120
- I thought that this...
- The Legends would change?

361
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
Since when do we need to change?

362
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,040
When you left our team, you said

363
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,800
you had nothing left to teach me.

364
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,800
Yes, well,
unfortunately all of history

365
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,960
suddenly came unglued

366
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,800
moments after
I'd uttered those words.

367
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,840
Look, I miss the good
old days too, Sara.

368
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,760
But times have changed.

369
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,600
Yeah, and you don't think
you need us anymore.

370
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,240
Look, Rip.

371
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,040
This is our mess.
You have to let us fix it.

372
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,920
Using your team to fix anything...

373
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,520
is like doing brain surgery
with a chainsaw.

374
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,960
Whoa. You can't leave yet.

375
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,800
Not without parking validation.

376
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,960
Son of a bitch stole my money.

377
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
This is a genuine Roman aureus.

378
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,040
This is first century B.C.

379
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,800
That means Rory really
saw Julius Caesar.

380
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,280
- Duh.
- We've got to tell Rip

381
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
that he's got the wrong guy.

382
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,800
- Yeah, like he'll listen to us.
- He's right.

383
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,640
We've got to grab Caesar
ourselves.

384
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,640
And prove to Rip
that we got the right stuff.

385
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Sara.

386
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,800
Exit's this way.

387
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,400
Our ship's this way.

388
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,000
We're gonna steal the Waverider?

389
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,600
We're gonna fix our mistakes.

390
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,200
Oh, damn it! I mean, darn it.

391
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,880
There's a class in session.

392
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,760
Listen up, punks.

393
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,920
Class dismissed. Get out of here.

394
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,600
This must be a part
of the training exercise.

395
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,200
Our ship has been boarded
by a Time Pirate.

396
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,040
On behalf of The Time Bureau,
and in accordance

397
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,120
to Article 15.6, Section B,

398
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,400
concerning the unlawful seizure
of Time Ships...

399
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,160
Anyone else?

400
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,640
Gideon's been in sleep mode
for five years.

401
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,760
But if I can divert her power
back to the core...

402
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,760
<i>Hello, Legends. What did I miss?</i>

403
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,320
Well, we're about to
steal the ship...

404
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,880
go grab Julius Caesar in Aruba...

405
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,120
all before history
completely collapses.

406
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,080
<i>So it's business as usual, then.</i>

407
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,400
Exactly.

408
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,240
Gideon, engines to power.

409
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,560
Turbines to speed.

410
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,880
<i>Right away, Captain.</i>

411
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,880
Sounds like this old boat
needs a lube job.

412
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
What in the hell
do they think they're doing?

413
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,280
The hangar's sealed.
There's no way out of here.

414
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,000
Yep, well, I'm afraid the Legends

415
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,520
have never permitted
something like logic

416
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,680
to stop them.

417
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,920
I hope you know what
you're doing, Ms. Lance.

418
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,360
Gideon, time-jump us out of here.

419
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,040
Oh, are you sure we can
time-jump inside the building?

420
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,560
We're about to find out.

421
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,400
Gideon, when are we?

422
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,000
<i>I was only able to time-jump us</i>

423
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,560
<i>three minutes into the future.</i>

424
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,240
<i>We're still in Star City.</i>

425
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,440
<i>If you haven't noticed,</i>

426
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,680
<i>the ship is in desperate need
of maintenance.</i>

427
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
Yeah, there's no way
we're gonna make it to Aruba.

428
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,160
Can we make it to Central City?

429
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,000
I know a good mechanic there.

430
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,000
Jefferson.
What a... what a nice surprise.

431
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,760
Lily also dropped by
with some rather exciting news.

432
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,800
Oh, well, if it's a bad time,
I can always just...

433
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,520
Wait, wait. What is it?

434
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,960
Something's wrong. I can feel it.

435
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,120
We may only see each other

436
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,800
once a week
for our bonding sessions

437
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,200
but we still share
a psychic connection.

438
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,120
I dropped out of school.

439
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,840
Why would you do that?

440
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,960
You could have your
master's in... in two years.

441
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,120
Yeah, I know, it's just...

442
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,240
Learning about engineering

443
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,200
is not half as fun
as actually, you know,

444
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,680
being an engineer...

445
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,960
on a time ship.

446
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,320
Oh, hey, Jax.

447
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,880
Lily, you're... you're...

448
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,640
What? I'm what?

449
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,120
Oh, you... you look...
you look healthy.

450
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,320
I'm kidding. I'm pregnant.

451
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,760
- Oh, my God. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

452
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,240
Yeah, I was on sabbatical
in Rome with my boyfriend and...

453
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,200
She means her future husband.

454
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,760
And we decided
we wanted to come home

455
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,000
and break the big news in person.

456
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,480
Oh, I've got to put
the osso buco in the oven.

457
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,960
But you should totally stay
for dinner...

458
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
right, daddy?

459
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
- Yeah.
- Okay.

460
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,360
Dude. What?

461
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,280
My heart still melts
when she says that word.

462
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,640
It's crazy. It's...

463
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,360
Oh, my God.

464
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,320
Is that what I think it is?

465
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,320
Come on, Grey.

466
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,640
A chance to meet Julius Caesar
and fix history.

467
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
Look, we have a time ship.

468
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,240
We can get you home
in time for dessert.

469
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
That's what I told
Clarissa the last time I left.

470
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,080
And when you came home
you had a surprise daughter.

471
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Your point?

472
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,080
The point is, sometimes...

473
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,720
we screw things up for the better.

474
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,120
That's a good motto.

475
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,240
We should use that.

476
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,640
Fine, whatever.

477
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,960
- I'll... I'll come.
- Great.

478
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,640
Now all we need is Amaya

479
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,840
and we can get the band
back together.

480
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
That's not happening.

481
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,080
Whoa, did I miss something?

482
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
Amaya dumped him.

483
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,160
- Went back to 1942.
- She didn't dump me.

484
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
She didn't dump me.

485
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,960
Amaya went back to Zambesi
because Rip told her

486
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,240
she has some
sort of destiny to fulfill

487
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,040
back in 1942. That's it.

488
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,560
Unlike the rest of us

489
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,440
who don't have crap

490
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,680
waiting for us in the real world.

491
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,520
Speak for yourself, numb nuts.

492
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,400
I don't know about you all,
but I was destined

493
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,240
for greater
things than folding towels.

494
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,440
And Rip thinks he doesn't need us

495
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,760
because he's got the Time Bureau.

496
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,880
Ray's right.

497
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,560
We're the ones who broke history.

498
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,880
We should be the ones that fix it.

499
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,760
But instead of operating
on history with a chainsaw...

500
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,360
this time, we are gonna be
the scalpel.

501
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,040
Is this your idea of subtle?

502
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,200
Just try to blend in, okay?

503
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,840
No problem.

504
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,840
Great Caesar's ghost.

505
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,960
That's him.

506
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,080
So what I have to say
to you is this...

507
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,040
are you willing to fight with me?

508
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,280
Yeah!

509
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,040
And claim this savage land
for Rome?

510
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,520
Yeah!

511
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,400
What, did you teach Caesar English?

512
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,040
Nope. Just showed up speaking fancy.

513
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,120
Temporal linguistic dysplasia...

514
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,560
- What?
- A side-effect

515
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,920
of historical displacement.

516
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,120
Astonishing!

517
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,760
You know, cowards die

518
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,320
many times before their deaths.

519
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,840
The valiant never taste death
but once!

520
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,680
- Yeah!
- And Delta Nu Phi sucks!

521
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,520
Delta Nu Phi sucks!

522
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,520
Alpha Psi Gamma sucks!

523
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,400
Delta Nu Phi sucks!

524
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,360
Can we not agree they all suck?

525
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,040
Alright.

526
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,600
Let's shut this toga party down

527
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,280
before things really get out of hand.

528
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,120
No powers.

529
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,440
It can make
the Anachronism worse.

530
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,240
Right, be the scalpel.

531
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
Because I saw in you...

532
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I've got an idea.

533
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,080
The makings of a legion.

534
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,720
Come on, man. Are you really
trying to hook up now?

535
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,320
No, I'm creating a dating profile

536
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,640
on our new UpSwipz app.

537
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Gideon, I need you to hit

538
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,760
every phone on the beach
with a match.

539
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,560
"Exotic beauty looking for

540
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,160
casual sex with young frat stud?"

541
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,640
- That might work.
- Yeah.

542
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,400
Now all I need is a profile picture.

543
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,840
<i>I believe I've got that covered.</i>

544
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Not bad.

545
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,720
- For Mars!
- Yeah!

546
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,160
- For Rome!
- Yeah!

547
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,560
Death... or glory!

548
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,680
All right, JC. Party's over.

549
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,800
You're coming with us.

550
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,440
I'd rather fall on my sword

551
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,640
than surrender it to a woman.

552
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,440
Well, then today is your lucky day.

553
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Oh, shouldn't we help her?

554
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,360
It's him I'm worried about.

555
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,480
Yep, I'd say our work here is done.

556
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,120
And to quote the great
conqueror himself,

557
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,000
"We came, we saw..."

558
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
We kicked Caesar's ass!

559
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, man.

560
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,880
- Suckers.
- Nice work.

561
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,680
I'd have done it faster.

562
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

563
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,120
- Did that hurt?
- Easy, Mick.

564
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,680
He broke my nose.

565
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,080
My best feature.

566
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,920
Still... we have to get him
back to his time in one piece.

567
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,360
Or he doesn't go on
to conquer the world

568
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,440
and help create the greatest empire
history has ever known.

569
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,600
We need to get moving.

570
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,040
It's not gonna take Rip long

571
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,080
to track down a stolen time ship.

572
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,400
<i>Quite so, Ms. Lance.</i>

573
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,680
<i>It appears that you've captured</i>

574
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,000
<i>the real Julius Caesar. Well done.</i>

575
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,400
<i>Now, if you'll just return him to us,</i>

576
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,760
<i>we'll be happy to handle his
reinsertion back into history.</i>

577
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,440
You don't think we can handle it?

578
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
<i>It's not that.</i>

579
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,480
<i>Maybe it is that.</i>

580
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,760
<i>But, the fact remains</i>

581
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,520
<i>that you have hijacked our property.</i>

582
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,720
<i>And if you would return it to us</i>

583
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,240
<i>along with our anachronistic guest...</i>

584
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,280
<i>all will be forgiven.</i>

585
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,000
<i>I trust you'll use
your best judgment.</i>

586
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,480
Does he not know this team?

587
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,520
Shouldn't we entrust Caesar's return

588
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,280
to people who do that sort
of thing professionally?

589
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,760
I thought this
was our chance to prove

590
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,680
that we were professional... ish.

591
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Your call, Captain.

592
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Gideon...

593
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,000
plot a course for the Time Bureau.

594
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,440
<i>I'm afraid that won't be possible</i>

595
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,920
<i>without additional repairs.</i>

596
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Of course.

597
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,440
Et tu, Sara?

598
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,440
I'm using my best judgment.

599
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,240
You know, I've taken
these engines apart

600
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,120
so many times, feels like
this ship is a part of me.

601
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,720
It is a part of you
that you can take on

602
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,040
whatever adventure
life offers you next.

603
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
What adventure could be better
than this one?

604
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,640
I mean, I got to be a superhero
who traveled through time...

605
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,840
changing history.

606
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,360
Yes, I know.

607
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,960
Look, I know you want to do
the whole granddad thing.

608
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,080
Smoke a pipe by the fire, but...

609
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,520
I got a whole lot of life left...

610
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
and I have no idea how to fill it.

611
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,280
Jefferson, you are, hands down...

612
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,880
the most gifted, capable...

613
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,200
driven young man I've ever known.

614
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,520
You can do anything you want to do.

615
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,680
Well, that's all well and good.

616
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,240
But what I want to do is be half

617
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,840
of a nuclear-powered superhero.

618
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,640
And I can't do that
if you don't want to.

619
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,320
Have you come to gloat?

620
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,680
Or to grant me the mercy
of taking my own life?

621
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,160
Getting beaten by a woman
bothers you that much?

622
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,880
Yes.

623
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,080
If your intention is neither
boasting nor mercy...

624
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,200
to what do I owe the honor
of this visit?

625
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,040
You doubt your present
course of action

626
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,760
and seem to believe that Caesar

627
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,320
holds the key to resolving it.

628
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,440
There's nothing to resolve.

629
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,280
My course of action isn't up to me.

630
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,000
So you believe your future
lies in the hands

631
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
of the Three Fates?

632
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
No.

633
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,440
It lies in the hands of a group

634
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,800
called the Time Bureau.

635
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,760
And if I go against them now,
they'll take my ship.

636
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,080
And if I screw this up...

637
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,720
then I lose everything.

638
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,440
And that's all you're willing
to wager for greatness?

639
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,120
Pompey said
he would have my head

640
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,040
for going against the Senate...

641
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,160
but when I lead my army
across the Rubicon...

642
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,880
Rome will welcome me as a god.

643
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,600
Well, I wish
I shared your confidence.

644
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,040
It cost me eight years
and countless centurions

645
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,200
to conquer Gaul.

646
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,680
But with an Amazonian queen
like you by my side...

647
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,240
I could make short work
of the rest of the world.

648
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,200
Conquering the world
does sound nice...

649
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,560
But I don't need you to do it.

650
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,680
Ship's fixed, Cap.

651
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,480
Fixed enough to get us back
to the Time Bureau?

652
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,920
How about ancient Rome?

653
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,920
Only one way to find out.

654
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,720
According to Gideon,
Caesar disappeared

655
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,200
the night before
his famous march on Rome.

656
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,680
Yeah, no crossing the Rubicon
means no civil war.

657
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,760
No civil war means no Ides of March.

658
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,000
No Ides of March means...

659
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,880
No Roman Empire.

660
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,360
What happens on the Ides of March?

661
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,120
Well, that's when your friends,
who really aren't your friends,

662
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,520
stab you in the back
to stop your rise to power.

663
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,200
Not that you'll remember any of this.

664
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,880
Check it out.
History is back to normal.

665
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,200
And now a little something
for the Heywood scrapbook.

666
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,120
Oh, man. That's a keeper.

667
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,360
Enjoy conquering the world.

668
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,160
Perhaps my eyes deceive me,

669
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,560
but that does not look
like the Time Bureau to me.

670
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,840
No, it says here we landed
in 49 B.C.

671
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,640
Relax, because
we just dropped off JC

672
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,800
back where he belongs.

673
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,480
So, history has been restored

674
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,120
and we can go home.

675
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,880
<i>I'm afraid that's not possible.</i>

676
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,960
Why? Something wrong with the ship?

677
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,000
<i>No, but your home no longer exists.</i>

678
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,720
<i>Here is a map of what
was formally known</i>

679
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,400
<i>as the United States, circa 2017.</i>

680
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,160
I thought you said
that history has been restored.

681
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,880
Does that look restored to you?

682
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,640
What does "Magna Hesperia" mean?

683
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,000
It means Caesar went on
to conquer the known world

684
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
and then, the unknown world.

685
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,080
One of you fools
must have entrusted him

686
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,400
with future knowledge,
something that allowed him

687
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,680
to alter the course of history.

688
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,600
No, no. I mean, Sara hit him
with Rip's flashy...

689
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
- Flashy thing.
- Thing.

690
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
Oh, my God.

691
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
What?

692
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
My book.

693
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
What book?

694
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,680
Change of plans.

695
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,200
We're not marching on Rome, sir?

696
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
No, we're still marching.

697
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,480
But when we get there,
we're going to visit

698
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,800
a few old friends...

699
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,280
starting with Brutus and Cassius.

700
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,480
I cannot believe you let Caesar

701
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,400
steal the answers to the test.

702
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,200
Why are you all looking at me?
It's not my fault.

703
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,520
How did mop-head even know
there would be a test?

704
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,120
It's a figure of speech.

705
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,640
Caesar knew how to alter history

706
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,640
because he already knew
how it would unfold.

707
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,520
Okay, so, all we got to do
is get back out there

708
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,720
and refold history.

709
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,960
Or contact Mr. Hunter

710
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
and let the Time Bureau handle it.

711
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,440
No, no, no, no.
We do not let those time-turds

712
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,840
have the satisfaction
of knowing that we...

713
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,360
That you lost the book?

714
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,760
Stop blaming me, okay?

715
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,680
Caesar must have swiped it
when I wasn't looking.

716
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,240
- Nate's right.
- Thank you.

717
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,640
Not about it not being your fault...

718
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,280
about The Time Bureau.

719
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,920
They're 2,000 years away.

720
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,400
- We can fix this before they even...
- Too late.

721
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,400
Ms. Lance, a word.

722
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Yeah.

723
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,120
Look, I know what you're gonna say

724
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,720
but we are gonna fix this.

725
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,920
You shall do nothing of the sort.

726
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,920
My agents
will clear this mess in no time.

727
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,160
And what if something
goes sideways?

728
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,800
None of these guys are field agents.

729
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,160
Admit it, Rip. You need us.

730
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,680
No, Sara. You need this.

731
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,680
But just because you all found
life outside this ship boring

732
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,520
doesn't mean you get
your old jobs back.

733
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,120
Because the Time Bureau is capable

734
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,600
of getting the job done...

735
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
Without the mess.

736
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,920
Status?

737
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,520
We've got eyes on the target.
Go-team is hot.

738
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,680
Yes, you are.

739
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Watch and learn, Ms. Lance.

740
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
Execute.

741
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,480
<i>Asset acquired.</i>

742
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,240
Proceed to the target to commence
memory erasure protocol.

743
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,360
Wait, I've seen this play before.

744
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,160
Leave the merchandise unattended...

745
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,440
draw the target out...

746
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,320
League of Assassins strategy?

747
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,280
No. It's Sink, Shower & Stuff.

748
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,040
We use it to catch shoplift...

749
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,240
it's a trap!

750
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,360
You've got to pull your team out
of there.

751
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,160
Agent Sharpe, initiate extraction.

752
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
Extract.

753
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,960
Oh, Agent Sharpe has been...

754
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
apprehended.

755
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,840
We were caught unprepared.

756
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,200
But we'll go back in, and we...

757
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,480
And screw things up
worse than you already have?

758
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,880
Boss is right.

759
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,520
We need to go
and rescue Agent Hotcakes.

760
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,520
Oh, please. This entire situation

761
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,160
is happening because of you idiots...

762
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Idiots?

763
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,720
Idiots with special abilities.

764
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,440
We know how to handle ourselves.

765
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,720
Not against Julius Caesar

766
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,720
who has an entire legion
at his command.

767
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,640
We're pretty good
at taking down legions.

768
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
You're damn straight.

769
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,400
I'm assuming the answer is no,

770
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,600
but do any of you happen
to have a plan?

771
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,600
We're about to rejoin my army.

772
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,760
Be grateful.

773
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
Not only am I letting you live.

774
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,840
I'm permitting you to witness
the rise of the Roman Empire.

775
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,120
The Time Bureau will never
permit you to alter history.

776
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,480
Caesar does not alter history.

777
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,360
He makes it.

778
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,720
Surrender your prisoner
in the name of Ares...

779
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,280
the god of war!

780
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,640
Mars is the Roman god
of war, Jefferson.

781
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,840
Yeah, whatever.

782
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,960
- What the hell are you doing?
- Rescuing you.

783
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I can take care of myself.

784
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Howdy.

785
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,120
<i>Dormi strictum amicus.</i>

786
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
What did you say to him?

787
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,320
Oh, "sleep tight, buddy"?

788
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,560
I guess. Maybe.

789
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,120
I think this deserves a bro hug.

790
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Bring it.

791
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
Damn, Ray.

792
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,880
You ruined my vacation...

793
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,960
and my nose.

794
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,480
Now we're even.

795
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
See? Problem solved.

796
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,240
I've got to say, Ms. Lance.

797
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,280
Now that I've seen your team
in action with my own eyes...

798
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
you are even worse than I imagined.

799
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,640
You're welcome.

800
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,400
Well, like Nate said...

801
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,080
sometimes we screw things up
for the better.

802
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,680
I fail to see how
that's true in this case.

803
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,560
It's our new motto.

804
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,840
New motto?

805
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,680
Right, does that mean
that you all plan to continue

806
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,200
swashbuckling your way
through history?

807
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,000
With the Time Bureau's
permission, of course.

808
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,640
And if I deny you permission?

809
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,640
- We'll do it anyways.
- Yeah.

810
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,680
Sir, the go-team has erased the
memories of Caesar and his forces.

811
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,080
Good.
We'd best take our leave, then.

812
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,520
Sara. Mr. Rory.

813
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,240
Do your best to stay out of trouble.

814
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,000
What's that?

815
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,200
It's a portal thingy.

816
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,640
Communications thing...

817
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,440
and a... yes...

818
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,640
a memory thing.

819
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,320
So I guess that means you're staying.

820
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,680
Well, I kind of have to.

821
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,960
You'd be dead without me.

822
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Cheers.

823
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,720
They are irresponsible,

824
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,880
undependable, unpredictable,
dangerous...

825
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,480
And yet effective.
At least on occasion.

826
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,960
Is that the reason
they're not warming a cell

827
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,320
back at headquarters as we speak?

828
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,960
They're not warming a cell,
Agent Sharpe.

829
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,600
Because they might just be
our best hope

830
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,360
of defeating what's coming.

831
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,280
They are the reason
Mallus is a threat.

832
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
Indeed.

833
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,520
But there might just come a day
when we need the Legends

834
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,080
to do what they do best...

835
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,000
Which is what, exactly?

836
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
Be the chainsaw.

837
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,600
Would you open a portal
back to headquarters?

838
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,920
I seem to have...

839
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,640
misplaced my Time Courier.

840
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,560
How's she running?

841
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,080
Lousy.

842
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,360
Rip's monkeys really
screwed up the works.

843
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,960
It's gonna take Ray months
to figure this out.

844
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
Why Raymond?

845
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,640
Well, I told Sara
to take us back home.

846
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,200
Oh, that's... that's
unfortunate, considering...

847
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,600
I have decided to stay aboard.

848
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Whoa, wait, wait, what?

849
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,320
I shanghaied you
into our first voyage.

850
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,320
I forced this life upon you.

851
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,560
I could hardly ask you
to give it up now.

852
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,080
But your life, your family...

853
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,320
I'll make it home

854
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,200
for the birth of my first grandchild.

855
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,040
As for my family...

856
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,480
They're on this ship as well.

857
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

858
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,680
You doing okay?

859
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,320
Well, nothing says "doing okay" like

860
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,080
pining over files of your ex.

861
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,240
Yeah, I was just thinking...

862
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
About her?

863
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,960
Yeah, about her, and...

864
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,160
and this place.

865
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,440
I miss being on the ship.

866
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
Yeah, of course you do.

867
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
It's your home.

868
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,160
And, she's back home too.

869
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,640
If she's happy, I'm happy.

870
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,880
She's happy, right?

871
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,040
Yeah. Totally.

872
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,160
This is the village.

873
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,720
Get out of our way, woman.

874
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,200
Actually, that's what
I was gonna tell you.

875
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,600
We have business here.

876
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,760
If you call poaching
and raping "business".

877
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,080
Zambesi is under my protection.

878
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,520
No! No, please don't!
