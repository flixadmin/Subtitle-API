1
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,360
(Mumled cheering and screams)

2
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,880
(Louder screaming and yelling)

3
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,120
Look at me. Look at me!

4
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,360
Do you remember me now, boy, eh?

5
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,800
Remember me?
There's a bright boy.

6
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,240
You'll be coming with me, boy,
and you'll be keeping your mouth shut.

7
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,040
- Keep your mouth shut, boy.
- l'm not a boy!

8
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,760
You're not a smart boy,
is that what you're trying to say?

9
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,640
Do you want to live, boy?!

10
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,320
North, boy, we're going north.

11
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,440
(Cawing)

12
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,760
lt had three eyes.

13
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,720
lt told me to come with him, so l did.

14
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,800
We went down into the crypts
and my father was there.

15
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,680
(Osha) Your father's not down there, little lord.

16
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,520
Not for many years yet.

17
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,880
- You're afraid. Just like Hodor.
- l'm not afraid of some hole in the ground.

18
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You've lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?

19
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,920
l'm a crippled boy and l'm willing to go.

20
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,160
That's my grandfather, Lord Rickard.

21
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,000
He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys.

22
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,760
That's Lyanna, my father's sister.

23
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,200
King Robert was supposed to marry her,

24
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,200
but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.

25
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,440
Robert started a war to win her back.

26
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,520
He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.

27
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,960
That's where l saw Father.

28
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,640
You see? He's not here.

29
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,200
(Growling)

30
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,600
(Snarling)

31
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,880
(Screams)

32
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,920
(Boy) Here, Shaggydog.
(Bran) Rickon!

33
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,040
That beast is supposed to be
chained in the kennels!

34
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,200
- He doesn't like chains.
- What are you doing down here?

35
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,480
- Come back up with us.
- No, l came to see Father.

36
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,960
How many times have l told you?
He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya.

37
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,360
He was down here. l saw him.

38
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,080
Saw him when?

39
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,240
Last night, when l was sleeping.

40
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
Here, Shaggydog.

41
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,680
You both miss him.

42
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,120
lt's only natural he should
be in your thoughts and dreams,

43
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,080
but that doesn't mean that...

44
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,720
Bran...

45
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,480
- My lady.
- My lady.

46
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,520
My lady.

47
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,800
My lady.

48
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,480
- My lady.
- My lady.

49
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,960
My lady.

50
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,240
(Panting)

51
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,960
(Gasping)

52
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,080
(Soft grunting, thudding)

53
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,280
(Louder grunting)

54
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,000
(Thudding and grunting continue)

55
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,840
Robb.

56
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,920
Robb.

57
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,680
- Robb!
- (Sobs)

58
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,680
You've ruined your sword.

59
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,960
Shh! Shh!

60
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,040
- Shh!
- l'll kill them all.

61
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,240
(Sobs)

62
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,840
- Every one of them.
- Shh.

63
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,440
l will kill them all.

64
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,840
- My boy.
- (Sobbing)

65
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,240
They have your sisters.

66
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,200
We have to get the girls back.

67
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,760
And then we will kill them all.

lsn't it a funny song?

82
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,320
Thank you for your rendition.

83
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,880
l imagine it was even better received
at that tavern.

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,960
l'm so sorry, Your Grace.

85
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
l'll never sing it again, l swear.

86
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,360
Tell me, which do you favour -

87
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,200
your fingers or your tongue?

88
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,440
Your Grace?

89
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,080
Fingers or your tongue?

90
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,720
lf you got to keep one, which would it be?

91
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,040
Or l could just cut your throat.

92
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,720
Every man needs hands, Your Grace.

93
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,440
Good.

94
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,120
- Tongue it is.
- Your Grace, please.

95
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,080
l won't sing, Your Grace.

96
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,160
Ser Ilyn, who better than you
to carry out the sentence?

97
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,600
l beg you! Please, no.

98
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,880
No!

99
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:15,920
Your Grace, please.
l beg you, l will never sing again!

100
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,840
- l'm done for the day.
- No! (Screaming)

101
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,240
l'll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.

102
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
(Man sobs)

103
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,720
Your Grace, please!

104
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,200
You look quite nice.

105
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,960
- Thank you, my lord.
- ''Your Grace.'' l'm King now.

106
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,080
(Sobbing) Stop! No!

107
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,160
Walk with me.
l want to show you something.

108
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,240
(Blade slashes)
(Gurgling)

109
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,560
Do as you're bid, child.

110
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,040
..and as soon as you've had your blood,
l'll put a son in you.

111
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,120
Mother says that shouldn't be long.

112
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,680
(Flies buzzing)

113
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,080
No! Please, no!

114
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,880
This one's your father.

115
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,080
This one here.

116
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,360
Look at it and see what happens to traitors.

117
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,240
- You promised to be merciful.
- l was.

118
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
l gave him a clean death.

119
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
Look at him.

120
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,240
Please let me go home.
l won't do any treason, l swear...

121
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,120
Mother says l'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here...and obey.

122
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,400
Look at him!

123
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,360
(Joffrey) Well?

124
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,360
How long do l have to look?

125
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,160
As long as it pleases me.

126
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,120
Do you want to see the rest?

127
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,480
lf it please Your Grace.

128
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,480
That's your Septa there.

129
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,000
l'll tell you what,
l'm going to give you a present.

130
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,600
After l raise my armies
and kill your traitor brother,

131
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,160
l'm going to give you his head as well.

132
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,600
Or maybe he'll give me yours.

133
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,160
My mother tells me a king
should never strike his lady.

134
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,760
Ser Meryn.

135
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,640
Here, girl.

136
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,960
Will you obey now?

137
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,720
Or do you need another lesson?

138
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
l'll look for you in court.

139
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,720
Save yourself some pain, girl.

140
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,600
Give him what he wants.

141
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,200
You'll be needing that again.

142
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,680
The proper course is clear -

143
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,280
pledge fealty to King Renly
and move south to join our forces with his.

144
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,400
Renly is not the king.

145
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,880
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord.

146
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,720
He put your father to death.

147
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,640
That doesn't make Renly king.

148
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,320
He's Robert's youngest brother.

149
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,200
lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me,
Renly can't be king before Stannis.

150
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,240
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?

151
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,840
- Renly is not right!
- (Greatjon) My lords.

152
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,720
- (Man) If we put ourselves behind Stannis...
- My lords!

153
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,880
Here is what l say to these two kings.

154
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,520
(Spits)
(Cheers, laughter)

155
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,000
Renly Baratheon is nothing to me,

156
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,440
nor Stannis neither.

157
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:20,160
Why should they rule over me and mine
from some flowery seat in the South?

158
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,960
What do they know of the Wall
or the Wolfswood?

159
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,920
Even their gods are wrong!

160
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,480
(All laugh)

161
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,880
Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again?

162
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
lt was the dragons we bowed to...

163
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,920
and now the dragons are dead!

164
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:46,400
There sits the only king
l mean to bend my knee to -

165
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,520
the King in the North!

166
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,680
l'll have peace on those terms.

167
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:00,200
They can keep their Red Castle

168
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,000
and their iron chair too.

169
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,840
The King in the North!

170
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,600
Am l your brother, now and always?

171
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
Now and always.

172
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,520
My sword is yours...

173
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,480
in victory and defeat,
from this day until my last day.

174
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,200
The King in the North!

175
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,960
(All) The King in the North!
The King in the North!

176
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,960
The King in the North!

177
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,520
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

178
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
The King in the North!

179
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,040
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

180
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,920
The King in the North!

181
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,840
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

182
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,480
The King in the North!

183
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,120
- Lady Stark.
- l want to see him.

184
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,720
Now!

185
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,280
(Prisoners coughing)

186
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,200
Leave us.

187
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,200
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.

188
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,960
Widowhood becomes you.

189
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,560
Your bed must be lonely.

190
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,400
ls that why you came?

191
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,000
l'm not at my best,
but l think l could be of service.

192
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,720
You slip out of that gown
and we'll see if l'm up to it.

193
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,280
(Groans)

194
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,840
Oh, l do like a violent woman.

195
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,680
l will kill you tonight, ser...

196
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,400
pack your head in a box
and send it to your sister.

197
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,880
Let me show you how...

198
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,280
Hit me again, over the ear.

199
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,200
And again and again. You're stronger
than you look. It shouldn't take long.

200
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,800
That is what you want the world to believe,
isn't it? That you don't fear death.

201
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,000
But l don't, my lady.

202
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,200
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?

203
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,720
Because you are going
to the deepest of the seven hells,

204
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,880
- if the gods are just.
- What gods are those?

205
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,880
The trees your husband prayed to?

206
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
Where were the trees
when his head was getting chopped om?

207
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,760
lf your gods are real and if they are just...

208
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,920
why is the world so full of injustice?

209
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,000
Because of men like you.

210
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,400
There are no men like me.

211
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,440
Only me.

212
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,640
My son Bran.

213
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,040
How did he come to fall from that tower?

214
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,600
l pushed him out the window.

215
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,360
Why?

216
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,720
l...hoped the fall would kill him.

217
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,160
Why?

218
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,120
You should get some sleep.

219
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,320
lt's going to be a long war.

220
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,560
l can't believe we're actually at war.

221
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:47,720
Was it this exciting last time,
when you were young?

222
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,320
What does it say?

223
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,800
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?

224
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,120
- What's our next move?
- Stop talking.

225
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,160
Get back into bed.

226
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,720
They have my son.

227
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:17,400
The Stark boy appears
to be less green than we'd hoped.

228
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,640
l've heard his wolf killed a dozen men
and as many horses.

229
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,280
ls it true about Stannis and Renly?

230
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,960
Both Baratheon brothers
have taken up against us.

231
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,440
Jaime captured, his armies scattered...

232
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,280
lt's a catastrophe.

233
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,160
Perhaps we should sue for peace.

234
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,240
(Goblet shatters)

235
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,080
There's your peace.

236
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,720
Joffrey saw to that when he decided
to remove Ned Stark's head.

237
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,840
You'll have an easier time
drinking from that cup

238
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,840
than you will bringing Robb Stark
to the table now.

239
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,280
He's winning...

240
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,400
- in case you hadn't noticed.
- l'm told we still have his sisters.

241
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,760
The first order of business
is ransoming Ser Jaime.

242
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,960
No truces. We can't amord to look weak.
We should march on them at once.

243
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:01,200
First we must return to Casterly Rock
to raise...

244
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,640
They have my son!

245
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,160
Get out, all of you.

246
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,360
Not you.

247
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,360
You were right about Eddard Stark.

248
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,120
lf he were alive, we could have used him to
broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun,

249
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,440
which would have given us more time
to deal with Robert's brothers. But now...

250
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,320
Madness. Madness and stupidity.

251
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,120
l always thought you were a stunted fool.

252
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,760
Perhaps l was wrong.

253
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,480
Half wrong.

254
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,320
l'm new to strategy, but...

255
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,240
Unless we want to be surrounded
by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.

256
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,920
No one will stay here.

257
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,560
Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders

258
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,560
and set the Riverland on fire
from God's Eye to the Red Fork.

259
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,560
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.

260
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,760
And you will go to King's Landing.

261
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,120
- And do what?
- Rule.

262
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:36,240
You will serve as Hand of the King
in my stead.

263
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,400
You will bring that boy king to heel,
and his mother too, if needs be.

264
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:43,000
And if you get so much as a whim of treason
from any of the rest -

265
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,000
- Baelish, Varys, Pycelle...
- Heads, spikes, walls.

266
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:49,360
Why not my uncle?

267
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,560
Why not anyone? Why me?

268
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,920
You're my son.

269
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,280
Oh, one more thing.

270
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,520
You will not take that whore to court.

271
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,240
Do you understand?

272
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,280
(Animals calling)

273
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,680
Ser Jorah?

274
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,560
Gently, gently.

275
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,920
My son...

276
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,280
Where is he? l want him.

277
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,520
Where is he?

278
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
The boy did not live.

279
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,120
- Tell me.
- What is there to tell?

280
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,400
How did my son die?

281
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:05,800
He never lived, my princess.

282
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,320
The women say...

283
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,480
What do the women say?

284
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,760
- They say the child was...
- (Mirri) Monstrous, twisted.

285
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,680
l pulled him out myself.

286
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,640
He was scaled like a lizard,

287
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,800
blind, with leather wings
like the wings of a bat.

288
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,840
When l touched him
the skin fell from his bones.

289
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,560
lnside...he was full of graveworms.

290
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,240
l warned you that only death
can pay for life.

291
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,160
You knew the price.

292
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,040
Where is Khal Drogo?

293
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,120
Show him to me.

294
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,400
Show me what l bought with my son's life.

295
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,400
As you command, lady.

296
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,800
Come. l will take you to him.

297
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,600
- Time enough for that later...
- l want to see him now.

298
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,840
The khalasar is gone.

299
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,560
A khal who cannot ride is no khal.

300
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,200
The Dothraki follow only the strong.

301
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,080
l'm sorry, my Princess.

302
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,760
Drogo!

303
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,040
My sun and stars.

304
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,760
Why is he out here alone?

305
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,600
He seems to like the warmth, Princess.

306
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,400
(Mirri) He lives.

307
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:55,400
You asked for life, you paid for life.

308
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,560
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?

309
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,600
When the sun rises in the west,
sets in the east.

310
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,440
When the seas go dry. When the mountains
blow in the wind like leaves.

311
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,600
Leave us.

312
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,160
l don't want you alone with this sorceress.

313
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,320
l have nothing more to fear
from this woman.

314
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,280
Go.

315
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:41,000
You knew what l was buying
and you knew the price.

316
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,600
lt was wrong of them to burn my temple.

317
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,080
- It angered the Great Shepherd.
- This is not God's work.

318
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,040
- My child was innocent.
- Innocent?

319
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,000
He would have been the stallion
who mounts the world.

320
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,120
Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar
will trample no nations into dust.

321
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,560
(Daenerys) l spoke for you.

322
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,600
- l saved you.
- (Chuckles) Saved me?

323
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,080
Three of those riders had already
raped me before you saved me, girl.

324
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,320
l saw my god's house burn,

325
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,760
there where l had healed men and women
beyond counting.

326
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,080
ln the streets l saw piles of heads...

327
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,440
the head of the baker who makes my bread,

328
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,680
the head of a young boy that l had
cured of feverjust three moons past.

329
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,760
So...tell me again
exactly what it was that you saved?

330
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
Your life.

331
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,080
Why don't you take a look at your khal...

332
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,600
Then you will see exactly
what life is worth...

333
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,280
when all the rest has gone.

334
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,040
You can't!

335
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,800
Get out of my way, Sam.

336
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,720
They'll put out the word.

337
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:08,240
They'll send out ravens.
People will come after you.

338
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:11,080
Do you know what happens to deserters?

339
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,080
Better than you do.

340
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,600
What are you going to do?

341
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,560
l'm gonna find my brother

342
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,360
and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.

343
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,760
You can't leave us now.
We need you here.

344
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:30,480
- Move.
- l won't let you go.

345
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:33,160
- Move.
- No.

346
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,640
- Hyah!
- (Neighs)

347
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,080
(Grunts)

348
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,720
Hand of the King?

349
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,840
So it would seem.

350
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,160
And your father said you couldn't
take anyone with you to King's Landing?

351
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,800
No, he said l couldn't take you with me
to King's Landing.

352
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,560
- He was very specific on that point.
- He knew my name?

353
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,200
What?

354
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:09,800
He said,
''Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing''?

355
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,640
l believe he used the word ''whore''.

356
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,680
Are you ashamed of me?

357
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,760
Are you afraid that l'm dancing around
the court with my tits out?

358
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,360
(Chuckles)

359
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,600
l'm funny now?

360
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,760
l'm Shae, the funny whore.

361
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,840
My father's probably the most powerful man
in the country.

362
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,360
Certainly the richest.

363
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,800
He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.

364
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,600
Everyone everywhere always has to do
exactly what my father says.

365
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,880
He's always been a cunt.

366
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:49,840
l believe the ladies of the court
could learn a great deal

367
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,600
from a girl like you.

368
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,680
Why don't you come with me,
be the Hand's lady?

369
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:02,200
Because the king needs a Hand
and the Hand...

370
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,960
l know what a Hand needs.

371
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,160
(Ghost barks)
(Men shouting)

372
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,200
Ghost?

373
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:23,360
(Man) Hyah!

374
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,720
Hyah! Hyah!

375
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,000
Hyah!

376
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,600
(Shrieks)

377
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,160
(Neighs)

378
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,760
Samwell!

379
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
- Is he dead?
- No, he's not dead.

380
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,240
(Samwell) Did we get him?

381
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,080
(Grenn) Come on, help me get him up.

382
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,360
Lucky you've got plenty of padding.

383
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,240
We're taking you back to where you belong.

384
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,800
- l belong with my brother.
- But we're your brothers now.

385
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,680
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.

386
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:58,960
They'll kill you if they know
you came after me.

387
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:02,000
- Go back.
- Sam told us everything.

388
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,600
- We're sorry about your father.
- But it doesn't matter.

389
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,960
You took the oath. You can't leave.

390
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,000
- l have to.
- You can't.

391
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,360
- You said the words.
- l don't care about...

392
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,480
''Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow...''

393
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:18,640
- To hell with all of you.
- ''Night gathers and now my watch begins.

394
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,760
''lt shall not end until my death.

395
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,760
''l shall live and die at my post.''

396
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,520
''l am the sword in the darkness...''

397
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,320
''The watcher on the walls...''

398
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,960
(All) ''The shield that guards the realms of men.

399
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,560
''l pledge my life and honour
to the Night's Watch,

400
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,200
''for this night and all nights to come.''

401
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,760
(Water spatters)

402
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,360
Do you remember
our first ride, my sun and stars?

403
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,680
lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away,
show me.

404
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,840
You're a fighter.
You've always been a fighter.

405
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:38,120
l need you to fight now.

406
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,640
l know you're very far away,

407
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:55,360
but come back to me, my sun and stars.

408
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,080
(ln English) When the sun...

409
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,560
rises in the west...

410
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,920
..and sets in the east...

411
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,800
(Sobs)

412
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,280
..then you shall return to me,
my sun and stars.

413
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,920
(Sobbing)

414
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,360
Kings? (Chuckles)

415
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh, l can tell you all there is
to know about kings.

416
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,920
The thing you need to understand
about kings is...

417
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:55,320
For the past 6T years, l've known...

418
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,080
truly known...
more kings than any man alive.

419
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,920
They're complicated men,
but l know how to serve them.

420
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,880
(Chuckles) Yes.

421
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,280
And keep on serving them. (Coughs)

422
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,600
Aerys Targaryen.

423
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,760
Of all the thousand thousand maladies
the gods visit on us...

424
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,920
madness is the worst.

425
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,840
He was a good man.

426
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,840
Such a charmer.

427
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,400
To watch him melt away before my eyes...

428
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:38,640
consumed by dreams of fire and blood...

429
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,120
Robert Baratheon
was an entirely dimerent animal -

430
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,800
powerful man, great warrior -

431
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:53,640
but alas, winning a kingdom
and ruling a kingdom

432
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,920
are rather dimerent things.

433
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,440
They say that...

434
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:00,880
if a man goes through life
with his battle visor down,

435
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,120
he can often be blind
to the enemies at his side. (Chuckles)

436
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,600
(Coughs) Now l serve his son...

437
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,000
King Joffrey...

438
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,560
may the gods bless his reign.

439
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,720
He is a capable young man -
strong military mind.

440
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,800
Stern.

441
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,040
But sternness in defence of the realm
is no vice.

442
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,720
(Coughs)

443
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,800
lt's far too soon to know
what manner of king he will be, but...

444
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:38,720
l sense true greatness on the horizon
for our new king.

445
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,360
Mmm. (Coughs)

446
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,680
True greatness.

447
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,720
So what's the thing?

448
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,000
What thing?

449
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,800
About kings.

450
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,560
You said, ''The thing you
need to understand about kings...''

451
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,480
What? Things? What?

452
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:02,520
When you started, you...
Never mind.

453
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,960
(Mutters) Let me see you out, my dear.

454
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,920
- It's all right. No need.
- Yes, yes.

455
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:11,000
Till the next time.

456
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,640
(Door closes)

457
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,720
(Sighs)

458
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,200
Right.

459
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,960
(Muttering)

460
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,960
(Groans)

461
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:00,600
When you imagine yourself up there,
how do you look?

462
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,920
Does the crown fit?

463
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,160
Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow,

464
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,120
the ones who sneered at you for years?

465
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,440
lt's hard for them to simper and bow
without heads.

466
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,880
A man with great ambition and no morals -

467
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,480
l wouldn't bet against you.

468
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,280
And what would you do, my friend,
if you found yourself sitting up there?

469
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,680
l must be one of the few men in this city
who doesn't want to be King.

470
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,160
You must be one of the few men in the city
who isn't a man.

471
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,800
Oh, you can do better than that.

472
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,440
When they castrated you,
did they take the pillar with the stones?

473
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,280
- l've always wondered.
- Have you?

474
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,440
Do you spend a lot of time
wondering what's between my legs?

475
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:49,440
l picture...a gash. Like a woman's.
Is that about right?

476
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:52,280
l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.

477
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,040
Must be strange for you,
even after all these years...

478
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,840
a man from another land,

479
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,160
despised by most,

480
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,480
feared by all...

481
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:04,120
Am l? That is good to know.

482
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,440
Do you lie awake at night
fearing my gash?

483
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,520
But you carry on...

484
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,520
whispering in one king's ear
and then the next.

485
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,400
l admire you.

486
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,640
And l admire you, Lord Baelish.

487
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,000
A grasper from a minor House with
a major talent for befriending powerful men...

488
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,000
- and women.
- A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.

489
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,160
So...

490
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,240
here we stand...

491
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,720
in mutual admiration and respect.

492
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,760
Playing our roles.

493
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,160
Serving a new king.

494
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,480
Long may he reign.

495
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,640
- My king.
- My king.

496
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,880
My lords. Shall we begin?

497
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,720
(Yoren) You're Arry now, hear me?

498
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,680
Arry the orphan boy.

499
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,240
No one asks an orphan too many questions,
cos nobody gives three shits.

500
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,120
What's your name?

501
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,360
Arry.

502
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,920
You've a long way to travel,
and in bad company.

503
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,040
l've 20 this time -
men and boys all bound for the Wall.

504
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,280
Your lord father gave me
the pick of the dungeons,

505
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,520
and l didn't find no little lordlings
down there.

506
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,880
This lot -

507
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,720
half of them would turn you over to the king
quick as spit for a pardon.

508
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,720
And the other half would do the same,
except they'd rape you first.

509
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,200
So keep to yourself -
and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.

510
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,760
You stay with this lot, boy.

511
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,320
And stay...

512
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,960
or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon
with these three.

513
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,040
Watch yourself, midget.

514
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,680
He's got a sword, this one.

515
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,240
What's a gutter rat like you
doing with a sword?

516
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,200
- Maybe he's a little squire.
- He ain't no squire. Look at him.

517
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,800
He looks like a girl.

518
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
l bet he stole that sword.

519
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,280
Let's have a look.

520
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,640
l could use me a sword like that.

521
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,000
- Take it om him.
- Give it here, midget.

522
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,760
Look at him.
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword.

523
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,640
l've seen him kick a boy to death.

524
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,840
l knocked him down
and l kicked him in the balls

525
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,120
and l kept kicking him
until he was dead.

526
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,960
l kicked him all to pieces.

527
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,400
- You better give me that sword!
- You want it?

528
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,120
l'll give it to you.

529
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,760
l already killed one fat boy.

530
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,160
l bet you never killed anyone.

531
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,880
l bet you're a liar. But l'm not.

532
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,800
l'm good at killing fat boys.

533
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,480
l like killing fat boys.

534
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,280
(Gasps)

535
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,480
Like picking on the little ones, do you?

536
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:40,200
l've been hammering an anvil
these past 10 years.

537
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,560
When l hit that steel, it sings.

538
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,320
Are you gonna sing when l hit you?

539
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,840
This is castle-forged steel.

540
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,960
Where'd you steal it?

541
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,680
- It was a gift.
- It don't matter now.

542
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,080
Where we're going,
they don't care what you've done.

543
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,400
They've got rapers,
pickpockets, highwaymen...

544
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,880
murderers.

545
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,200
- Which are you?
- Armourer's apprentice.

546
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,120
But my master got sick of me, so...
here l am.

547
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:17,240
(Yoren) Come on, you sorry sons of whores!

548
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,480
lt's a thousand leagues from here
to the Wall!

549
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,920
And winter is coming!

550
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:54,400
Ham.

551
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:59,160
How many days in a row must a man
be expected to start his day with ham?

552
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,920
Bring me some beer at least.

553
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,800
You look exhausted.

554
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,840
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?

555
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,200
Don't look so terrified.

556
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,800
lf we beheaded everyone
that ran away for the night,

557
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,520
only ghosts would guard the Wall.

558
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,840
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town.

559
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,480
Honour made you leave,

560
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,240
honour brought you back.

561
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:29,120
My friends brought me back.

562
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,080
l didn't say it was your honour.

563
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,640
- They killed my father.
- And you're gonna bring him back to life?

564
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,800
No? Good.

565
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,520
We've had enough of that sort of thing.

566
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:47,080
Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are
reporting whole villages abandoned.

567
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,120
At night they see fires
blazing in the mountains

568
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,280
from dusk until dawn.

569
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,680
A captured wildling swears their tribes
are uniting in some secret stronghold,

570
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,160
to what ends the gods only know.

571
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:03,440
Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men

572
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,720
discovered four blue-eyed corpses.

573
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,720
Unlike us, they were wise enough
to burn them.

574
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,120
Do you think your brother's war
is more important than ours?

575
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,360
No.

576
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,120
When dead men and worse
come hunting for us in the night,

577
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:26,960
do you think it matters
who sits on the Iron Throne?

578
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,000
- No.
- Good.

579
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,680
Because l want you
and your wolf with us

580
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,560
when we ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

581
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,160
Beyond the Wall?

582
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,200
l'll not sit meekly by...
and wait for the snows.

583
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:44,080
l mean to find out what's happening.

584
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
The Night's Watch will ride in force

585
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,120
against the wildlings, the white walkers
and whatever else is out there.

586
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,720
(Men shouting)

587
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,280
(Mormont) And we will find Benjen Stark,

588
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,880
alive or dead.

589
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,920
l will command them myself.

590
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,440
So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow...

591
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,320
(Man) Move out!

592
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,920
(Mormont) ..are you a brother of
the Night's Watch

593
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:12,480
or a bastard boy
who wants to play at war?

594
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,760
ls this your command, Khaleesi?

595
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:56,880
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs
in the Night Lands.

596
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,880
Sell them. You can return to the free cities
and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.

597
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,960
They were not given to me to sell.

598
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,200
Khaleesi, my Queen...

599
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,640
l vow to serve you, obey you,

600
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,560
to die for you if need be...

601
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:20,840
but let him go, Khaleesi.

602
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
l know what you intend. Do not.

603
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:24,760
l must.

604
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,880
(Sighs) You don't understand...

605
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,760
Don't ask me to stand aside
as you climb on that pyre.

606
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,560
l won't watch you burn.

607
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:37,080
ls that what you fear?

608
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,680
You will be my khalasar.

609
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,720
l see the faces of slaves.

610
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,120
l free you.

611
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:08,960
Take om your collars.
Go if you wish, no one will stop you.

612
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:10,520
But if you stay...

613
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,960
it will be as brothers and sisters,

614
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,240
as husbands and wives.

615
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,200
(Chuckles softly)

616
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,880
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.

617
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:35,280
You swore to obey me.

618
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:41,280
(Grunting)

619
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:46,760
l am Daenerys Stormborn...

620
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,560
of House Targaryen...

621
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:51,480
of the blood of old Valyria.

622
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,240
l am the Dragon's Daughter.

623
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,600
And l swear to you...

624
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:00,280
that those who would harm you
will die screaming.

625
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,960
- You will not hear me scream.
- l will.

626
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,600
But it is not your screams l want.

627
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,560
Only your life.

628
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,680
(Singing)

629
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,080
(Wailing)

630
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,840
(Mirri screaming)

631
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,480
(Screaming continues)

632
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,600
(Chirruping)

633
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,680
(Soft snarls)

634
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:36,680
Blood of my blood.

635
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,280
(Hisses)

636
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,160
(Hisses)

637
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:10,200
(Shrieking)

638
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,720
(Shrieking continues)
