1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,479
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,909
Is this your new girlfriend?

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,259
- Um, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,659
You and I dating would be totally weird.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,699
Totally weird.

6
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,479
Wow, that's beautiful.

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,099
Step away from the creature, miss.

8
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,109
You murdered him!

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,539
Hank is running some secret project.

10
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,359
He's not just taking the fugitives.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,519
He's testing on them.

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,079
I don't need you anymore.

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,959
I don't need you anymore, either.

14
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,939
What did you do?

15
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,969
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,249
Maybe I shouldn't intrude.

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,979
Nate needs all of our support right now.

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,609
Well, what am I supposed to say to him?

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,599
"Sorry the woman I've been
exchanging love letters with

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,819
in prison killed your dad"?

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,279
They ought to put that
on a condolence card.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,890
Look, we are going inside
and we are going to strive

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,119
with grace to help our
friend cope with his loss.

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,829
Damn it.

25
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,670
Here, let me help.

26
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,009
Hey, uh, thanks for sticking
around this past week.

27
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,259
What are pretend girlfriends for?

28
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,159
My mom's gonna be so crushed
when I tell her we broke up.

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,170
Then don't.

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,359
I... I mean, she's going through a lot.

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,889
We can pretend break
up any time we want.

32
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,320
We should, um... we should
probably get out there.

33
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,319
You ready for this?

34
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,939
Oh, Nathaniel.

35
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,869
I need you to make a toast later.

36
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,860
Tell everyone what an amazing
man your father was.

37
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,299
Yeah, Mom, I don't think
that's a great idea.

38
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,669
What? Of course it is.

39
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,759
And Zari, I am so glad that

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,089
you're here for Nathaniel
to lean on right now.

41
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,550
Yeah, um, you know me.

42
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,720
I'm... I'm his rock.

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,139
I can't. I... I can't face him.

44
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,019
Wait... wait.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,739
I hope you're not stress-eating, squire.

46
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,369
I don't know what else to do.

47
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,979
I can't believe this is happening.

48
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,709
You feel the energy in this room?

49
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,879
It's like sitting on a keg of dynamite.

50
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,479
You see, wakes are notorious soft spots

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,549
where the supernatural
meets the living world.

52
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,049
See Nate's aunt?

53
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,659
That particular prayer is
to ward off evil spirits

54
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,679
and they've covered the mirrors,

55
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,869
so the bad lads can't get in.

56
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,299
Well, that's creepy.

57
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,669
Yeah, well, creepy is my business.

58
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,559
And it looks like business is good.

59
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,299
Oh!

60
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,659
Nate, Nate, I'm... I'm
sorry. I'm... I'm so sorry.

61
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,119
No, it's... it's okay, Ray.

62
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,119
No, no, no, it's not.

63
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,079
I keep giving Nora second chances and

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,879
she goes and does this.

65
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,739
Look, you thought Nora could change

66
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,990
and I never thought my dad would
be torturing magical creatures,

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,259
so I guess... I guess we're both wrong.

68
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,809
Can't believe you're
the one comforting me.

69
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,519
Oh, come on. I love you, bro.

70
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,380
That's never gonna change.

71
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,939
Love you, too.

72
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,799
Oh, no. Don't, no-no-no, don't.

73
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,579
Don't, don't, don't do it, Ray.

74
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,709
Don't... you're gonna do it.

75
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,459
You're gonna do it.

76
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,879
Nora?

77
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,839

78
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,849
How... how are you doing that?

79
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,479
It's a reflection spell.

80
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,349
I can't hold it much longer.

81
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,890
Well, good, because
there's nothing you could

82
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,439
possibly say that would
make any difference.

83
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,519
This time there will be
no more second chances.

84
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,609
Ray! I didn't kill Nate's dad.

85
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,860
Oh, thank God, you're innocent.

86
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,869
Tell me where you are.

87
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,029
I need to talk to you in person.

88
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,339
Now, who wants a nice, juicy steak?

89
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,949
Charlie, uh, you know
that I'm a vegetarian.

90
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,320
No, no, no, you used to be a vegetarian

91
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,899
when you were a normal, boring human.

92
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,889
- But now you are...
- A monster?

93
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,819
Exactly. I mean, how cool is that?

94
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,139
Wait, are you trying to get
me to shift into Wolfie?

95
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,229
Of course I am.

96
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,539
You've been moping about the ship,

97
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,849
thinking about your lost love.

98
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,179
But I think that he would
really want you to just

99
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,569
embrace your wild side.

100
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,180
Konane liked me as Mona.

101
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,779
Whoa.

102
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,719
The words on your shirt.

103
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,110
These are the names of my favorite

104
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,409
Jane Austen characters.

105
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,489
It appears that you're experiencing

106
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,949
the impact of a magical fugitive.

107
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,249
Oh.

108
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,819
This better be good, Mona.

109
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,859
A fugitive got to Jane Austen.

110
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,959
She never wrote "Sense and Sensibility."

111
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,919
And "Pride and Prejudice"
disappeared, too.

112
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,419
Whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait.

113
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,799
Did someone say history's in trouble?

114
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,349
Legends assemble!

115
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,309
Okay, I really need to
get out of here, too.

116
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,479
Hey, what's up?

117
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,179
Nothing.

118
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,109
Uh, there's a fugitive
alert, but it can wait.

119
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,979
No, you should go.

120
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,479
It's hard enough I have to play pretend.

121
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,490
You guys shouldn't.

122
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,819
Okay.

123
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,829
- Bye, Nate.
- Bye, Zari.

124
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,419
Gideon traced a new
Fugitive to a wedding

125
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,599
Jane Austen attended in
Bath, England, 1802.

126
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,639
I already had Gideon chart a course.

127
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,020
Can I come on the mission?

128
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,849
Please?

129
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,349
Sure.

130
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,019
Yeah, and as much as I
love a good wedding sneak,

131
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,859
I'm gonna QB from,
um... from my bedroom.

132
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,069
Is he acting weirder than normal?

133
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,119
Yeah.

134
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,429
Speaking of weird...

135
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,819
I think my sense of smell has
improved because of Wolfie.

136
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,129
And you smell exactly like... Nate.

137
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,169
No, I don't.

138
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,089
It's definitely Nate.

139
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,299
Nate and something else.

140
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,179
Arousal?

141
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,659
No, I don't...

142
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,819
I don't like Nate.

143
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,279
- That would be wrong and...
- He likes you.

144
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,309
He confessed it when he
swallowed the truth bug.

145
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,519
We're so not passing the
Bechdel Test right now.

146
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,799
It's okay to talk about guys sometimes.

147
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,149
Come on. I bet it's been
months since you got laid.

148
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,290
Now, why don't you just go smash Nate?

149
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,839
Or better yet, you should go

150
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,719
smash somebody else because
if you're still thinking

151
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,909
about Nate then you know
you're really into him.

152
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,159
Why don't you talk to Nate?
Tell him how you feel.

153
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,829
- Oh, boo.
- That is a terrible idea.

154
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,619
Okay, I'm going. Bye.

155
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,379
_

156
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,219
This is like a Jane Austen
novel come to life.

157
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,219
Oh, my bonnet!

158
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,519
Look out!

159
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,229
Whoa!

160
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,399
- Whoa.
- Oh.

161
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,200
Forgive me, miss. Are you hurt?

162
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,920
Only my pride.

163
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,220
Injured pride is a small thing...

164
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,520
if it allowed us to meet.

165
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,980
What's the holdup there?

166
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,190
- Come, come, I say.
- Duty calls.

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,969
Apologies, Lord Remington.

168
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,719
We'll be on our way shortly.

169
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,309
Here.

170
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,889
Not a word.

171
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,399
Was that a curtsey?

172
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,199
"Only my pride."

173
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,519
Okay, let's go. Shut up.

174
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,779
A damsel.

175
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,699
If you don't jump that
buff coachman's bones,

176
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,329
I will.

177
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,939
We are at this wedding to
catch a magical creature.

178
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,580
If that's the groom, then
I'm glad I'm not the bride.

179
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,450
A man's charms are
equal to his fortunes.

180
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,769
And Mr. Dockerty's
fortunes are prodigious.

181
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,149
Jane.

182
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,780
Don't be rude.

183
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,320
That's Jane Austen.

184
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,039
I cannot marry you, Mr. Dockerty.

185
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,499
My heart yearns for another.

186
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,629
Our family's scullery maid.

187
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,249
Ellen, are you here?

188
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,549
I'm here.

189
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,089
I love you, too!

190
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,460
Scandal!

191
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,550
Oh, dear Lord.

192
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,159
Oh.

193
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,519
I give not one fig, Miss Sinclair,

194
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,979
for my heart and my
lower extremities yearn

195
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,139
for your mother.

196
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,200
Get over here, gorgeous.

197
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,449
- Come to me, my love.
- Ooh!

198
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,110
This is what I call a wedding.

199
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,949
Coast is clear.

200
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,279
I really don't want you to get
in trouble with your friends.

201
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,399
Oh, it's no trouble.

202
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,089
It looks like everyone
else is still on mission.

203
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,479
Okay.

204
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,100
Uh, so, who did kill Hank?

205
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,159
- The demon.
- Okay, good.

206
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,189
I... obviously, I mean...
obviously, it's bad.

207
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,939
If it's a demon, that means that

208
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,429
John will be able to find proof and

209
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,529
you just need to lay low
until he comes back.

210
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,399
You really don't mind me staying here?

211
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,560
Yeah, no, it'd be nice
if you stayed here.

212
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,779
Oy, Rayge. Where are you?

213
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,379
I've got an update on the mission...

214
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,379
- "Rayge"?
- It's a long story.

215
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,620
- ... need to do some research...
- What's... oh... oh...

216
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,039
What...

217
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,499
What are you hiding in there?

218
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,959
Hmm? What? Nothing.

219
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,089
Ah, buffing the old bishop, was we?

220
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,839
It's all right, mate.

221
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,929
No judgment here, all right?

222
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,679
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

223
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,729
So, the bride and the scullery maid,

224
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,329
- that was...
- Insane?

225
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,779
- Romantic.
- I was gonna say hot.

226
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,439
Regardless, that
definitely did not happen

227
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,509
in actual history.

228
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,100
Ray, Charlie, what you got?

229
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,779
This wedding was the second of a series

230
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,109
of lust outbreaks in 1802.

231
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,709
Yeah, the sexual revolution came

232
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,139
a couple hundred years too early.

233
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,040
Why would it make Jane
Austen stop writing?

234
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,249
We need more info.

235
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,039
Well, Jane Austen was known for being

236
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,959
a keen social observer, so
if anyone would have noticed

237
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,029
a new magical arrival in
town, it would be her.

238
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,759
Okay, let's go interview Jane.

239
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,369
Oh, wait, hang on a tick.

240
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,260
People with the real dirt,
always the servants.

241
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,439
Like a handsome coachman perhaps, hmm?

242
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,059
Fine, I'll go ask him some questions.

243
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,229
- But that's it.
- You go get it, girl.

244
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,859
Okay.

245
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,319
Sister, dear, this is
Miss Lance and Miss Wu.

246
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,259
They're new in town.

247
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,889
Try not to scare them away.

248
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,829
I shall do my best, Cassandra.

249
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,769
We are so sorry to interrupt
your writing, Miss Austen.

250
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,579
This? Just a letter.

251
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,109
Uh, shall we take a turn around
the room while we converse?

252
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,719
We'd be delighted to.

253
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,179
It's a Regency thing. Go with it.

254
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,319
So, the bride, Miss Sinclair,

255
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,789
her behavior must have
been quite a shock.

256
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,059
Ever since Lord Remington
arrived a week ago,

257
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,299
the entire town has been
acting most imprudently.

258
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,209
But Miss Sinclair's situation
is truly horrendous.

259
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,339
Oh, I'd think you of all people

260
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,909
would celebrate the triumph of romance.

261
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,589
What's to celebrate?

262
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,509
Miss Sinclair will be cut
off from her fortune

263
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,299
and the two women will
have nothing to live on.

264
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,519
But it's because of
you... I... I mean...

265
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,019
I have come to believe that

266
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,659
love will find a way to
overcome any obstacle.

267
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,899
Then you're either lying
or you're a fool.

268
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,359
Tell me, has love worked
out so well for you?

269
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,699
- No, but...
- Then you are a fool.

270
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,600
For you shouldn't have
to learn a lesson twice.

271
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:33,509
Let's go find Lord Remington.

272
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,580
We should be going.

273
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,920
Hello?

274
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,950
This is stupid.

275
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,740
What a pleasure to see you again.

276
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,659
Hey, man.

277
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,479
What's up, pretty?

278
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,319
This whole toasting is
eating me up on the inside.

279
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,869
My... my dad was such a dick.

280
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,209
He lied about everything and now

281
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,699
he's turning me into a liar, too.

282
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,089
Listen, your old man's gone.

283
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,860
Whatever you say out
there, that's for you.

284
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,859
You know what, Mick?

285
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,060
I think you're onto something.

286
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,809
Nathaniel!

287
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,719
Hey, where's Nate?

288
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,989
Well, we need to find him
because Hank's spirit

289
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,699
is still here.

290
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,619
Hey, cheer up.

291
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,100
I mean, what does Jane Austen know?

292
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,899
How to be witty and wise and
mix satire with romance.

293
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,169
I bet you these girls know
where Lord Remington is.

294
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,259
They do look like fan girls.

295
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,009
Okay, you know the era.
You take the lead.

296
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,949
He's simply the handsomest
man I've ever laid eyes on.

297
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,179
I know what you mean.

298
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,619
Lord Remington is such a fine specimen.

299
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,789
I can't say I share your sentiment.

300
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,260
His coachman, though,

301
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,619
what he lacks in means,

302
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,369
he makes up for in magnetism.

303
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,969
I concur.

304
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,669
His arrival has sent
many hearts aflutter.

305
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,339
Coachman,

306
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,459
as in the guy we pushed
Zari to hook up with!

307
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,089
Zari's gonna smash the fugitive!

308
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,650
Oh...

309
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,969
Sorry. This is moving really fast.

310
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,440
- I agree.
- You do?

311
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,979
What's your name?

312
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:09,069
Uh, my name is Zari. What's your name?

313
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,359
You know what? Don't...
don't answer that.

314
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,320
You don't kiss like any
man I've ever known.

315
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,180
What are you?

316
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,039
I am Kamadeva,

317
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,220
the Hindu god of love.

318
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,339
Awesome.

319
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,639
- Oh!
- We're too late!

320
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,479
Zari!

321
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,129
We think you might be dealing with...

322
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,420
The fugitive?

323
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,139
Yeah, I know.

324
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,960
This is Kamadeva.

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,840
As in the namesake of
Kama Sutra, Kamadeva?

326
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,069
That I did not know.

327
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,699
Look, I'm not going to sleep
with a magical fugitive.

328
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,619
You are incredible.

329
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,979
A woman has never before
resisted my charms.

330
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,429
All right, you're coming with us.

331
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,209
I would follow Miss Zari
to the world's end.

332
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,110
Well, your days of ruining
Regency-era marriages

333
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,779
are over, Kamadeva.

334
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,109
I only sought to grant
people the courage

335
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,359
to follow their hearts' desire.

336
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,279
Oh, I think he likes you.

337
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,919
Gideon, get us out of here.

338
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,860
I'm not so sure we can go yet.

339
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,339
Miss Wu is correct.

340
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,939
The historical records still indicate

341
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,859
that Jane Austen's
career is in jeopardy.

342
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,759
We caught the fugitive.
What's the problem?

343
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,059
Well, it's too late to knock
on Jane Austen's door tonight.

344
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,249
We'll talk to her tomorrow.

345
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,459
So, I'm to spend the night...

346
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,470
Alone.

347
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,279
Oh, what a waste.

348
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,009
All right, everybody out.

349
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,759
- Hi.
- Come on.

350
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,389
Surely I can have a bed.

351
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,569
Well, I had Gideon fabricate
some jim-jams because, uh,

352
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,149
you know, it's a slumber party.

353
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,360
Oh, uh, thanks.

354
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,869
Uh, obviously since you're my
guest, you will get the bed.

355
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,239
Oh, well, it's big enough
for the both of us.

356
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,539
We can just share.

357
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,379
Oh, okay.

358
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,420
You can turn around now.

359
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,979
Hmm.

360
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,799
It really covers everything.

361
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,399
Thing is, I pride myself
on being a gentleman

362
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,799
and the gentlemanly thing to do

363
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,969
would be to sleep in the chair.

364
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,969
So...

365
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,949
But you... you... you
can't... there's no way...

366
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,749
Oh, that's not...

367
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,520
Okay.

368
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,339
Hey, Nate. How's the old toast going?

369
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,759
Is there one or two N's in "conniving"?

370
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,040
Right, then.

371
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,399
Uh, may I suggest a
slight change of plan?

372
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,569
No. Mick is right.

373
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,760
It's time for me to tell
the truth about my dad.

374
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,229
How was I supposed to know
Hank's ghost was here?

375
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,300
Wait, what?

376
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,640
Yeah, that's about the
gist of it, Natey boy.

377
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,989
You see, your old man's
spirit is working very hard

378
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,919
to stay attached to the mortal realm.

379
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,460
I can only surmise that he has something

380
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,139
he wants to say to you,
so if you wouldn't mind

381
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,499
leaving off your roast for a bit,

382
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,319
joining us for a brief séance,

383
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,440
and I'll have him on his way in no time.

384
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,340
No.

385
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,699
There's nothing Hank can
say now to excuse him

386
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,929
from embezzling money
and hurting creatures.

387
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,219
In fact, I'm glad he's still here,

388
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,349
'cause it's his turn to listen to me!

389
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,349
You don't scare me, Hank!

390
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,960
Ray?

391
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,780
You want me in bed with you?

392
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,759
Yes, I did. I do.

393
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,259
I do.

394
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,869
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

395
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,679
Ava.

396
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,050
Damn it, this is definitely a dream.

397
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,899
The fugitive get to you, too?

398
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah.

399
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,189
Well, personally, I
really enjoyed my night,

400
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,149
blowing David Bowie's mind.

401
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,519
Who'd you get a leg over, Z?

402
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,979
Wait, let me guess. Nate?

403
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,300
No, Kamadeva.

404
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,909
- Both?
- It was both!

405
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,149
Blimey, Z, I didn't
know you had it in you.

406
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,500
What about you, Wolfie?

407
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,740
You dreamt about Konane.

408
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,519
Mona...

409
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,089
I'll get it.

410
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,299
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

411
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,429
He had the sweetest eyes.

412
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,719
And when he would look at me,

413
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,839
the whole world would disappear.

414
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,060
And now he's dead.

415
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,619
Mona, I know it's hard, but
try to have some perspective.

416
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,439
You didn't know him for very long.

417
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,599
So, you think I'm a fool, too?

418
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,989
No, I just don't think anyone
should give their heart away

419
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,869
without thinking about the consequences.

420
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,700
But romance is taking
a chance on someone

421
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,959
without knowing how it's gonna end up!

422
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,159
Romance is something used to
sell novels. It's not real.

423
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,379
Well, it'll never be real for you.

424
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,669
Not if you never try.

425
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,759
Not if you never take a risk!

426
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,459
You know, it's hard to
take advice from someone

427
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,389
whose boyfriend turned
her into a werewolf.

428
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,100
Hey, guys.

429
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,340
Let's just take a breath.

430
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,599
You're right.

431
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,800
I might be stupid for being a romantic,

432
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,580
but it's not Konane's fault.

433
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,699
Bloody hell!

434
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,449
Finally! You look wicked, mate!

435
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,420
Mona, wait!

436
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,429
Jane Austen.

437
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,430
It's time for you to pay!

438
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,040
Stay back, beast!

439
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,419
If I'm a beast, it's because of you!

440
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,939
Your books made me an
incurable romantic!

441
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,620
You're the reason I risked
everything for love!

442
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,540
And now Konane's dead!

443
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,199
And look at me!

444
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,329
You don't believe in romance!

445
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,520
Your writing is all lies!

446
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,089
Are you the girl from earlier?

447
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,959
Mona is weak.

448
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,549
Wolfie is strong.

449
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,499
Well, Wolfie, I believe from the depths

450
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,000
of my soul that one should
only marry for love.

451
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,639
You do?

452
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,199
So much so that I rejected
the only man who has ever

453
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,280
asked for my hand.

454
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,609
He was a smug simpleton
who only read sermons.

455
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,300
How remarkable.

456
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,929
You shouldn't mess with people's dreams.

457
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,789
My powers don't create
passion out of thin air.

458
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,719
Whomever you dreamt
about, you truly desire.

459
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,959
It doesn't mean I have to act on it.

460
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,359
It's called impulse control.

461
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,949
You sound like a woman

462
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,829
who has never let herself fall in love.

463
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,939
Where I'm from, love is a liability.

464
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,260
And yet a life without
love is no life at all.

465
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,820
Tell me, what does a god
know about the human heart?

466
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,060
My real name is Sanjay.

467
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,860
I was born thousands of years ago.

468
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,179
When the actual Kamadeva
was immolated by Shiva,

469
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,340
I gathered his ashes in this vial.

470
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,780
They bestowed powers I could
have scarcely imagined.

471
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,719
Why are you telling me this?

472
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,500
Because I like you.

473
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,849
And I think you secretly yearn
to be impulsive and free.

474
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,600
Unless you lack the courage.

475
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,539
Okay. Give me a hit.

476
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,289
- Might I suggest...
- Nope.

477
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,199
If I'm gonna do this,
I want to experience

478
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,879
love, lust, the whole shebang.

479
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,299
That is, unless you lack the courage.

480
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,679
One, two, three.

481
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,939
Oh, wow.

482
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,159
Most of you here, uh, knew Hank well.

483
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,440
Or, thought you did.

484
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,479
I'm gonna talk about a different Hank,

485
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,669
a Hank I got to know this year.

486
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,120
Hank was a workaholic who
never took a day off.

487
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,729
Well, Hank, you can, um,
finally rest in peace.

488
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,980
Um, Hank never knew his own father.

489
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,120
That's why he wanted to be there
for Nathaniel growing up.

490
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,669
But work often got in the way.

491
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:24,540
So one year, we planned
to use Hank's leave

492
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,960
to stay for a week in Disney World.

493
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,740
Nathaniel was over the moon.

494
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,919
But the morning that we
were to fly to Orlando,

495
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,239
we ended up having to take Nathaniel

496
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,720
to the hospital instead.

497
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,379
When Hank saw the look of disappointment

498
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,499
in his son's eyes, he went out

499
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,340
and rented a Mickey Mouse costume,

500
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,299
put it on, and went to the hospital.

501
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,639
He convinced everyone
there that Mickey Mouse

502
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,280
had come to see them.

503
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,819
Hank Heywood was not a perfect man.

504
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:09,719
But when he was at his
best, that is who he was,

505
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,389
a man who could make
you believe in magic.

506
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,899
To Hank.

507
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,929
To Hank.

508
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,959
Why did you tell me that
by following their hearts,

509
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,089
those women would only
fall into despair?

510
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,829
Because my decision was
a result of my pride.

511
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,179
When my father dies, my
sister and I will be

512
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,129
- reduced to penury.
- But your writing...

513
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,680
Has been rejected by every publisher.

514
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,039
It's no wonder.

515
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,079
I satirize the manners
of a society that seems

516
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,799
to have lost all sense of decorum.

517
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,319
Therefore, I've decided to stop writing.

518
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,239
But you will publish.

519
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,849
You can't give up now,

520
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,640
because your books are timeless.

521
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,319
How can you be so sure?

522
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,560
Because...

523
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,700
you're my favorite author.

524
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,160
May I offer you a bit of advice?

525
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,079
My books advocate a
partnership based on love

526
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,779
and mutual respect,

527
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,640
not on losing control.

528
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,199
What shall we do next?

529
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,380
I have an idea.

530
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,450
Let's get married.

531
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,079
Do you hear that?

532
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,840
No. Hear what?

533
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,459
There's definitely music playing.

534
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,619
Kamadeva loved music.

535
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,900
Perhaps you should sing.

536
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,399

A Christian wedding?

I took the liberty of broadcasting

558
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,949
- Miss Tomaz's comms.
- Huh.

559
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,549
It's rather infectious.

Ray, this music,

561
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,199
- I think it's magical.
- You're right.

562
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,199
I want to express my
feelings to you in verse.

Is that really necessary?

I'll bet mine was dirtier.

566
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,299
Why didn't you go and make a move?

567
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,299
I would have, if you'd been flirtier.

so I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

you had to stick around?

I made a terrible mistake.

00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,689
A man approached me about a deal.

652
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,700
Unlimited funding.

653
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,599
And all I had to do was give him access

654
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,020
to all the magical creatures
within the Time Bureau.

655
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,909
But this man was no
ordinary beltway bandit.

656
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,420
He was a demon.

657
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,440
Only after he murdered me
did I realize the truth.

658
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,009
What was the demon's name?

659
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,029
Promise me you'll keep Nathaniel safe.

660
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,799
Yes, yes, yes, I promise.
Now, come on, Hank,

661
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,719
you can't delay the inevitable forever.

662
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,599
What was the demon's name?

663
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,859
His name was Neron.

664
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,500
_

665
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,149
Hey, world. I'm Hank Heywood.

666
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,319
And I'm here to tell you about
an exciting opportunity.

667
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,060
When I learned about the existence of

668
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:30,400
magical creatures... yes,
magical creatures exist...

669
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,560
I ran right home and
pulled out a drawing

670
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,749
made by my son,

671
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,079
Nathaniel, when he was
only nine years old.

672
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,289
My son envisioned a theme
park where everyone

673
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:45,470
could gaze in wonder at
dragons and unicorns,

674
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,219
werewolves and minotaurs.

675
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,719
This is insane.

676
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,980
Now, you may be thinking,
"This is insane."

677
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,330
But what great man hasn't
been thought of as insane

678
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,139
at one point in his life?

679
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,660
I believe this park can
bring our country together.

680
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,060
And with your help,

681
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,980
I'm going to turn my son's
dream into a reality.

682
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,359
I call it Heyworld.

683
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,180
Oh, Hank.

684
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,160
Why?

685
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,149
Oh, Hank.

686
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,660
I have so many questions.

687
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,999
You weren't torturing magical creatures.

688
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,619
You were training them
to be in a theme park.

689
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,020
That is nuts.

690
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,519
But I gotta respect
you for dreaming big.

691
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,630
It was your moonshot, your way of

692
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,449
risking it all to make the
world a better place.

693
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,160
I was so wrong about you.

694
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,719
At the end of the day,
you were just as wacky

695
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,240
and well-intentioned as any Legend.

696
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,300
And I wish I had a chance to
get to know that side of you.

697
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,820
I'm gonna miss you.

698
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,400
I love you, Hank.

699
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,900
I love you, Dad.

700
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,749
Look at you.

701
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,400
Take a look at yourself,
you miserable git.

702
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,659
That's right.

703
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,940
Soak it in.

704
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,689
Your big sacrifice, it was for nothing.

705
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,819
But instead of rolling up your sleeves

706
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,540
and taking it to that demon bastard,

707
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,520
you're getting rat-ass drunk in a shed.

708
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,140
I can't fight him.

709
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,799
He's too strong.

710
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,599
Oh, this isn't about Neron.

711
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,599
You failed Desmond.

712
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,080
You failed Astra.

713
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,960
And you'll fail Nate. And you know why?

714
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,819
Because deep down,

715
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,830
you want them all to go to Hell.

716
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,250
You want the company.

717
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:20,779
You liar!

718
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,080
Hey, Johnny.

719
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,360
Miss me?

720
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,000
Des.

721
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,220
I'm surprised you haven't
figured it out yet.

722
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,160
Neron.

723
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:51,390
