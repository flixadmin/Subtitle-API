1
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,121 
I believe in America.

2
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,999 
America has made my fortune

3
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,085 
and I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,548 
I gave her freedom,
but I taught her

5
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,134 
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,221 
She found a boyfriend.
Not an Italian.

7
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,682 
She went to the movies with him.

8
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,768 
She stayed out late.
I didn't protest.

9
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,398 
Two months ago,
he took her for a drive

10
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,984 
with another boyfriend.

11
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,945 
They made her drink whiskey,

12
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,240 
and then they tried
to take advantage of her.

13
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,660 
She resisted.

14
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,163 
She kept her honor.

15
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,917 
So they beat her like an animal.

16
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,547 
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken...

17
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,009 
her jaw was shattered...

18
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,512 
held together by wire.

19
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,099 
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

20
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:27,439 
But I wept.
Why did I weep?

21
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,611 
She was the light of my life.

22
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,990 
Beautiful girl.

23
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,454 
Now she will never
be beautiful again.

24
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,130 
Sorry.

25
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,766 
I, I went to the police,
like a good American.

26
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,311 
These two boys
were brought to trial.

27
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,399 
A judge sentence them
to three years in prison...

28
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,985 
and suspend their sentence.

29
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,321 
Suspended the sentence.

30
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,866 
They went free that very day.

31
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,537 
I stood in the courtroom
like a fool.

32
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,666 
And those two bastard,
they smiled at me.

33
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,671 
Then I said to my wife,
"For justice...

34
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,299 
we must go to Don Corleone."

35
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,515 
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

36
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,518 
What do you want of me?

37
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,605 
Tell me anything,
but do what I beg you to do.

38
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,317 
What is that?

39
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,718 
That I cannot do.

40
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,721 
I'll give you anything you ask.

41
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,893 
We've known each other many years,
but this is the first time...

42
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,313 
you ever came to me
for counsel or for help.

43
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,358 
I can't remember the last time
that you invited me...

44
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,944 
to your house
for a cup of coffee...

45
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,698 
even though my wife
is godmother to your only child.

46
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,076 
But let's be frank.

47
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,578 
You never wanted my friendship...

48
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,707 
and you were afraid
to be in my debt.

49
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,293 
I didn't want
to get into trouble.

50
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,922 
I understand.

51
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,800 
You found paradise in America.

52
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,596 
You had a good trade,
you made a good living.

53
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,307 
Police protected you,
and there were courts of law.

54
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,935 
So you didn't need
a friend like me.

55
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,315 
But, now you come to me
and you say,

56
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,943 
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

57
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,531 
But you don't ask with respect.

58
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,200 
You don't offer friendship.

59
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,786 
You don't even think
to call me 'Godfather.'

60
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,747 
Instead, you come into my house

61
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,749 
on the day my daughter
is to be married

62
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,252 
and you ask me to do murder
for money.

63
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,630 
I ask you for justice.

64
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,466 
That is not justice.
Your daughter is still alive.

65
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,138 
They must suffer then
as she suffers.

66
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,726 
How much shall I pay you?

67
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,784 
Bonasera. Bonasera.

68
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,664 
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

69
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,044 
If you'd come to me
in friendship,

70
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,171 
then the scum
that ruined your daughter

71
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,673 
would be suffering
this very day.

72
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,884 
And if, by chance,

73
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,969 
an honest man like yourself
should make enemies,

74
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,472 
then they would become
my enemies.

75
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,060 
And then they would fear you.

76
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,650 
Be my friend?

77
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,572 
Godfather.

78
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,662 
Good.

79
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,706 
Someday, and that day
may never come...

80
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,209 
I'll call upon you
to do a service for me.

81
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,505 
But until that day...

82
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,759 
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

83
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,721 
<i>- Grazie, Godfather.</i>
- Prego

84
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,273 
Give this to Clemenza.

85
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,235 
I want reliable people,

86
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,404 
people that aren't
going to be carried away.

87
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,947 
I mean, we're not murderers,

88
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,533 
in spite of what
this undertaker says.

89
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,518 
- Where's Michael?
- What? Don't worry.

90
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,270 
It's early. He'll be here.

91
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,521 
We're not taking it.

92
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,024 
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

93
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,526 
<i>No picture now.</i>

94
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,908 
- What's the matter, Sonny?
- It's Michael.

95
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,418 
Don Barzini.

96
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:07,923 
<i>Welcome to our house.</i>

97
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,271 
Hey, Paulie!
Let me have some wine.

98
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,940 
Paulie! More wine.

99
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,316 
<i>Scusi, please.</i>

100
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,151 
You look terrif on the floor.

101
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,654 
What are you,
a dance judge or something?

102
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,157 
Go take a walk around
the neighborhood. Do your job.

103
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,709 
Hey, Sandra, come on. Do me a favor.
Watch the kids.

104
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,670 
- Don't let 'em run wild, all right?
- Well, you watch yourself, all right?

105
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,111 
Twenty or thirty grand.

106
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,614 
In small bills, cash.

107
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,450 
In that little silk purse.

108
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:19,411 
Maron, if this was someone else's wedding, sweet
tonato!

109
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,873 
<i>Hey, Paulie!</i>
I got two gobbagool...

110
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,833 
<i>gabagol and a prosciutto.</i>

111
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,336 
Stupid jerk!

112
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,055 
Hey, what's the matter?

113
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,027 
- I have to go back to work.
- Oh, Tom.

114
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,362 
It's part of the wedding.

115
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,281 
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

116
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,623 
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

117
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,125 
that you have invited me
to your home...

118
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,006 
Get outta here.

119
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,509 
This is a private party.
Go on.

120
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,971 
What is it?
Hey, my sister's wedding.

121
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,522 
Goddamn FBI
don't respect nothin'.

122
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,486 
Hey, come here, come here.
Come here!

123
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:38,365 
There.

124
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,378 
But towards the end
he was paroled...

125
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,006 
to help with
the American war effort.

126
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,633 
For the last six months, he's been
working at my pastry shop.

127
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,386 
Nazorine, my friend,
what can I do for you?

128
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,889 
Now that the war is over...

129
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:05,017 
this boy, Enzo, they want
to repatriate him back to Italy.

130
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,687 
Godfather, I have a daughter.

131
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,315 
See, she and Enzo...

132
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,318 
You want Enzo to stay
in this country...

133
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,820 
and you want your daughter
to be married.

134
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,365 
You understand everything.

135
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,577 
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

136
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,165 
And wait till you see
the beautiful wedding cake...

137
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,583 
I made for your daughter.

138
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,169 
Like this, with the bride
and the groom and...

139
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,512 
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

140
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,807 
Give it to a Jew congressman
in another district.

141
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,436 
Who else is on the list?

142
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,778 
Hey, Michael.
How are you?

143
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,280 
Hello.

144
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,716 
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

145
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,475 
Is this... Is this necessary?

146
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,435 
He didn't expect to be invited
to the wedding...

147
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,479 
so he wanted to thank you.

148
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,189 
All right.

149
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,401 
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

150
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,028 
that you have invited me
to your home...

151
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,614 
on the wedding day
of your daughter.

152
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,534 
And may their first child
be a masculine child.

153
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,162 
- Don...
- Michael?

154
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,830 
Don Corleone...

155
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,332 
That man over there
is talking to himself.

156
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,752 
See that scary guy over there?

157
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,588 
He's a very scary guy.

158
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,923 
Who is he?
What's his name?

159
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,509 
His name is Luca Brasi...

160
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,137 
and he helps my father out
sometimes.

161
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:08,432 
Oh, Michael, wait a minute.
He's coming over here.

162
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:09,433 
Mike!

163
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,934 
Ho! Tom.

164
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,436 
Heyyy!

165
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,480 
You look terrific!

166
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,691 
My brother Tom Hagen.
This is Kay Adams.

167
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,235 
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

168
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,696 
Your father's
been asking for you.

169
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,448 
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

170
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,950 
I'll be there.

171
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,995 
If he's your brother,
why does he have a different name?

172
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,123 
Oh, uh, when my brother Sonny was a kid...

173
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,626 
he found Tom Hagen in the street,
and he had no home.

174
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:39,004 
And so my father took him in...

175
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,090 
and he's been with us ever since.

176
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,302 
He's a good lawyer.

177
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,096 
Not a Sicilian, but...

178
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,432 
I think he's gonna be consigliere.

179
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,935 
- What's that?
- That's...

180
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,187 
like a counselor, an advisor.

181
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,689 
Very important to the family.

182
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,776 
You like your lasagna?

183
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:09,701 
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

184
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,996 
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding...

185
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,129 
on the day
of your daughter's wedding.

186
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,883 
And I hope
that their first child...

187
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,511 
be a masculine child.

188
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:33,350 
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

189
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,229 
For your daughter's
bridal purse.

190
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:40,232 
Thank you, Luca,
my most valued friend.

191
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:43,819 
Don Corleone,
I'm gonna leave you now...

192
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,988 
because I know you are busy.

193
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,490 
Thank you.

194
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,992 
Senator Cauly apologized
for not coming personally...

195
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,578 
but said you'd understand.

196
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,414 
Also some of the judges.

197
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,418 
They've all sent gifts.
Salute!

198
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,754 
What is that outside?

199
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,390 
Johnny!

200
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,854 
I love you.

201
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:32,529 
Hey, Johnny, look over here!

202
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,365 
He came all the way from California
to come to the wedding.

203
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,576 
- I told you he was going to come.
- It's been two years.

204
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:40,078 
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

205
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,835 
Sing a song.

206
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,894 
Michael, you never told me
you knew Johnny Fontane.

207
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:07,940 
- Sure. You wanna meet him?
- Huh? Oh, well, sure.

208
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,108 
My father helped him
with his career.

209
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,237 
- For my Connie.
- He did? How?

210
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,113 
<i>I have but one</i>

211
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,032 
- Let's listen to the song.
- No, Michael

212
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,659 
<i>Heart</i>

213
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,371 
<i>This heart I bring you</i>

214
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:28,293 
<i>I have but one heart</i>

215
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,921 
<i>To share with you</i>

216
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:37,636 
<i>I have but one dream</i>

217
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:41,348 
<i>That I can cling to</i>

218
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:47,521 
<i>You are the one dream</i>

219
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,899 
<i>I pray comes true</i>

220
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:54,027 
Please, Michael. Tell me.

221
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:57,698 
<i>My darling, until I saw you</i>

222
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,825 
Well, when Johnny was first starting out...

223
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:02,661 
he was signed to this
personal service contract...

224
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,289 
with a big bandleader.

225
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,791 
And as his career
got better and better...

226
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,294 
he wanted to get out of it.

227
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:13,672 
Now, Johnny is
my father's godson...

228
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:16,300 
and my father went
to see this bandleader...

229
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,720 
and he offered him
$10,000 to let Johnny go.

230
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,682 
But the bandleader said no.

231
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:27,144 
So the next day
my father went to see him...

232
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,771 
only this time with Luca Brasi.

233
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,484 
And within an hour,
he signed a release...

234
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,281 
for a certified check of $1,000.

235
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,159 
How'd he do that?

236
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,661 
My father made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

237
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,624 
What was that?

238
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,460 
Luca Brasi
held a gun to his head...

239
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,837 
and my father assured him
that either his brains...

240
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:56,340 
or his signature
would be on the contract.

241
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:04,389 
That's a true story.

242
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:17,277 
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.

243
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,626 
Beautiful!

244
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,928 
My godson comes all the way
from California.

245
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:45,430 
Give him a glass of wine.

246
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:06,660 
I'll take care of it.

247
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:11,123 
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

248
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,675 
How are you, Fredo?

249
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,803 
My brother Fredo.
This is Kay Adams.

250
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,432 
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

251
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:33,395 
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

252
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,981 
Yeah.
This is your friend, huh?

253
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:41,403 
I don't know what to do.
My voice is, is weak.

254
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,822 
It's weak.

255
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:46,450 
Anyway, if I had this part
in the picture, you know...

256
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:49,203 
it puts me right back
up on top again.

257
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,831 
But this, uh...

258
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,083 
this man out there,
he won't give it to me.

259
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,169 
- The head of the studio.
- What's his name?

260
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:59,755 
Woltz. Woltz.
He won't give it to me...

261
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:03,425 
and he says
there's no chance, no chance.

262
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,932 
Sonny?

263
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:11,642 
Sonny?

264
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,191 
Sonny?

265
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,902 
Sonny, you in there?

266
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:24,655 
- What?
- The old man wants to see you.

267
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,617 
All right, one minute.

268
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,342 
A month ago, he bought
the movie rights to this book.

269
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,302 
A best-seller.

270
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,596 
And the main character
is a guy just like me.

271
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:52,099 
Why, I wouldn't even
have to act.

272
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:53,600 
Just be myself.

273
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,479 
Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

274
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,817 
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

275
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,653 
Is this how you turned out?

276
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:07,281 
A Hollywood finocchio
that cries like a woman?

277
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,285 
"What can I do?"
"What can I do?"

278
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:12,870 
What is that nonsense?

279
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,372 
Ridiculous!

280
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:22,629 
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

281
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,298 
Good.

282
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,425 
Because the man who doesn't
spend time with his family...

283
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:28,760 
can never be a real man.

284
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,263 
Come here.

285
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:37,227 
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.

286
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,439 
I want you to rest well,
and a month from now...

287
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:43,567 
this Hollywood big shot's
gonna give you what you want.

288
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,195 
Too late.
They start shooting in a week.

289
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:49,448 
I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.

290
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,953 
Now just go outside,
enjoy yourself and...

291
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,581 
forget about all this nonsense.

292
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,668 
Listen. I want you
to leave it all to me.

293
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:05,130 
All right.

294
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,114 
What time does my daughter
leave with the bridegroom?

295
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,700 
In a few minutes,
right after they cut the cake.

296
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,912 
Now, your new son-in-law,
we give him something important.

297
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,373 
Never.
Give him a living...

298
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:42,417 
but never discuss
the family business with him.

299
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:43,919 
What else?

300
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,504 
Virgil Sollozzo called.

301
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:47,923 
We have to give him a day
sometime next week.

302
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,425 
We'll discuss him when you
come back from California.

303
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,803 
When am I going to California?

304
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,888 
I want you to go tonight.

305
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,683 
I want you to talk
to this movie big shot...

306
00:25:57,808 --> 00:26:00,310 
and settle this business
for Johnny.

307
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:04,231 
Now if there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

308
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:10,112 
Carlo, we're gonna take
the picture.

309
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,574 
Wait a minute.

310
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:16,076 
No, Michael, not me.

311
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:20,330 
Just a little closer.

312
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,833 
Okay, that's it.
Just like that now. Hold it.

313
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:10,148 
Isn't that nice?

314
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,864 
All right, start talking.

315
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:19,366 
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

316
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,828 
This friend is my client and would
give his undying friendship...

317
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:26,665 
to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz
would grant us a small favor.

318
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,293 
Woltz is listening.

319
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:32,379 
Give Johnny the part in that new
war film you're starting next week.

320
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:42,055 
And what favor
would your friend...

321
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,057 
grant Mr. Woltz?

322
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,976 
You're gonna have
some union problems.

323
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:47,811 
My client could make them disappear.

324
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,938 
Also, one of your top stars
has just moved...

325
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,940 
from marijuana to heroin.

326
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,942 
- Are you trying to muscle me?
- Absolutely not.

327
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,361 
Now listen to me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch!

328
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,989 
Let me lay it on the line for you
and your boss, whoever he is!

329
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:00,741 
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie.

330
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,243 
I don't care
how many dago, guinea, wop...

331
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,621 
greaseball goombahs
come outta the woodwork.

332
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:06,872 
I'm German-Irish.

333
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:09,500 
Well, let me tell you something,
my kraut mick friend.

334
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:12,503 
I'm going to make so much trouble for you,
you won't know what hit you.

335
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:14,588 
Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer.
I have not threatened...

336
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:17,508 
I know almost every big lawyer
in New York. Who the hell are you?

337
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:20,844 
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

338
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:23,430 
Now, you have my number.
I'll wait for your call.

339
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,351 
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

340
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,775 
Check him out.

341
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:59,091 
- This is really beautiful.
- Look at this.

342
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:01,426 
It used to decorate
the palace of a king.

343
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,720 
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

344
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,348 
Why didn't you say
you worked for Corleone, Tom?

345
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,725 
I thought you were just
some cheap, two-bit hustler...

346
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,769 
Johnny was running in,
trying to bluff me.

347
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,272 
I don't like to use his name
unless it's really necessary.

348
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:14,898 
- How's your drink, Tom?
- Fine.

349
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,609 
Hey, come on over here with me. I want to
show you something really beautiful.

350
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:20,237 
You do appreciate beauty,
don't you, Tom?

351
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:26,285 
There you are.
$600,000 on four hooves.

352
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,744 
I'll bet Russian czars...

353
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:30,080 
never paid that kind of dough
for a single horse.

354
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,583 
Khartoum.

355
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,423 
I'm not gonna race him, though.
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

356
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,091 
Beautiful.

357
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:42,759 
- Thanks, Tony.
- You're welcome.

358
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,262 
- Come on.
- Let's get something to eat.

359
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:49,224 
Mr. Corleone
is Johnny's godfather.

360
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,561 
To the Italian people,
that's a very religious...

361
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:54,563 
sacred, close relationship.

362
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:55,689 
I respect that.

363
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:58,192 
Just tell him he should ask me
anything else.

364
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:00,819 
But this is one favor
I can't give him.

365
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:03,614 
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

366
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:06,658 
- Understood?
- You don't understand.

367
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:09,286 
Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

368
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:14,374 
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

369
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,502 
I'm gonna run him
out of the business.

370
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:19,004 
And let me tell you why.

371
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:23,342 
Johnny Fontane ruined
one of Woltz International's...

372
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,469 
most valuable protégés.

373
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,804 
For five years,
we had her under training.

374
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,849 
Singing lessons,
acting lessons, dancing lessons.

375
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,352 
I spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars on her.

376
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:35,687 
I was gonna make her a big star.

377
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,398 
And let me be even more frank.

378
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:40,901 
Just to show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man...

379
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,445 
that it's not all dollars and cents.

380
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,364 
She was beautiful!

381
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:47,574 
She was young, she was innocent!

382
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,576 
She was the greatest piece of ass
I've ever had...

383
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:52,079 
and I've had 'em all over the world!

384
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:54,957 
And then Johnny Fontane comes along...

385
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:57,876 
with his olive oil voice and guinea charm.

386
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,672 
And she runs off.

387
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:05,008 
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous...

388
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:08,679 
and a man in my position can't afford...

389
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,431 
to be made to look ridiculous!

390
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:13,934 
Now you get the hell outta here!

391
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,061 
And if that goombah
tries any rough stuff...

392
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:18,564 
you tell him I ain't no bandleader.

393
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:22,484 
Yeah. I heard that story.

394
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:26,071 
Thank you for the dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

395
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:30,117 
If your car could take me
to the airport...

396
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:34,037 
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists
on hearing bad news immediately.

397
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:30,654 
- You're not too tired are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

398
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:33,282 
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

399
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,410 
Now...

400
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:39,705 
Sollozzo is known as "The Turk."

401
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:42,749 
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife...

402
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:44,543 
<i>but only</i>
in matters of business...

403
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:47,045 
<i>with some sort</i>
of reasonable complaint.

404
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,382 
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

405
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:53,844 
<i>He has fields in Turkey</i>
where they grow the poppy...

406
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:56,847 
<i>and in Sicily he has the plants</i>
to process them into heroin.

407
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:01,518 
<i>Now, he needs cash and he needs</i>
protection from the police...

408
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:03,729 
<i>for which he gives</i>
a piece of the action.

409
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:05,731 
<i>I couldn't find out how much.</i>

410
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:08,525 
<i>The Tattaglia family</i>
is behind him here in New York.

411
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,777 
<i>Now, they have to be</i>
in it for something.

412
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:11,904 
Santino Corleone.

413
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:13,780 
What about his prison record?

414
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,283 
Two terms,
one in Italy, one here.

415
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:19,369 
He's known as
a top narcotics man.

416
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:21,872 
Santino, what do you think?

417
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,459 
There's a lot of money
in that white powder.

418
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,086 
Tom?

419
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:30,589 
<i>Well, I say, yes, there's more</i>
money potential in narcotics...

420
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:32,674 
<i>than anything else</i>
we're looking at.

421
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:35,093 
<i>Now, if we don't get into it,</i>
somebody else will.

422
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:37,262 
<i>Maybe one of the five families,</i>
maybe all of them.

423
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:38,430 
<i>Now, with the money they earn...</i>

424
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,767 
they can buy more police
and political power.

425
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:44,102 
Then they come after us.

426
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,855 
Now we have the unions,
we have the gambling...

427
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:49,274 
and they're the best things
to have, but narcotics...

428
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:50,776 
is a thing of the future.

429
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:52,611 
Now, if we don't get
a piece of that action...

430
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:54,112 
we risk everything we have.

431
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:56,615 
I mean, not now,
but ten years from now.

432
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:03,247 
So? What's your answer
gonna be, Pop?

433
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,963 
Bene. Don Corleone.

434
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,466 
I need a man
who has powerful friends.

435
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:18,095 
I need a million dollars in cash.

436
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:20,305 
I need, Don Corleone,
those politicians...

437
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:23,934 
that you carry in your pocket
like so many nickels and dimes.

438
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,646 
What is the interest
for my family?

439
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,606 
Thirty percent.

440
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:32,401 
In the first year, your end
should be three, four million dollars.

441
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:36,196 
And then it would go up.

442
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:39,324 
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

443
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:44,830 
My compliments.

444
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:50,252 
I'll take care of the Tattaglias.
Outta my share.

445
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:53,964 
So, I receive 30%
for finance...

446
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:57,551 
political influence
and legal protection.

447
00:36:57,551 --> 00:37:00,053 
- That's what you're telling me.
- That's right.

448
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:05,851 
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

449
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:08,896 
If you consider
a million dollars in cash...

450
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:11,190 
just "finance"...

451
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,192 
<i>I salute you, Don Corleone.</i>

452
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:26,997 
I said that I would see you because...

453
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,291 
I heard that you were
a serious man...

454
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,793 
to be treated with respect.

455
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:39,635 
But I must say no to you.

456
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:43,263 
And I'll give you my reason.

457
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:46,058 
It's true, I have
a lot of friends in politics.

458
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:49,728 
But they wouldn't be friendly
very long...

459
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:52,105 
if they knew my business was drugs
instead of gambling...

460
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:55,317 
which they regard
as a harmless vice.

461
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,028 
- But drugs is a dirty business.
- No, Don Corleone...

462
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:00,155 
It doesn't make
any difference to me...

463
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:02,908 
what a man does for a living,
you understand...

464
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:05,536 
but your business is...

465
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,330 
a little dangerous.

466
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,833 
If you're worried about security
for your million...

467
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,543 
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

468
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:15,254 
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias
guarantee our investment...

469
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:17,881 
Wait a minute.

470
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:25,931 
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children...

471
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:28,267 
and I spoil them,
as you can see.

472
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:29,977 
They talk when they should listen.

473
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:32,104 
But anyway...

474
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:34,606 
Signor Sollozzo,
my no is final...

475
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,484 
and I wish to congratulate you
on your new business.

476
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,863 
I know you'll do very well,
and good luck to you...

477
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:43,949 
especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine.

478
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,870 
Thank you.

479
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:10,809 
Come here.

480
00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:14,438 
What's the matter with you?

481
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:16,231 
I think your brain
is going soft...

482
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:19,109 
from all that comedy you're
playing with that young girl.

483
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:22,613 
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

484
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:27,284 
Go on.

485
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:32,748 
Tom, what?
What is this nonsense?

486
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:35,334 
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

487
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,880 
Well, take it away.

488
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,382 
Take it over there.

489
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:45,135 
And...

490
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,638 
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

491
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:56,647 
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

492
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,108 
I want you to find out what he's got
under his fingernails, you know?

493
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:03,028 
Go to the Tattaglias...

494
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:05,364 
and make them think...

495
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:09,034 
that you're not too happy
with our family...

496
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,663 
and find out what you can.

497
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:33,433 
And I got something
for your mother and for Sonny...

498
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,602 
and a tie for Freddy...

499
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:38,313 
and Tom Hagen
got the Reynolds pen.

500
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:40,524 
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Me?

501
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:43,026 
Oh, just you.

502
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:15,350 
Andiamo, Fredo.

503
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,352 
Tell Paulie to get the car.
We're going.

504
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:18,770 
Okay, Pa.

505
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,690 
I'll have to get it myself, Pa.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

506
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:27,196 
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind gettin' the car.

507
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,202 
Buon nateli, Dano. Grazie

508
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:19,706 
Luca, I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

509
00:42:19,832 --> 00:42:21,291 
I know.

510
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:23,794 
Su bequero Scotch? Pre-war...

511
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:25,796 
Io no bib' "I don't drink".

512
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:31,468 
You know who I am?

513
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:32,469 
I know you.

514
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:43,438 
You have been talking to the Tattaglia
family... right? I think you and I can do
business.

515
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:56,451 
I need someone strong like you.
I heard you are not happy with the
Corleone family. Want to join me?.

516
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:58,954 
What's in it for me?.

517
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:03,167 
$50,000...to start with..

518
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:08,172 
Not bad.

519
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:11,175 
Agreed?

520
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:30,152 
Grazie.

521
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,611 
Oh. Tom Hagen.

522
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:14,404 
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

523
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:17,324 
I'm glad I run into you.
I wanna talk to you.

524
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:19,326 
I haven't got time.

525
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:22,079 
Oh, make time, consigliere.
Get in the car.

526
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:25,791 
What are you worried about?

527
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,293 
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

528
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:31,630 
Get in.

529
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:43,308 
<i>Wait a moment, Fredo.</i>

530
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:46,311 
- I'm gonna buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pa.

531
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:53,318 
Hi. Merry Christmas.

532
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:55,821 
I want some fruit over there.

533
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:01,076 
Gimme three of them.

534
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:04,663 
No, that one.

535
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:25,309 
Fredo!

536
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:14,441 
Papa.

537
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:16,985 
Papa!

538
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:24,576 
Mike, would you like me better
if I were a nun...

539
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:27,204 
like in the story, you know?

540
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:30,415 
No.

541
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:33,418 
Well, then would you like me better
if I were Ingrid Bergman?

542
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:36,046 
Now that's a thought.

543
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:38,423 
Michael.

544
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:42,344 
No, I would not like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

545
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:44,930 
- Michael.
- What's the matter?

546
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:03,240 
They don't say
if he's dead or alive.

547
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:27,347 
Sonny, Michael.

548
00:47:27,347 --> 00:47:28,765 
<i>Michael, where you been?</i>

549
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:30,517 
Is he all right?

550
00:47:30,517 --> 00:47:33,270 
<i>We don't know yet.</i>
There's all kinds of stories.

551
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:37,316 
<i>He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

552
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:40,861 
<i>- Are you there?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here.

553
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:43,405 
<i>Where you been? I was worried.</i>

554
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:45,574 
Didn't Tom tell you?
I called.

555
00:47:45,574 --> 00:47:49,286 
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.</i>
You should be with Mama, you hear?

556
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:51,914 
All right.

557
00:47:57,628 --> 00:48:00,130 
Oh, my God.

558
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:16,605 
Who is it?

559
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:19,191 
Open up. It's Clemenza.

560
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:21,276 
What?

561
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:23,779 
There's more news about your old man.

562
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:26,323 
The word is out on the street
he's already dead.

563
00:48:26,323 --> 00:48:28,325 
Shut your mouth.
What's the matter with you?

564
00:48:28,325 --> 00:48:30,828 
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

565
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:33,038 
- Where was Paulie?
- Paulie was out sick.

566
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,582 
- He's been home sick all winter.
- How many times he been sick?

567
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:37,209 
Only maybe three, four times.

568
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:39,253 
I mean, I asked Freddy if he wants
a different bodyguard.

569
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:41,004 
- He said no.
- Pick him up right now.

570
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:42,840 
I don't care how sick he is. If he's breathin',...

571
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,509 
I want you to bring him to
my father's house now. You understand? Now

572
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:48,387 
Yeah. You want me to send any people over
here? - No, just you and him. Go ahead.

573
00:48:48,512 --> 00:48:51,014 
All right.

574
00:48:56,019 --> 00:49:01,233 
Look, uh... I'm havin' a couple of our people come
over to the house. A couple of our people.

575
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,072 
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Santino Corleone?

576
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:09,575 
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- We have Tom Hagen.

577
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:13,704 
<i>In about three hours, he'll be</i>
released with our proposition.

578
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:17,166 
<i>Listen to everything he has</i>
to say before you do anything.

579
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:18,917 
<i>What's done is done.</i>

580
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:21,879 
<i>And don't lose that famous temper</i>
of yours, huh, Sonny?

581
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:24,464 
No, I'll wait.

582
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:40,481 
Your boss is dead.

583
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:45,277 
I know you're not in the muscle
end of the family, Tom...

584
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:47,779 
so I don't want you to be scared.

585
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:50,908 
I want you
to help the Corleones...

586
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:53,494 
and I want you to help me.

587
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,915 
Yeah. We got him outside his office...

588
00:49:57,915 --> 00:50:00,417 
just about an hour after we picked you up.

589
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:04,755 
Drink it.

590
00:50:07,883 --> 00:50:11,303 
So now it's up to you to make
the peace between me and Sonny.

591
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:18,352 
Sonny was hot
for my deal, wasn't he?

592
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:22,272 
And you knew it was
the right thing to do.

593
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:26,610 
Sonny will come after you
with everything he's got.

594
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:29,863 
That'll be his first reaction, sure.

595
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:33,033 
That's why you gotta
talk some sense into him.

596
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:36,286 
The Tattaglia family is behind me
with all their people.

597
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:39,414 
The other New York families
will go along with anything...

598
00:50:39,414 --> 00:50:41,917 
that will prevent a full-scale war.

599
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:44,837 
Let's face it, Tom,
in all due respect...

600
00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:47,422 
the Don, rest in peace, was slippin'.

601
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:52,845 
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

602
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:58,851 
Well, now he's dead.

603
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:01,353 
He's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

604
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:05,149 
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

605
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:07,067 
You gotta talk
to the caporegimes...

606
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,570 
that Tessio, and that fat Clemenza.

607
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:16,493 
It's good business, Tom.

608
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:19,705 
I'll try.

609
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:22,374 
But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

610
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:27,880 
Yeah. Well...

611
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:31,216 
Let me worry about Luca.

612
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:38,515 
You just talk to Sonny.

613
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:41,018 
And the other two kids.

614
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:45,731 
I'll do my best.

615
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:48,233 
Good.

616
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:51,570 
Now, you can go.

617
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,747 
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

618
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,792 
Blood is a big expense.

619
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:28,774 
He's still alive.

620
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:31,276 
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

621
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:34,780 
Well, that's bad luck for me...

622
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,282 
and bad luck for you
if you don't make that deal.

623
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:24,329 
Your mother's over
in the hospital with your father.

624
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,832 
Looks like he's gonna
pull through, thank God.

625
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:31,170 
- That's a lot of bad blood.
- What do you think?

626
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:34,047 
It's too far.
I think it's too personal.

627
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:36,800 
- The Don will consider this over.
- You gonna kill all those guys?

628
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:39,428 
- Hey, stay out of it, Mickey, do me a favor.
- Sollozzo's the key.

629
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:41,722 
You get rid of him,
everything falls into line.

630
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:44,308 
What about Luca? Sollozzo
didn't seem worried about Luca.

631
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:49,813 
I don't know. If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

632
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:51,982 
Has anyone been able
to get in touch with Luca?

633
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:54,067 
We've been tryin' all night.
He might be shacked up.

634
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:55,152 
Hey, Mick, try him again.

635
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:56,820 
Luca never sleeps over
with a broad.

636
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,323 
He always goes home
when he's through.

637
00:53:59,865 --> 00:54:02,826 
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.

638
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:06,038 
What do we do
if the old man dies, God forbid?

639
00:54:06,163 --> 00:54:08,665 
If we lose the old man...

640
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:12,377 
we lose our political contacts
and half our strength.

641
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:15,380 
The other New York families might
wind up supporting Sollozzo...

642
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:17,841 
just to avoid a long destructive war.

643
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:21,553 
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

644
00:54:22,804 --> 00:54:25,307 
If your father dies...

645
00:54:26,642 --> 00:54:28,393 
you'll make the deal, Sonny.

646
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:30,979 
You know, that's easy for you to say,
Tom. He's not your father.

647
00:54:31,063 --> 00:54:33,565 
I was as much a son to him
as you or Mike.

648
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:40,531 
What is it?

649
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:42,991 
Hey, Paulie, I thought
I told you to stay put.

650
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:45,619 
Well, the guy at the gates,
they say they got a package.

651
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:48,247 
Yeah?
Tessio, go see what it is.

652
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,585 
- You want me to hang around?
- Yeah, hang around.

653
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:55,087 
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

654
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:57,798 
Yeah? There's some food
in the icebox. You hungry or anything?

655
00:54:57,923 --> 00:54:59,967 
- No, it's all right. Thanks.
- How 'bout a drink? How 'bout a little brandy?

656
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:01,760 
- That's good to sweat it out.
- All right, sure.

657
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,263 
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea. Yeah, right.

658
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:08,433 
I want you to take care
of that son of a bitch right away.

659
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:11,019 
Paulie sold out the old man, that strutz.

660
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,231 
I don't wanna see him again. Make that
first thing on your list, understand?

661
00:55:14,314 --> 00:55:15,649 
Understood.

662
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:17,985 
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow.
You get a couple of guys.

663
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:20,195 
You go over to Luca's apartment. Hang
around. Wait for him to show up.

664
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:24,241 
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

665
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:26,618 
Yeah.

666
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:30,164 
Listen, hang around the house
on the phone. It'll be a big help.

667
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:33,792 
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

668
00:55:42,134 --> 00:55:44,928 
- What the hell is this?
- It's a Sicilian message.

669
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,556 
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

670
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,822 
- I'm goin' now.
- What time you gonna be home tonight?

671
00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:06,366 
I don't know. Probably late.

672
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:11,163 
- Don't forget the cannoli.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

673
00:56:13,874 --> 00:56:17,669 
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rearview mirror.

674
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:21,423 
That Sonny's runnin' wild.

675
00:56:21,423 --> 00:56:23,509 
He's thinkin' of goin'
to the mattresses already.

676
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:26,053 
We gotta find a spot
over on the West Side.

677
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:29,264 
We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.

678
00:56:29,348 --> 00:56:31,725 
You know any good spots
on the West Side?

679
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:34,228 
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Well, think about it while you're drivin'.

680
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:36,605 
I wanna hit New York sometime this month.

681
00:56:36,605 --> 00:56:39,107 
And watch out for the kids
when you're backin' out.

682
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:51,912 
Hey, Paulie, I want you to go
down 39th Street. Colosanto's.

683
00:56:51,912 --> 00:56:54,998 
You pick up 18 mattresses for the guys
to sleep, will you? Bring me the bill.

684
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:58,001 
- Yeah, all right.I must go look at the bills.
No, make sure they're clean because...

685
00:56:58,085 --> 00:57:01,296 
Those guys are gonna be stuck up
in there for a long time, you know?

686
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,590 
They're clean. They told me
they exterminate them.

687
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,717 
"Exterminate"?
That's a bad word to use.

688
00:57:05,717 --> 00:57:08,679 
Exterminate. Get this guy.
See how we don't exterminate you.

689
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:11,974 
<i>- Youse funny, or what?</i>
- Hey, Paulie. Did you fart?

690
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:14,977 
- Yeah, Rocco, what'd you do?
- No, me. Nothin'. It wasn't me.

691
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,104 
- It's gotta be him.
- Hey, pull over, will you.

692
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:19,606 
I gotta take a leak.

693
00:58:00,814 --> 00:58:02,608 
Leave the gun.

694
00:58:02,608 --> 00:58:05,110 
Take the cannoli.

695
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:23,420 
<i>Hey, Mike?</i>

696
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:25,422 
<i>Hey, Mikey?</i>

697
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:27,925 
Yeah?

698
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:29,426 
<i>You're wanted on the telephone.</i>

699
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,643 
- Who is it?
- It's some girl.

700
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:42,898 
Hello, Kay?

701
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:44,274 
<i>How's your father?</i>

702
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:46,068 
He's good.
He's gonna make it.

703
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:48,570 
<i>I love you.</i>

704
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:49,571 
Huh?

705
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:51,865 
<i>I love you!</i>

706
00:58:52,115 --> 00:58:53,617 
<i>Michael?</i>

707
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:54,993 
Yeah, I know.

708
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:56,829 
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

709
00:58:56,829 --> 00:58:58,497 
Yeah, I can't talk.

710
00:58:58,497 --> 00:59:00,290 
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

711
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:03,627 
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

712
00:59:03,836 --> 00:59:06,797 
Hey, Mikey. Why don't you tell
that nice girl you love her?

713
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:09,007 
I love you with all-a my heart!

714
00:59:09,007 --> 00:59:11,510 
If I don't see you again a-soon,
I'm-a gonna die!

715
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:14,763 
Come over here, kid.
Learn somethin'.

716
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:17,266 
You never know. You might have to cook
for 20 guys someday.

717
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:20,102 
You see? You start out
with a little bit of oil.

718
00:59:20,102 --> 00:59:21,687 
Then you fry some garlic.

719
00:59:21,687 --> 00:59:24,314 
Then you throw in some tomatoes,
some tomato paste.

720
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:27,067 
You fry it.
You make sure it doesn't stick.

721
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:30,320 
When you got it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and your meatballs.

722
00:59:33,198 --> 00:59:35,701 
Add a little bit of wine.

723
00:59:38,537 --> 00:59:41,456 
And a little bit of sugar.

724
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,209 
- And that's my trick.
- Why don't you cut the crap?

725
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:46,378 
I got more important things
for you to do.

726
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:49,006 
- How's Paulie?
- Oh, Paulie. Won't see him no more.

727
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:53,552 
- Where you going?
- To the city.

728
00:59:53,552 --> 00:59:55,220 
Send some bodyguards with him.

729
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,222 
- No. I'm just going to the hospital to see Pop.
- Nevermind. Send somebody with him.

730
00:59:57,222 --> 01:00:00,142 
Oh, he'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

731
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:02,728 
- All right. Be careful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

732
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:08,233 
Send somebody with him anyway.

733
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:38,263 
I have to go.

734
01:00:38,263 --> 01:00:40,766 
Can I go with you?

735
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:43,685 
No, Kay. There's gonna be
detectives there.

736
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:45,771 
People from the press.

737
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:48,273 
Well, I'll ride in a cab.

738
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,778 
I don't want you to get involved.

739
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:57,950 
When will I see you again?

740
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:06,124 
Go back to New Hampshire...

741
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:08,627 
and I'll call you
at your parents' house.

742
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:12,464 
When will I see you again,
Michael?

743
01:01:13,966 --> 01:01:16,468 
I don't know.

744
01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:28,642 
What are you doing here?

745
01:03:28,642 --> 01:03:30,769 
You're not supposed
to be here now.

746
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:34,314 
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.

747
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:36,984 
There's nobody here.
What happened to the guards?

748
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:39,444 
Your father just had
too many visitors.

749
01:03:39,444 --> 01:03:42,322 
They interfered
with hospital service.

750
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:45,325 
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

751
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:54,168 
Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0, please.

752
01:03:56,795 --> 01:03:59,298 
Nurse, wait a minute.
Stay here.

753
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:05,470 
Sonny, Michael.
I'm at the hospital.

754
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:08,015 
Listen. I got here late.
There's nobody here.

755
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,101 
Nobody. No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody.

756
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:14,021 
<i>- Pop is all alone.</i>
- Don't panic. We'll send somebody.

757
01:04:14,146 --> 01:04:16,482 
I won't panic.

758
01:04:16,482 --> 01:04:19,026 
I'm sorry, but you will
have to leave.

759
01:04:21,987 --> 01:04:24,698 
You and I are gonna move my father
to another room.

760
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:27,868 
Now, can you disconnect those tubes
so we can move the bed out?

761
01:04:27,993 --> 01:04:31,455 
- That's out of the question.
- Do you know my father?

762
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:33,790 
Men are coming here to kill him.

763
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:35,918 
You understand?

764
01:04:35,918 --> 01:04:38,420 
Now, help me, please.

765
01:05:54,746 --> 01:05:59,501 
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo... the baker.

766
01:05:59,585 --> 01:06:01,086 
- You remember me?
- Enzo?

767
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:02,921 
- Yes, Enzo.
- You better get out of here, Enzo.

768
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:04,923 
There's gonna be trouble.

769
01:06:04,923 --> 01:06:07,426 
If there is trouble,
I stay here to help you...

770
01:06:07,426 --> 01:06:09,928 
For your father. For your father.

771
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:12,764 
All right, listen.

772
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:14,933 
Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital.

773
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:17,978 
All right? I'll be out
in a minute. Go ahead.

774
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:19,354 
Okay, okay.

775
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:36,205 
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

776
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:39,917 
I'm with you now.

777
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:43,587 
I'm with you.

778
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:20,624 
Get rid of these.
Come here.

779
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:23,460 
Put your hand in your pocket
like you have a gun.

780
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:26,630 
You'll be all right.

781
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:33,387 
You'll be okay.

782
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:19,600 
You did good.

783
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:54,927 
Here he is.

784
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:57,387 
All right, hold still.

785
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:09,274 
I thought I got
all you guinea hoods locked up.

786
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:10,776 
What the hell are you doing here?

787
01:09:10,776 --> 01:09:13,237 
What happened to the men who
were guarding my father, Captain?

788
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:15,280 
Why, you little punk.

789
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,282 
What the hell are you doing,
telling me my business?

790
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:19,159 
I pulled them guys off of here.

791
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:22,162 
Now, you get out of here
and stay away from this hospital.

792
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:25,249 
I'm not moving until you put
some guards around my father's room.

793
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:27,960 
Phil, take him in.

794
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,379 
The kid's clean, Captain.
He's a war hero.

795
01:09:30,379 --> 01:09:33,298 
- He's never been busted...
- Goddamn it, I said take him in.

796
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,886 
What's the Turk paying you
to set up my father, Captain?

797
01:09:39,221 --> 01:09:41,348 
Take a hold of him.
Stand him up.

798
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:43,851 
Stand him up straight.

799
01:10:05,747 --> 01:10:07,833 
I'm the attorney
for the Corleone family.

800
01:10:07,833 --> 01:10:10,544 
These men are private detectives
hired to protect Vito Corleone.

801
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,172 
They're licensed to carry firearms.

802
01:10:13,172 --> 01:10:15,674 
If you interfere, you'll have to
appear before a judge...

803
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:18,302 
in the morning and show cause.

804
01:10:18,427 --> 01:10:20,929 
All right, let him go.

805
01:10:21,013 --> 01:10:23,474 
Come on.

806
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:54,963 
What's with all the new faces?

807
01:10:54,963 --> 01:10:56,798 
Gonna need 'em now.

808
01:10:56,798 --> 01:10:59,426 
After the hospital thing,
Sonny got mad.

809
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:02,679 
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
at 4:00 this morning.

810
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:06,475 
Jesus Christ.

811
01:11:12,815 --> 01:11:15,317 
Looks like a fortress around here.

812
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:18,904 
Tom-anuch!

813
01:11:19,822 --> 01:11:22,699 
A hundred button men on the street,
24 hours a day.

814
01:11:22,825 --> 01:11:26,036 
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

815
01:11:28,664 --> 01:11:31,166 
Hey, Mike, come here.
Let me look at you.

816
01:11:34,586 --> 01:11:36,296 
You look beautiful.
Just beautiful.

817
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:37,798 
You're gorgeous.

818
01:11:37,798 --> 01:11:40,509 
Hey, listen to this.
The Turk, he wants to talk.

819
01:11:40,592 --> 01:11:43,345 
Eh gosh...Imagine the nerve
on this son of a bitch.

820
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:45,764 
Craps out last night,
he wants a meeting today.

821
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:48,267 
- What'd he say?
- What did he say?

822
01:11:48,934 --> 01:11:51,103 
He wants us to send Michael
to hear the proposition.

823
01:11:51,103 --> 01:11:54,189 
And the promise is that the deal
is so good that we can't refuse.

824
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:56,441 
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

825
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:58,110 
That's part of the deal.

826
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,112 
Bruno cancels out what they did
to my father.

827
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:02,614 
Sonny, we ought to hear
what they have to say.

828
01:12:02,948 --> 01:12:05,450 
No. No. No. No more.
Not this time, Consigliere.

829
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:09,037 
No more meetings, no more discussions,
no more Sollozzo tricks.

830
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:10,956 
You give them one message...
I want Sollozzo.

831
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:12,624 
If not, it's all-out war.
We go to the mattresses.

832
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:14,293 
Some of the other families
won't sit still for a war.

833
01:12:14,293 --> 01:12:16,461 
- Then they hand me Sollozzo.
- Your father wouldn't hear this.

834
01:12:16,461 --> 01:12:19,548 
- This is business, not personal.
- They shot my father...Your ass...

835
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:23,051 
Even shooting your father
was business, not personal, Sonny.

836
01:12:23,135 --> 01:12:24,970 
Well, then business will have to suffer.
All right?

837
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:26,805 
And listen... do me a favor, Tom...

838
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:28,807 
No more advice on how
to patch things up.

839
01:12:28,807 --> 01:12:31,310 
Just help me win, please.
All right?

840
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:39,818 
I found out about this Captain McCluskey
who broke Mike's jaw.

841
01:12:39,943 --> 01:12:41,445 
What about him?

842
01:12:41,445 --> 01:12:44,490 
Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

843
01:12:44,615 --> 01:12:47,493 
McCluskey has agreed
to be the Turk's bodyguard.

844
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:49,620 
What you have to understand,
Sonny...

845
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,788 
is that while Sollozzo's
being guarded like this...

846
01:12:51,788 --> 01:12:53,624 
he is invulnerable.

847
01:12:53,624 --> 01:12:57,169 
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain. Never.

848
01:12:57,294 --> 01:13:00,339 
It would be disastrous. All the
five families would come after you, Sonny.

849
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:03,175 
The Corleone family
would be outcast.

850
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,970 
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

851
01:13:08,472 --> 01:13:10,641 
So do me a favor.

852
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:13,268 
Take this into consideration.

853
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:18,565 
All right, we'll wait.

854
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,823 
We can't wait.

855
01:13:25,823 --> 01:13:27,825 
Can't wait.

856
01:13:27,825 --> 01:13:29,576 
I don't care what Sollozzo says
about a deal.

857
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:31,745 
He's gonna kill Pop.
That's it.

858
01:13:31,745 --> 01:13:33,580 
That's the key for him.

859
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,582 
Got to get Sollozzo.

860
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:37,751 
CLEMENZA: Mike is right.

861
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:39,753 
Let me ask you something first.

862
01:13:39,753 --> 01:13:42,840 
What about this McCluskey?

863
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:45,425 
What do we do with this cop here?

864
01:13:49,763 --> 01:13:52,266 
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

865
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:56,353 
It will be me...

866
01:13:56,436 --> 01:13:58,939 
McCluskey and Sollozzo.

867
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,442 
Let's set the meeting.

868
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:07,531 
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

869
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:13,370 
Now we insist it's a public place...
a bar, a restaurant.

870
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:17,207 
Someplace where there's people,
so I feel safe.

871
01:14:20,127 --> 01:14:23,046 
They're gonna search me
when I first meet them, right?

872
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,632 
So I can't have a weapon on me then.

873
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:31,305 
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

874
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:33,891 
to have a weapon
planted there for me...

875
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,231 
then I'll kill them both.

876
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:55,662 
What are you gonna do?
Nice college boy, huh?

877
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:57,789 
Didn't want to get mixed up
in the family business.

878
01:14:57,789 --> 01:14:59,791 
Now you want to gun down
a police captain?

879
01:14:59,791 --> 01:15:01,793 
Why? 'Cause he slapped you
in the face a little bit?

880
01:15:01,793 --> 01:15:04,129 
What do you think this is, the army,
where you shoot them a mile away?

881
01:15:04,129 --> 01:15:05,797 
You've gotta
get up close like this and bada-bing!

882
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:09,176 
You blow their brains all over your
nice Ivy League suit. Come here.

883
01:15:09,301 --> 01:15:11,637 
You're taking this very personal.

884
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:14,848 
Tom, this is business, and this man
is taking it very, very personal.

885
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:16,975 
Where does it say that
you can't kill a cop?

886
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:19,520 
- Come on, Mikey.
- Tom, wait a minute.

887
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:22,356 
I'm talking about a cop
that's mixed up in drugs.

888
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:26,610 
I'm talking about a dishonest cop,
a crooked cop...

889
01:15:26,693 --> 01:15:29,571 
who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming to him.

890
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:31,740 
That's a terrific story.

891
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:34,451 
Now we have newspaper people
on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

892
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:38,247 
They might like a story like that.

893
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:40,749 
They might.
They just might.

894
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:45,754 
It's not personal, Sonny.

895
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:48,257 
It's strictly business.

896
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:51,927 
It's as cold as they come.

897
01:15:51,927 --> 01:15:55,472 
Impossible to trace, so you don't
worry about prints, Mike.

898
01:15:55,597 --> 01:15:58,475 
I put a special tape
on the trigger and the butt.

899
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,103 
Here. Try it.

900
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:14,283 
What's the matter,
the trigger too tight?

901
01:16:17,452 --> 01:16:19,621 
- My ears.
- I left it noisy.

902
01:16:19,621 --> 01:16:24,334 
Yeah, I left it noisy  that way it scares
any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders
away.

903
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:26,962 
All right, you shot them both.
Now what do you do?

904
01:16:29,548 --> 01:16:31,717 
Sit down, finish my dinner.

905
01:16:31,717 --> 01:16:33,385 
Come on, kid.
Don't fool around.

906
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:36,972 
Just let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

907
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:39,224 
Everybody will still think
you got it.

908
01:16:39,224 --> 01:16:41,393 
They're gonna be staring
at your face, Mike...

909
01:16:41,393 --> 01:16:44,480 
so walk out of the place real fast,
but you don't run.

910
01:16:44,563 --> 01:16:47,983 
Don't look nobody directly in the
eye, but you don't look away, either.

911
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:50,068 
Hey, they're gonna be scared stiff
of you, believe me...

912
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:52,571 
so don't worry about nothing.

913
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:55,574 
You know, you're gonna turn out all right.

914
01:16:55,574 --> 01:16:57,910 
You take a long vacation,
nobody knows where...

915
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,412 
and we're gonna catch the hell.

916
01:17:00,412 --> 01:17:02,581 
How bad do you think
it's gonna be?

917
01:17:02,581 --> 01:17:04,583 
Pretty goddamn bad.

918
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:07,669 
Probably all the other families
will line up against us.

919
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:10,672 
That's all right. These things
gotta happen every five years or so.

920
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:13,342 
Ten years.
Helps to get rid of the bad blood.

921
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:16,011 
Been ten years since
the last one.

922
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:18,096 
You know, you gotta stop them
at the beginning...

923
01:17:18,096 --> 01:17:20,265 
like they should have
stopped Hitler at Munich.

924
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:22,267 
They should have never let him
get away with that.

925
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:24,770 
They was just asking
for big trouble.

926
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:27,689 
You know, Mike,
we was all proud of you...

927
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:29,566 
being a hero and all.

928
01:17:29,566 --> 01:17:32,069 
Your father too.

929
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:11,275 
Nothing.
Not a hint.

930
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:13,777 
Absolutely nothing.

931
01:18:13,944 --> 01:18:16,822 
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting's gonna be held.

932
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:20,617 
How much time do we have?

933
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:23,287 
They're gonna pick you up in front of Jack
Dempsey's joint...

934
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:25,789 
in an hour and a half...
exactly an hour and a half.

935
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:29,960 
We could put a tail on them,
see how it turns out.

936
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:33,297 
Sollozzo'll lose our ass
going around the block.

937
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,923 
What about the negotiator?

938
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:37,634 
He's over at my place playing
pinochle with a couple of my men.

939
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:39,511 
He's happy.
They're letting him win.

940
01:18:39,511 --> 01:18:43,140 
It's too much of a risk for Mike.
Maybe we ought to call it off, Sonny.

941
01:18:43,265 --> 01:18:46,810 
The negotiator keeps on playing cards
until Mike comes back safe and sound.

942
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:49,229 
So why don't they just blast who's ever
in the goddamn car?

943
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:51,231 
Too dangerous.
They'll be looking for that.

944
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:53,734 
Sollozzo might not
even be in the car, Sonny.

945
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:56,904 
I get it.

946
01:19:06,246 --> 01:19:12,753 
Yeah...Yeah...Well, thanks...

947
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:24,515 
- Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.
- Well is it reliable?

948
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:26,433 
That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.

949
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:29,269 
A police captain's got to be
on call 24 hours a day.

950
01:19:29,394 --> 01:19:32,272 
He signed out at that number
between 8:00 and 10:00.

951
01:19:32,397 --> 01:19:33,941 
Anybody know this joint?

952
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:37,361 
Yeah, sure. I do.
It's perfect for us.

953
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:39,738 
A small family place, good food.

954
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:42,533 
Everyone minds his business.
It's perfect.

955
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:45,452 
Pete, they got
an old-fashioned toilet...

956
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:48,789 
You know, the box
and the chain thing.

957
01:19:50,415 --> 01:19:52,960 
We might be able
to tape the gun behind it.

958
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:54,586 
All right.

959
01:19:54,586 --> 01:19:57,714 
Mike, you go to the restaurant.

960
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,259 
You eat, you talk for a while,
you relax.

961
01:20:00,259 --> 01:20:01,927 
You make them relax.

962
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:04,304 
Then you get up
and go take a leak.

963
01:20:04,304 --> 01:20:06,974 
No, better still,
you ask for permission to go.

964
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:08,934 
And when you come back,
you come out blasting.

965
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:11,895 
And don't take any chances.
Two shots in the head apiece.

966
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:14,106 
Now, listen.
I want somebody good...

967
01:20:14,106 --> 01:20:16,108 
and I mean very good...
to plant that gun.

968
01:20:16,108 --> 01:20:19,069 
I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet
with just his dick in his hands, all right?

969
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:20,946 
The gun will be there.

970
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:25,159 
All right, listen. You drive him
and you pick him up after the job.

971
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:27,744 
Come on. Let's move.

972
01:20:27,828 --> 01:20:30,330 
Thank you, Tom.

973
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:35,502 
Did he tell you
to drop the gun right away?

974
01:20:35,627 --> 01:20:38,088 
Yeah, a million times.

975
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:44,761 
Now, you don't forget...
two shots apiece in the head...

976
01:20:44,803 --> 01:20:46,972 
as soon as you
come out the door.

977
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:49,433 
Let's go.

978
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:55,689 
How long do you think it'll be
before I can come back?

979
01:20:57,649 --> 01:20:59,818 
At least a year, Mike.

980
01:20:59,818 --> 01:21:03,363 
Listen, I'll square it with Mom, you know,
you not seeing her before you leave...

981
01:21:03,489 --> 01:21:07,868 
and I'll get a message
to that girlfriend...

982
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:10,454 
when I think the time is right.

983
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:18,128 
Take care.

984
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:22,800 
- See you, Mike.
- Okay, Tom.

985
01:21:54,623 --> 01:21:56,625 
I'm glad you came, Mike.

986
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:59,127 
I hope we can
straighten everything out.

987
01:21:59,795 --> 01:22:02,673 
I mean, this is terrible. It's not the way
I wanted things to go at all.

988
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:04,633 
It should have never happened.

989
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:06,802 
I want to straighten
everything out tonight.

990
01:22:06,802 --> 01:22:09,304 
I don't want my father
bothered anymore.

991
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:13,350 
He won't be, Mike.
I swear on my children he won't be.

992
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:16,687 
But you got to keep an open mind
when we talk.

993
01:22:16,812 --> 01:22:19,314 
I mean, I hope you're not a hot-head
like your brother Sonny.

994
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:21,817 
You can't talk business
with him.

995
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:25,487 
He's a good kid.

996
01:22:28,824 --> 01:22:31,326 
I'm sorry about
the other night, Mike.

997
01:22:32,411 --> 01:22:34,913 
I gotta frisk you,
so turn around, huh?

998
01:22:34,913 --> 01:22:37,416 
On your knees, facing me.

999
01:22:41,253 --> 01:22:44,173 
I guess I'm getting
too old for my job.

1000
01:22:45,257 --> 01:22:47,342 
Too grouchy.

1001
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:50,012 
Can't stand the aggravation.

1002
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:52,598 
You know how it is.

1003
01:22:53,432 --> 01:22:55,934 
He's clean.

1004
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:24,296 
We're going to Jersey?

1005
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:28,467 
Maybe.

1006
01:23:53,116 --> 01:23:55,619 
Nice work, Lou.

1007
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:34,324 
How's the Italian food
in this restaurant?

1008
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:36,785 
Good.
Try the veal.

1009
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:39,288 
- It's the best in the city.
- I'll have it.

1010
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:42,791 
<i>Understand?</i>

1011
01:25:15,282 --> 01:25:17,159 
I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike.

1012
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:19,661 
Go ahead.

1013
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:27,044 
- I'm sorry.
- Forget about it.

1014
01:25:30,047 --> 01:25:37,054 
What happened to
your father was business.

1015
01:25:38,055 --> 01:25:41,058 
I have much respect for your father...

1016
01:25:41,058 --> 01:25:45,062 
but your father's thinking
is old fashioned.

1017
01:25:46,063 --> 01:25:50,943 
You must understand why
I did what I did.

1018
01:25:51,068 --> 01:25:54,071 
I understand these things.

1019
01:25:54,571 --> 01:25:56,281 
I do.

1020
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:58,784 
You do.

1021
01:26:09,253 --> 01:26:13,549 
Now we have to think about what happens

1022
01:26:13,549 --> 01:26:18,262 
between you and the Tattaglias.

1023
01:26:18,262 --> 01:26:22,266 
We have to work through

1024
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:26,270 
where we go from here.

1025
01:26:33,777 --> 01:26:36,280 
How do I say...?

1026
01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:40,576 
What I want...

1027
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:43,245 
what's most important to me...

1028
01:26:45,581 --> 01:26:47,749 
is that I have a guarantee:

1029
01:26:47,749 --> 01:26:49,918 
no more attempts
on my father's life.

1030
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:54,131 
What guarantees could I give you, Mike?
I am the hunted one.

1031
01:26:54,756 --> 01:26:57,801 
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

1032
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:00,429 
I'm not that clever.

1033
01:27:01,597 --> 01:27:04,099 
All I want is a truce.

1034
01:27:10,606 --> 01:27:14,318 
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is that all right?

1035
01:27:15,611 --> 01:27:18,113 
You gotta go, you gotta go.

1036
01:27:23,744 --> 01:27:25,370 
I frisked him.
He's clean.

1037
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:27,873 
Don't take too long.

1038
01:27:31,043 --> 01:27:33,545 
I've frisked a thousand young punks.

1039
01:28:48,871 --> 01:28:51,373 
Everything all right?

1040
01:28:52,374 --> 01:28:54,835 
I respect myself...  understand?

1041
01:28:54,877 --> 01:28:57,838 
And so I cannot allow your
father to hold me back.

1042
01:28:58,672 --> 01:29:01,675 
What happened was unavoidable.

1043
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:05,179 
I had the unspoken support of
the other Dons.

1044
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:07,639 
If your father were in better health...

1045
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:10,142 
without his eldest son running things...

1046
01:31:23,984 --> 01:31:25,486 
Hey, come on.

1047
01:31:25,486 --> 01:31:27,988 
Come on. Let's go.

1048
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:26,130 
Joe, you take over.

1049
01:32:29,007 --> 01:32:31,468 
Hi, Grandpa.

1050
01:32:42,938 --> 01:32:45,440 
I love you, Grandpa.

1051
01:32:47,442 --> 01:32:50,154 
I'm sorry, Pa.
He doesn't know you yet.

1052
01:32:51,905 --> 01:32:54,783 
- Here you are, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

1053
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:56,952 
"I hope you get red, Grandpa...

1054
01:32:56,952 --> 01:32:58,954 
and I wish
I would see you soon.

1055
01:32:58,954 --> 01:33:01,456 
Love, your grandson, Frank."

1056
01:33:03,959 --> 01:33:06,295 
Go with your mother.

1057
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:08,797 
Go ahead.
Take 'em downstairs.

1058
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:16,972 
Go on, Carlo. You too.

1059
01:33:18,307 --> 01:33:20,809 
Go on.

1060
01:33:23,312 --> 01:33:26,523 
I got chicken cacciatore
for you, sweetheart.

1061
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:28,525 
- That's enough bread.
- I like bread.

1062
01:33:28,567 --> 01:33:31,028 
I know, but how much can you eat?

1063
01:33:40,579 --> 01:33:42,581 
What's the matter with you, Carlo?

1064
01:33:42,581 --> 01:33:45,083 
Shut up and set the table.

1065
01:34:00,265 --> 01:34:02,851 
Since McCluskey's killing...

1066
01:34:02,935 --> 01:34:06,355 
the police have been cracking down
most of our operations.

1067
01:34:08,106 --> 01:34:10,609 
And also the other families'.

1068
01:34:11,109 --> 01:34:12,903 
Been a lot of bad blood.

1069
01:34:12,945 --> 01:34:16,406 
They hit us, so we hit them back.

1070
01:34:17,282 --> 01:34:19,451 
Through our contacts
in the newspapers...

1071
01:34:19,451 --> 01:34:21,787 
we've been able to put out
a lot of material...

1072
01:34:21,787 --> 01:34:25,207 
about McCluskey being linked
with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

1073
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:28,961 
See, things are
starting to loosen up.

1074
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:34,299 
Dad, I'm sending Fredo
to Las Vegas...

1075
01:34:34,424 --> 01:34:37,010 
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

1076
01:34:37,136 --> 01:34:39,096 
I want him to rest.

1077
01:34:39,096 --> 01:34:41,598 
I'm going to learn
the casino business.

1078
01:34:41,598 --> 01:34:44,101 
Yeah.

1079
01:34:49,773 --> 01:34:52,276 
Where is Michael?

1080
01:35:04,121 --> 01:35:06,707 
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

1081
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:12,838 
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back now.

1082
01:35:34,568 --> 01:35:36,737 
I want you to find out where that ol' pimp
Tattaglia is hiding.

1083
01:35:36,737 --> 01:35:38,739 
I want his ass now...
right now.

1084
01:35:38,739 --> 01:35:40,574 
- Hey, Sonny.
- What?

1085
01:35:40,574 --> 01:35:42,409 
Things are starting to loosen up
a little bit.

1086
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:45,162 
If you go after Tattaglia,
all hell's going to break loose.

1087
01:35:45,245 --> 01:35:47,247 
Let the smoke clear.
Pop can negotiate.

1088
01:35:47,247 --> 01:35:49,750 
No, Pop can't do nothing till
he's better. I'm gonna decide what's gonna be
done.

1089
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:51,752 
All right, but your war's
costing us a lot of money.

1090
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:53,587 
Nothing's coming in.
We can't do business.

1091
01:35:53,587 --> 01:35:56,340 
Well neither can they.
Don't worry about it.

1092
01:35:56,423 --> 01:35:58,425 
- We can't afford a stalemate.
- Well, then there ain't no more stalemate.

1093
01:35:58,425 --> 01:36:00,427 
I'm gonna end it
by killing that old bastard.

1094
01:36:00,427 --> 01:36:02,596 
You're getting a great reputation.
I hope you're enjoying it.

1095
01:36:02,596 --> 01:36:04,264 
Well you just do what I tell you to do!

1096
01:36:04,264 --> 01:36:06,433 
Goddamn it, if I had a wartime
consigliere, a Sicilian,

1097
01:36:06,433 --> 01:36:08,435 
I wouldn't be in this shape!

1098
01:36:08,435 --> 01:36:10,938 
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1099
01:36:14,274 --> 01:36:16,777 
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

1100
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:20,823 
Mom made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.

1101
01:36:21,782 --> 01:36:24,535 
Them niggers are having
a good time...

1102
01:36:24,618 --> 01:36:26,286 
with our policy banks
up there in Harlem.

1103
01:36:26,286 --> 01:36:30,123 
Driving them new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

1104
01:36:30,249 --> 01:36:33,627 
I knew that was gonna happen as soon
as they started making big money.

1105
01:36:33,752 --> 01:36:37,297 
Look, Papa never talked business
at the table in front of the kids.

1106
01:36:37,422 --> 01:36:40,134 
- Hey, shut up, Connie.
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1107
01:36:40,259 --> 01:36:43,303 
- You got that?
- Santino, don't interfere.

1108
01:36:45,264 --> 01:36:47,850 
You know, Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk
to you, maybe after dinner.

1109
01:36:47,933 --> 01:36:49,893 
I could be doing a lot more
for the family.

1110
01:36:49,935 --> 01:36:52,396 
We don't discuss business
at the table.

1111
01:37:39,318 --> 01:37:40,819 
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

1112
01:37:45,324 --> 01:37:53,832 
Michele, Why are you so far from the
house? You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

1113
01:37:53,832 --> 01:37:54,833 
I'm with Calo and Fabrizio...

1114
01:37:54,917 --> 01:38:04,843 
It's still dangerous. We've heard from
Santino in New York. Your enemies know
you're here.

1115
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:07,846 
Did Santino say when I can go back?

1116
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:12,851 
Not yet. It's out of the question.

1117
01:38:13,143 --> 01:38:14,520 
Grazie.

1118
01:38:15,145 --> 01:38:16,522 
Where are you going now?

1119
01:38:17,356 --> 01:38:19,858 
Corleone.

1120
01:38:20,359 --> 01:38:21,819 
Take my car...

1121
01:38:24,029 --> 01:38:25,531 
No. I want to walk.

1122
01:38:28,033 --> 01:38:29,535 
Accura! Be careful!

1123
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:51,348 
Look there. Corleone.

1124
01:39:03,944 --> 01:39:05,320 
Where have all the men gone?

1125
01:39:05,529 --> 01:39:07,156 
They're dead from vendettas.

1126
01:39:10,534 --> 01:39:11,827 
There are the names of the dead.

1127
01:39:28,677 --> 01:39:32,014 
Hey, American!
Take me to the America! G.I.!

1128
01:39:32,556 --> 01:39:33,557 
Hey, hey, hey!

1129
01:39:33,599 --> 01:39:36,685 
Take me to America, G.I.
Clark Gable.

1130
01:39:37,186 --> 01:39:38,687 
America! America!

1131
01:39:38,687 --> 01:39:40,189 
Take me to the America, G.I.

1132
01:39:40,189 --> 01:39:42,191 
Clark Gable.
Rita Hayworth.

1133
01:40:00,501 --> 01:40:02,211 
Mama mia what a beauty.Oh...

1134
01:40:11,512 --> 01:40:14,181 
I think you got hit by the
thunderbolt.

1135
01:40:19,478 --> 01:40:24,191 
Michele. In Sicily, women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

1136
01:40:35,494 --> 01:40:37,496 
Hey, host.

1137
01:40:39,206 --> 01:40:41,208 
A bottle of wine.

1138
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:48,882 
Did you have a good hunt?

1139
01:40:49,883 --> 01:40:54,888 
You know all the girls around here?
We saw some real beauties.

1140
01:40:54,888 --> 01:40:59,893
One of them struck our friend like a
thunderbolt.

1141
01:41:02,896 --> 01:41:03,836
She would tempt the devil himself.

1142
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:07,720
... tempt the devil...

1143
01:41:09,903 --> 01:41:11,905
Ah, I understand...really put together...

1144
01:41:12,906 --> 01:41:15,508
Really put together, eh Calo?

1145
01:41:15,518 --> 01:41:15,909
... together

1146
01:41:18,078 --> 01:41:21,915
Such hair...such mouth!

1147
01:41:22,082 --> 01:41:22,916 
A bocca...

1148
01:41:23,083 --> 01:41:26,879 
Ah, he girls around here are beautiful but
virtuous, ah?

1149
01:41:27,087 --> 01:41:32,176 
This one had a purple dress and a purple
ribbon in her hair.

1150
01:41:32,301 --> 01:41:32,885 
... a purple ribbon...

1151
01:41:33,302 --> 01:41:36,889 
... a type more Greek than Italian.

1152
01:41:37,097 --> 01:41:38,891 
Piu Greca d'Italiana...

1153
01:41:39,099 --> 01:41:40,017
Do you know her?

1154
01:41:40,027 --> 01:41:39,600
NO!

1155
01:41:44,897 --> 01:41:47,608
There's no girl like that in this
town!

1156
01:41:50,903 --> 01:41:51,612 
My God, I understand!

1157
01:41:55,908 --> 01:41:56,617 
What's wrong?

1158
01:41:59,912 --> 01:42:03,582 
Let's go. It's his daughter.

1159
01:42:04,917 --> 01:42:05,584 
Tell him to come here.

1160
01:42:06,001 --> 01:42:08,587 
You don't understand. It's his daughter!

1161
01:42:08,712 --> 01:42:09,588 
No, no, no, no. Call him.

1162
01:42:30,692 --> 01:42:32,611 
Fabrizio...traducce per me.

1163
01:42:32,694 --> 01:42:33,612 
Si, Signor.

1164
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:38,992 
I apologize if I offended you.

1165
01:42:39,827 --> 01:42:42,329 
I'm a stranger in this country...

1166
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:45,749 
and I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

1167
01:42:51,505 --> 01:42:54,007 
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

1168
01:42:55,676 --> 01:42:58,178 
My name is Michael Corleone.

1169
01:43:00,013 --> 01:43:02,683 
There are people who would pay
a lot of money for that information.

1170
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:09,022 
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

1171
01:43:10,983 --> 01:43:13,485 
instead of gaining a husband.

1172
01:43:21,201 --> 01:43:23,704 
I want to meet your daughter...

1173
01:43:24,538 --> 01:43:26,373 
with your permission...

1174
01:43:26,373 --> 01:43:28,876 
and under the supervision
of your family...

1175
01:43:29,835 --> 01:43:32,337 
with all respect.

1176
01:43:38,802 --> 01:43:45,309 
Come to my house Sunday. My name is
Vitelli...

1177
01:43:47,811 --> 01:43:49,813 
Grazie e como se chiama, vostra figlia?

1178
01:43:50,022 --> 01:43:52,524 
Apollonia.

1179
01:43:52,608 --> 01:43:53,484 
Bene.

1180
01:44:46,995 --> 01:44:49,998 
...this is my daughter, Apollonia...

1181
01:44:49,998 --> 01:44:53,001 
and this is Michael Corleone.

1182
01:45:09,017 --> 01:45:11,019 
Thank you.

1183
01:45:11,603 --> 01:45:13,605 
Your welcome.

1184
01:45:23,615 --> 01:45:26,118 
What's the problem with your eye.

1185
01:45:26,618 --> 01:45:29,121 
No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.

1186
01:46:43,821 --> 01:46:46,323 
Hey! I'm gonna knock you dizzy.

1187
01:46:51,829 --> 01:46:54,331 
Save it for the library.

1188
01:46:57,459 --> 01:46:59,962 
Come on. We gotta go
pick up my sister. Let's go.

1189
01:47:18,188 --> 01:47:20,691 
What's the matter?

1190
01:47:22,484 --> 01:47:24,486 
What's the matter?

1191
01:47:25,696 --> 01:47:27,865 
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

1192
01:47:27,865 --> 01:47:31,243 
Sonny, please. It was my fault.
Sonny, it was my fault. I hit him.

1193
01:47:31,368 --> 01:47:33,287 
I started a fight with him.
Please, Sonny.

1194
01:47:33,287 --> 01:47:35,789 
I'm sorry.

1195
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:43,088 
Okay, I'm just... I'm just gonna get a
doctor to come and take a look at you.

1196
01:47:43,297 --> 01:47:46,049 
Sonny, please don't do anything.
Please, don't do it.

1197
01:47:48,135 --> 01:47:50,304 
What's the matter with you?
What am I gonna do?

1198
01:47:50,304 --> 01:47:53,098 
Am I gonna make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

1199
01:47:55,976 --> 01:47:57,478 
All right?

1200
01:47:57,478 --> 01:48:00,564 
This fat slob's still bettin' the Yankees
pretty heavy?

1201
01:48:00,689 --> 01:48:03,192 
You tell 'em to stop takin'
action on 'em, alright?

1202
01:48:04,359 --> 01:48:06,862 
You lost enough money
last weekend to me.

1203
01:48:12,743 --> 01:48:15,245 
Carlo, come here.

1204
01:49:12,344 --> 01:49:15,055 
You touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

1205
01:53:10,415 --> 01:53:13,127 
Weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

1206
01:53:13,252 --> 01:53:17,548 
Yes, well, I have.
I mean I've tried writing and calling.

1207
01:53:17,631 --> 01:53:20,008 
Now, I wanna reach Michael.

1208
01:53:20,008 --> 01:53:23,428 
Nobody knows where he is. We know
that he's all right, but that's all.

1209
01:53:26,682 --> 01:53:28,684 
- What was that?
- That's an accident.

1210
01:53:28,684 --> 01:53:31,395 
But nobody was hurt.

1211
01:53:31,436 --> 01:53:32,437 
Tom...

1212
01:53:32,938 --> 01:53:36,775 
Would you give this letter
to Michael, please? Please?

1213
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:39,236 
Well, if I accepted that...

1214
01:53:39,236 --> 01:53:42,781 
in a court of law they could prove that
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

1215
01:53:42,906 --> 01:53:45,117 
Now you just be patient, Kay.
He'll get in touch with you, all right?

1216
01:53:45,117 --> 01:53:48,996 
I let my cab go, so can I come in
to call another one, please?

1217
01:53:49,121 --> 01:53:51,623 
Come on. I'm sorry.
Come on.

1218
01:54:07,931 --> 01:54:10,434 
Hello?

1219
01:54:11,977 --> 01:54:13,770 
<i>Is Carlo there?</i>

1220
01:54:13,770 --> 01:54:16,231 
<i>- Who's this?</i>
- This is a friend of Carlo's.

1221
01:54:16,231 --> 01:54:19,276 
<i>Would you tell him that</i>
I can't make it tonight until later?

1222
01:54:25,491 --> 01:54:27,993 
Bitch.

1223
01:54:28,786 --> 01:54:31,371 
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry yet.

1224
01:54:31,497 --> 01:54:33,499 
Your food is on the table.
It's getting cold.

1225
01:54:33,499 --> 01:54:36,543 
- I'll eat out later.
- You just told me to make you dinner.

1226
01:54:36,668 --> 01:54:38,670 
Hey, fuck you, eh?

1227
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:41,131 
Go fuck yourself!

1228
01:54:45,844 --> 01:54:48,347 
What the hell is she up to now, this
little guinea brat.

1229
01:54:52,768 --> 01:54:55,354 
That's it. Break it all,
you spoiled guinea brat.

1230
01:54:55,479 --> 01:54:57,981 
Break it all!

1231
01:55:00,692 --> 01:55:03,153 
That's it. Break it all.

1232
01:55:06,281 --> 01:55:10,494 
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

1233
01:55:10,577 --> 01:55:13,080 
Maybe I will.
Why not?

1234
01:55:18,752 --> 01:55:21,213 
- Now clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

1235
01:55:21,213 --> 01:55:23,715 
Clean it up! Clean it up, you guinea
spoiled brat!

1236
01:55:23,715 --> 01:55:30,222 
Clean it up! Clean it up, I
said clean it up! Clean that up! Clean it
up!

1237
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:33,142 
You son of a bitch!

1238
01:55:33,642 --> 01:55:41,150 
Clean it up! Clean that up you son-of-a-
bitch! Clean it! Clean it up!

1239
01:55:41,817 --> 01:55:44,903 
Yeah yeah...	Come on, now! Kill me!
Be a murderer like your father!

1240
01:55:45,028 --> 01:55:47,364 
- Come on! All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

1241
01:55:47,364 --> 01:55:49,074 
- Come on!
- I'll kill you!

1242
01:55:49,074 --> 01:55:51,577 
- Come on! Kill me!
Get up!

1243
01:55:51,577 --> 01:55:53,245 
Get out of here!

1244
01:55:53,245 --> 01:55:56,707 
- I hate you!
- Now go ahead. Now I'll kill you.

1245
01:55:56,832 --> 01:55:58,834 
You guinea brat, you.

1246
01:55:58,834 --> 01:56:01,336 
Get out here!

1247
01:56:10,179 --> 01:56:13,098 
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you. What is it?

1248
01:56:14,266 --> 01:56:17,144 
Honey, talk louder.
The baby's crying.

1249
01:56:17,269 --> 01:56:19,271 
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

1250
01:56:19,271 --> 01:56:21,356 
I don't understand.

1251
01:56:21,356 --> 01:56:23,859 
Yeah, Connie.

1252
01:56:28,405 --> 01:56:30,908 
Listen, you wait there.

1253
01:56:32,785 --> 01:56:35,245 
No, you just wait there.

1254
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:39,958 
- That son of a bitch.
- Sonny, what's the matter?

1255
01:56:40,083 --> 01:56:42,211 
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

1256
01:56:42,211 --> 01:56:44,713 
Damn it!

1257
01:56:46,882 --> 01:56:49,510 
Open the goddamn gate.
Get off your ass.

1258
01:57:06,026 --> 01:57:08,862 
- Sonny, come on!
- Get out of here!

1259
01:57:08,987 --> 01:57:11,448 
Go after him.
Go on.

1260
01:57:39,852 --> 01:57:41,812 
Son of a bitch.

1261
01:57:41,812 --> 01:57:44,314 
Come on! Come on!

1262
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:33,882 
Give me a drop.

1263
01:59:41,473 --> 01:59:43,976 
My wife is crying upstairs.

1264
01:59:46,145 --> 01:59:48,647 
I hear cars coming to the house.

1265
01:59:53,235 --> 01:59:55,737 
Consigliere of mine...

1266
01:59:56,613 --> 01:59:59,533 
I think you should tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

1267
01:59:59,658 --> 02:00:02,119 
Well, I didn't tell Mama anything.

1268
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:06,874 
I was about to come up and wake you
just now and tell you.

1269
02:00:10,002 --> 02:00:12,504 
But you needed a drink first.

1270
02:00:19,094 --> 02:00:21,597 
Now you've had your drink.

1271
02:00:27,144 --> 02:00:31,315 
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

1272
02:00:48,582 --> 02:00:51,084 
I want all inquiries made.

1273
02:00:55,255 --> 02:00:57,758 
I want no acts of vengeance.

1274
02:00:59,301 --> 02:01:01,804 
I want you to arrange a meeting...

1275
02:01:03,096 --> 02:01:05,599 
with the heads
of the five families.

1276
02:01:07,851 --> 02:01:10,354 
This war stops now.

1277
02:01:31,792 --> 02:01:34,336 
Call Bonasera.

1278
02:01:34,419 --> 02:01:36,922 
We need him now.

1279
02:01:48,767 --> 02:01:51,770 
This is Tom Hagen
calling for Vito Corleone...

1280
02:01:51,854 --> 02:01:53,939 
at his request.

1281
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:56,275 
Now, you owe your Don a service.

1282
02:01:56,275 --> 02:02:00,070 
<i>He has no doubt that</i>
you will repay it.

1283
02:02:00,195 --> 02:02:02,948 
<i>Now, he will be at your</i>
funeral parlor in one hour.

1284
02:02:03,073 --> 02:02:05,576 
<i>Be there to greet him.</i>

1285
02:02:25,804 --> 02:02:28,140 
Well, my friend...

1286
02:02:28,140 --> 02:02:30,601 
are you ready
to do me this service?

1287
02:02:30,601 --> 02:02:32,269 
Yes.

1288
02:02:32,269 --> 02:02:34,771 
What do you want me to do?

1289
02:02:42,154 --> 02:02:45,157 
I want you to use
all your powers...

1290
02:02:45,282 --> 02:02:47,785 
and all your skills.

1291
02:02:50,788 --> 02:02:53,290 
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

1292
02:03:09,848 --> 02:03:12,309
Look how they massacred my boy.

1293
02:03:44,842 --> 02:03:45,362
It's safer to teach you English!

1294
02:03:45,843 --> 02:03:46,343
I know English...

1295
02:03:47,219 --> 02:03:49,096 
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday...

1296
02:03:49,096 --> 02:03:51,723 
Wednesday, Friday,
Sunday, Saturday.

1297
02:04:02,109 --> 02:04:03,735 
How are things in Palermo?

1298
02:04:10,117 --> 02:04:15,539 
Michael is teaching me to drive  watch,
I'll show you.

1299
02:04:19,084 --> 02:04:21,044
Young people don't respect anything
anymore. Times are changing for the worse.
This place has become too dangerous for
you. I don't think you're safe here. I
want you to move to a villa near Siracusa,
right now...Subita, eh?

1300
02:04:45,110 --> 02:04:46,528 
What's wrong?

1301
02:04:48,113 --> 02:04:56,538
Bad news from America. Your brother,
Santino, they killed him.

1302
02:05:01,084 --> 02:05:02,274
Michele...Michele, Let's go... let's go...
you promised me.

1303
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:26,610
- Fabrizio.
- Yes, sir?

1304
02:05:27,778 --> 02:05:29,446 
Are you driving yourself, boss?

1305
02:05:29,446 --> 02:05:31,740 
- Yes.
- Is your wife coming with you?

1306
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:35,285 
No. I want you to take her to her father's
house till I know things are safe.

1307
02:05:35,410 --> 02:05:37,913
Okay. Anything you say, boss.

1308
02:05:45,087 --> 02:05:45,897
Calo, dové Apollonia?

1309
02:05:46,088 --> 02:05:47,178
She's going to surprise you  she wants to
drive.

1310
02:05:52,094 --> 02:05:53,024
She'll make a good American wife.

1311
02:05:56,098 --> 02:05:56,988
Wait, I'll get the baggage...

1312
02:06:13,115 --> 02:06:14,125
Michele, wait there! I'll drive to you...

1313
02:06:22,082 --> 02:06:22,862
NO! No, Apollonia!

1314
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:48,901
Don Barzini,
I want to thank you...

1315
02:06:48,901 --> 02:06:52,404 
for helping me organize
this meeting here today.

1316
02:06:52,529 --> 02:06:55,866 
And also the other heads
of the five families...

1317
02:06:55,991 --> 02:06:58,494 
from New York and New Jersey.

1318
02:06:59,495 --> 02:07:02,498 
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.

1319
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,503 
And Brooklyn...

1320
02:07:07,669 --> 02:07:10,172 
Philip Tattaglia.

1321
02:07:11,590 --> 02:07:14,384 
And from Staten Island...

1322
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:17,763 
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1323
02:07:17,888 --> 02:07:20,390 
And all the other associates
that came as far...

1324
02:07:20,432 --> 02:07:23,560 
as from California
and Kansas City...

1325
02:07:23,685 --> 02:07:26,104 
and all the other territories
of the country.

1326
02:07:26,104 --> 02:07:28,607 
Thank you.

1327
02:07:34,238 --> 02:07:36,740 
How did things ever get so far?

1328
02:07:37,783 --> 02:07:40,244 
I don't know.

1329
02:07:41,495 --> 02:07:44,998 
It was so unfortunate
and so unnecessary.

1330
02:07:48,085 --> 02:07:50,295 
Tattaglia lost a son...

1331
02:07:50,295 --> 02:07:52,798 
and I lost a son.

1332
02:07:53,549 --> 02:07:57,136 
We're quits,
and if Tattaglia agrees...

1333
02:07:57,261 --> 02:08:01,306 
then I'm willing to let things
go on the way they were before.

1334
02:08:02,975 --> 02:08:06,478 
We are all grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1335
02:08:06,603 --> 02:08:09,273 
We all know him
as a man of his word.

1336
02:08:09,398 --> 02:08:11,650 
A modest man.
He'll always listen to reason.

1337
02:08:11,650 --> 02:08:14,111 
Yes, Don Barzini.

1338
02:08:14,153 --> 02:08:16,238 
He's too modest.

1339
02:08:16,238 --> 02:08:19,199 
He had all the judges
and politicians in his pocket.

1340
02:08:20,617 --> 02:08:23,454 
He refused to share them.

1341
02:08:23,537 --> 02:08:26,540 
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1342
02:08:27,416 --> 02:08:29,918 
All of you know me here.

1343
02:08:30,794 --> 02:08:34,798 
When did I ever refuse,
except one time?

1344
02:08:34,923 --> 02:08:37,426 
And why?

1345
02:08:37,593 --> 02:08:40,095 
Because I believe
this drug business...

1346
02:08:40,179 --> 02:08:43,307 
is going to destroy us
in the years to come.

1347
02:08:43,432 --> 02:08:47,144 
I mean, it's not like gambling
or liquor or even women...

1348
02:08:47,269 --> 02:08:49,980 
which is something that
most people want nowadays...

1349
02:08:50,105 --> 02:08:53,567 
and is forbidden to them by
the pezzonovante of the church.

1350
02:08:53,692 --> 02:08:56,778 
Even the police departments
that have helped us in the past...

1351
02:08:56,862 --> 02:08:58,697 
with gambling and other things...

1352
02:08:58,697 --> 02:09:02,826 
are gonna refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1353
02:09:02,951 --> 02:09:05,871 
And I believed that then...

1354
02:09:05,996 --> 02:09:08,123 
and I believe that now.

1355
02:09:08,123 --> 02:09:10,417 
Times have changed.

1356
02:09:10,417 --> 02:09:12,711 
It's not like the old days...

1357
02:09:12,711 --> 02:09:15,172 
when we could do
anything we want.

1358
02:09:15,214 --> 02:09:18,133 
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1359
02:09:18,217 --> 02:09:22,179 
If Don Corleone had all the judges
and the politicians in New York...

1360
02:09:22,262 --> 02:09:25,265 
then he must share them
or let others use them.

1361
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:28,519 
He must let us draw
the water from the well.

1362
02:09:29,478 --> 02:09:33,023 
Certainly, he can present a bill
for such services.

1363
02:09:33,148 --> 02:09:35,859 
After all, we are not Communists.

1364
02:09:38,862 --> 02:09:41,907 
I also don't believe in drugs.

1365
02:09:42,032 --> 02:09:44,243 
For years,
I paid my people extra...

1366
02:09:44,243 --> 02:09:46,662 
so they wouldn't do
that kind of business.

1367
02:09:46,662 --> 02:09:50,082 
Somebody comes to them and says,
"I have powders.

1368
02:09:50,207 --> 02:09:52,918 
If you put up a three, four
thousand dollar investment,

1369
02:09:53,919 --> 02:09:56,547 
we can make 50,000 distributing."

1370
02:09:57,673 --> 02:10:01,468 
So they can't resist. I want
to control it as a business...

1371
02:10:01,593 --> 02:10:04,054 
to keep it respectable.

1372
02:10:04,054 --> 02:10:08,559 
I don't want it near schools.
I don't want it sold to children.

1373
02:10:08,684 --> 02:10:11,186 
That's an infamia.

1374
02:10:11,728 --> 02:10:15,649 
In my city, we would keep the traffic
in the dark people, the colored.

1375
02:10:15,774 --> 02:10:18,610 
They're animals anyway,
so let them lose their souls.

1376
02:10:25,617 --> 02:10:28,912 
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1377
02:10:30,622 --> 02:10:33,792 
And as a reasonable man, I'm willing
to do whatever's necessary...

1378
02:10:33,917 --> 02:10:37,379 
to find a peaceful solution
to these problems.

1379
02:10:37,504 --> 02:10:39,673 
Then we are agreed.

1380
02:10:39,673 --> 02:10:42,134 
The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1381
02:10:42,134 --> 02:10:44,678 
And Don Corleone will give our
protection in the east...

1382
02:10:44,803 --> 02:10:46,722 
and there will be the peace.

1383
02:10:46,722 --> 02:10:50,601 
But I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1384
02:10:50,684 --> 02:10:53,854 
As time goes by and
his position becomes stronger...

1385
02:10:53,979 --> 02:10:56,482 
will he attempt
any individual vendetta?

1386
02:10:56,607 --> 02:10:58,650 
Look, we are all
reasonable men here.

1387
02:10:58,650 --> 02:11:02,112 
We don't have to give assurances
as if we were lawyers.

1388
02:11:02,196 --> 02:11:04,448 
You talk about vengeance.

1389
02:11:04,448 --> 02:11:07,701 
Is vengeance gonna bring
your son back to you?

1390
02:11:07,826 --> 02:11:10,287 
Or my boy to me?

1391
02:11:10,996 --> 02:11:13,457 
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

1392
02:11:16,627 --> 02:11:19,129 
But I have selfish reasons.

1393
02:11:21,131 --> 02:11:23,175 
My youngest son...

1394
02:11:23,175 --> 02:11:25,636 
was forced to leave this country...

1395
02:11:26,678 --> 02:11:29,139 
because of this Sollozzo business.

1396
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:32,476 
All right.
And I have to make arrangements...

1397
02:11:32,559 --> 02:11:37,189 
to bring him back here safely,
cleared of all these false charges.

1398
02:11:38,857 --> 02:11:41,860 
But I'm a superstitious man.

1399
02:11:41,985 --> 02:11:44,530 
And if some unlucky accident
should befall him...

1400
02:11:44,655 --> 02:11:48,367 
if he should get shot
in the head by a police officer...

1401
02:11:48,492 --> 02:11:52,329 
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell...

1402
02:11:52,412 --> 02:11:54,915 
of if he's struck
by a bolt of lightening...

1403
02:11:56,542 --> 02:11:59,586 
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1404
02:12:01,797 --> 02:12:04,299 
And that I do not forgive.

1405
02:12:06,635 --> 02:12:09,138 
But that aside...

1406
02:12:12,057 --> 02:12:14,560 
let me say that I swear...

1407
02:12:16,019 --> 02:12:19,106 
on the souls of my grandchildren...

1408
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:22,734 
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1409
02:12:49,136 --> 02:12:51,138 
When I meet with the Tattaglia
people, should I insist...

1410
02:12:51,138 --> 02:12:54,516 
that all these drug middlemen
have clean records?

1411
02:12:54,600 --> 02:12:57,102 
Mention it.
Don't insist.

1412
02:12:58,937 --> 02:13:01,440 
Barzini is a man who'll know that
without being told.

1413
02:13:02,774 --> 02:13:05,402 
You mean Tattaglia.

1414
02:13:05,486 --> 02:13:08,238 
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1415
02:13:08,322 --> 02:13:10,824 
He never could've outfought Santino.

1416
02:13:14,161 --> 02:13:17,831 
But I didn't know until this day
that it was...

1417
02:13:17,956 --> 02:13:20,417 
Barzini all along.

1418
02:13:35,098 --> 02:13:37,601 
Come on, Nancy.

1419
02:13:38,310 --> 02:13:40,771 
Keep together, everyone.
Brian?

1420
02:13:42,147 --> 02:13:44,650 
Okay. All right.

1421
02:13:57,204 --> 02:13:59,748 
How long have you been back?

1422
02:13:59,832 --> 02:14:02,334 
I've been back a year.

1423
02:14:03,293 --> 02:14:05,796 
Longer than that, I think.

1424
02:14:08,048 --> 02:14:10,551 
It's good to see you, Kay.

1425
02:14:16,473 --> 02:14:18,976 
Hi, Miss Adams!

1426
02:14:21,311 --> 02:14:23,814 
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1427
02:14:26,441 --> 02:14:28,485 
He's been sick.

1428
02:14:28,485 --> 02:14:30,904 
Very sick.

1429
02:14:30,904 --> 02:14:33,031 
But you're not like him, Michael.

1430
02:14:33,031 --> 02:14:35,534 
I thought you weren't going
to become a man like your father.

1431
02:14:35,659 --> 02:14:38,162 
That's what you told me.

1432
02:14:38,704 --> 02:14:41,415 
My father's no different
than any other powerful man.

1433
02:14:43,083 --> 02:14:46,670 
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1434
02:14:47,754 --> 02:14:50,257 
Like a senator or a president.

1435
02:14:50,257 --> 02:14:52,801 
- Do you know how naive you sound?
- Why?

1436
02:14:52,885 --> 02:14:55,512 
Senators and presidents
don't have men killed.

1437
02:14:56,847 --> 02:14:57,848 
Oh.

1438
02:14:58,849 --> 02:15:01,351 
Who's being naive, Kay?

1439
02:15:01,977 --> 02:15:04,229 
Kay, my father's way
of doing things is over.

1440
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:07,691 
It's finished.
Even he knows that.

1441
02:15:07,816 --> 02:15:09,860 
I mean, in five years
the Corleone family...

1442
02:15:09,860 --> 02:15:12,362 
is going to be completely legitimate.

1443
02:15:14,114 --> 02:15:16,992 
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business.

1444
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:17,993 
Kay.

1445
02:15:19,453 --> 02:15:21,830 
Michael, why did you come here?

1446
02:15:21,830 --> 02:15:24,041 
Why?

1447
02:15:24,041 --> 02:15:26,084 
What do you want with me
after all this time...

1448
02:15:26,084 --> 02:15:28,629 
without even calling or writing?

1449
02:15:28,754 --> 02:15:30,756 
I came here because I need you.

1450
02:15:30,756 --> 02:15:33,258 
- Because I care for you.
- Please stop it, Michael.

1451
02:15:33,383 --> 02:15:36,512 
Because I want you to marry me.

1452
02:15:38,013 --> 02:15:40,516 
- It's too late. It's too late.
- Please. Kay.

1453
02:15:42,226 --> 02:15:46,063 
I'll do anything you ask, anything to
make up for what's happened to us.

1454
02:15:47,898 --> 02:15:50,234 
Because that's important, Kay.

1455
02:15:50,234 --> 02:15:53,695 
Because what's important is that...

1456
02:15:53,821 --> 02:15:55,656 
we have each other.

1457
02:15:55,656 --> 02:15:58,575 
That we have a life together.

1458
02:15:58,659 --> 02:16:02,121 
That we have children.
Our children.

1459
02:16:02,621 --> 02:16:03,622 
Kay...

1460
02:16:04,289 --> 02:16:07,000 
I need you...

1461
02:16:07,126 --> 02:16:09,586 
and I love you.

1462
02:16:30,732 --> 02:16:32,734 
Barzini's people
chisel my territory...

1463
02:16:32,734 --> 02:16:34,611 
and we do nothing about it.

1464
02:16:34,611 --> 02:16:37,281 
Pretty soon, there won't be one place
in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

1465
02:16:37,322 --> 02:16:39,867 
- Just be patient.
- I'm not askin' you for help, Mike.

1466
02:16:39,992 --> 02:16:42,494 
- Just take off the handcuffs.
- Be patient.

1467
02:16:42,619 --> 02:16:44,746 
We gotta protect ourselves.

1468
02:16:44,746 --> 02:16:46,748 
Give me a chance to recruit
some new men.

1469
02:16:46,748 --> 02:16:48,375 
No.

1470
02:16:48,375 --> 02:16:50,878 
I don't wanna give Barzini
an excuse to start fighting.

1471
02:16:50,961 --> 02:16:53,464 
Mike, you're wrong.

1472
02:16:53,589 --> 02:16:57,217 
Don Corleone, you once said
that the day would come...

1473
02:16:57,342 --> 02:17:00,012 
when Tessio and me
could form our own family.

1474
02:17:00,137 --> 02:17:02,139 
Till today,
I would never think of it.

1475
02:17:02,139 --> 02:17:04,516 
I must ask your permission.

1476
02:17:04,516 --> 02:17:07,728 
Well, Michael is now
head of the family...

1477
02:17:07,853 --> 02:17:10,522 
and if he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1478
02:17:12,107 --> 02:17:14,610 
After we make the move to Nevada...

1479
02:17:14,693 --> 02:17:17,696 
you can break off from the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1480
02:17:17,821 --> 02:17:20,616 
- After we make the move to Nevada.
- How long will that be?

1481
02:17:21,867 --> 02:17:23,494 
Six months.

1482
02:17:23,494 --> 02:17:26,955 
Forgive me, Godfather,
but with you gone...

1483
02:17:27,039 --> 02:17:30,042 
me and Pete'll come under
Barzini's thumb sooner or later.

1484
02:17:30,125 --> 02:17:32,628 
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

1485
02:17:32,669 --> 02:17:35,589 
In six months' time, there won't be
nothing left to build on.

1486
02:17:35,714 --> 02:17:38,675 
- You have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1487
02:17:38,801 --> 02:17:41,595 
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Yes, always, Godfather.

1488
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:43,972 
Then be a friend to Michael...

1489
02:17:43,972 --> 02:17:46,475 
and do as he says.

1490
02:17:49,895 --> 02:17:52,105 
There are things being negotiated
now that are going to solve...

1491
02:17:52,105 --> 02:17:55,192 
all your problems
and answer all your questions.

1492
02:17:55,317 --> 02:17:57,820 
That's all I can tell you now.

1493
02:17:58,320 --> 02:18:00,948 
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1494
02:18:01,073 --> 02:18:04,201 
When we make our move there,
you're gonna be my right-hand man.

1495
02:18:04,326 --> 02:18:07,037 
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

1496
02:18:07,121 --> 02:18:09,623 
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

1497
02:18:09,623 --> 02:18:12,084 
That's no reflection on Tom,
but that's the way I want it.

1498
02:18:12,084 --> 02:18:14,044 
Besides, if I ever need help...

1499
02:18:14,044 --> 02:18:16,338 
who's a better consigliere
than my father?

1500
02:18:16,338 --> 02:18:18,841 
Now that's it.

1501
02:18:36,942 --> 02:18:39,403 
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1502
02:18:40,821 --> 02:18:45,075 
Mike, ehh...
Why am I out?

1503
02:18:45,159 --> 02:18:47,661 
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1504
02:18:49,246 --> 02:18:51,748 
Things may get rough
with the move we're trying.

1505
02:18:52,416 --> 02:18:53,417 
Tom...

1506
02:18:59,006 --> 02:19:01,300 
I advised Michael.

1507
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:04,178 
I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1508
02:19:04,303 --> 02:19:07,556 
I thought Santino was a bad Don...

1509
02:19:07,639 --> 02:19:09,933 
rest in peace.

1510
02:19:09,933 --> 02:19:12,936 
Michael has all my confidence,
as, as you do.

1511
02:19:14,146 --> 02:19:17,691 
But there are reasons why
you must have no part...

1512
02:19:17,816 --> 02:19:20,027 
in what is going to happen.

1513
02:19:20,027 --> 02:19:21,528 
Maybe I could help.

1514
02:19:21,528 --> 02:19:24,031 
You're out, Tom.

1515
02:20:12,454 --> 02:20:14,957 
I can't get over the way
your face looks.

1516
02:20:15,082 --> 02:20:18,252 
It really looks good.
This doctor did some job.

1517
02:20:18,377 --> 02:20:21,004 
Who talked you into it, Kay?
Hey, hey, wait.

1518
02:20:21,088 --> 02:20:23,507 
Leave them out here.
We'll deal with them later.

1519
02:20:23,507 --> 02:20:25,509 
He's tired.
He wants to clean up.

1520
02:20:25,509 --> 02:20:28,554 
All right now, let me open the door.
All right?

1521
02:20:34,101 --> 02:20:36,436 
Hello, Mike.
Welcome to Las Vegas.

1522
02:20:36,436 --> 02:20:39,690 
All for you, kid.
It was all his idea, right?

1523
02:20:39,815 --> 02:20:42,609 
- Well, your brother, Freddy...
- It was... Girls?

1524
02:20:46,363 --> 02:20:49,158 
I'll be right back.
You keep them occupied.

1525
02:20:49,241 --> 02:20:52,202 
That a boy.
Anything you want, kid, anything. Huh?

1526
02:20:52,286 --> 02:20:54,788 
Who are the girls?

1527
02:20:55,372 --> 02:20:57,374 
That's for you to find out.

1528
02:20:57,374 --> 02:21:00,210 
Get rid of them, Fredo.

1529
02:21:00,335 --> 02:21:02,463 
- Hey, Mike...
- Fredo, I'm here on business.

1530
02:21:02,463 --> 02:21:06,216 
I leave tomorrow.
Now, get rid of them. I'm tired.

1531
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:08,802 
Get rid of the band too.

1532
02:21:13,765 --> 02:21:16,560 
Hey, just take off.
Come on. Let's go.

1533
02:21:16,685 --> 02:21:19,938 
Hey, that's it.
Hey, Angelo, that's it.

1534
02:21:20,063 --> 02:21:22,065 
Let's go.
Hey, come on!

1535
02:21:22,107 --> 02:21:24,568 
Scram!

1536
02:21:24,860 --> 02:21:27,237 
Come on, honey. Let's go.
I don't know, Johnny.

1537
02:21:27,237 --> 02:21:29,406 
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with him. I'm sorry.

1538
02:21:29,406 --> 02:21:31,700 
It's all right, Freddy.

1539
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:34,203 
I don't know.
He's tired, he's hot.

1540
02:21:41,210 --> 02:21:43,712 
What happened to Moe Greene?

1541
02:21:44,296 --> 02:21:46,799 
He said he had some business.
He said give him a call...

1542
02:21:46,799 --> 02:21:48,801 
when the party started.

1543
02:21:48,801 --> 02:21:51,261 
Well, give him a call.

1544
02:21:52,095 --> 02:21:55,182 
- Johnny, how are you?
- Hello, Mike. Nice to see you again.

1545
02:21:55,307 --> 02:21:57,434 
- We're all proud of you.
- Thanks, Mike.

1546
02:21:57,476 --> 02:21:59,853 
Sit down, Johnny.
I want to talk to you.

1547
02:21:59,853 --> 02:22:04,274 
- The Don's proud of you, too, Johnny.
- Well, I, owe it all to him.

1548
02:22:04,399 --> 02:22:06,443 
Well, he knows
how grateful you are.

1549
02:22:06,443 --> 02:22:09,488 
That's why he'd like to ask
a favor of you.

1550
02:22:09,613 --> 02:22:12,116 
Mike, what can I do?

1551
02:22:12,908 --> 02:22:15,452 
The Corleone family is thinking
of giving up all its interests...

1552
02:22:15,494 --> 02:22:18,872 
in the olive oil business,
settling out here.

1553
02:22:18,997 --> 02:22:22,251 
Now, Moe Greene will sell us his
share of the casino and the hotel...

1554
02:22:22,334 --> 02:22:24,962 
so it can be completely owned
by the family. Tom?

1555
02:22:25,045 --> 02:22:27,339 
Hey, Mike, are you sure about that?

1556
02:22:27,339 --> 02:22:30,217 
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothin' to me about sellin'.

1557
02:22:30,342 --> 02:22:32,803 
Well, I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

1558
02:22:34,555 --> 02:22:36,974 
See, Johnny...

1559
02:22:37,015 --> 02:22:39,309 
see, we figure that entertainment
will be a big factor...

1560
02:22:39,309 --> 02:22:41,103 
in drawing gamblers to the casino.

1561
02:22:41,103 --> 02:22:44,398 
Now we hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1562
02:22:47,901 --> 02:22:51,155 
Perhaps convince some of
your friends in the movies...

1563
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:53,782 
to do the same.

1564
02:22:53,866 --> 02:22:56,326 
We're counting on you.

1565
02:22:57,953 --> 02:23:00,456 
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1566
02:23:00,581 --> 02:23:01,915 
You know that.

1567
02:23:01,915 --> 02:23:04,418 
Good.

1568
02:23:04,543 --> 02:23:06,795 
Hey, Mike.
Hello, fellas.

1569
02:23:06,795 --> 02:23:10,507 
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
Good to see you, Mike.

1570
02:23:10,591 --> 02:23:12,634 
- How are you, Moe?
- You got everything you want?

1571
02:23:12,634 --> 02:23:15,345 
The chef cooked for you special, the
dancers will kick your tongue out...

1572
02:23:15,429 --> 02:23:17,181 
and your credit is good.

1573
02:23:17,222 --> 02:23:19,850 
Draw chips for everybody in the room
so they can play on the house.

1574
02:23:23,395 --> 02:23:25,898 
My credit good enough
to buy you out?

1575
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:29,818 
Buy me out?

1576
02:23:29,818 --> 02:23:32,488 
The casino. The hotel.

1577
02:23:32,571 --> 02:23:35,365 
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1578
02:23:35,449 --> 02:23:38,327 
The Corleone family
wants to buy me out?

1579
02:23:38,410 --> 02:23:40,913 
No, I buy you out.
You don't buy me out.

1580
02:23:40,954 --> 02:23:44,208 
Your casino loses money.
Maybe we can do better.

1581
02:23:44,333 --> 02:23:46,835 
You think I'm skimming
off the top, Mike?

1582
02:23:47,628 --> 02:23:50,130 
You're unlucky.

1583
02:23:53,300 --> 02:23:55,761 
You goddamn guineas
really make me laugh.

1584
02:23:55,761 --> 02:23:58,597 
I do you a favor and take Freddy in
when you're having a bad time.

1585
02:23:58,722 --> 02:24:01,183 
- And then you try to push me out!
- Wait a minute.

1586
02:24:01,183 --> 02:24:03,769 
You took Freddy in because
the Corleone family...

1587
02:24:03,894 --> 02:24:06,396 
bankrolled your casino,
because the Molinari family...

1588
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:08,607 
on the coast guaranteed his safety.

1589
02:24:08,607 --> 02:24:10,692 
Now, we're talkin' business.
Let's talk business.

1590
02:24:10,692 --> 02:24:13,403 
Yeah, let's talk business, Mike.
First of all, you're all done.

1591
02:24:13,529 --> 02:24:15,989 
The Corleone family don't even have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1592
02:24:15,989 --> 02:24:18,492 
The Godfather's sick, right? You're
getting chased out of New York...

1593
02:24:18,534 --> 02:24:20,327 
by Barzini and the other families.

1594
02:24:20,327 --> 02:24:24,248 
What do you think is going on here? You think
you can come to my hotel and take over?

1595
02:24:24,331 --> 02:24:26,166 
I talked to Barzini.

1596
02:24:26,166 --> 02:24:29,419 
I can make a deal with him
and still keep my hotel.

1597
02:24:29,545 --> 02:24:32,131 
Is that why you slapped
my brother around in public?

1598
02:24:33,215 --> 02:24:34,925 
Oh, no, that was nothin', Mike.

1599
02:24:35,217 --> 02:24:37,761 
Now, now, Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.

1600
02:24:37,886 --> 02:24:40,389 
Sure he flies off the handle
once in a while...

1601
02:24:40,389 --> 02:24:42,516 
but Moe and me,
we're good friends, right, Moe, huh?

1602
02:24:42,516 --> 02:24:44,393 
I got a business to run.

1603
02:24:44,393 --> 02:24:47,104 
I gotta kick asses sometimes
to make it run right.

1604
02:24:47,229 --> 02:24:51,233 
We had a little argument, Freddy and I,
so I had to straighten him out.

1605
02:24:51,316 --> 02:24:53,944 
You straightened my brother out?

1606
02:24:54,027 --> 02:24:56,530 
He was banging cocktail waitresses
two at a time!

1607
02:24:56,530 --> 02:24:59,450 
Players couldn't get a drink at the table.
What's wrong with you?

1608
02:25:05,497 --> 02:25:08,959 
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1609
02:25:09,084 --> 02:25:10,794 
Son of a bitch.

1610
02:25:10,794 --> 02:25:13,797 
Do you know who I am?
I'm Moe Greene.

1611
02:25:13,922 --> 02:25:16,508 
I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders.

1612
02:25:16,633 --> 02:25:19,136 
Wait a minute, Moe.
Moe, I got an idea.

1613
02:25:20,137 --> 02:25:23,307 
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Now, you can talk to the Don.

1614
02:25:23,432 --> 02:25:25,434 
- You can explain...
- Just a minute.

1615
02:25:25,434 --> 02:25:29,021 
The Don is semiretired and Mike is
in charge of the family business now.

1616
02:25:29,146 --> 02:25:31,690 
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1617
02:25:36,570 --> 02:25:41,158 
Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1618
02:25:43,535 --> 02:25:48,248 
Fredo. You're my older brother,
and I love you.

1619
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:51,835 
But don't ever take sides
with anyone...

1620
02:25:51,835 --> 02:25:54,713 
against the family again...

1621
02:25:54,838 --> 02:25:57,341 
ever.

1622
02:26:04,139 --> 02:26:06,308 
I have to see my father
and his people.

1623
02:26:06,308 --> 02:26:08,811 
- So have dinner without me.
- Oh, Michael.

1624
02:26:10,312 --> 02:26:12,564 
This weekend we'll go out.
We'll go to the city.

1625
02:26:12,564 --> 02:26:15,067 
We'll see a show and we'll have dinner.
I promise.

1626
02:26:22,533 --> 02:26:25,410 
Oh, Michael. Michael, your sister wants
to ask you something.

1627
02:26:25,536 --> 02:26:27,663 
- Well, let her ask.
- No, she's afraid to.

1628
02:26:27,663 --> 02:26:30,874 
Connie and Carlo want you to be
godfather to their little boy.

1629
02:26:30,999 --> 02:26:32,876 
- Oh, we'll see.
- Will you?

1630
02:26:32,876 --> 02:26:35,379 
Let me think about it. We'll see.
Come on.

1631
02:26:41,969 --> 02:26:43,887 
So...

1632
02:26:43,929 --> 02:26:46,890 
Barzini will move against you first.

1633
02:26:46,974 --> 02:26:51,311 
He'll set up a meeting with
someone that you absolutely trust...

1634
02:26:51,436 --> 02:26:53,897 
guaranteeing your safety.

1635
02:26:54,773 --> 02:26:58,026 
And at that meeting,
you'll be assassinated.

1636
02:27:02,656 --> 02:27:05,868 
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.

1637
02:27:07,035 --> 02:27:09,204 
Anyway, I'm drinking more.

1638
02:27:09,204 --> 02:27:11,707 
It's good for you, Pop.

1639
02:27:15,627 --> 02:27:18,130 
I don't know.

1640
02:27:19,047 --> 02:27:21,550 
Your wife and children,
are you happy with them?

1641
02:27:22,968 --> 02:27:25,012 
Very happy.

1642
02:27:25,012 --> 02:27:27,556 
That's good.

1643
02:27:27,639 --> 02:27:29,933 
I hope you don't mind
the way I...

1644
02:27:29,933 --> 02:27:32,519 
I keep going over
this Barzini business.

1645
02:27:32,644 --> 02:27:34,688 
No, not at all.

1646
02:27:34,688 --> 02:27:37,065 
It's an old habit.

1647
02:27:37,065 --> 02:27:39,818 
I spent my life
tryin' not to be careless.

1648
02:27:41,695 --> 02:27:44,531 
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1649
02:27:48,410 --> 02:27:50,954 
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1650
02:27:51,079 --> 02:27:53,582 
You know, he looks
more like you every day.

1651
02:27:56,376 --> 02:27:58,629 
He's smarter than I am.

1652
02:27:58,670 --> 02:28:01,131 
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

1653
02:28:02,966 --> 02:28:05,469 
Reads the funny papers.

1654
02:28:12,184 --> 02:28:14,686 
I want you to arrange
to have a telephone man...

1655
02:28:14,686 --> 02:28:17,815 
check all the calls that go
in and out of here.

1656
02:28:17,940 --> 02:28:20,067 
- I did it already, Pop.
- Could be anyone.

1657
02:28:20,067 --> 02:28:23,612 
- Pop, I took care of that.
- Oh, that's right. I forgot.

1658
02:28:27,324 --> 02:28:29,701 
What's the matter?

1659
02:28:29,701 --> 02:28:32,204 
What's bothering you?

1660
02:28:34,998 --> 02:28:37,501 
I'll handle it.

1661
02:28:37,876 --> 02:28:40,379 
I told you I can handle it,
I'll handle it.

1662
02:28:53,433 --> 02:28:57,771 
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this...

1663
02:28:57,896 --> 02:28:59,773 
and Fredo...

1664
02:28:59,773 --> 02:29:02,234 
Well...

1665
02:29:02,234 --> 02:29:04,736 
Fredo was...

1666
02:29:06,280 --> 02:29:09,032 
But I never, I never wanted this for you.

1667
02:29:11,326 --> 02:29:14,163 
I worked my whole life...
I don't apologize...

1668
02:29:14,246 --> 02:29:16,415 
to take care of my family...

1669
02:29:16,415 --> 02:29:20,294 
and I refused to be a fool...

1670
02:29:20,419 --> 02:29:24,465 
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1671
02:29:26,592 --> 02:29:29,720 
I don't apologize. That's my life.
But I thought that...

1672
02:29:31,722 --> 02:29:34,308 
that when it was your time...

1673
02:29:34,433 --> 02:29:36,894 
that you would be the one
to hold the strings.

1674
02:29:38,770 --> 02:29:41,231 
Senator Corleone.

1675
02:29:42,232 --> 02:29:44,401 
Governor Corleone.
Something.

1676
02:29:44,401 --> 02:29:46,904 
Another pezzonovante.

1677
02:29:52,409 --> 02:29:56,246 
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1678
02:29:56,330 --> 02:29:58,916 
We'll get there, Pop.

1679
02:29:59,041 --> 02:30:01,543 
We'll get there.

1680
02:30:04,797 --> 02:30:09,134 
Now listen. Whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting...

1681
02:30:09,259 --> 02:30:11,011 
he's the traitor.

1682
02:30:11,011 --> 02:30:13,514 
Don't forget that.

1683
02:30:29,279 --> 02:30:31,782 
Put it over the tree.

1684
02:30:46,547 --> 02:30:49,007 
- Can I water these?
- Yeah.

1685
02:30:49,007 --> 02:30:50,592 
That's fine.

1686
02:30:50,592 --> 02:30:53,095 
Over here.
Over here.

1687
02:30:55,180 --> 02:30:57,683 
Be careful.
You're spilling it.

1688
02:31:04,022 --> 02:31:06,483 
Anthony, come here.

1689
02:31:11,905 --> 02:31:14,408 
Go ahead. That's right.
We'll put it right there.

1690
02:31:20,205 --> 02:31:22,708 
I'll show you something.
Come here.

1691
02:31:25,210 --> 02:31:27,713 
Now, you stand there.

1692
02:31:30,841 --> 02:31:33,343 
Give me an orange!

1693
02:31:50,903 --> 02:31:53,405 
That's a new trick.

1694
02:31:53,989 --> 02:31:56,533 
You run in there.
Run in there.

1695
02:32:09,171 --> 02:32:11,673 
- Where are you?
- Who?

1696
02:32:44,790 --> 02:32:47,292 
Ouch!

1697
02:35:08,851 --> 02:35:11,353 
Mike, can I have a minute?

1698
02:35:21,697 --> 02:35:24,158 
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1699
02:35:24,158 --> 02:35:26,660 
He says we can straighten
any of our problems out.

1700
02:35:28,328 --> 02:35:30,831 
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1701
02:35:31,748 --> 02:35:34,209 
I can arrange security...

1702
02:35:34,209 --> 02:35:36,712 
on my territory.

1703
02:35:38,630 --> 02:35:40,632 
All right?

1704
02:35:40,632 --> 02:35:43,469 
- All right.
- All right.

1705
02:35:58,776 --> 02:36:01,278 
Do you know how
they're gonna come at you?

1706
02:36:04,198 --> 02:36:06,617 
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn.

1707
02:36:06,658 --> 02:36:09,119 
Tessio's ground...

1708
02:36:09,995 --> 02:36:12,498 
where I'll be safe.

1709
02:36:24,051 --> 02:36:27,638 
I always thought it would've been
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1710
02:36:27,763 --> 02:36:30,140 
It's the smart move.

1711
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:32,643 
Tessio was always smarter.

1712
02:36:33,811 --> 02:36:36,146 
But I'm gonna wait.

1713
02:36:36,146 --> 02:36:38,649 
After the baptism.

1714
02:36:40,609 --> 02:36:43,153 
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1715
02:36:44,530 --> 02:36:47,449 
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini...

1716
02:36:47,533 --> 02:36:49,993 
and Tattaglia...

1717
02:36:49,993 --> 02:36:52,496 
all the heads
of the five families.

1718
02:37:19,022 --> 02:37:21,024 
Go forth from him, unclean spirit,

1719
02:37:21,233 --> 02:37:24,403 
and give place to the Holy Spirit,
the Spirit of God.

1720
02:37:26,405 --> 02:37:27,406 
Let us pray.

1721
02:37:27,406 --> 02:37:30,409 
Our prayers through through
Christ our Lord. So be it.

1722
02:37:31,034 --> 02:37:32,035 
Michael.

1723
02:37:32,035 --> 02:37:35,038 
Signed with the sign of the Lord's cross,

1724
02:37:36,039 --> 02:37:39,001 
so that, preserving this first experience
of the greatness of thy glory,

1725
02:37:39,042 --> 02:37:42,004 
he may deserve, by keeping
thy commandments,

1726
02:37:42,004 --> 02:37:45,007 
<i>to attain to the glory of regeneration.</i>

1727
02:37:45,007 --> 02:37:48,010 
<i>Through Christ our Lord. So be it.</i>

1728
02:37:48,010 --> 02:37:51,013 
<i>Let us pray.</i>
Almighty, everlasting God,

1729
02:37:51,013 --> 02:37:53,515 
<i>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i>

1730
02:37:53,515 --> 02:37:56,518 
<i>look graciously down upon this,</i>
thy servant, Michael.

1731
02:37:56,518 --> 02:37:59,521 
Who shall come to judge the living
and the dead,

1732
02:37:59,521 --> 02:38:02,524 
and the world by fire. So be it.

1733
02:38:02,524 --> 02:38:04,818 
Michael. Receive the salt of wisdom.

1734
02:38:04,818 --> 02:38:07,112 
Let it be to thee a token of mercy
unto everlasting life.

1735
02:38:07,112 --> 02:38:09,114 
May it make your way easy to eternal life.
So be it.

1736
02:38:09,114 --> 02:38:11,617 
May the almighty God, the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

1737
02:38:11,617 --> 02:38:14,119 
<i>Who hath regenerated thee by water</i>
and the Holy Spirit,

1738
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:17,623 
<i>and who hath given thee the</i>
remission of all thy sins,

1739
02:38:18,123 --> 02:38:21,627 
<i>may he, himself anoint thee with</i>
the Chrism of Salvation,

1740
02:38:21,627 --> 02:38:24,630 
<i>in the same Christ Jesus our Lord,</i>
unto life eternal. So be it.

1741
02:38:25,631 --> 02:38:28,926 
I annoint you with the oil of salvation
in Christ Jesus our Lord,

1742
02:38:29,259 --> 02:38:32,221 
that you may have everlasting life.
So be it.

1743
02:38:39,645 --> 02:38:42,648 
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,</i>
the Holy Catholic Church,

1744
02:38:42,648 --> 02:38:45,651 
<i>the communion of Saints,</i>
the forgiveness of sins,

1745
02:38:45,651 --> 02:38:49,154 
<i>the resurrection of the body</i>
and life everlasting? I do believe.

1746
02:38:50,155 --> 02:38:53,158 
I exorcise thee, unclean spirit,
in the name of the Father,

1747
02:38:53,158 --> 02:38:56,161 
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

1748
02:38:56,161 --> 02:39:00,165 
that thou goest out and depart from
this servant of God, Michael.

1749
02:39:00,165 --> 02:39:03,627 
For he commands thee, accursed one,

1750
02:39:05,462 --> 02:39:08,465 
Be opened, for an odor of sweetness.

1751
02:39:08,465 --> 02:39:11,468 
Be thou, devil, begone,

1752
02:39:11,468 --> 02:39:13,762 
for the judgment of God shall draw near.

1753
02:39:13,804 --> 02:39:16,682 
Michael, do you believe in God,
the Father almighty...

1754
02:39:16,807 --> 02:39:19,768 
- creator of Heaven and Earth?
- I do.

1755
02:39:19,852 --> 02:39:23,147 
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,</i>
his only Son, our Lord?

1756
02:39:23,272 --> 02:39:24,773 
<i>I do.</i>

1757
02:39:24,773 --> 02:39:28,944 
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,</i>
the Holy Catholic Church?

1758
02:39:28,944 --> 02:39:29,945 
<i>I do.</i>

1759
02:39:30,237 --> 02:39:34,158 
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,</i>
hallowed be thy name.

1760
02:39:34,158 --> 02:39:38,162 
<i>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,</i>
on earth as it is in heaven.

1761
02:39:38,162 --> 02:39:40,956 
<i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>

1762
02:39:40,956 --> 02:39:42,958 
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

1763
02:39:43,125 --> 02:39:46,253 
<i>as we forgive them that</i>
trespass against us.

1764
02:39:46,253 --> 02:39:49,256 
<i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>

1765
02:39:49,256 --> 02:39:51,258 
<i>but deliver us from evil.</i>
So be it.

1766
02:39:51,258 --> 02:39:52,759 
Michael.

1767
02:39:52,759 --> 02:39:55,762 
Enter thou into the temple of God,

1768
02:39:55,762 --> 02:39:58,724 
that thou mayest have part with Christ
unto life everlasting. So be it.

1769
02:39:58,724 --> 02:40:01,226 
I believe in God the Father almighty,

1770
02:40:01,226 --> 02:40:03,228 
Creator of heaven and earth,

1771
02:40:03,228 --> 02:40:06,732 
<i>and in Jesus Christ his only</i>
son our Lord,

1772
02:40:06,732 --> 02:40:09,067 
<i>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,</i>

1773
02:40:09,067 --> 02:40:11,028 
<i>born of the Virgin Mary,</i>

1774
02:40:11,069 --> 02:40:14,364 
<i>suffered under Pontius Pilate,</i>
was crucified, dead, and buried.

1775
02:40:14,364 --> 02:40:17,034 
<i>He descended into Hell.</i>
On the third day,

1776
02:40:17,034 --> 02:40:21,038 
<i>He rose again from the dead.</i>
He ascended into heaven,

1777
02:40:21,038 --> 02:40:23,832 
<i>and sitteth at the right hand of</i>
God the Father almighty,

1778
02:40:23,874 --> 02:40:26,335 
<i>from thence shall he come to judge</i>
the living and the dead.

1779
02:40:26,335 --> 02:40:29,338 
<i>I believe in the Holy Ghost,</i>
the Holy Catholic Church,

1780
02:40:29,338 --> 02:40:32,341 
<i>the communion of saints,</i>
the forgiveness of sins,

1781
02:40:32,341 --> 02:40:35,177 
<i>the resurrection of the body,</i>
and life everlasting. So be it.

1782
02:40:35,219 --> 02:40:40,182 
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1783
02:40:46,563 --> 02:40:49,066 
I do renounce him.

1784
02:40:57,407 --> 02:40:59,910 
And all his works?

1785
02:41:12,089 --> 02:41:14,591 
I do renounce them.

1786
02:41:19,471 --> 02:41:23,434 
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1787
02:41:38,824 --> 02:41:42,911 
Michael Rizzi,
will you be baptized?

1788
02:41:42,995 --> 02:41:44,997 
I will.

1789
02:41:44,997 --> 02:41:47,291 
In the name of the Father,

1790
02:41:47,291 --> 02:41:49,293 
<i>and of the Son,</i>

1791
02:41:49,293 --> 02:41:51,712 
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

1792
02:41:52,045 --> 02:41:54,590 
<i>Michael Rizzi, go in peace.</i>

1793
02:41:54,715 --> 02:41:57,759 
And may the Lord be with you.
So be it.

1794
02:42:39,843 --> 02:42:41,845 
- Carlo.
- What?

1795
02:42:41,845 --> 02:42:44,097 
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1796
02:42:44,097 --> 02:42:46,141 
Everybody's gonna have to leave
without us.

1797
02:42:46,141 --> 02:42:48,685 
- It's our first vacation together.
- Connie, please.

1798
02:42:48,811 --> 02:42:50,813 
- What do you wanna do?
- Go back to the house.

1799
02:42:50,813 --> 02:42:53,690 
Wait for my call.
It's important.

1800
02:42:53,774 --> 02:42:56,276 
I'll only be a couple of days.

1801
02:42:58,695 --> 02:43:01,198 
Have a nice trip, Mama.

1802
02:43:12,209 --> 02:43:14,711 
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1803
02:43:16,547 --> 02:43:18,966 
I hope Mike can get us
a good deal tonight.

1804
02:43:18,966 --> 02:43:21,468 
I'm sure he will.

1805
02:43:28,225 --> 02:43:31,228 
Sal, Tom, the boss says
he'll come in a separate car.

1806
02:43:31,353 --> 02:43:33,564 
He says for you two
to go on ahead.

1807
02:43:33,564 --> 02:43:36,191 
Hell, he can't do that.
It screws up all my arrangements.

1808
02:43:36,275 --> 02:43:38,777 
- Well that's what he said.
- I can't go either, Sal.

1809
02:43:51,415 --> 02:43:54,168 
Tell Mike it was only business.

1810
02:43:54,251 --> 02:43:56,753 
I always liked him.

1811
02:43:56,920 --> 02:43:59,423 
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1812
02:44:05,846 --> 02:44:08,348 
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1813
02:44:09,433 --> 02:44:12,144 
- For old times' sake.
- Can't do it, Sally.

1814
02:44:58,107 --> 02:45:00,609 
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.

1815
02:45:05,489 --> 02:45:07,324 
Mike, you got it all wrong.

1816
02:45:07,324 --> 02:45:09,827 
You fingered Sonny
for the Barzini people.

1817
02:45:11,453 --> 02:45:14,498 
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1818
02:45:14,623 --> 02:45:16,625 
Did you think that could fool
a Corleone?

1819
02:45:16,625 --> 02:45:19,795 
Mike, I'm innocent.
I swear on the kids.

1820
02:45:19,878 --> 02:45:22,381 
- Please, don't do this to me.
- Sit down.

1821
02:45:25,509 --> 02:45:28,011 
Don't do this to me, please.

1822
02:45:36,895 --> 02:45:39,398 
Barzini's dead.

1823
02:45:40,566 --> 02:45:43,068 
So is Phillip Tattaglia...

1824
02:45:44,278 --> 02:45:46,780 
Moe Greene...

1825
02:45:46,780 --> 02:45:49,283 
Stracci...

1826
02:45:49,867 --> 02:45:52,369 
Cuneo.

1827
02:45:52,411 --> 02:45:55,914 
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1828
02:45:57,791 --> 02:46:00,294 
Admit what you did.

1829
02:46:03,422 --> 02:46:05,924 
Get him a drink.

1830
02:46:11,555 --> 02:46:14,016 
Come on.

1831
02:46:14,016 --> 02:46:16,393 
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1832
02:46:16,393 --> 02:46:18,896 
Come on. You think I'd make my sister
a widow?

1833
02:46:20,564 --> 02:46:23,066 
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1834
02:46:30,199 --> 02:46:31,533 
Go ahead, drink.

1835
02:46:31,533 --> 02:46:34,036 
Drink.

1836
02:46:37,080 --> 02:46:39,249 
Now, Carlo, you're out
of the family business.

1837
02:46:39,249 --> 02:46:42,920 
That's your punishment.
You're finished.

1838
02:46:43,045 --> 02:46:45,547 
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1839
02:46:51,762 --> 02:46:55,182 
I want you to stay there.
Understand?

1840
02:46:55,265 --> 02:46:57,768 
Only don't tell me
you're innocent...

1841
02:46:59,353 --> 02:47:02,314 
because it insults my intelligence.

1842
02:47:02,439 --> 02:47:04,942 
It makes me very angry.

1843
02:47:07,820 --> 02:47:11,073 
Now, who approached you?

1844
02:47:11,156 --> 02:47:13,659 
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1845
02:47:20,791 --> 02:47:23,293 
It was Barzini.

1846
02:47:25,754 --> 02:47:28,257 
Good.

1847
02:47:34,888 --> 02:47:37,558 
There's a car waiting for you
outside to take you to the airport.

1848
02:47:38,976 --> 02:47:41,478 
I'll call your wife,
tell her what flight you're on.

1849
02:47:47,109 --> 02:47:49,611 
- Please, can I...
- Get out of my sight.

1850
02:48:15,053 --> 02:48:17,556 
Hello, Carlo.

1851
02:49:14,071 --> 02:49:16,907 
Will you stop crying?
What are you trying to tell me?

1852
02:49:16,990 --> 02:49:19,785 
- I'm trying to tell you you're wrong.
- Mama, please!

1853
02:49:28,210 --> 02:49:30,212 
Michael! Michael!

1854
02:49:30,712 --> 02:49:33,215 
Where is he?

1855
02:49:35,092 --> 02:49:40,139 
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband!

1856
02:49:40,264 --> 02:49:42,850 
You waited until Papa died
so nobody could stop you...

1857
02:49:42,933 --> 02:49:44,476 
and then you killed him!

1858
02:49:44,476 --> 02:49:47,604 
You blamed him for Sonny.
You always did. Everybody did.

1859
02:49:47,729 --> 02:49:51,358 
But you never thought about me!
You never gave a damn about me!

1860
02:49:51,442 --> 02:49:53,944 
Now what am I gonna do?

1861
02:49:57,656 --> 02:50:00,159 
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the mall?

1862
02:50:00,242 --> 02:50:02,786 
All the time he knew
he was gonna kill him.

1863
02:50:02,911 --> 02:50:05,998 
And you stood godfather
to our baby.

1864
02:50:06,123 --> 02:50:08,459 
You lousy, coldhearted bastard.

1865
02:50:08,459 --> 02:50:10,961 
Want to know how many men
he had killed with Carlo?

1866
02:50:10,961 --> 02:50:12,754 
Read the papers!
Read the papers!

1867
02:50:12,754 --> 02:50:15,257 
That's your husband!
That's your husband!

1868
02:50:28,812 --> 02:50:31,315 
Take her upstairs.

1869
02:50:31,356 --> 02:50:33,859 
- Get her a doctor.
- Oh, God!

1870
02:50:53,921 --> 02:50:56,423 
She's hysterical.

1871
02:51:00,344 --> 02:51:02,846 
Hysterical.

1872
02:51:03,847 --> 02:51:06,350 
Michael, is it true?

1873
02:51:07,810 --> 02:51:09,853 
Don't ask me about my business, Kay.

1874
02:51:09,853 --> 02:51:13,357 
- Is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business.

1875
02:51:13,482 --> 02:51:15,984 
- No.
- Enough!

1876
02:51:34,378 --> 02:51:36,880 
All right.

1877
02:51:38,674 --> 02:51:41,176 
This one time.

1878
02:51:44,388 --> 02:51:46,890 
This one time, I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1879
02:51:53,397 --> 02:51:55,899 
Is it true?

1880
02:51:59,528 --> 02:52:02,030 
Is it?

1881
02:52:02,322 --> 02:52:03,824 
No.

1882
02:52:17,546 --> 02:52:19,923 
I guess we both need a drink, huh?

1883
02:52:19,923 --> 02:52:22,426 
Come on.

1884
02:52:51,997 --> 02:52:54,500 
Don Corleone.
