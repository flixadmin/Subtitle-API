1
00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:23,445
Citizens of Colombia,

2
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:28,784
we present your new president,
Pablo Escobar!

3
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,873
PABLO ESCOBAR, PRESIDENT

4
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:38,627
Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

5
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:41,755
Thank you.

6
00:00:42,506 --> 00:00:44,383
How are you, sir?

7
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:52,724
Thank you.

8
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:57,312
Thank you.

9
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,151
Much appreciated.

10
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:08,907
Thank you.

11
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:11,410
Please come in, Mr President.

12
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:38,353
- All yours.
- Thank you.

13
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:47,904
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

14
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:51,950
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>
- What's this?

15
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:55,329
<i>Happy birthday, dear Pablo</i>

16
00:01:56,204 --> 00:01:59,583
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

17
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,211
<i>Bravo, Pablito.</i>

18
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:06,590
<i>I love you, son.
Don't eat the whole cake.</i>

19
00:02:06,715 --> 00:02:08,675
<i>Don't forget
to blow out the candles, Dad.</i>

20
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:12,846
<i>Happy birthday, Daddy!</i>

21
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:16,683
<i>Pablo, we miss you so much.</i>

22
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:18,852
<i>We wish we could be there with you.</i>

23
00:02:18,977 --> 00:02:20,646
<i>I know, my love.</i>

24
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:24,691
<i>Soon this will all be behind us.</i>

25
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:27,611
<i>I promise.</i>

26
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:30,455
Good morning, boss.

27
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,124
I made some eggs.

28
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,628
- There's leftover cake.
- Yes, sir.

29
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:39,005
Thanks.

30
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:44,010
I got everything we need, boss.

31
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:47,347
You went to a different store, correct?

32
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:50,058
Yes, sir.
I go to a different one every time.

33
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:56,940
So, the shopkeeper's mum,
she's a healer.

34
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:00,860
I paid her a visit.

35
00:08:02,237 --> 00:08:05,782
I told you not to talk to anybody.

36
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,201
Yeah, boss, but...

37
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:15,250
only thing is, since I was a kid,
I've believed in these things.

38
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,253
Look...

39
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:22,465
I asked her for something to protect you.

40
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,469
The sword of St. Michael the archangel...

41
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:29,097
- the Virgin...
- ...and the Holy Child of Atocha.

42
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:38,440
You know my mother and I built a church?

43
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:41,359
Yes, sir.

44
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:45,697
In Barrio Pablo Escobar.
That's where I grew up, boss.

45
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:49,701
Happy birthday, sir.

46
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:52,245
Thank you, Limón.

47
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:55,582
Pardon me.

48
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,590
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

49
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:07,594
<i>Happy birthday dear Pablo</i>

50
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:09,637
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

51
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:15,226
Casablanca neighbourhood,
to be exact.

52
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:22,859
If he does, we'll be listening.

53
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:44,589
This stays between us, understood?

54
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:51,012
We will set up a temporary base
in Casablanca.

55
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:55,225
We need to act as quickly as possible
as soon as Escobar appears, understood?

56
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,185
- Yes, Colonel.
- Good work.

57
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:03,691
Lieutenant Martinez?

58
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:07,487
How long since we heard anything
from Escobar?

59
00:10:07,612 --> 00:10:09,906
A month? A month and a half?

60
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:12,075
A month and a half, sir.

61
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,495
And that whole time you've been
in the van listening to static?

62
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:19,290
Yes. Waiting.

63
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,752
Stubbornness seems to run in my family.

64
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:24,671
It's in our blood.

65
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:29,342
Excuse me.

66
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:36,641
Six.

67
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:51,072
Can you imagine what would happen
if cocaine were legal?

68
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:54,701
It's your turn.

69
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:59,330
I think if coke was legal, boss,

70
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:04,169
you would be the boss of the world
and the cops couldn't touch you.

71
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:16,431
Yes, sir.

72
00:11:17,098 --> 00:11:20,685
We're sure that the call came from the
Casablanca neighbourhood in Medellin.

73
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,229
This is the best intel
we've received in months.

74
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:27,066
Don't underestimate him.
We've made that mistake in the past.

75
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:30,236
Gentlemen, I want to be loud and clear.

76
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:32,989
If your men are able to find Escobar...

77
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:36,409
I don't care about the consequences.

78
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:40,330
I want him dead.

79
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:43,917
Do you have a problem with that?

80
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:51,966
With all due respect, Mr President,
if he resists, that's how it will go.

81
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:54,260
Otherwise, we're going to capture him.

82
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:57,096
Keep me informed.

83
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,976
Gentlemen.

84
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:39,764
Mrs Escobar?

85
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,849
The attorney general called this morning.

86
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:44,727
He's decided to end
your protective custody.

87
00:12:45,687 --> 00:12:48,898
So we have to leave by the weekend.

88
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,527
No. No, you can't do this to us.

89
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:55,989
They were waiting for your husband
to turn himself in, and he never did.

90
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:04,080
Ma'am? Ma'am.

91
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,874
May I give you some advice?

92
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:14,424
I think it's time for you to think
about you and your children's safety.

93
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:16,384
Forget about him.

94
00:13:37,488 --> 00:13:40,950
<i>The kids miss you.
Should I wake up Juan Pablo?</i>

95
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:46,289
<i>Probably not a good idea
right now, my love.</i>

96
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:50,543
<i>So... do you feel
a year older or what?</i>

97
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:54,797
More like four or five.

98
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:58,009
We've missed you very much, Pablo.

99
00:13:58,134 --> 00:13:59,844
The days feel longer.

100
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:04,307
For me too.

101
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,853
I still don't understand
why you're in Medellin.

102
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:11,105
That place is too dangerous, my love.

103
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:18,654
That's exactly why.
No one would think I'd be here.

104
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:22,992
Pablo...

105
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:26,788
<i>I think the time has come.
We don't have a choice.</i>

106
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,793
Turning yourself in
isn't the end of the world, my love.

107
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,169
You can survive prison.

108
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:39,384
We both know that won't happen.

109
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:41,844
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Shh!

110
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:45,306
- <i>Listen to me, Pablo...</i>
- They're talking.

111
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:47,934
- <i>You will always be Pablo Escobar.</i>
- Boss.

112
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:51,270
<i>You will always be that man
that's admired and followed.</i>

113
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:53,689
My man.

114
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:56,401
<i>My love, there's a lot of journalists
who want to speak with you.</i>

115
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:58,319
<i>The people love you and follow you.</i>

116
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:01,447
<i>Tata, Limón wants me off.</i>

117
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:04,617
It's Escobar. Let's go west!
Fix the position, Morales.

118
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:08,704
My love, look at Nelson Mandela.

119
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:13,418
<i>They put the man in jail,
but the people still believed in him.</i>

120
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:15,420
<i>They gave him the Nobel Prize.</i>

121
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:19,298
They say he may even
become president.

122
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:22,427
<i>President, Pablo.
Of the same country that imprisoned him.</i>

123
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:24,512
<i>I need to hang up.
We'll talk about this later.</i>

124
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:26,264
Alvaro, stop.
Stop for a second.

125
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:29,142
<i>All right, Pablo.
But think about what I'm saying.</i>

126
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:31,102
<i>It's very important.</i>

127
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:34,188
<i>It's our only way out really.</i>

128
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:37,567
Alvaro, let's go slowly.

129
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:39,777
Colonel! Colonel,
this is Lieutenant Martinez.

130
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:42,780
<i>Think about turning yourself in, my love.
Think of your family.</i>

131
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:45,074
I'll think about it.

132
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,452
All right?

133
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:51,080
<i>I love you very much.</i>

134
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:24,906
Where are you going?

135
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:26,365
To Medellin.

136
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:30,953
What? No, no, no, Hermilda.
You can't leave.

137
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:33,831
My son needs me.

138
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:36,417
How so?

139
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:38,628
What you want...

140
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:43,174
for him to turn himself in
to those monsters...

141
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:44,967
I don't want them to kill him.

142
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:47,220
They're going to kill him either way,
and you know that.

143
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:48,888
They won't if he turns himself in.

144
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:51,849
- It's a trap! Tata, my God!
- Lower your voice.

145
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:53,768
No! No, ma'am.

146
00:16:53,893 --> 00:17:00,274
I will not stay quiet when...
when I see you... betraying my son!

147
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,278
I have never betrayed Pablo.
Let's make that very clear.

148
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:08,074
We're locked in this hotel
as if it were a jail.

149
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,243
We can't even leave the country.

150
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:16,249
And the only shot I have
at getting my children out of this alive...

151
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,252
is for Pablo to turn himself in.

152
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:27,635
My son...

153
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:31,222
needs his mother.

154
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:40,565
Hermilda.

155
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:52,201
Please be very careful. Please.

156
00:17:53,661 --> 00:17:55,538
Tell the children...

157
00:17:58,124 --> 00:17:59,875
I'll tell them.

158
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:20,563
We have intel
that Escobar is in this building.

159
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:25,151
Listen up. I want you to do
what you can to get him alive.

160
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,571
Escobar must be brought to justice
before the people of Colombia

161
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:32,658
and answer for the atrocious crimes
he has committed against this nation.

162
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:36,912
Now, if he resists...

163
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:40,750
if a single one of our men
is in harm's way...

164
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:43,336
I want you to take his life. Understood?

165
00:18:43,461 --> 00:18:45,212
- Yes, Colonel!
- Let's go.

166
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:35,721
Everything all right, boss?

167
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:59,203
Tata wants me to surrender.

168
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:06,293
She said
I can be like Nelson Mandela.

169
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:08,587
Nelson Mandela?

170
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:14,760
Who's that, boss?

171
00:21:05,603 --> 00:21:07,271
Did you buy more rolling papers?

172
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:09,482
Sorry, no, boss.

173
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:47,269
I can't think with that
fucking smell of Chinese food in here.

174
00:22:08,624 --> 00:22:10,501
<i>He's not here.</i>

175
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,759
Come inside.
You can't risk being seen, sir.

176
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:23,931
This is my city, Limón.

177
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:29,728
These are my people.

178
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:36,360
Medellin will never betray me.

179
00:22:42,116 --> 00:22:43,158
Colonel.

180
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:45,661
- We fucked up again, sir.
- He's not here.

181
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:48,581
Looks like your little machine is broken.

182
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:50,708
Go and fiddle with the little knob.
Go on.

183
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:54,128
Excuse me, Colonel.

184
00:22:57,756 --> 00:22:58,966
Listen up!

185
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:01,927
Take down the staging area
and head back to Holguin.

186
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:16,150
The son of a bitch wasn't talking
from this building, but he was close.

187
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:24,116
- A ghost.
- What's that?

188
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:28,662
That's what you call a signal that's been
reflected and appears somewhere else.

189
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:31,790
That's what happened with Escobar's
signal. It bounced off the water.

190
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:40,674
I'm going to get the rolling papers
and clear my head.

191
00:23:41,842 --> 00:23:43,510
Give me the keys!

192
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:46,430
- If you want, I'll go.
- Where are the sunglasses?

193
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:19,625
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, how are you?

194
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,211
Can I have a strawberry with cream,
please?

195
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,505
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

196
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:43,899
- Thank you. How much do I owe you?
- Just two thousand pesos.

197
00:26:47,027 --> 00:26:49,822
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

198
00:26:56,662 --> 00:27:00,374
- Hello. Give me a juice, please.
- Hello, how are you? My pleasure.

199
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,043
Sir.

200
00:27:04,086 --> 00:27:06,338
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

201
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:06,690
- Kick it here!
- There you go.

202
00:28:07,524 --> 00:28:09,693
Yeah!

203
00:28:40,224 --> 00:28:43,769
You'd have to be really stupid
or have a lot of balls

204
00:28:43,894 --> 00:28:46,104
to sit here as if nothing's happening.

205
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,817
They're offering seven million dollars
for you head,

206
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:53,403
and you're sitting here
like a fucking tourist.

207
00:28:56,698 --> 00:28:58,951
You look just like Che Guevara.

208
00:28:59,076 --> 00:29:00,953
What's beautiful is always beautiful.

209
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,830
You look like you ate Che Guevara.

210
00:29:12,965 --> 00:29:15,008
What? You don't miss me or what?

211
00:29:18,845 --> 00:29:21,306
Yesterday, I turned 44 years old.

212
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:24,559
Son of a bitch, you're old, Pablo.

213
00:29:25,227 --> 00:29:27,104
Thank you, Gustavo.

214
00:29:29,773 --> 00:29:34,111
Did you know that Julius Caesar
invaded Britain when he was 44?

215
00:29:34,778 --> 00:29:38,282
He lost power many times,
but always got it back.

216
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:39,950
Never letting anything stop him.

217
00:29:41,076 --> 00:29:44,538
Yeah, but that motherfucker
had a fucking army.

218
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:47,791
You remember when we used to
talk about going to the jungle

219
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,418
if shit got too heavy?

220
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:52,796
Yeah, and joining the guerrillas.

221
00:29:55,716 --> 00:29:57,634
Tata wants me to surrender.

222
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:04,016
Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.
She loves you very much.

223
00:30:04,641 --> 00:30:06,059
Maybe it's a good idea.

224
00:30:08,562 --> 00:30:12,899
You surrender, go to jail
and take the time to rest, think,

225
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:17,279
to restructure the business,
and escape whenever you want.

226
00:30:17,404 --> 00:30:19,323
The legend grows.

227
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:22,117
- She said the same thing.
- Yeah.

228
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:28,040
We both know that things aren't
going to be as easy as before, cousin.

229
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:32,794
Let's cut the bullshit.

230
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:37,591
We are bandits, Pablo.

231
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:39,968
Right?

232
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,642
What do you think?

233
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:52,356
I think...

234
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:58,945
that everything started to fall apart
the day you left.

235
00:31:03,658 --> 00:31:05,619
So you do miss me, you son of a bitch.

236
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,382
Every fucking day of my life, brother.

237
00:32:39,921 --> 00:32:42,674
Boss? Don't do that again, sir.

238
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,510
- I was worried. It's dangerous.
- Look...

239
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:51,183
It worked perfectly.

240
00:32:57,147 --> 00:32:59,566
You're a good man, Limón.

241
00:33:02,652 --> 00:33:04,237
Thank you.

242
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:07,365
Thanks a lot.

243
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:10,744
- Are we going to eat the pasta or what?
- Yes, sir.

244
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:14,456
- Put salt on it, pussy.
- Yes, boss. Whatever you say.

245
00:33:14,581 --> 00:33:16,166
I'm hungry.

246
00:33:19,002 --> 00:33:20,420
<i>Tata?</i>

247
00:33:24,466 --> 00:33:25,550
Pablo?

248
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:28,303
<i>There's the love of my life.</i>

249
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:33,016
- You sound different.
<i>- I'm good, my love.</i>

250
00:33:34,017 --> 00:33:35,810
I feel good.

251
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:40,482
And ready to talk to those reporters.

252
00:33:42,526 --> 00:33:44,069
Good, my love.

253
00:33:44,194 --> 00:33:46,238
Does that mean
you're turning yourself in?

254
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:51,243
No, Tata.

255
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:54,371
I'll never surrender.</i>

256
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:00,210
We won't be under protection, Pablo.

257
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:03,296
You have to.

258
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:09,386
I'll never surrender, my love.

259
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:25,944
I know, Pablo.

260
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:29,864
But what's your plan?

261
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:34,995
All right.

262
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,038
I know what we're going to do.

263
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:43,169
We will talk to all of those
foreign journalists.

264
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:45,255
<i>That's what we are going to do.</i>

265
00:34:50,844 --> 00:34:53,680
- <i>...foreign journalists...</i>
- Alvaro, slow down!

266
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:56,516
<i>...so the world will know
what these bastards are doing...</i>

267
00:34:56,641 --> 00:34:59,352
- It must be around here, Morales.
- You sure?

268
00:35:03,189 --> 00:35:05,567
<i>We will make the international press
put pressure</i>

269
00:35:05,692 --> 00:35:07,485
<i>on the Colombian government.</i>

270
00:35:08,903 --> 00:35:12,949
And listen, we will succeed, Tata.

271
00:35:13,074 --> 00:35:16,745
We will succeed.
We will fight and we will succeed.

272
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,955
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

273
00:35:19,748 --> 00:35:22,751
<i>- We will succeed.</i>
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!

274
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:29,382
<i>As soon as we do that,
I'll go to the jungle, join the guerrillas...</i>

275
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:31,384
Son of a bitch, it's Escobar.

276
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:34,721
We have to get you and the kids
out of the country.

277
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:37,015
And listen...

278
00:35:37,724 --> 00:35:42,312
I will not rest until that happens.

279
00:35:42,437 --> 00:35:45,815
Alvaro, drive slowly. Park up ahead.

280
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:51,613
<i>I only have one notebook.
Let me go get it.</i>

281
00:35:56,242 --> 00:35:58,286
The helicopters are triangulating
that area, correct?

282
00:35:58,411 --> 00:35:59,829
Yes, Colonel, just in this area.

283
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:01,247
- Very well.
- Excuse me, Colonel.

284
00:36:01,373 --> 00:36:04,042
Lieutenant Martinez is on channel four.

285
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:08,296
All right, excuse me. Thank you.

286
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:11,633
<i>Go ahead, Lieutenant.</i>

287
00:36:11,758 --> 00:36:13,134
Colonel, I found him.

288
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:15,136
<i>Who? Escobar?</i>

289
00:36:16,304 --> 00:36:17,639
Yes, Colonel.

290
00:36:17,764 --> 00:36:19,349
<i>He's in Los Olivos.</i>

291
00:36:21,476 --> 00:36:25,897
Son, are you sure? We can't afford
the luxury of making another mistake.

292
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:29,192
I'm sure. I saw him.

293
00:36:30,902 --> 00:36:32,696
What do you mean you saw him?

294
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,908
<i>Yes, he looked out a window.
He's got a beard now, but it's him.</i>

295
00:36:38,243 --> 00:36:39,828
And did he see you?

296
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:42,872
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

297
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,418
Listen up, Lieutenant.

298
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:49,003
<i>There's still some men
in the staging area.</i>

299
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:52,716
<i>I need you to wait until they get to you.
Understood?</i>

300
00:36:53,425 --> 00:36:54,926
Copy that, Colonel.

301
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:57,929
One more thing. Be safe.
Over and out.

302
00:37:00,432 --> 00:37:02,559
- Fix the position.
- Right away.

303
00:37:04,853 --> 00:37:05,895
Hello, Dad.

304
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:08,398
How's it going, son?

305
00:37:09,482 --> 00:37:11,359
You wanted to ask me something
or what?

306
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:13,153
Yes, sir.

307
00:37:13,278 --> 00:37:15,196
What wish did you make
for your birthday?

308
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:18,783
If I tell you, it won't come true. Right?

309
00:37:19,576 --> 00:37:22,036
<i>Tell me! Don't be like that!</i>

310
00:37:22,162 --> 00:37:24,372
Well, the only thing that I can tell you

311
00:37:24,497 --> 00:37:27,834
<i>- is that it was a very good wish.</i>
- You know,

312
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:30,670
<i>you deserve the best birthday
in the world.</i>

313
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,350
Thank you, my love.

314
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:48,688
Captain.

315
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:51,399
- <i>Captain, can you hear me?</i>
- Yes, Colonel?

316
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:53,860
<i>How many men are left
in the provisional base?</i>

317
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:56,780
- Counting me, about 12.
<i>- Listen up.</i>

318
00:37:57,947 --> 00:38:01,743
- Lieutenant Martinez found Escobar.
<i>- Shit! Let's go!</i>

319
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:04,329
Everybody to Los Olivos!

320
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:06,039
<i>Hello.</i>

321
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:10,418
Hello, my little princess.
How's my little girl?

322
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:11,544
Good.

323
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:15,423
I've got your little rabbit here.
He's getting very fat.

324
00:38:26,184 --> 00:38:27,519
Perez!

325
00:38:27,644 --> 00:38:31,356
Attention! Two groups. Captain, Sergeant
in the back, and I'll take the front.

326
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,402
Get your mum on the phone, OK?

327
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:39,155
Pablo.

328
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,616
<i>- Do you have the questions?</i>
- Yes, my love, I've got them here.

329
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,744
<i>The first one
is from a Spanish journalist.</i>

330
00:38:45,995 --> 00:38:49,374
<i>"How do you fee! after
all these days on the run?“</i>

331
00:38:51,334 --> 00:38:52,961
Write this down.

332
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:57,006
It's been very hard
being far from my family,

333
00:38:57,131 --> 00:39:00,009
who I love more than anything
in the world.

334
00:39:00,134 --> 00:39:03,513
- Sergeant, go around.
- But I feel good.

335
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:05,139
I feel strong.

336
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:10,061
And I have the will to fight
all of these injustices.

337
00:39:11,145 --> 00:39:14,774
The government has made a mockery
of our rights.

338
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:21,823
It's allowed our justice system
to become corrupted by murderers.

339
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:26,619
The people of Colombia deserve
much better than that.

340
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:34,502
The government
is holding my family hostage.

341
00:39:35,128 --> 00:39:38,339
That's a crime against human rights
committed by a government

342
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:41,551
<i>that calls itself democratic.</i>

343
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:45,221
My little kids are innocent children

344
00:39:45,346 --> 00:39:49,684
that have nothing to do
with their father's problems.

345
00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:58,443
All we want from the government

346
00:39:58,568 --> 00:40:01,446
is that they bring those killers,
Los PEPES, to justice.

347
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:07,660
But above else, that they allow my family
to leave the country immediately.

348
00:40:07,785 --> 00:40:09,954
Without that...

349
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:14,459
One moment.

350
00:40:14,584 --> 00:40:16,336
What happened, Pablo?

351
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,259
Something strange is happening here.
I'll call you back.

352
00:40:24,052 --> 00:40:25,887
Pablo. Pablo.

353
00:40:26,012 --> 00:40:29,140
<i>Pablo. Pablo, don't hang up.</i>

354
00:40:29,766 --> 00:40:31,184
<i>Pablo, what's going on?</i>

355
00:40:32,977 --> 00:40:34,479
What's wrong, Mum?

356
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:40,610
Go on. All right.

357
00:40:49,118 --> 00:40:50,244
Go! Go!

358
00:40:51,663 --> 00:40:52,705
Let's go!

359
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:59,128
Let's go! Come on! Come on!

360
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:00,380
Come on!

361
00:41:00,964 --> 00:41:02,340
Come on! Move, move, move!

362
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:12,266
Go, go, go!

363
00:41:20,608 --> 00:41:21,859
Move!

364
00:41:22,443 --> 00:41:23,486
Go!

365
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:25,321
Keep going!

366
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,484
Nobody shoot! Nobody shoot!

367
00:42:28,718 --> 00:42:30,428
Sergeant Sarmiento!

368
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:33,639
You just shot Pablo Escobar!

369
00:42:33,765 --> 00:42:35,183
Is he alive?

370
00:43:16,224 --> 00:43:17,850
Long live Colombia.

371
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:20,394
- Long live Colombia!
- Long live!

372
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,438
We killed Pablo Escobar!

373
00:43:22,563 --> 00:43:25,358
- Long live! Long live!
- Long live Colombia!

374
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:28,820
- Long live Colombia!
- Long live Colombia!

375
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:53,010
Go ahead.

376
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:01,644
They killed Pablo Escobar!

377
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:32,985
My son! My son...

378
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,343
I pray to God that other mothers

379
00:46:39,468 --> 00:46:43,514
don't have to experience
the pain that I'm feeling.

380
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:46,475
And I know my son wasn't as bad
as they made him out to be.

381
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,603
I know that they blamed him
for anything bad that happened.

382
00:46:49,729 --> 00:46:51,814
I want the good things he did
to be remembered,

383
00:46:51,939 --> 00:46:54,191
because he didn't do the bad things
they say he did.

384
00:46:54,317 --> 00:46:57,445
He built playing fields.
He built a neighbourhood for the poor.

385
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,488
No one has paid attention to that.

386
00:46:59,613 --> 00:47:03,701
As a son,
there will never be anyone better.

387
00:47:03,826 --> 00:47:07,455
He was the noblest of men.
Not just as a son...

388
00:47:36,192 --> 00:47:39,403
Sit down, ma'am. Sit.

389
00:47:39,528 --> 00:47:40,905
Thank you.

390
00:47:47,703 --> 00:47:49,330
Talk to me.

391
00:47:51,832 --> 00:47:54,502
Before he died,
my husband told me to find you.

392
00:47:56,212 --> 00:47:57,838
He told you that?

393
00:48:00,674 --> 00:48:04,053
He told me that despite the fact
that you became enemies,

394
00:48:04,178 --> 00:48:06,180
you were once associates and friends.

395
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:15,231
You were saying?

396
00:48:16,899 --> 00:48:19,568
He told me that
you were a decent man.

397
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:22,238
That you would
understand the situation.

398
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:25,574
That you would forgive us.

399
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:29,078
And that you might help us
get out of the country.

400
00:48:31,831 --> 00:48:34,708
How much do you have left,
Mrs Escobar?

401
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:37,420
In property? In cash?

402
00:48:42,216 --> 00:48:43,426
I can find out.

403
00:48:47,304 --> 00:48:49,306
That's good.

404
00:48:49,432 --> 00:48:51,642
Because I want all of it.

405
00:50:01,837 --> 00:50:03,923
All right, gentlemen!

406
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:05,591
Gentlemen!

407
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:11,222
In the history of every business,
there are decisive moments.

408
00:50:19,772 --> 00:50:24,944
The first sale. The first million.
The first billion.

409
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:28,948
And when your rival no longer exists.

410
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:47,216
The important thing
in these moments isn't how one reacts,

411
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:49,635
but how well one has prepared for them.

412
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,056
Gentlemen, I have to tell you
that we are ready.

413
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:01,939
And we won't be needing
kidnappings and bombs to succeed.

414
00:51:02,064 --> 00:51:05,317
We will do it covertly.

415
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:08,195
And when they turn around
to see what happened,

416
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,613
we'll no longer be there.

417
00:51:09,738 --> 00:51:11,448
No, sir!

418
00:51:11,574 --> 00:51:13,867
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
