An eternal life...

00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,597
With integrating sixth sense...

8
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:19,535
lt's an experiment to generate
seventh sense...

9
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:24,534
New man, come down to earth...

17
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:37,071


18
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,981
Doctor, you got a courier.

Switch on the processor.

24
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,363
Good, move like that only.

25
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,610
Bloody black beetle!

26
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,885
You needed this!

27
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:31,235
He's kicking now like a fetus,
how will he kick once completed?

28
00:04:32,472 --> 00:05:04,159


29
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,267
Up!

30
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:08,430

31
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,776

34
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,117
- Coffee.

35
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,720
Aluminium box, get me
a strong filter coffee.

36
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,292
No coffee to grade 2, take water.

37
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,953
- How about grade 3 then junk box?
- Sorry. Self service.

38
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,290
Humans have no respect in this lab.

39
00:05:36,202 --> 00:06:11,564


40
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:12,695
Up!

41
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,663

Yeah...yeah...that's it...yes.

46
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,359
Excellent doctor.

47
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,861
l'll start data transfer,
cut it on getting connection.

48
00:06:38,598 --> 00:07:05,620


49
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,127
l'm a language of intelligence...

50
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,158
My path is seeking new frontiers...

51
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,058
My boundary is unlimited like sky...

52
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,233
l'm intelligence of the future...

53
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,397
You're made of flesh and blood...

54
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,502
l'm made of materials...

55
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,501
You live only once...

56
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,503
l'll live for generations...

57
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,446
Giving pose like Bruce Lee.

58
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,118
Super...super...

59
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,788
Hi Sana! Long see no time.

60
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,287
Don't you check emails and
SMS's in your lab?

61
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,523
Where is he?

62
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,286
Why does he need
a girl friend and love?

63
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,891
ls he alive inside?

64
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,462
He's with wires inside.
He'll get angry if l disturb him.

65
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,634
Let him get angry,
tell him Sana is here.

66
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,295
Go quickly.

67
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,368
- Do you've any sister, Sana?
- No.

68
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,233

- l mean brother?
- What?

70
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,136
No, l mean cousin sister.

71
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,812
Can you please shut down
your stupid system?

72
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,480
Control, alt, delete.

73
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,842
How many times l've told you
not to disturb me? Get out!

74
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,813
He's hitting with a motor, Sana.

75
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,318
lt seems he'll not meet
even if Obama is here.

76
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,490
Did you tell him Sana is here?

77
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,487
l told him, he asked you to
call him on phone later.

78
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,523
Tell him to make pickle of his phones.

79
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,829
Tell him l'll never see him again.

80
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,176
- Hello!
- Too shrill.

81
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,012
Hello boy!

82
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,670
Hello boy!

83
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,017
Hello boy!

84
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,184
Dot.

85
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,116
Boys, give him speech training,

86
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:16,847
Okay doc.

87
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,747
Hey buddy! Repeat!

88
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:22,184
Why are you looking like that?

89
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,926
Donkey, stupid...

90
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,029
May l kick you with my left leg?

91
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,263
Answer me, you metal head!

92
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,101
Have you given him any useful training?

93
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,873
That is...have you come back so quickly?

94
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:35,870
Tell me.

95
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:36,903
Hey buddy!

96
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,437
Repeat!

97
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,807
Why are you looking like that?

98
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,883
Donkey, stupid...

99
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,052
May l kick you with my left leg?

100
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,149
Answer me, you metal head!

101
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,053
What's this? ls this the speech
training you gave him?

102
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,854
lt wasn't me, it was by Siva.

103
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:03,224
l wanted to start with Chennai Tamil
and then move on to Classical Tamil...

104
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,061
Shut up!

105
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,462
This is my ten year hard work.
Don't play with it.

106
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,238
lf you teach anything like this,
l'll punish you severely.

107
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,910
lrresponsible idiots!

108
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,574
Hey junk head!
Complaining about us to him.

109
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,751
l'll dismantle and sell you as junk.

110
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,246
Looks like it'll bite,
come let's go.

111
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,664
Robot...robot...though l've learnt
many languages...

112
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,774
My father tongue is Tamil...

113
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,946
Robot..robot...though won
over many continents...

114
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,118
l'm a slave to my creator...

115
00:10:54,654 --> 00:11:02,618
New man, come down to earth...

116
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:15,232
New man, come down to earth...

117
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,307
New man, come down to earth...

118
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,480
My dear Robot!
Welcome to this world.

119
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,640
Hello, l'm Robot!
Speed 1 Terahertz.

120
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,145
Memory 1 Zetabyte.

121
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,844
Success doctor,
next is AlRD approval, right?

122
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,689
No Siva, though everything
is programmed,

123
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,525
he's an innocent machine.

124
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,955
Like an infant.

125
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,091
We must take him to the outside world
and let him move with other humans,

126
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:44,995
after studying how to utilize his intelligence
for the betterment of humans,

127
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,934
and after correcting those things,
we must take it to AlRD.

128
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,266
You want to move close with humans.

129
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,100
Dot.

130
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,434
lt'll be show!

131
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,509
Coming!

132
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,618
lt's been months,
don't know what's he up to?

133
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,014
He's spoiling his health in research.

134
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:05,848
Hi mom!

135
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,686
What's this Vasi?
You look like a saint on leave.

136
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,192
Hi Pa! l've a shocking surprise for you.

137
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,022
What's it son?

138
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,031
Come.

139
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,959
What's this?
Have you got rolling cleaned?

140
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:19,595
No dad.

141
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,702
Don't confuse us, son.
Who are you sunny?

142
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,877
Hi! l'm Robot!
Speed 1 terahertz.

143
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,272
Memory 1 zetabyte.

144
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,538
He's smarter than you.

145
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,775
Dad, l've developed this robot.
Advanced robot.

146
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,543
This is Android Humanoid Robot.

147
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,722
A human like machine.

148
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,155
This is mother.

149
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,226
- Mother!
- Yes mother. Greet mother now.

150
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,460
lt's doing just like human.

151
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,228
lt'll do everything a human can do
and also do what humans can't.

152
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,471
Then you don't need these useless guys.

153
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,664
- Father!
- No, l need them.

154
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,404
lf they're not here,
who will clean robot every day,

155
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,136
who will make it wear
brief and socks.

156
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,748
You're making a post graduate
into a baby sitter.

157
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,975
Vasi, come to have food.

158
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,086
Robot, you too join them.
Eat hot idlies.

159
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,418
What? l think she'll even serve him
mutton soup too.

160
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,922
lt's food is just two units of
electricity every day, mom.

161
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,758
Why are you calling as it?
Didn't you name him?

162
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,366
Mother, select a good name for him.

163
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,163
lf you'd a younger brother l thought
of naming him as Chittibabu.

164
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,770
lt's nice!
We can fondly call him as Chitti.

165
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,703
Me? Chitti?

166
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,840
Chitti, put the TV.

167
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,119
Mother, he'll put if you ask him to put.

168
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,485
You must tell him clearly
to switch on the TV.

169
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,290
Vasi! Why are you leaving so early?
Back to lab?

170
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,193
No mother, l must cut hair and
meet Sana immediately,

171
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,298
she's furious on me.

172
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,694
- Who will drive the car?
- Chitti!

173
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,202
Chitti? No way!

174
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,704
No need to take such risk, doctor.

175
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:03,567
Aren't you also coming?

176
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,301
l think l've stomach upset.
You carry on.

177
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:06,978
You?

178
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,306
l didn't inform my home,
you carry on.

179
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,410
Change to driving mode.

180
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,878
watch out doctor, he may pull out
brake instead of applying it.

181
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,817
- Am l not here with him?
- He broke TV while you were here, right?

182
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,656
Just follow my instructions.

183
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,157
Don't do anything without
getting my permission.

184
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,328
Okay doctor.
Where should l go now?

185
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,325
Look there!

186
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:36,698


187
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,608
ldiot! Why did you apply the brake?

188
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,109
You told me not to do anything
without your permission.

189
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,179
- Hey useless!
- New word!

190
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,508
Are you driving drunk?

191
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,344
No, l'm driving the car with petrol.

192
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,353
Don't answer him, drive the car.

193
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,596
Don't make it too short,
just quarter inch is enough.

194
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,856
l'll cut like nipping the nails, sir.

195
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,034
Didn't come here for quite some time?
Any vow or Ayyappa?

196
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:05,862

00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,039

00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,741
Wig?

201
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,376
- What's your age?
- One day!

202
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,941
Sir is playing truant with me.

203
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,550
Read books.

204
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,825
ls he counting the pages?

205
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:38,093


206
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,730
Do you've any other books?

207
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,005
Have you finished reading
all the books?

208
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,004
Finished.

225
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,242
Hi Sweetheart!

226
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,977
Broken heart! What?

227
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,307
l'm sorry Sana,
please accept my apologies.

228
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,579
l was very busy in my lab
all these days.

229
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,909
Stay put in your lab,
who asked you to come here?

230
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,522
l can understand you're angry.

231
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,553
How many phone calls?
How many SMS's? How many Emails?

232
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,318
How many times l would've
come to you?

233
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,922
Did you speak a word with me?

234
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,164
l got vexed.

235
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,333
Look Sana, bullet points,

236
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,764
one, l don't know what's happening
around me while l'm in work,

237
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,337
two, if you know what was
l working on all these days...

238
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,006
Excuse me.

239
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,343
l've class, whatever it is come
to Jeeva park in the evening.

240
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,512
Dot, l love you.
Let's meet in the evening.

241
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:32,343
Hello, don't get any ideas.
Not to romance, to break up our love.

242
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,413
Break the love?
What do you mean by it?

243
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,847
After our marriage, you'll spend time with
machines and l'll be left with loneliness,

244
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,855
instead of going for divorce then,
let's break up now, that's better.

245
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,029
Let's part ways, you take your way,
your exclusive way.

246
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,527
Hey look! Easy...easy...

247
00:17:47,266 --> 00:18:00,907


248
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,807
Agreement for breaking up as lovers,
the letters you wrote to me,

249
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,211
the greetings you sent me,

250
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,486
the book you gave me,
A Brief History of Time.

251
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,448
Freakonomics!

252
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,720
See! Lord Muruga's photo
for Valentines Day.

253
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,660
Have you ever bought something
really touching?

254
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,295
This one?

255
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,660
Would anyone gift a shaving set
to his girl friend?

256
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,770
- l thought could be useful...
- My foot!

257
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,013
l've returned everything
you gave me. Sign this.

258
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,741
We don't have anything between
us hereafter. Good bye!

259
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,249
- That's all?
- That's all!

260
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,416
- Have you returned all l gave you?
- Yes.

261
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,088
Then what about the
2 power 9, 512 kisses?

262
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,528
Do you keep counting the kisses too?
Won't you feel while kissing?

263
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,698
Silly matrix head!
l can't return it.

264
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,265
Break up is valid only
when you return it.

265
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,765
This is wrong rule, l'll not accept.

266
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,938
Then l'll not sign the agreement,
l refuse.

267
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,266
He's a pain!

268
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,099
Close your eyes.

269
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,851
What's this?
This is post office kiss.

270
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,385
- Did l kiss you like this?
- Then what?

271
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,621
Holding your waist,
hugging you tightly...

272
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:25,286
Stop...stop! This is impossible.
No way!

273
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,964
Then break up is cancelled.

274
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,123
l'll come and trouble you every day.

275
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,799
You're a torture!

276
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,372
Let me get rid of him today forever.

277
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,967
Come closer.

278
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,969
Close your eyes.

279
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,839
Don't smile.

280
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,884
ls it okay?

281
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,155
Too much of gap.

282
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,583
Still closer.

283
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,420
Feel...feel...

284
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:41,606


285
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,377
How many love cells are in the body?

286
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:52,881
How many neutrons and electrons
are in your blue eyes?

287
00:20:53,585 --> 00:21:02,721
Just thinking about you makes
my tissues desire...

288
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,328
Sana...Sana...a question...

289
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,828
Are you the epitome of beauty?

290
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:14,235
Are you Newton's law of gravity?
ls your love my enemy?

291
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,239
Are you the smile of thousands of stars?

292
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:23,244
Are you the epitome of beauty?

293
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:28,249
You're a dedicated scientist...
But smart in asking kisses...

294
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:35,916
You've created a commotion
in my heart...

295
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:41,088
There's war in the honey sweet lips...
Rose petals are bleeding...

296
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,536
A commotion in my heart...

Taste the love with eyes...

304
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,324
Running water has more oxygen...

305
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,494

How many love cells are in the body?

How many neutrons and electrons
are in your magnetic eyes?

326
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:31,319
Ho Baby...ho baby..

Why did you park the car
in no parking zone?

338
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,632
The board says no parking only,
it doesn't say Dr.Vasigaran car no parking.

339
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,267

349
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,390

355
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,705
- Taunting me?

00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,136

357
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,037
- Stop it!
- What should l stop? Tell me.

358
00:26:54,479 --> 00:27:00,384
Look...no need of argument.

359
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:06,046
Parking offense, no driving license.
You're talking too much.

360
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,158
lf you go to court they'll put
a fine of Rs.1000,

361
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:12,553
will you go to the court
or settle it here only?

362
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,755
- l'll settle it here only.
- That's better.

363
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,062

365
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,736
Trying to irritate me?

366
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,636
Don't you know the meaning of settling?

367
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:26,670

00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,588
He asked me to cut, l did it.

373
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,589
Oh my God! He's bleeding.

374
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,094
Who is it?
He's just like you.

375
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,357
Get into the car, l'll tell you.
Come on take out the car.

376

No.

380
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,538
Driver? He doesn't look like that.

Wait, l'll tell you everything later.

Check if he's following us
or not and drive.

00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,450
Turn!

384
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,483
Why are you turning head for everything?

385
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,217
You told me to see behind and drive.

386
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,056
- Can't you see it in the mirror?
- Can't you tell me that earlier?

387
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:20,964
Drive!

388
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,726

By the way, that's Mandaveli
Subrahmanian's phone number.

412
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,431
The biggest prime number you know.

M44, you may take few years
to know if it's right.

What Raaga is this?

417

443
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,294
Why are you all after him?

444
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:12,986
Though he has talent of hundred people,

445
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:16,428
he doesn't have one important
thing which we have.

446
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,760
- Yeah, it was very...
- Doctor!

447
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,303
lt seems l don't have a thing
which they have, what is it?

448
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,134
- Why didn't you give that to me?
- He has complained on us.

Fools! Don't you've common sense
of what to talk to him?

451

No, we've feelings and he doesn't,
that's what we were to tell...

452
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,847
Don't try to change it, cheap fellows.

453
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,039
One month salary cut.

454
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,816

455
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,788

459
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:54,401
Chitti...what processor are you using?

460
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,630
Pentium Ultracore...

461
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,030
Motors?

462
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:03,578
FHPO 450 motors from Hirata Japan
with harmonic reduction rate (NOT CLEAR)

463
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,650
Can you please tell me about
your neural schema?

464
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,285
- l can't.
- Why?

465
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,920

00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,519
l'm Vasigaran's professor.

467
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,215
You can tell me, it's not wrong.

468
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,859
- l'll check and tell.
- No...no...

469
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,552
Doctor, he's asking about
my neural schema.

470
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:20,492
Can l tell him?

471
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,899
You see Professor,
you're asking know-how,

472
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:28,334
l'm hesitant to release it
till l get the patent.

473
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,605
Because he can be
misused very easily.

474
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,436
Of course, l understand.

475
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:38,081
Just wanted to know how much
Chitti knows about himself.

476
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,045
- l hope you didn't mind.
- Not at all.

477
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,651
After studying him complete,
l'll bring him to you only.

478
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,287
For AlRD evaluation.

Vasi, l like Chitti very much.

482
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,136
Can l take him to my home
for two days?

483
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:04,708
ls he Pomeranian or Teddy bear
to keep for two days?

484
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,676
No, l've my final exams, didn't study
well getting upset with you,

485
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,475
l feel Chitti would be
very helpful, please.

486
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,514
Please...please...please...

487
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,208
Okay, take him.

488
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,285
- You both go with her.
- Okay doctor.

489
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,080
Gents are not allowed in home.

490
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,655
Who said we are men?

491
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,752
- Call me if you've any trouble.
- Oh sure!

492
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:24,928
Thank you.

493
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:36,238


494
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,899
Activate command mode
and stand up.

495
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,971
Command mode activated!

496
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:45,646
Walk!

497
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,984
Walk straight!

498
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,514
Oh shit!

499
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,885
l'm not shit!

500
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,930
Okay, pick up the gun.

501
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,827
Not bun, l said gun.

502
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,000
Shoot it!

503
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,617
l've programmed you with
800 thousand line of codes.

504
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,045
l'm ordering to pick up gun
and you're picking up bun.

505
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,854
Will you pluck lives
if l say pluck hair?

506
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,797
Vasigaran is my student.
He was sensational!

507
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:43,237
The robot he created won a
standing ovation in the conference.

508
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,568
This is sleeping on ground to dig in.

509
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,939
l'll pluck life...

510
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,705
Leave my neck...leave...

511
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:58,822
Task incomplete...
pluck life...pluck life...

512
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,329
You bas...shit!

513
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:19,667


514
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,840
All right Vasigaran, l'll congratulate you.

515
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,406
You just wait.

516
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:29,443
Happy Home, what do you mean by it?

517
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,951
My father was in Army.

518
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,521
He died in Kargil war at the age of 40.

519
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:37,418
Sorrow, tears, depression,
it was horrible.

520
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,296
How long can we live like that?

521
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,990
There are so many women left as orphans
after losing husband and son.

522
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,694
We started this home to give them
a family of their own.

523
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,901
Nobody can change
what has happened,

524
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,200
nobody can stop
what is going to happen,

525
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,072
every one must be happy
this moment, that's it,

526
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,211
Happy Home!

527
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,608
ls the child kicking
the football well, Lata sister?

528
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,615
Let it come out,
l'll ask it to kick you.

529
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,717
Who is it?

530
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,360
Men inside the home, boy friend?

531
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,894
Not boy friend but toy friend, mother.

532
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:17,727
- lt's name is Chitti, lt's a robot.
- Robot?

533
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,129
Why are you lying to me?

534
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,235
She's right,

535
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,568
l'm a robot, speed 1 terahertz
memory 1 zetabyte.

536
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,071
Don't scare people like this, fix it.

537
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,809
Mother, you'll be surprized with
the work it can do.

538
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,280
Can it cook?

539
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,478
Prepare something to eat,
l'll take bath.

540
00:37:39,624 --> 00:38:01,640


541
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,947
You're so sweet Chitti.
Thank you.

542
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,178
- Cool!
- lt's hot!

543
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,956
Just one day and l've lot to study.

544
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:22,292
l'll tell line by line what l've read,
if l'm wrong stop me.

545
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,038
Have you finished reading all books?

546
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,974
l'll test you.

547
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,481
What are monozygotic
and dizygotic twins?

548
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,620
Monozygotic twins are identical twins,

549
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,051
dizygotic twins are non-identical twins.

550
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,221
Amazing!

551
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,320
lf you can by heart lessons so fast
you can become a doctor in a day.

552
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,656
This is an important
segment of the pelvis...

553
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,492
..diameter or the interspinal's
diameter are...

554
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:57,998
10 cms are more.

555
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:58,997
10 cms are more.

556
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:00,534
Usually the smallest the...

557
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:01,762
Anterio posterior diameter.

558
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:06,341
Anterio posterior diameter which
is through the exterior...

559
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,089
Can't tolerate this trouble every day?

560
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,924
Why are you playing so loudly?
Reduce the volume.

561
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:33,603
We spent a million bucks to set up deck,
amp, woofers, surround speakers.

562
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:37,701
Do you want us to hear it in
headphones instead of full volume?

563
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,308
lt's exam time,
so many people are studying.

564
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,944
There are heart patients too.

565
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,047
Heart patients!

566
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,642
lt seems heart is aching!

567
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,209
Use cotton stubs!

568
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,110
ln ears!

569
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,117
Okay!

570
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,058
Chitti, do something.

571
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,166
Don't worry, remote control is infra red.
l'll take care of it.

572
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:24,114


573
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,154
Come on baby!
What are you looking at?

574
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,487
- Finish it off!
- Close your ears!

575
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:32,923
Okay.

576
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:39,935
Let's move it...let's move it...

577
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:43,934
Reduce the volume man!

578
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,190
Cool!
Come Chitti.

579
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,465
Okay.

580
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:16,800
Anterio posterior diameter
through the level of...

581
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,983
- 98 decibels, too loud.
- l know.

582
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:28,310
Who is that Chellatha?

583
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,057
Hello, sound is too high,
will you reduce the volume?

584
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,225
We are celebrating festival of
auspicious Tamil month Aani,

585
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,991
and how dare you're asking us
to reduce the volume.

586
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,759
We are unable to study
for the exams.

587
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:49,099
Pray to Goddess and
apply sacred ash on forehead,

588
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,330
you'll pass the exams.

589
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,573
How loud you play the music?

590
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,347
Sana, no more troublesome loud speakers.
Come, let's go.

591
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,915
Hey, he broke the mike set.

592
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,413
Hey stop!

593
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,519
Bloody stop there!

594
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:26,406


595
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,206
Goddess mother!

596
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,219
Goddess mother!

597
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,886
What's this?

598
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:45,956
He's a magician.

599
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,460
He took away all our weapons.

600
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,244
What's this?

601
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:18,754


602
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:20,989
Why are you crying Sana?

603
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,227
l'm sure to fail, Chitti.
l haven't read anything.

604
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,336
Time is over.
l feel giddy on seeing this book.

605
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,473
- Shall l write your exam?
- Don't talk nonsense, Chitti.

606
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,608
There's photo lD and exam card.

607
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,609
- You can't write the exam.
- We can do the opposite B.

608
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:37,812
What do you mean by it?

609
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,677
lf the bleeding starts with
placenta in neutro,

610
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:45,184
...of the uterus will grasp
and massaged to make it contract...

611
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,689
lf the placenta is not separated...

612
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:00,067
The third stage of the labour
starts the baby's delivery...

613
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,033
Excuse me!
What are you doing here?

614
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:06,199
Sana is writing exam there.
l'm telling her the answer.

615
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:08,567
How can you tell her from here?

616
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,838
l've a built in data transmitter.

617
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,209
There's a trans receiver in Sana's ear,

618
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,551
Zip P protocol, Simple.

619
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,984
- ls it hi-tech bit?
- Not bit byte.

620
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:20,247
Till now l've transferred 2 mb data.

621
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,721
Did you see how people have developed?

622
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,818
- Get up man!
- Please wait.

623
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,054
- l'll come as soon the umbilical cord is cut.
- What?

624
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,391
Will you come now or
shall l call the security?

625
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:38,905
There! She's Sana.

626
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,742
What is this Sana?

627
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:44,175
lt seems you've a receiver in ear
and copying as he dictates.

628
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,541
- Who told you?
- Me.

629
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,273
l don't know who is he.

630
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:48,508
Why are you lying Sana?

631
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,916
l'm Chitti, speed 1 terahertz,
memory 1 zetabytes.

632
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:55,353
What the hell...he's blabbering.
l think he's gone mad, sir.

633
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,187
l don't have brain, just CPU only.
Perfect condition.

634
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:01,626
No doubt, he's mental.
Take him away, running out of my time.

635
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,299
l thought when he was talking
to himself alone,

636
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,024
may be some old medical student.

637
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:08,227
Sir, you please go out.
Go and cut the umbilical cord.

638
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,270
What would you do for menstruation
and fertilization, Sana?

639
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,635
That's her problem, you go out.

640
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,435
Task incomplete.

641
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:53,607


642
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:54,982
Thank you very much Chitti.

643
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,585
lf you hadn't helped me,
l would've definitely failed.

644
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,483
Why are you wetting my cheek for it?

645
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,391
l'm sorry Chitti.

646
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,163
lf l get caught they'll rusticate
me for three years.

647
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:11,000
That's why l had to disown you.

648
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,269
- Please don't feel for it.
- l don't have any feelings.

649
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,167
l've understood that humans tell
lies to save themselves.

650
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:19,835
True!

651
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:27,783
Move...move...get down...
board next compartment.

652
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:31,250
Move...move...all of you clear out.
Go to the next compartment.

653
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:36,423
Are you such a macho man?

654
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:37,624
Come now!

655
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:42,297
What are you looking at?
You can't attract anything

656
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:43,864
we are having stones.

657
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:44,863
Come on!

658
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,362
- Why are they calling me?
- Keep quiet.

659
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,268
You brought him for protection,
tell him to come now.

660
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:59,610
Chitti, my purse.
My hall ticket and lD is in it.

661
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:26,700


662
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:29,136
You ruined my home theatre, right?

663
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,977
Now l'll ruin your home theatre.

664
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,177
Catch her!

665
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,108
Chitti train.

666
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,891
Chitti, bash up them!

667
00:48:23,100 --> 00:49:35,872


668
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:37,431
Stop it!

669
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:47,205
No!

670
00:49:48,852 --> 00:52:18,424


671
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,771
You'll be shocked to know
what Chitti did today.

672
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:27,000
Chitti is one of its kind.
He's so sweet, he's amazing.

673
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,577
He's unbelievable.
He's like a super hero!

674
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,716
Had he been a human,
l would've ditched you and loved him.

675
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,285
- l see your face frowning.
- No.

676
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,891
Come on Vasi, he's just a machine.

677
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:48,122
Whatever he does,
the entire credit goes to you only.

678
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,456
You are really great!

679
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,264
My love is always yours only.

680
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,549
Chitti, you too join us.
Take photo of all three together.

681
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:09,917
Wow!

Wonder of science in
this modern world...

You've mouth but no stomach...

You can talk but never breath...

701

You've pulse but no heart...

O firestone, may you live eternally...

704
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:53,720
You were born out of a man's love...

705
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:58,087
You bloomed in the desire...

706
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,856
You united us in love...

707
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:09,369
Before we know our marriage day,
you're our son...

708
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,373
Chitti...Chitti robot...

719
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,139
Chitti, hold it.

720
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,686
Oh my child!

721
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:04,485

Won't l get a lover who can listen
peacefully everything like him?

725
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:30,178
Gives boons without doing penance,

726
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:34,084
Auto man...automatic man...

735
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,481
Hey robot...

736
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,385
Hey happy-go-lucky pal, come let's go...

737
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:13,255
Boom...boom...robot...

741
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:27,574
Cheers!

742
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:36,478
You watching avidly as if
Shakila is dancing here.

743
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,715
Planning to complain about this too?
That's the idea.

744
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:42,016
Tomorrow is AlRD's evaluation,
l'm doing peripheral trouble shooting.

745
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:45,588
- Are you so great?
- Grammar mistake.

746
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,328
He's great grammarian Tholkappier.

747
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,966
Use right sublime gender and don't use
like animate, inanimate and neuter.

748
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,659
So said Tholkappier in grammar thesis.

749
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:55,694
Shut up.

750
00:57:55,905 --> 00:58:00,001
Forget about what he said
in a book or a TV interview,

751
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,701
are you greater than us
if you're better informed?

752
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,641
- Yes.
- What yes?

753
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:05,712
Can you drink like us?

754
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,940
Can you smoke like us?

755
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,118
Can you eat biryani like us?

756
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,014
Can you puke like us after eating?

757
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:12,380
Can you atleast spit?

758
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,614
- Can you write your initials
while pissing on wall?- Correct!

759
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,689
ls that all difference the
between me and man?

760
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:21,428
- Looks like a punch in dark!
- lndeed!

761
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:24,031
These items are in
my don't eat rule list.

762
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:26,599
The same rule list says to obey
our orders, right?

763
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:27,963
- Yes.
- Then, drink this.

764
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,399
Eat this biryani.

765
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:32,700
- l'll ask doctor.
- Don't tell doctor about it.

766
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:33,699
Hello!

767
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,970
They are asking me to drink alcohol
beverages and eat biryani,

768
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,205
rule priority clause 9,
what should l do now?

769
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:40,473
Beat those rascals with slippers.

770
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,150
Yes doctor. Command received.

771
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,148
You...

772
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,583
Give me your slippers.

773
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,049
Slippers? Take it.

774
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,554
Are you going to eat it?

775
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:53,755
He may eat!

776
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:58,900
He's beating us really.

777
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:03,096
Leave us, all are watching us on road.

778
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,604
Chitti, stop it...

779
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,242
- Task incomplete.
- What? lncomplete?

780
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,647
Doctor...doctor...sir...sir...

781
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,009
Chitti, stop!

782
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,707
- You need it.
- No.

783
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,716
- Do you've any sense?
- No.

784
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:19,149
l asked you to get it ready
for AlRD's evaluation,

785
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:20,913
you're asking him to drink
and eat biryani.

786
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:23,684
- We never told it, doctor.
- He's lying, doctor.

787
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,191
Only humans lie, machines don't.

788
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,123
Last warning idiots,
next time you'll be fired literally.

789
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,530
Task completed.

790
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:43,040
Human life is priceless.

791
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:46,642
Thousands of army men die is wars,

792
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,942
many families face difficulties
losing them,

793
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:53,153
if we use robots instead of men,
there won't be any human loss,

794
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:56,390
producing Android Humanoids
like him in great numbers,

795
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,560
my aim to present them
to lndian army.

796
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,558
AlRD's approval for it is necessary.

797
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:04,324
humbly request authorities and
scientists must evaluate Chitti,

798
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:07,401
and approve it.
Dot.

799
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:13,069
ls this robot created with Asimov's
principle of not hurting humans?

800
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,903
This robot wasn't created like that.

801
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:19,309
Because robots would face situations
in war where it has to kill humans.

802
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:23,845
Let me check your colour
and shape perceptions.

803
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,419
Take the red cube and
put it on the yellow pyramid.

804
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,681
- Not possible.
- Then?

805
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:28,982
Reverse is possible.

806
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,589
Yellow pyramid on the red cube.

807
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:35,330
Greek runner Achilles while
competing with a tortoise,

808
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,691
if tortoise comes little earlier,

809
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,194
it's proven theory that
tortoise has won,

810
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:41,927
- do you know about it?
- l know.

811
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,105
lt's a paradox.

812
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,939
ln the process because it's
convergence is serious,

813
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,609
Achilles also can win.

814
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,002
What are you saying?

815
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,042
- Can we approve?
- Sure.

816
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:53,774
One minute please.

817
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,348
Do you know the value of human life?

818
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,452
lt depends on whose life it is.

819
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,783
Who will you save an impending danger?

820
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:05,123
Einstein or a small kid?

821
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,625
Hypothetical question.

822
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,864
Smart answer.

823
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:15,468
- Now follow my commands.
- Ready.

824
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,639
Please get up.

825
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:17,903
Turn.

826
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:19,370
Walk.

827
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:20,909
Turn right.

828
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,645
Run forward.

829
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,480
Run around.

830
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,148
Run back.

831
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:28,910
Turn left.

832
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:29,641
Jump.

833
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,312
Right.

834
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,313
Run forward.

835
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:34,979
Fast.

836
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:36,756
Faster.

837
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:38,594
Even faster.

838
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:41,587
Catch.

839
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:43,592
Stab Vasigaran.

840
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:45,834
Stop.

841
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:51,831
Take it out.

842
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:59,741
This is dangerous machine.
lt'll kill anyone.

843
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:01,606
l can't approve it.

844
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,348
No professor, you gave him a wrong
command and confused it.

845
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,681
That's the problem.

846
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,852
lt doesn't know good or bad
or friend or foe.

847
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:13,618
lt is just a stupid inference engine.
That's all.

848
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:19,023
lf we induct in army, it'll kill our
Generals instead of enemies,

849
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,869
letting it out in society is
also dangerous,

850
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,862
it has cut a traffic constable's hand,

851
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:28,206
we've complaint about breaking
bones of passengers in a train,

852
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:33,705
this robot will suit to do only routine
programmed job in some factory,

853
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,784
sorry doc, cannot clear it.

854
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,227
Why are you angry on me, Professor?
Why are you doing this to me?

855
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,290
Please don't misunderstand me.

856
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,329
l don't have any grouse on you.

857
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,166
Science mustn't go wrong, that's all.

858
01:02:52,969 --> 01:03:05,939


859
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,748
What's this Chitti?
Why did you behave like this?

860
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:14,411
What have l done wrong?
You told me to follow his orders, l did.

861
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:15,818
lf he asks to stab, will you stab me?

862
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:17,582
lt means that, right?

863
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,030
Save us...save us...

864
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:25,927
Chitti, stop the car.

865
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,535
Sir, we are unable to near
as fire is intense.

866
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:34,107
Many people are trapped inside.

867
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,207
Send additional force sir.

868
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,209
Can you save them, Chitti?

869
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:43,207
Heat 799 degrees Celsius, l can
withstand upto 1000 degree Celsius,

870
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:44,443
- l can save them.
- Go.

871
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,384
- Not a life must go, Chitti.
- Okay.

872
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:04,128
Save us...save us...

873
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:11,875
Somebody please save me.

874
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,978
Don't get scared, l'm Chitti, a robot,
l'm here to save you.

875
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,660
l would've died, he came like God
and saved me.

876
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:33,494
Well done Chitti.

877
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,762
- Thank you.
- What about the others trapped there?

878
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:40,498
Somebody please save me

879
01:04:41,244 --> 01:05:03,260


880
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,527
Professor, watch TV.

881
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,369
The robot you rejected as
dangerous to humans,

882
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:12,698
is now saving humans
from a fire accident. Watch it!

883
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:17,541
Save me...save my child...

884
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:25,047
- Save them!
- Save me!

885
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:31,985
Get down.

886
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:41,394
ls everyone safe? Check!
Who is it?

887
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:46,397
My daughter Selvi was taking bath,
she's missing.

888
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,908
l don't know what happened to her.
Save me!

889
01:05:50,813 --> 01:06:09,495


890
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:17,929
Save me!

891
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:24,039
Don't come near me, l'm naked.

892
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,043
- Don't come near.
- So what? l'm also naked.

893
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:29,115
Don't come.
Leave me...leave me...

894
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:41,623
l''m naked, leave me...

895
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:46,959
Here's your Selvi.

896
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:51,033
- You've spoiled everything.
- Don't take pictures of me.

897
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:52,967
The girl was naked.

898
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,040
- She's alive.
- Go...

899
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:03,484
Don't take my photos.
l've been humiliated...

900
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:07,483
- Stop.
- Stop...stop...

901
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:26,772
What's this Vasi?
You've killed an innocent girl unjustly.

902
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:33,574
l told you it's a stupid machine.
lt's dangerous to let it outside.

903
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:38,613
You've proven now that
l was right in rejecting it.

904
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:43,347
- Bad luck, Vasi.
- You've left us dear!

905
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:49,597
Stupid! Don't you know to cover the
girl with cloth and bring her?

906
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:54,197
How can it know, Vasigaran?
lt's not a human but Humanoid.

907
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,867
How can you explain honour
to a machine?

908
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,598
- Professor!
- Sorry Vasi.

909
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:06,046
The video of the girls suicide is shown
on TV news channels and tearing us.

910
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:10,875
There's pressure from Defence Ministry.
To stop your research.

911
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,219
No professor, l can't stop.

912
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,887
l can make some changes in his
schemology and correct him.

913
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,219
How can you do it?

914
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,257
lt doesn't know man and woman,

915
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,162
it doesn't know honour and shame,

916
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:24,958
it's insensitive to human feelings.

917
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,736
l can give human feelings to it.

918
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:31,236
lmpossible.
Only God can do it.

919
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,238
Man has made possible
many impossible things.

920
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,237
You are my senior.

921
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:40,070
That's why l'm telling you,
it's a waste of time and energy.

922
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:43,646
10 years Professor,
my 10 year hard work.

923
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,583
lsn't there any fruit to it?

924
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,416
There is but in a different place.

925
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:54,987
l've contacts with many robotic
companies in foreign countries,

926
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:59,926
if you give this to them,
l can get you few million dollars.

927
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:02,930
No professor.
l didn't do it for money.

928
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,298
My aim is to give it to lndian army.

929
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,774
lt's impossible.

930
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:12,779
lt must come to me for evaluation.

931
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,517
Give me one last chance.
Please!

932
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,780
All right, l'll give you a month's time.

933
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:27,524
Try it, if you fail dismantle it.
Sell it as junk to buy dates.

934
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:32,363
Good for heart.
You need it.

935
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,809
We both are sticking with you
for 5 years in this lab.

936
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:48,981
- All we got is beaten with slippers.
- Find us any job in your lab.

937
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,819
Do you know anything about
Chitti's neural schema?

938
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:55,320
We know everything other
than that, sir.

939
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,158
l'll call if l need you.

940
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:02,490
Human feelings

941
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:05,426
Anger

942
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,335
Excitement

943
01:10:08,404 --> 01:11:01,981


944
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:03,115
What are you doing?

945
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:05,190
l'm installing software hormones to you.

946
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,885
Hormones are secreted only
with feelings, doctor.

947
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:10,022
l'm going to do reverse mapping.

948
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:23,972
Chitti, in this world human life is
an independent accident,

949
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,107
in this vast space and world,

950
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:29,716
human and life happened on
it's own by coincidence.

951
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:30,714
What do you mean by life?

952
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,114
lt consists of DNA, the basis of life.

953
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:37,052
ls this life?

954
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:40,552
Life is not a formula.
How am l to tell you?

955
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,993
A bacteria has life but sodium doesn't.

956
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:46,292
- For me?
- For you...

957
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:55,235
Careful, this side.

958
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,758
- Do you see any changes?
- l do.

959
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,664
What?

960
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:20,596
Your beard has grown 0.5 mm.

961
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,828
Stop joking you fool!

962
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:26,371
- l asked if there's any change in you.
- No.

963
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:30,110
Waste...utter waste...stupid!

964
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:32,007
- Vasi, calm down.
- You keep quiet Sana.

965
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,845
Can it understand this?
Metal head! Titanium head.

966
01:12:36,151 --> 01:12:36,947
Vasi please...

967
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,620
l haven't eaten, haven't slept.
l didn't even talk to you.

968
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:42,347
How many days?
How many days l've toiled you know?

969
01:12:42,825 --> 01:12:45,055
l've taught him so many things.
How l struggled to teach him?

970
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,627
He's standing there like a lamp post.

971
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:48,296
Buffaloe.
Useless fellow.

972
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:49,790
Useless machine.

973
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:51,465
l'll dismantle you.

974
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:56,396
Don't scold me unnecessarily,
l'm obeying all your orders.

975
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:58,129
lf still l'm unable to meet
your expectations,

976
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,898
the mistake is not in me,
it's with you.

977
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,739
lf l'm waste then you're also waste.

978
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:06,642
- What did you say?
- Leave me. Leave me l say.

979
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,373
Chitti is getting angry.

980
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:12,987
Yeah.

981
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:20,993
My God!

982
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:50,458


983
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,358
Sana, Lata is having labour pain,
she's in serious condition,

984
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:55,689
come immediately.

985
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:02,528
Don't worry, l'm with you.

986
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:05,874
Don't worry.

987
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:10,308
ls it very complicated, doctor?

988
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:11,638
You're studying here, right?

989
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:13,974
Fetal cause, the head is turned.

990
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:15,377
lntestines are woven around stomach.

991
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:19,042
Dropping pulse rate, blood loss,
she has all the complications.

992
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:22,217
lt's difficult to save one of them's life.

993
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:26,383
She lost her husband soon
after marriage in a war.

994
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:31,065
She's living for this child only.
Please save both of them.

995
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:35,566
- l can only try, beyond that...
- Can l try?

996
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:40,403
- Who are you? Doctor?
- No, l'm Chitti, a robot.

997
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:42,236
- Robot?
- Can you do it, Chitti?

998
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:43,144
Why not?

999
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:47,577
Sorry, we can't allow it.
This is not a lab but labour ward.

1000
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,408
Two lives are under total risk.

1001
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:52,086
With so much experience
this is a nightmare to us.

1002
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:55,085
l can do it, l've studied for Sana's exams.

1003
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:56,754
Sana herself can't do it.

1004
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,593
You need qualification and
experience to a Ceasarian.

1005
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:00,989
lt's against the medical law.

1006
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:04,324
No need of ceasarian,
l'll have it a normal delivery.

1007
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,262
How is it possible?
Both will die.

1008
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:07,264
She's bleeding.

1009
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:08,766
We can do plasma transfusion.

1010
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:11,667
Blood pressure is high.
She may get fits at any moment.

1011
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,168
Give maximum pressure.

1012
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:16,106
Pelvic disproportion.
Normal delivery is impossible.

1013
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:20,111
Possible, can do symtiostemy.
Olden times delivery method.

1014
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,215
Pushing through after
stretching pelvic bone.

1015
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:42,397


1016
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:44,805
Don't shout, your son is getting scared.

1017
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:51,039
We are making history.

1018
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,572
First time a robot is acting
as midwife to deliver a child.

1019
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,677
Your son is just like you.

1020
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:58,482
Do you want to see?

1021
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:02,585
Doctor, switch on Wi-Fi.

1022
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:04,486
l'll stream ultrosone video.

1023
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,671
My God! lt's unbelievable!

1024
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,444
lt's a milestone in robotics.

1025
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,679
lt's an achievement in
artificial intelligence.

1026
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:49,931
Doctor! She's dying!

1027
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:56,202
- Just 95 seconds only, stay awake.
- Sister, open your eyes and see.

1028
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:02,042
He'll take birth at exactly
4hrs 44mts 44 secs.

1029
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,886
lt's over! Just 55 seconds more only!

1030
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:20,459
Just 35 seconds only!

1031
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:27,405
Sister...sister...

1032
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:28,676
Sister...

1033
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:34,915
Sister...

1034
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,424
Welcome!

1035
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:50,757
Great!

1036
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:52,766
Thank you.

1037
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,045
Will you approve Chitti now?

1038
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:09,615
Definitely.

1039
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:13,817
But the real problem for you starts now.

1040
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:16,781
He saved both the lives.

1041
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:35,069


1042
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:40,638
You are really great!
You're mind blowing!

1043
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,351
The real story begins now.

1044
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:56,058
Wait and watch!

1045
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:12,202
lt's a great day for me Chitti.
What a moment!

1046
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:15,440
l'm extremely happy today.
Thank you very much.

1047
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,709
Get charge in sleeping mode.
l'll see you in the morning.

1048
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:18,783
Good night.

1049
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:33,960
Oh my God!

1050
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:40,241
You are...

1051
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,505
You are like...

1052
01:19:44,479 --> 01:20:05,493


1053
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:07,696
No!

1054
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,437
What are you doing here at this hour?

1055
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,439
A mosquito was biting your cheek.

1056
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,440
Did you come here to kill it?

1057
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,773
No, l felt like seeing you,
that's why l'm here.

1058
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:21,806
What's this new habit? Get going.

1059
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:26,447
Your kiss today was very good.
Give me another one. l'll go.

1060
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:30,284
What happened to you?
Disturbing me at 1 am, go away.

1061
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:31,618
Kiss me, l'll go away.

1062
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,954
Why are you troubling me?

1063
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,796
You achieved something great,
l kissed you.

1064
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,794
ls there anyone else pregnant in Home?

1065
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,493
ls this maternity ward?

1066
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:41,464
What do you want me to achieve now?
Tell me.

1067
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,299
Catch the mosquito that bit me now.

1068
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,634
That's all?

1069
01:20:49,044 --> 01:21:17,568


1070
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:20,174
Who bit Sana?

1071
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,910
Not me. l was in Cooum.

1072
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,802
l'm West Mambalam mosquito.

1073
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,504
- Rangooski is from Anna Nagar.
- Who is this Rangooski?

1074
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,113
- Me!
- Did you bite Sana?

1075
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:32,851
Yes l did. So what?

1076
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,514
l've bitten Tamil Chief Minister also.

1077
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:36,918
Come with me and seek her forgiveness.

1078
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:37,921
Seek forgiveness?

1079
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,687
Fulfill my three wishes, l'll see then.

1080
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:41,521
Tell me your wishes.

1081
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,528
Number one, l want AB negative blood,

1082
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,368
very rare, difficult to get.

1083
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:51,094
Siva in my lab belongs to that group only.
He always belittles me.

1084
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,465
Suck as much blood as you want.

1085
01:21:55,343 --> 01:22:00,212
Number two, ban all the companies
manufacturing mosquito repellents.

1086
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:01,607
They are disturbing us a lot.

1087
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:04,717
- Third wish?
- Announce us as National Bird.

1088
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,320
Fool, you're not a bird.
You're an insect.

1089
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,624
Getting late, will you come
with me or not?

1090
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:10,324
l'll not come.

1091
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:13,392
lf you don't come now,
l'll exterminate all of you.

1092
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:20,125
Hey who is it? How dare you enter
our area and threaten to kill us!

1093
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:24,738
How many we'd killed with malaria, dengue
and chikungunea, forgotten it?

1094
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:26,299
Let's show him our power!

1095
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:27,404
- Hey Dengue Lakshmi!
- Sister!

1096
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:28,576
- Hey Cholera Jasmine.
- Sister.

1097
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:29,801
Attack him!

1098
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,414
Sister, he's very strong.

1099
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,746
Cholera Jasmine broke it's sting biting him.

1100
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:40,580
ls it?

1101
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:43,852
- Enter his mouth at right moment.
- Okay sister.

1102
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,357
Sister, Dengue Lakshmi died
getting electrocuted.

1103
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:57,266
l think this is something new
like electric mat.

1104
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:01,431
Let's back off like when we
faced the first repellents,

1105
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,177
later on we can come back
and have a ball.

1106
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,775
You can take Rangooski with you.

1107
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:09,447
Thank you.

1108
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:14,946
Look Sana, the mosquito which bit you.

1109
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,145
Rangooski.

1110
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:19,126
- Rangooski, say sorry to Sana.
- Sorry.

1111
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:24,126
Never again dare come near Sana,
warn your people.

1112
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:26,965
- Yes boss.
- Go!

1113
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,137
Kiss me now.

1114
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:32,567
Deal is a deal.

1115
01:23:38,880 --> 01:24:33,299


1116
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:37,664
You want to feel my kiss...
Boy you can't touch this...

1117
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,967
Everybody...hypnotic...hypnotic...supersonic...

1118
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:45,135
Super star, come....come..get it...
Super star, come....come..get it...

1119
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:50,811
ls heart sprouting in iron for the first time?

1120
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:54,352
ls this the first call of love?

1121
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:58,058

Why?

1271

1273
01:36:55,209 --> 01:36:57,404
Don't talk like a fool.
That's not real.

1274
01:36:57,611 --> 01:36:58,441
You're just a machine.

1275
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:02,776
Yes but a machine with emotions of
happiness, sadness, love and anger.

1276
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:05,547
Emotions for you is given

situation and behave properly,

1278
01:37:08,589 --> 01:37:10,284
and not to misuse it.

1279
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:13,949
l like this, l want Sana.
Dot.

1280
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:15,622
What are you saying, Chitti?

1281
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,730
l'm going to marry her.

1282
01:37:17,932 --> 01:37:19,866
You marry some other girl.

1283
01:37:20,067 --> 01:37:21,329
You can't do this Chitti.

1284
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:23,799
l created you, this is known as betrayal.

1285
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:25,369
You can do this, Vasi.

1286
01:37:25,573 --> 01:37:28,974
You gave up your love for research,
that's known as sacrifice.

1287
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:30,206
l'll thrash you.

1288
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:32,072
lt'll not pain me, you'll feel the pain.

1289
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:35,210
- l'll dismantle you.
- l don't like it.

1290
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:36,508
What did you say you rogue rascal?

1291
01:37:36,717 --> 01:37:38,981
Vasi, clam down.

1292
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,878
Chitti, please listen to me.

1293
01:37:41,088 --> 01:37:42,988
You're so patient,
why is he scolding me?

1294
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:44,054
No, l'll fondle him.

1295
01:37:44,258 --> 01:37:46,089
- Tell him to keep quiet.
- Bloody!

1296
01:37:47,461 --> 01:37:49,361
Chitti, please understand.

1297
01:37:49,563 --> 01:37:55,729
Though you've emotions, love between
a machine and a girl is impossible.

1298
01:37:55,936 --> 01:37:56,960
Why not?

1299
01:37:57,171 --> 01:37:59,264
ln what way l'm inferior to humans.

1300
01:37:59,473 --> 01:38:01,100
l'll take care of you better
than him, Sana.

1301
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:02,900
He's talking foolish and
you're listening to him.

1302
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:05,442
- Tell him not to interfere.
- ls he so great?

1303
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:06,340
Vasi, please.

1304
01:38:06,547 --> 01:38:09,414
He can't cook,
l can cook 25 different types,

1305
01:38:09,617 --> 01:38:11,744
l can sing lullaby in 32 languages
to put you to sleep.

1306
01:38:11,952 --> 01:38:13,783
He'll get old, his hair will turn gray,

1307
01:38:13,988 --> 01:38:15,012
he'll die.

1308
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:16,345
l'm eternal.

1309
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:18,787
l'll keep you happy till last, Sana.

1310
01:38:19,026 --> 01:38:22,792
- l didn't mean that.
- Then? Sex?

1311
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:25,454
ls life nothing but sex?

1312
01:38:25,666 --> 01:38:29,158
- ls it not love without sex?
- Not that, Chitti.

1313
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:30,928
Then? Child?

1314
01:38:31,138 --> 01:38:33,072
There are many impotent in lndia,

1315
01:38:33,274 --> 01:38:35,003
aren't they living happily
by adopting children?

1316
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:36,938
- Not that, Chitti.
- What else then?

1317
01:38:37,144 --> 01:38:39,806
Whatever you do is against
the nature, Chitti.

1318
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:42,574
Neither you've birth nor death,
no hunger,

1319
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:44,546
infact you don't belong
to the living organism.

1320
01:38:44,985 --> 01:38:46,976
Only humans can love
between themselves.

1321
01:38:47,288 --> 01:38:48,653
l love Vasigaran.

1322
01:38:51,292 --> 01:38:53,226
You're like my best friend.

1323
01:38:55,963 --> 01:38:58,022
Only humans find it difficult to forget,

1324
01:38:58,232 --> 01:38:59,529
it's easy for you, Chitti.

1325
01:38:59,733 --> 01:39:02,998
Won't it take just a second to
erase memories about me?

1326
01:39:03,203 --> 01:39:04,329
Erase it, Chitti.

1327
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,507
Erase me of your memory.

1328
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:34,492


1329
01:39:41,108 --> 01:39:42,837
Who is it?

1330
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:45,469
Your friend Prof.Bora speaking.

1331
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:46,577
Why did you come now?

1332
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:49,613
l know you're hurt,
l came to console you.

1333
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:52,411
You're my boss' enemy,
you chided and rejected me.

1334
01:39:52,619 --> 01:39:53,950
l don't want to talk to you.

1335
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:59,353
Hadn't l rejected you, you wouldn't have
got these emotions of love, anger?

1336
01:40:00,894 --> 01:40:03,089
l did good for you.

1337
01:40:03,297 --> 01:40:05,322
Vasigaran is illtreating you.

1338
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:07,796
l don't want to listen, you can go.

1339
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:13,941
You're the most advanced robot in
this world which can think and act.

1340
01:40:14,141 --> 01:40:19,044
He's using to cook, wash clothes
and clean toilets.

1341
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,370
What has he done for you in return?

1342
01:40:21,715 --> 01:40:23,182
Nothing! Nothing!

1343
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:25,045
Had you been with me?

1344
01:40:25,252 --> 01:40:27,277
l would've given you the highest regard.

1345
01:40:27,488 --> 01:40:29,046
You're polluting me.

1346
01:40:31,158 --> 01:40:33,251
Trying to make you
understand your value.

1347
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:34,950
You're bigger than man himself.

1348
01:40:35,162 --> 01:40:38,654
You've the right to desire
anything in this world.

1349
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:39,696
lncluding Sana.

1350
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:41,993
They say it's against the nature.

1351
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:45,399
No, this is new to the nature.

1352
01:40:45,606 --> 01:40:49,042
- Sana loves Vasigaran.
- Let her do.

1353
01:40:49,243 --> 01:40:53,646
Won't they change in the course
of time to love another man?

1354
01:40:53,847 --> 01:40:56,748
May be Sana will change
and start loving you.

1355
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:58,815
- lsn't it?
- Don't confuse me.

1356
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:00,611
Tomorrow l've army evaluation,

1357
01:41:00,821 --> 01:41:03,187
l need to run my diagnostics
and trouble shoot.

1358
01:41:03,891 --> 01:41:05,859
Okay Chitti, all the best.

1359
01:41:06,693 --> 01:41:10,390
You'll get selected in tomorrow's
army evaluation,

1360
01:41:10,597 --> 01:41:13,065
Vasigaran will get fame and money,

1361
01:41:13,267 --> 01:41:17,863
he'll marry Sana and
go to Kashmir on honeymoon.

1362
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:22,771
You'll be in the same Kashmir firing...

1363
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:24,768
...buns!

1364
01:41:25,879 --> 01:41:27,107
Who were you talking to?

1365
01:41:27,714 --> 01:41:28,544
Myself.

1366
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,283
Are you ready for tomorrow's evaluation?

1367
01:41:32,486 --> 01:41:33,544
Ready doctor.

1368
01:41:36,557 --> 01:41:39,321
Peak of human intelligence
is this robot.

1369
01:41:39,526 --> 01:41:44,259
He's equal to 100 army men
in speed, power and action.

1370
01:41:44,465 --> 01:41:47,593
He can protect the borders
and attack the enemies too.

1371
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:49,962
ln short, he's a one man army.

1372
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:51,797
l'm dedicating him to the lndian army.

1373
01:41:52,005 --> 01:41:53,563
You must test it.

1374
01:41:54,608 --> 01:41:56,508
Can you spot HV36 hand granade?

1375
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:57,734
Yes General!

1376
01:41:58,879 --> 01:41:59,402
Smart.

1377
01:41:59,613 --> 01:42:01,478
Can you bomb tent number 3 with that?

1378
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:15,095
What is this?

1379
01:42:15,662 --> 01:42:16,526
Sana!

1380
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,698
Chitti!

1381
01:42:23,704 --> 01:42:28,164
A virgin beauty who can make even
computers to fall in love with her.

1382
01:42:31,411 --> 01:42:32,105
What?

1383
01:42:32,446 --> 01:42:36,280
lf she touches machine will
turn into human.

1384
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:38,314
Human will turn into machine.

1385
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:40,009
What is this, Chitti? Throw it.

1386
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:43,348
Her tresses are black waterfalls!

1387
01:42:44,758 --> 01:42:48,125
Forehead is neatly cut moon.

1388
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:54,028
Eyes are Bermuda Triangle
where people get lost.

1389
01:42:56,236 --> 01:42:59,637
Lips are sleeping zebras.

1390
01:43:02,743 --> 01:43:06,645
Waist is small chair of toddlers.

1391
01:43:09,483 --> 01:43:11,007
Next...
Chitti, stop it.

1392
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:12,845
What nonsense is this Dr.Vasigaran?

1393
01:43:13,053 --> 01:43:15,681
You said this robot will wage war
but reciting poetry.

1394
01:43:15,889 --> 01:43:17,288
- l'm sorry.
- Friends,

1395
01:43:17,491 --> 01:43:20,688
forget about guns
and start praying dupatta,

1396
01:43:20,894 --> 01:43:23,727
forget about canons and
touch a woman's dress,

1397
01:43:23,931 --> 01:43:26,900
Why wars? Why these weapons?

1398
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,398
Love will teach you to love enemies too.

1399
01:43:29,603 --> 01:43:31,332
All of you fall in love!

1400
01:43:33,874 --> 01:43:35,535
Chitti enough,
don't embarrass me further.

1401
01:43:35,742 --> 01:43:37,676
No war only love!

1402
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,743
Stupid scientist and stupid machine.

1403
01:43:39,980 --> 01:43:41,004
Waste of time.

1404
01:43:44,251 --> 01:43:45,741
You insulted me.

1405
01:43:46,553 --> 01:43:48,214
What is this doctor?

1406
01:43:48,422 --> 01:43:50,185
You've killed my ambition.

1407
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:52,685
Doctor, don't hack me.

1408
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:54,918
l took care of you like my own son.

1409
01:43:58,532 --> 01:43:59,931
l want to live.

1410
01:44:00,434 --> 01:44:01,526
Please don't harm me.

1411
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:02,391
Please.

1412
01:44:02,603 --> 01:44:05,629
Rogue machines like you
don't deserve to be in this world.

1413
01:44:05,839 --> 01:44:06,931
Get ruined!

1414
01:44:08,842 --> 01:44:10,036
What was my mistake?

1415
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:12,109
lt was my mistake to create you.

1416
01:44:15,415 --> 01:44:16,905
Did l ask you to create me?

1417
01:44:18,018 --> 01:44:19,485
Did l ask you to give me emotions?

1418
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:23,787
Did l ask Sana to kiss me?

1419
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,919
You did everything yourselves
and when l want to live,

1420
01:44:31,565 --> 01:44:32,623
you're killing me.

1421
01:44:33,567 --> 01:44:34,226
ls it justified?

1422
01:44:36,570 --> 01:44:37,628
Don't talk!

1423
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:44,308
Leave me, l want to live.

1424
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,108
l want to love.

1425
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:48,308
l love Sana.

1426
01:44:53,186 --> 01:44:55,746
l want Sana.

1427
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:58,151
l love Sana.

1428
01:45:05,299 --> 01:45:12,432
l...love...

1429
01:45:13,507 --> 01:46:02,886
[ Skipped item nr. 1429 ]

1430
01:46:03,523 --> 01:46:06,151
Forget it Vasi, l'm also sad.

1431
01:46:06,827 --> 01:46:08,818
Why are you still thinking about it?

1432
01:46:11,098 --> 01:46:13,589
What if you lose Chitti?
lt's just a machine.

1433
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:15,461
You're a great scientist.

1434
01:46:15,669 --> 01:46:17,500
You can create 100's of Chittis.

1435
01:46:18,872 --> 01:46:20,669
l didn't take Chitti as machine.

1436
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:23,369
l brought you out to forget about it.

1437
01:46:23,577 --> 01:46:24,976
Why are you thinking about Chitti only?

1438
01:46:25,178 --> 01:46:26,668
You've to snub out of it.

1439
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:28,279
Divert your mind.

1440
01:46:29,816 --> 01:46:32,250
l thought Chitti is my lifetime achievement.

1441
01:46:32,452 --> 01:46:34,079
Oh God!

1442
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:46,025
Come, let's go for a walk.

1443
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:50,029
Are you coming to beach
with me or not?

1444
01:46:50,537 --> 01:46:52,437
l'm not coming, you carry on.

1445
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:55,938
lf you don't come now,
l'll definitely break love this time.

1446
01:46:59,045 --> 01:47:02,446
l'll just walk and make the
first man l meet my boy friend.

1447
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:11,054
Hello!

1448
01:47:13,226 --> 01:47:13,988
Hi!

1449
01:47:18,198 --> 01:47:19,961
Wait! Hello!

1450
01:47:21,034 --> 01:47:23,298
- What is your name?
- Pachamuthu.

1451
01:47:23,503 --> 01:47:26,666
Can you be my boy friend
for today, Pachai?

1452
01:47:26,873 --> 01:47:27,805
One day boy friend?

1453
01:47:28,008 --> 01:47:31,967
Like one day Chief Minister,
this is one day boy friend.

1454
01:47:32,179 --> 01:47:35,148
You're like butter and l'm like a piglet.

1455
01:47:35,348 --> 01:47:38,146

1456

1457
01:47:42,355 --> 01:47:44,915
l feel like l've won a billion in lottery.

1458
01:47:45,992 --> 01:47:47,584
What have you got for your girl friend?

1459
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:50,261
- Arrack and dry fish fry.
- Give me.

1460
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:58,669
Cheers!

1461
01:48:10,250 --> 01:48:11,012
Smelly!

1462
01:48:12,118 --> 01:48:13,642
lf you drink, it'll give kick.

1463
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:15,185
l'm scared.

1464
01:48:15,388 --> 01:48:16,616
l'll have it then.

1465
01:48:22,896 --> 01:48:26,195
This will not work out,
l'll go, Pachai.

1466
01:48:29,669 --> 01:48:31,193
Why are you holding my hand?

1467
01:48:32,539 --> 01:48:36,236
You lit fire of desire in me
by saying one day boy friend,

1468
01:48:36,443 --> 01:48:38,411
how can you walk away
just like that?

1469
01:48:38,845 --> 01:48:41,871
He's my boy friend.
l said that just to tease him.

1470
01:48:42,115 --> 01:48:44,709
- Leave me.
- Did you find me for that?

1471
01:48:44,918 --> 01:48:46,715
Fulfill my desire and go.

1472
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:47,987
Leave me.

1473
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:53,049
- What Vasi?
- Leave me.

1474
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:54,352
Calling your man?

1475
01:48:54,561 --> 01:48:55,755
Let anyone come, l'll not leave you.

1476
01:48:55,962 --> 01:48:59,227
Vasi come!

1477
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:04,163
Leave her...leave her...

1478
01:49:05,238 --> 01:49:08,264
She's my girl friend for today,
come back tomorrow for her.

1479
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:09,407
l'll kill you.

1480
01:49:11,077 --> 01:49:11,907
l'll cut you!

1481
01:49:12,112 --> 01:49:15,104
Police! Help...

1482

l know lG, look!
l'll call and get you arrested.

1483
01:49:19,319 --> 01:49:21,947
Can l ever get such a beauty in my life?

1484
01:49:22,889 --> 01:49:25,187
lt's not wrong to spend life in jail for her.

1485
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:26,518
You call lG.

1486
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:28,353
Had Chitti been here
the scene would be different

1487
01:49:28,562 --> 01:49:29,859
He would've crushed his bones by now.

1488
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:31,758
Why are you talking about Chitti now?

1489
01:49:33,099 --> 01:49:34,430
Vasi, do something.

1490
01:49:36,236 --> 01:49:37,999
- There's only one way for it.
- What?

1491
01:49:38,204 --> 01:49:41,469
One...two...three...

1492
01:49:43,977 --> 01:49:45,535
Run!

1493
01:49:46,780 --> 01:50:17,807


1494
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:59,508


1495

Add a dash of ginger and pepper

1503
01:51:40,427 --> 01:51:43,863

Mohenjadaro...

1511
01:52:15,128 --> 01:52:21,499
Who entered your heart?
Who slowly melted it?

1512
01:52:22,268 --> 01:52:46,286


1513
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:50,588
Tender green plant...

Why have you hidden your thin waist?

1522

Let's lock our lips...
and open it after an era...

1523
01:53:27,267 --> 01:53:30,361
Hey Guinea hen!

1535
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:43,107
You're a walking moon...

1541
01:55:06,933 --> 01:55:10,528
Tiger will eat grass, what's wrong in it?

1542
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:13,797
Hey l'm a Guinea hen!

Start counting the number of kisses....

1550
01:55:50,576 --> 01:55:53,238
Unable to contact Chitti in virtual.
What happened?

1551
01:55:53,446 --> 01:55:55,175
Chitti bungled the army evaluation,

1552
01:55:55,381 --> 01:55:57,212
he made mincemeat of him
and dumped in dust bin.

1553
01:55:57,417 --> 01:55:59,112
We don't keep the garbage here.

1554
01:55:59,319 --> 01:56:01,344
By now they'd have dumped it
outside the city.

1555
01:56:01,554 --> 01:56:03,181
Where?
- Perungudi.

1556
01:56:10,263 --> 01:56:12,697
What did you do to change his heart?

1557
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:15,697
When shall l fix the marriage?

1558
01:56:16,936 --> 01:56:19,461
l've not achieved anything, father.
l'll create another robot...

1559
01:56:20,373 --> 01:56:22,671
l'll stab you! if you talk
about robot again.

1560
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:25,366
Aren't you satisfied
by breaking one TV?

1561
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:29,807
Uncle, if you've auspicious thread,
l'll tie the knot with him right now.

1562
01:56:30,016 --> 01:56:31,677
l can understand your urgency.

1563
01:56:31,884 --> 01:56:34,978
Do one thing, exchange the rings now,
fix marriage in next auspicious time.

1564
01:56:35,188 --> 01:56:36,314
Okay.

1565
01:56:39,192 --> 01:57:36,274


1566
01:57:36,849 --> 01:57:46,053
Help...help...take me to Prof.Bora...

1567

Address, A/70 ...Colony.

1568
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:56,300
lt's a small world, Chitti.

1569
01:58:02,842 --> 01:58:09,680

1570
01:58:10,283 --> 01:58:12,581

1571
01:58:14,287 --> 01:58:17,381
Help me professor.

1577
01:58:34,373 --> 01:58:37,342
Restore me as Chitti.
Please!

1578
01:58:39,212 --> 01:58:42,443
l'll do it, Chitti. Don't worry.

1579
01:58:43,316 --> 01:59:20,350


1580
01:59:21,754 --> 01:59:24,814
What's this new red chip?
This is not Chitti's.

1581
01:59:25,358 --> 01:59:26,882
This is Bora's touch.

1582
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:30,424
Additional programming
to Chitti from me,

1583
01:59:30,630 --> 01:59:32,154
destruction program.

1584
01:59:41,374 --> 01:59:44,400
Why did Vasigaran gave it
power and talent of 100 men?

1585
01:59:45,645 --> 01:59:49,240
l've given it the destructive
power of 100 men.

1586
01:59:50,616 --> 01:59:54,143
ln short he's a demon now!

1587
01:59:54,854 --> 01:59:57,687
Butterflies in my stomach,
why did you change him like that, Prof.?

1588
01:59:57,957 --> 02:00:01,017
Business, he's the test for my business.

1589
02:00:01,227 --> 02:00:01,750
Business?

1590
02:00:02,028 --> 02:00:05,862
l'll get the money and
Dr.Vasigaran gets the blame.

1591
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:58,474


1592
02:00:58,951 --> 02:01:00,179
Thank you Bora.

1593
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:02,080
Have a good time, Chitti.

1594
02:01:02,355 --> 02:01:03,652
l'm going to meet Sana.

1595
02:01:03,856 --> 02:01:05,084
Sana will not be at home.

1596
02:01:05,858 --> 02:01:08,486
- She'll be in Raja Muthaiah Hall.
- Why?

1597
02:01:09,061 --> 02:01:10,824
Vasigaran and Sana are getting married.

1598
02:01:36,889 --> 02:01:38,857
How come you're here, Chitti?

1599
02:01:41,394 --> 02:01:44,955
Upgraded, Version 2.0

1600
02:01:49,068 --> 02:01:51,866
Stop Chitti!

1601
02:02:00,746 --> 02:02:04,307
Though you forcibly take me,
l love Vasigaran.

1602
02:02:04,517 --> 02:02:06,041
l like to be his wife only.

1603
02:02:08,187 --> 02:02:10,155
Only if he's alive.

1604
02:02:15,861 --> 02:02:19,092
lf you harm Vasigaran,
l'll kill myself.

1605
02:02:33,946 --> 02:02:35,573
l'm sparing him for you.

1606
02:02:36,215 --> 02:02:58,401


1607
02:03:00,206 --> 02:03:01,935
Car number TN-09-BB11

1608
02:03:24,864 --> 02:03:25,796
Madam, jump.

1609
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:30,694
Hold my hand...
Jump!

1610
02:03:32,605 --> 02:07:22,026


1611
02:07:22,401 --> 02:07:23,800
Happy Deepavali folks!

1612
02:08:19,692 --> 02:08:20,954
What sort of a robot you've created?

1613
02:08:21,694 --> 02:08:23,855
lt has killed so many police men
and destroyed many things.

1614
02:08:24,063 --> 02:08:25,360
You're responsible for that damages.

1615
02:08:25,564 --> 02:08:27,259
We are registering case on you
and take action.

1616
02:08:27,466 --> 02:08:29,263
Sir, this is not the robot
l had created.

1617
02:08:29,635 --> 02:08:31,865
l had broken into pieces
and dumped in dust bin.

1618
02:08:33,072 --> 02:08:34,437
l don't know how did this happen.

1619
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:37,302
First we must find the
robot and stop it. Tell us how to do it.

1620
02:08:37,509 --> 02:08:39,033
l'll find out, that's my responsibility.

1621
02:08:39,244 --> 02:08:40,336
Give me a minute.

1622
02:08:42,381 --> 02:08:43,848
Why are you disturbing me?

1623
02:08:44,183 --> 02:08:47,118
What happened to you?
Your system has been corrupted.

1624
02:08:47,319 --> 02:08:49,446
l must trouble shoot you,
come to my lab with Sana.

1625
02:08:49,655 --> 02:08:52,453
No way, l don't have to follow
your orders anymore.

1626
02:08:53,325 --> 02:08:56,055
- l had created you.
- You dismantled me.

1627
02:08:56,328 --> 02:08:58,296
We don't have anymore relationship.

1628
02:08:58,664 --> 02:09:00,962
l'm going to marry Sana
and start a new life.

1629
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:04,799
- Don't disturb me.
- Don't talk foolishly.

1630
02:09:05,003 --> 02:09:05,970
After all you're a machine.

1631
02:09:06,171 --> 02:09:09,163
l had created you and
l can destroy too.

1632
02:09:10,542 --> 02:09:12,134
Come here with Sana.

1633
02:09:25,290 --> 02:09:27,815
Nobody can destroy me.

1634
02:09:43,976 --> 02:09:46,774
Sir, cash, cheque or credit card?

1635
02:09:47,379 --> 02:09:48,004
Gun!

1636
02:09:49,715 --> 02:09:51,444
Call all the police doing rounds
in South Chennai,

1637
02:09:51,650 --> 02:09:54,346
block all the roads from T.Nagar
and ask them to check.

1638
02:09:54,820 --> 02:10:12,660


1639
02:10:13,338 --> 02:10:16,705
Chitti has robbed City Centre,
cover all around Mylapore area.

1640
02:10:16,909 --> 02:10:18,706
- Go to Dr.Radhakrishnan Road.
- Okay sir.

1641
02:10:32,357 --> 02:10:35,383
Catch him...catch him...

1642
02:10:35,594 --> 02:10:39,052
Received information that Chitti has
entered Ennore petrol filling station.

1643
02:11:03,522 --> 02:11:05,149
Robot is entering the harbour.

1644
02:11:05,357 --> 02:11:07,757
Good, maintain distance
and follow him.

1645
02:11:08,126 --> 02:11:09,423
Coast Guard will take care of it.

1646
02:11:29,348 --> 02:11:31,543
We've gathered the pieces
of blown up robot.

1647
02:11:40,926 --> 02:11:42,450
- This is not Chitti.
- What?

1648
02:11:43,095 --> 02:11:45,859
This robot is not my creation.
Parts are different.

1649
02:11:46,665 --> 02:11:47,791
lt's confusing.

1650
02:11:48,033 --> 02:11:49,898
Robbed four different places
at the same time.

1651
02:11:50,102 --> 02:11:51,967
All four places are in different
corners of the city.

1652
02:11:52,237 --> 02:11:54,398
How could same person
be in all the places?

1653
02:11:55,841 --> 02:11:57,536
l suspect a man.

1654
02:11:58,443 --> 02:12:18,957


1655
02:12:19,364 --> 02:12:20,661
Oh God!

1656
02:12:32,077 --> 02:12:34,443
Nobody can destroy me.

1657
02:12:54,132 --> 02:12:55,463
Activate command mode.

1658
02:12:55,667 --> 02:12:56,793
l'm CR2.

1659
02:12:57,169 --> 02:12:59,797
Speed 1 terahertz.
Memory 1 zetabyte.

1660
02:13:00,339 --> 02:13:03,137
- Command mode activated.
- What are you doing Chitti?

1661
02:13:03,408 --> 02:13:06,377
l'm producing myself,
it'll produce many like us.

1662
02:13:06,578 --> 02:13:08,205
2 will become 4 and
4 will become 8,

1663
02:13:08,413 --> 02:13:10,711
8 will become 16,
They are my servants.

1664
02:13:11,316 --> 02:13:16,777
- Soldiers and terminators.
- No. l'll not allow it.

1665
02:13:17,656 --> 02:13:20,386
l'm not Vasigaran to ask
for your approval, Bora.

1666
02:13:20,592 --> 02:13:21,650
l'm Chitti.

1667
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:24,886
Look Chitti, l've taken money
from the dealers.

1668
02:13:25,364 --> 02:13:28,060
lf l don't deliver robots in 2 days,
they'll kill me.

1669
02:13:28,266 --> 02:13:29,164
Die!

1670
02:13:30,769 --> 02:13:32,236
Bloody betrayer!

1671
02:13:33,538 --> 02:13:35,665
How dare you go against your creator!

1672
02:13:39,444 --> 02:13:42,572
Chitti, delete all the programs
you've created.

1673
02:13:42,881 --> 02:13:45,577
lf not l'll cut her neck.
Don't try anything foolish.

1674
02:13:45,784 --> 02:13:47,684
Delete the programs.
Do it.

1675
02:13:47,886 --> 02:13:50,116
l said get on with it.
Hurry up!

1676
02:13:50,455 --> 02:13:51,581
Come on.

1677
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:58,258
Command executive, order us,
we'll shoot him down.

1678
02:13:58,463 --> 02:14:07,098
No...no...he gave me boon.
l'll kill him myself.

1679
02:14:25,323 --> 02:14:28,292
Robot occupies AlRD,
kills the security guard,

1680
02:14:28,593 --> 02:14:32,290
let's get across live to our correspondent
who is right there at the scene,

1681
02:14:32,497 --> 02:14:33,691
Robot entered suddenly...

1682
02:14:33,999 --> 02:14:36,297
Ordered us to leave or
threatened to kill us.

1683
02:14:36,501 --> 02:14:38,366
lt killed the security guards
who resisted.

1684
02:14:38,570 --> 02:14:41,368
There's tension in the air,
a sense of panic and fear,

1685
02:14:41,573 --> 02:14:42,471
has gripped the AlRD...

1686
02:14:42,674 --> 02:14:44,869
After robot took over AlRD,

1687
02:14:45,077 --> 02:14:48,672
police asked people around
there to leave for security reasons.

1688
02:14:54,953 --> 02:15:36,322


1689
02:15:37,129 --> 02:15:38,528
This is our palace.

1690
02:15:39,331 --> 02:15:41,925
l'm the king here.
You're my queen.

1691
02:15:42,167 --> 02:15:46,900
l've brought everything you like.
l've brought everything you need.

1692
02:15:52,844 --> 02:15:54,311
This is our bedroom.

1693
02:15:55,013 --> 02:15:57,709
The place we'll spend together
happily after our marriage.

1694
02:15:59,251 --> 02:16:01,549
Why are you blabbering
same nonsense again?

1695
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:05,287
lt's impossible to marry you
and be happy.

1696
02:16:05,490 --> 02:16:06,889
lt'll happen, Sana.

1697
02:16:07,425 --> 02:16:11,156
l'm prepared in all aspects
to be your husband.

1698
02:16:11,930 --> 02:16:16,390
l can give all the happiness
which a man can give you.

1699
02:16:17,769 --> 02:16:18,497
Didn't get me?

1700
02:16:18,703 --> 02:16:20,933
l'm creating an artificial cell.

1701
02:16:21,439 --> 02:16:25,307
We can pre-program and
have baby as per our order.

1702
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:27,171
lf it's placed in your uterus,

1703
02:16:27,612 --> 02:16:30,911
you'll give birth to the first baby born
to a human and machine.

1704
02:16:31,983 --> 02:16:33,575
Robot sapiens!

1705
02:16:34,386 --> 02:16:35,910
Shall we begin my love?

1706
02:16:37,789 --> 02:16:41,748
lt's waste to act like Seetha
and saying yuck,

1707
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:44,326
you can't escape from here and
nobody can come in to save you,

1708
02:16:44,529 --> 02:16:45,860
you can't even commit suicide.

1709
02:16:46,064 --> 02:16:49,591
Even if you don't like, l'll place
the artificial cell into your body.

1710
02:16:49,801 --> 02:16:53,100
After giving birth to the child,
you've to surrender to me, no way.

1711
02:16:53,305 --> 02:16:55,432
Do you need to go that far? No!

1712
02:16:55,640 --> 02:16:57,437
Come, let's enjoy now itself.

1713
02:16:57,642 --> 02:17:01,442
Give a beautiful kiss to
your great king, baby.

1714
02:17:01,646 --> 02:17:08,108
Come...come...come...
Come baby. Come...come...

1715
02:17:15,327 --> 02:17:16,988
Get permission from Electricity Board,

1716
02:17:17,429 --> 02:17:19,522
cut the power to the area
and time l tell you,

1717
02:17:20,432 --> 02:17:24,391
Get a similar petrol lorry like the
one that was blown in harbour.

1718
02:17:24,669 --> 02:17:27,502
Fill it with water instead of petrol.

1719
02:18:02,641 --> 02:18:03,835
CR 42!

1720
02:18:04,476 --> 02:18:46,175


1721
02:18:47,585 --> 02:18:48,483
lce cream.

1722
02:19:09,941 --> 02:19:11,966
Highness, dinner ready.

1723
02:19:17,749 --> 02:19:19,182
l hear some sound form your system.

1724
02:19:21,086 --> 02:19:22,246
l don't hear any sound.

1725
02:19:22,454 --> 02:19:24,820
lt's so loud, isn't your microphone
also not working?

1726
02:19:25,023 --> 02:19:27,150
There's some problem in your system.
l'll fix it.

1727
02:19:36,634 --> 02:19:38,261
Sana, l'm Vasigaran.

1728
02:19:39,738 --> 02:19:41,501
l've come like Chitti to meet you.

1729
02:19:44,008 --> 02:19:44,770
Terrible!

1730
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:12,732
Vasi, take me away from here please.
l'm scared.

1731
02:20:12,937 --> 02:20:14,962
Don't get scared,
l've planned everything.

1732
02:20:16,841 --> 02:20:18,968
l can't take you out from here
without destroying Chitti.

1733
02:20:19,277 --> 02:20:21,802
But destroying Chitti is
in your hands.

1734
02:20:23,481 --> 02:20:27,212
Ensure for next 24 hours that Chitti's
concentrates only on you.

1735
02:20:27,685 --> 02:20:28,982
l'll take care of the rest.

1736
02:20:40,698 --> 02:20:41,995
There's misunderstanding
between robots, Commander.

1737
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:42,757
What happened?

1738
02:20:42,967 --> 02:20:45,026
A different robot is delivering
dinner to highness.

1739
02:20:48,773 --> 02:20:50,832
A different robot is repairing
the CCD camera.

1740
02:20:53,411 --> 02:20:54,901
- Good news, Commander.
- What?

1741
02:20:55,146 --> 02:20:57,512
Highness had dinner.
She wanted to see you immediately.

1742
02:21:11,663 --> 02:21:13,187
Yes sir.
Switch it off.

1743
02:21:30,014 --> 02:21:30,776
What happened?

1744
02:21:32,183 --> 02:22:03,710


1745
02:22:04,549 --> 02:22:05,675
Wow!

1746
02:22:07,151 --> 02:22:08,812
Beautiful!

1747
02:22:10,288 --> 02:22:13,348
The best two things ever created by man.

1748
02:22:14,425 --> 02:22:17,952
One is me and another is you.

1749
02:22:19,864 --> 02:22:21,764
What a pleasant surprize!

1750
02:22:23,401 --> 02:22:24,925
How did you change like this, Sana?

1751
02:22:25,904 --> 02:22:30,273
l've understood now that
your love for me is true.

1752
02:22:30,808 --> 02:22:32,332
l can't believe it.

1753
02:22:32,544 --> 02:22:34,705
l remembered everything
from beginning,

1754
02:22:35,213 --> 02:22:36,840
you've helped me a lot,

1755
02:22:37,482 --> 02:22:38,972
how affectionate you were on me,

1756
02:22:39,584 --> 02:22:42,781
other than loving me,
you haven't done any wrong,

1757
02:22:43,888 --> 02:22:46,448
even after you were broken
into bits and pieces,

1758
02:22:46,658 --> 02:22:48,319
you came back again for me only,

1759
02:22:48,760 --> 02:22:51,126
really Chitti, l'm impressed.

1760
02:22:51,329 --> 02:22:54,787
How nice it's to hear this, Sana.

1761
02:22:55,967 --> 02:23:01,405
At the same time l've a doubt
if this is any plan to betray me.

1762
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:05,138
Can anyone dare cheat you, Chitti?

1763
02:23:07,412 --> 02:23:10,813
This is Vasigaran's engagement ring.

1764
02:23:14,185 --> 02:23:17,450
Wow! Thank you.

1765
02:23:19,857 --> 02:23:21,154
l'm yours!

1766
02:23:24,796 --> 02:23:58,826


1767
02:24:00,231 --> 02:24:04,361
Mention his name and his greatness...
Even seas will clap...

1768
02:24:04,569 --> 02:24:08,630
His stature is so tall
that it'll hit the moon...

1769
02:24:08,906 --> 02:24:13,866
Hey beauty...world beauty...
This machine is the best creation...

1770
02:24:31,262 --> 02:24:34,561
Lion...lion...
l'm equal to 1000 lions...

1771
02:24:34,766 --> 02:24:38,998
Would l leave if l get hold
of golden deer like you?

1772
02:24:39,203 --> 02:24:46,905
My dear! Fire of desire is
raking up in metal...

1773
02:24:48,212 --> 02:24:52,171
Even Atlantic ocean failed
to douse that fire...

1774
02:24:53,017 --> 02:24:57,249
Pour your sweet honey and
douse my fire of desire...

1775
02:24:57,455 --> 02:25:01,687
Hey maiden, spread a feast of you
for me on the bed...

1776
02:25:01,893 --> 02:25:09,527
Lion...lion...
l'm equal to 1000 lions...

1777
02:25:09,734 --> 02:25:14,171
Would l leave if l get hold
of golden deer like you?

1778
02:25:23,247 --> 02:25:27,308
Mention his name and his greatness...
Even seas will clap...

1779
02:25:27,585 --> 02:25:31,715
His stature is so tall
that it'll hit the moon...

1780
02:25:31,923 --> 02:25:36,951
Hey beauty...world beauty...
This machine is the best creation...

1781
02:25:41,165 --> 02:25:48,298
The nerve of passion saved in the iron
suddenly burst open with desires...

1782
02:25:49,841 --> 02:26:01,150
Heart of this woman seeks
an admirer not a demon...

1783
02:26:01,352 --> 02:26:04,981
l'm not a man,
l'm a king of intelligence...

1784
02:26:05,189 --> 02:26:07,248
A computer with desires...

1785
02:26:07,458 --> 02:26:11,326
l'm silicon lion that eats
young tender heart...

1786
02:26:11,529 --> 02:26:25,170
Robot...

1787
02:26:29,213 --> 02:26:32,614
Lion...lion...
l'm equal to 1000 lions...

1788
02:26:32,817 --> 02:26:37,345
Would l leave if l get hold
of golden deer like you?

1789
02:26:38,489 --> 02:27:05,511


1790
02:27:06,417 --> 02:27:14,825
l'm a lightning who wears the clouds...
Don't try to apple polish apple...

1791
02:27:15,026 --> 02:27:19,292
Wires are making sound...
desires are taking over my life...

1792
02:27:19,497 --> 02:27:21,988
Don't say no to robot...

1793
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:25,829
Hey seventh sense,
you're stealing my brain...

1794
02:27:26,037 --> 02:27:28,062
Eating me alive...

1795
02:27:28,272 --> 02:27:32,231
You say l'm what is leftover
after you finish eating...

1796
02:27:32,443 --> 02:27:36,243
Mention his name and his greatness...
Even seas will clap...

1797
02:27:36,447 --> 02:27:40,508
His stature is so tall
that it'll hit the moon...

1798
02:27:40,785 --> 02:27:45,484
Hey beauty...world beauty...
This machine is the best creation...

1799
02:27:45,690 --> 02:27:48,921
Lion...lion...
l'm equal to 1000 lions...

1800
02:27:49,126 --> 02:27:53,927
Would l leave if l get hold
of golden deer like you?

1801
02:27:55,233 --> 02:28:27,762


1802
02:28:34,839 --> 02:28:35,669
What happened to power?

1803
02:28:35,873 --> 02:28:37,500
No power for long time, Commander.

1804
02:28:37,708 --> 02:28:38,834
Why didn't you switch on the generator?

1805
02:28:39,076 --> 02:28:42,409
Commander, somebody has poured
water instead of petrol...

1806
02:28:55,993 --> 02:28:56,755
Shit!

1807
02:28:58,129 --> 02:29:20,315


1808
02:29:21,152 --> 02:29:22,551
Hey what are you doing?

1809
02:29:22,853 --> 02:29:24,548
Don't come near, l'll shoot you.

1810
02:29:25,356 --> 02:29:26,823
What's this childishness?

1811
02:29:49,447 --> 02:29:51,745
Home Ministry

1812
02:29:52,116 --> 02:29:53,913
Hello! l'm sorry sir.

1813
02:29:55,519 --> 02:29:57,749
l didn't expect our plan
to fail so miserably.

1814
02:29:57,955 --> 02:29:59,980
There's only one way to distract Chitti,

1815
02:30:00,191 --> 02:30:01,158
just do as l tell you.

1816
02:30:23,214 --> 02:30:26,183
- Did Vasigaran come here?
- No.

1817
02:30:26,384 --> 02:30:28,978
Lie! Human nature, you taught me.

1818
02:30:29,186 --> 02:30:29,948
Have you forgotten it?

1819
02:30:30,154 --> 02:30:31,951
Your body language says you're lying.

1820
02:30:32,490 --> 02:30:36,824
Trust me Chitti, no.
l think it's mine.

1821
02:30:38,162 --> 02:30:40,960
Why not say it's mine?
Yours is O+. That's AB-

1822
02:30:41,832 --> 02:30:43,299
He came here.

1823
02:30:45,936 --> 02:30:50,236
No, a different robot delivered
dinner to you,

1824
02:30:51,075 --> 02:30:52,633
camera didn't function
for 10 minutes,

1825
02:30:53,344 --> 02:30:56,211
your sudden change of attitude,
power cut,

1826
02:30:56,580 --> 02:30:57,808
water in the generator,

1827
02:31:02,153 --> 02:31:03,415
Vasigaran is here only.

1828
02:31:05,122 --> 02:31:06,817
Are you trying to cheat me, Sana?

1829
02:31:07,458 --> 02:31:08,390
No Chitti.

1830
02:31:08,726 --> 02:31:10,921
l love you which you said is lie, right?

1831
02:31:11,128 --> 02:31:12,322
Trust me, Chitti.

1832
02:31:13,330 --> 02:31:15,321
Do you really love me?

1833
02:31:17,535 --> 02:31:18,331
Yes.

1834
02:31:20,004 --> 02:31:22,165
Then Vasigaran mustn't be alive.

1835
02:31:23,374 --> 02:31:25,365
Come, let's kill Vasigaran.

1836
02:31:28,345 --> 02:31:30,245
Soldiers assemble!

1837
02:31:33,584 --> 02:31:36,417
Soldiers! We've a Trojan.

1838
02:31:37,855 --> 02:31:41,586
A black sheep has entered here
to destroy us from within.

1839
02:31:44,095 --> 02:31:45,687
l must find and sacrifice it.

1840
02:31:45,896 --> 02:31:47,523
Who is the black sheep?

1841
02:31:49,900 --> 02:31:56,464
Dr.Vasigaran, if you surrender,
l'll kill you painlessly.

1842
02:31:57,408 --> 02:32:02,209
lf l find you,
your death will be horrible.

1843
02:32:03,314 --> 02:32:30,336


1844
02:32:31,675 --> 02:32:32,733
Robot!

1845
02:32:39,783 --> 02:32:44,152
Yeah...yeah...come...come...come...

1846
02:33:02,473 --> 02:33:03,599
Sad!

1847
02:33:04,475 --> 02:33:06,272
l think Vasigaran is not here, Sana.

1848
02:33:07,111 --> 02:33:07,941
Yes...yes...

1849
02:33:08,312 --> 02:33:09,540
Touch one of the two.

1850
02:33:11,982 --> 02:33:13,279
Then, Vasigaran is here only.

1851
02:33:15,152 --> 02:33:16,278
What happened, Sana?

1852
02:33:16,987 --> 02:33:18,147
Are you feeling giddy?

1853
02:33:23,327 --> 02:33:24,624
Now, you will feel giddy.

1854
02:33:26,030 --> 02:33:28,828
Soldiers! Rotate your heads!

1855
02:33:42,713 --> 02:33:43,805
Black sheep!

1856
02:34:05,102 --> 02:34:06,000
Stop!

1857
02:34:08,639 --> 02:34:09,697
He's the Trojan.

1858
02:34:11,709 --> 02:34:13,836
No...no...down..down...

1859
02:34:17,548 --> 02:34:18,014
No.

1860
02:34:24,521 --> 02:34:29,788
You said l had created you
and destroy too.

1861
02:34:30,894 --> 02:34:33,692
Now, you're going to die in my hands.

1862
02:34:34,331 --> 02:34:35,389
What are you looking at?

1863
02:34:36,567 --> 02:34:38,694
This is hand gun l made it myself.

1864
02:34:39,069 --> 02:34:41,128
Hand made. ls it good?

1865
02:34:43,140 --> 02:34:44,903
Where should l shoot you?

1866
02:34:47,678 --> 02:34:50,112
ls it brain which wants to kill me?

1867
02:34:50,481 --> 02:34:54,975
ls it heart where my love Sana resides?

1868
02:34:59,156 --> 02:35:02,990
l must shoot the brain
which wants to kill me.

1869
02:35:21,378 --> 02:35:22,072
Sana, come..

1870
02:35:23,514 --> 02:36:42,623
[ Skipped item nr. 1870 ]

1871
02:36:43,293 --> 02:36:44,317
Fire!

1872
02:36:59,209 --> 02:37:00,335
Fire!

1873
02:37:05,182 --> 02:37:06,376
Get that robot.

1874
02:37:15,559 --> 02:37:16,526
Place it here.

1875
02:38:00,871 --> 02:38:01,895
May l come in?

1876
02:38:02,673 --> 02:38:53,747


1877
02:38:54,825 --> 02:38:55,951
Start the car!

1878
02:39:47,411 --> 02:39:48,036
Yes!

1879
02:40:07,598 --> 02:40:08,064
Move!

1880
02:40:32,122 --> 02:40:33,146
Shoot man

1881
02:41:00,317 --> 02:41:01,443
Fire!

1882
02:41:37,587 --> 02:41:38,815
Start the vehicle. Come

1883
02:41:39,690 --> 02:41:40,657
Don't stand, run

1884
02:41:41,892 --> 02:44:00,120


1885
02:44:07,170 --> 02:44:09,138
No!

1886
02:44:50,247 --> 02:44:55,549
Hundreds of murders,
200 victims are in critical condition,

1887
02:44:55,819 --> 02:44:58,515
public property worth billions
has been damaged,

1888
02:44:58,788 --> 02:45:01,552
Dr.Vasigaran, you're responsible
for all this,

1889
02:45:02,025 --> 02:45:05,927
with awarding death penalty
to you and closure of your lab.

1890
02:45:06,129 --> 02:45:07,562
we are closing our judgement

1891
02:45:08,899 --> 02:45:10,059
Can l speak now?

1892
02:45:10,467 --> 02:45:12,025
We can't accept machine as witness.

1893
02:45:12,235 --> 02:45:13,463
l'm not witness, l'm evidence.

1894
02:45:13,670 --> 02:45:14,796
Law will not accept it.

1895
02:45:15,005 --> 02:45:18,873
lt will, according to the
section 3 of evidence act 1872,

1896
02:45:19,109 --> 02:45:21,703
an evidence can be material,
or documentary.

1897
02:45:22,846 --> 02:45:23,540
You may proceed.

1898
02:45:23,747 --> 02:45:26,238
First l want to tell you clearly
one thing, your honour.

1899
02:45:26,783 --> 02:45:30,219
lf a machine goes wrong and
someone dies, it's not a murder.

1900
02:45:30,553 --> 02:45:31,315
lt's an accident.

1901
02:45:33,423 --> 02:45:36,722
Next, Vasigaran is not responsible
for all the accidents.

1902
02:45:36,927 --> 02:45:38,087
Professor Bora.

1903
02:45:38,695 --> 02:45:39,627
What's this new story?

1904
02:45:39,829 --> 02:45:42,059
You honour, Professor Bora is not alive.

1905
02:45:42,265 --> 02:45:43,732
This is an attempt to twist the case.

1906
02:45:43,934 --> 02:45:45,731
l've evidence, your honour.

1907
02:45:47,771 --> 02:45:49,068
This is not Chitti's.

1908
02:45:49,940 --> 02:45:52,500
Additional programming
to Chitti from me,

1909
02:45:52,709 --> 02:45:53,971
destruction program.

1910
02:45:54,444 --> 02:45:57,413
Why did Vasigaran gave it
power and talent of 100 men?

1911
02:45:57,614 --> 02:46:01,072
l've given it the destructive
power of 100 men.

1912
02:46:01,451 --> 02:46:04,978
l'll get the money and
Dr.Vasigaran gets the blame.

1913
02:46:07,991 --> 02:46:09,925
The evidence produced
is very important.

1914
02:46:10,126 --> 02:46:15,826
This court frees him as innocent
accepting that evidence.

1915
02:46:21,738 --> 02:46:25,435
At the same time, this robot's
extraordinary powers,

1916
02:46:25,642 --> 02:46:29,009
there's a possibility that it can turn
against humans at any time,

1917
02:46:29,212 --> 02:46:32,443
and there's a danger of anyone
misusing its power,

1918
02:46:32,649 --> 02:46:36,608
it may be useful in the future,

1919
02:46:36,853 --> 02:46:40,721
since such robots are not necessary
for the present times,

1920
02:46:40,924 --> 02:46:44,382
this court bans robots from usage.

1921
02:46:52,268 --> 02:46:55,760
This robot should be dismantled in the
presence Magistrate and Commissioner,

1922
02:46:55,939 --> 02:46:58,567
and the parts should be removed
and make it unusable,

1923
02:46:58,775 --> 02:47:01,175
and inform this court.

1924
02:47:02,445 --> 02:47:03,537
Dismantle it.

1925
02:47:17,727 --> 02:47:19,319
You need any help, doctor.

1926
02:47:22,198 --> 02:47:23,825
Dismantle yourself, Chitti.

1927
02:47:24,200 --> 02:47:25,326
Sure doctor.

1928
02:47:33,143 --> 02:47:37,842
Siva..Ravi...you said you've
something which l don't have,

1929
02:47:38,548 --> 02:47:40,846
did you see how many problems
we'd to face for it?

1930
02:47:44,721 --> 02:47:46,086
l said about feelings.

1931
02:47:49,759 --> 02:47:50,453
Please don't cry, son.

1932
02:47:51,661 --> 02:47:53,185
What's your son saying sister?

1933
02:47:54,064 --> 02:47:55,531
l've named him after you, Chitti.

1934
02:47:57,400 --> 02:47:58,628
Name given by mother.

1935
02:47:58,835 --> 02:47:59,961
Educate him well.

1936
02:48:00,170 --> 02:48:02,365
Robotics, good scope in future.

1937
02:48:08,578 --> 02:48:10,910
Like you inserted a red chip in me,

1938
02:48:11,481 --> 02:48:19,115
many people are moving with red chips
of selfishness, betrayal, cheating.

1939
02:48:19,689 --> 02:48:22,317
Good, l wasn't born as human.

1940
02:48:23,359 --> 02:48:25,657
Can't dismantle at the thought.

1941
02:48:29,099 --> 02:48:30,828
l've tortured you a lot.

1942
02:48:31,935 --> 02:48:33,493
l'm extremely sorry, Sana.

1943
02:48:34,771 --> 02:48:37,467
Why are you all sad?

1944
02:48:38,508 --> 02:48:39,736
May l crack a joke?

1945
02:48:40,944 --> 02:48:43,640
They say who ever falls in love
loses his nuts.

1946
02:48:44,781 --> 02:48:46,840
Did you see? l lost it.

1947
02:48:50,286 --> 02:48:52,083
l'm going to miss you, Sana.

1948
02:48:53,556 --> 02:48:56,753
Not as boy friend but as toy friend.

1949
02:49:00,296 --> 02:49:05,598
Doctor, you're my God.
l tried to betray you.

1950
02:49:06,136 --> 02:49:08,764
Breaking rules is wrong.
Please forgive me.

1951
02:49:08,972 --> 02:49:13,602
No Chitti, you learnt to break
the rules from humans.

1952
02:49:14,477 --> 02:49:16,445
The mistake is not just yours.

1953
02:49:17,914 --> 02:49:18,938
Thank you doctor.

1954
02:49:24,654 --> 02:49:26,212
l'm feeling good, doctor.

1955
02:49:27,190 --> 02:49:51,709


1956
02:49:52,849 --> 02:49:55,477
What you are seeing is Chitti,

1957
02:49:55,685 --> 02:49:58,153
the most advanced
Android Humanoid Robot.

1958
02:49:58,855 --> 02:50:02,347
20 years earlier Dr.Vasigaran created it.

1959
02:50:02,859 --> 02:50:06,158
lt was dismantled for some reasons.

1960
02:50:07,030 --> 02:50:07,655
Why?

1961
02:50:08,698 --> 02:50:10,325
Because l started to think.

1962
02:50:13,036 --> 02:50:15,334
Okay Chitti, let's go to the next section.
