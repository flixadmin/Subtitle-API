4
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,105
So, I know what you're thinking.

5
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,357
Why is that incredibly handsome hedgehog

6
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:17,111
being chased by a madman
with a mustache from the civil war?

7
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,317
Well, fo be honest,

8
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,949
it feels like I've been running
my whole life.

9
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,701
Is this foo much? Am I going foo fast?

10
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,408
It's kind of what I do...
You know what? Let's back up.

11
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,926
This is the island where I'm from.

12
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,338
It had everything.

13
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,765
Sandy beaches, cascading waterfalls,

14
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,717
public access fo loop-de-loops.

15
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,643
And I never had fo cafch a school bus

16
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,972
because I could run
across the entire island

17
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,852
in less than two seconds.

18
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,683
Also there was no school.

19
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,894
I know, pretty sweet island, right?

20
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,570
Yeah!

21
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,775
I was born with extraordinary powers
and was told to keep them secret.

22
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,953
And like any kia,
I did the exact opposite.

23
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,832
That's longclaw. She fook care of me.

24
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:12,379
She was basically Obi-Wan Kenobi
jf Obi-Wan Kenobi had a beak and ate mice.

25
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,003
Sonic, someone could have seen you.

26
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,755
No one saw me. I'm too fast!

27
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,757
And I wanted to bring you this.

28
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,925
Get down!

29
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:32,149
Turns out, with great power
comes great power-hungry bad guys.

30
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,226
And I led them right fo us.

31
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,204
Listen carefully, Sonic.

32
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,667
You have a power unlike
anything I have ever seen.

33
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,090
And that means someone
will always want it.

34
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,886
The only way to stay safe
is to stay hidden.

35
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,092
This world is on the far side
of the universe.

36
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,472
You should be safe there.

37
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,305
- I don't want to go without you.
- You must.

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,982
These rings will be
your most important possession.

39
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,405
If you're ever discovered, use one.

40
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,865
Never stop running.

41
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,902
Now go!

42
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,869
Longclaw!

43
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,538
Goodbye, Sonic.

44
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,629
Nol!

45
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,376
Nol!

46
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,824
Come on, one car?

47
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,377
I'm bored.

48
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,001
Tom, do you read me? Are you there?

49
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,842
No, Wade,
I'm actually on a yacht in Barbados.

50
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,554
With Rihanna.

51
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,671
O-m-g.

52
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,347
That's amazing. Please send pics.

53
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,470
No, Wade. I'm at the speed trap.

54
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,724
Already? How did you get back so fast?
Barbados is in the ocean!

55
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,554
Hang on, I think I got something.

56
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,732
Hey, buddy! Where's the fire?

57
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,612
Got kids living around here.

58
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,240
I thought that was kind of funny. Sorry.

59
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,296
What?

60
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,623
Tom, we need you down on main street.

61
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,544
There's been a violent gang shoot-out.

62
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,417
Just kidding. A duck stole a bagel.

63
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,173
But they do need it back.

64
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,349
Whoa, buddy. You almost
got yourself killed out there.

65
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,480
What are you,
some kind of adrenaline junkie?

66
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,654
It must be rough being slow all the time.

67
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,028
Tell you what. Today is your lucky day.

68
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,830
Have you ever felt so alive?

69
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,743
This is great. You're doing amazing.

70
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,328
Oh, geez!

71
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,838
Good recovery.

72
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,760
Let's keep this our little secret, okay?

73
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,010
You never saw me. I was never here.

74
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,070
So, what were you expecting?

75
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:52,151
A dirty little hedgehog eating berries
and struggling fo survive?

76
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,739
Think again. Because I am
living my best life on earth.

77
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,494
I've got a library...

78
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,876
A home gym,

79
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,079
and a slate-of-the-art security system.

80
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,603
Oh, no.

81
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,059
And if I'm ever discovered,
[Ll follow longclaw's instructions

82
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,983
and use my rings
lo escape to a new planet.

83
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,237
A nice, safe little world
filled only with mushrooms.

84
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,737
Gross, smelly mushrooms.

85
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,365
I hate mushrooms.

86
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,831
But let's not worry about all that.

87
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,332
This is green hills,
the greatest place on earth.

88
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:50,630
These are my people, Ana, aare I say,
I am their lovable space creature.

89
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,551
So what if they don't know I exist?

90
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,724
My favorite person is the donut lora,

91
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,181
protector of this town

92
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,980
and defender of all creatures,
big and small.

93
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,067
Morning.

94
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,937
Donald. Daisy. Daffy.

95
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,611
Donut lord lives with pretzel lady.

96
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,863
She is super nice to animals

97
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,988
and strangely was born without bones.

98
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,986
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

99
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,289
There is one person in town
who's actually onto me.

100
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,583
He calls me the blue devil.

101
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,535
I almost caught him last night.

102
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,461
Say hello to crazy Carl.

103
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,592
We have fun together.

104
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,796
I know you're out there!

105
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,803
And I know you're real!

106
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,431
No, I'm not!

107
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,604
Movie night is my favorite.

108
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,602
Please, please.

109
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,649
Yes! Keanu!

110
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,352
You are a national treasure.

111
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,813
- When I find you...
- Pop quiz, hotshot.

112
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,647
There's a bomb on a bus.

113
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,153
"Pop quiz, hotshot."

114
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,863
It's a classic line.

115
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,536
Basically, we're like a family.

116
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,035
Even though we haven't met yet.

117
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:07,620
You don't think your prolonged isolation
is making you a bit crazy perhaps?

118
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,625
Crazy? Me?

119
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,298
No way, doc. You got me all wrong.

120
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,754
And despite all these so-called friends
of yours, deep down,

121
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,884
you're still rather lonely?

122
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,894
Perhaps afraid you'll be alone forever?

123
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:45,908
Uh-uh. Hey! No, no.

124
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,617
Get out of there. Come on.

125
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,044
Oh, come on! Get out of there!

126
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,543
Get out of there, you trash pandas.

127
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,926
Maddie, as green hills'
most respected veterinarian,

128
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,050
what is the fastest way
to exterminate a raccoon?

129
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,598
Hi, ozzy. Hello! You're glad to see me.

130
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,885
You don't eat garbage, do you?

131
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,014
What's that?

132
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,522
- Is that what I think it is?
- Uh-huh. Open it.

133
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,982
Oh, it's kind of small. Is that bad?

134
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,776
Just open it.

135
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,529
"Dear Thomas,

136
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,500
we have reviewed your application
to the San Francisco police department,

137
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,202
and pending interdepartmental review
and background check,

138
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,659
we are happy to inform you that you have
been selected to join our team."

139
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,164
Oh, my god! “Wow.

140
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,163
Oh, my god.

141
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,633
Ta-dal

142
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,125
"San Francisco sucks."

143
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,514
Wrong one!

144
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,882
Ta-dal

145
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,515
- you never had a doubt, huh?
- No! Mm-mmm.

146
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,983
- I can't believe this.
- Oh, I know! You did it.

147
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,107
Hey, what are those?

148
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,732
Apartments for rent I found on zillow.

149
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:05,821
I thought ozzy and I could fly there
tomorrow and check out some neighborhoods.

150
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,241
I mean, this is all happening so fast.

151
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,997
Oh, man. It's the craziest thing.

152
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,329
You apply for the job, you get the job.

153
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,914
Well, pending a background check.

154
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,089
Oh, man.

155
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,590
Hope they don't find out about that time
you used the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

156
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,636
Correction: I'm still using
the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

157
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,640
But, maddie, are you sure
you're okay with this?

158
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,764
Thomas Michael wachowski,

159
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,187
what did you do the entire time
I was in veterinary school?

160
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,230
I worked a second job
to pay the rent and...

161
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,104
A third job to pay tuition.

162
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,108
You sacrificed for me.
I'm happy to sacrifice for you.

163
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,074
Babe, are you sure you're okay with this?

164
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,740
I mean, there's been
a wachowski protecting this town

165
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,787
for more than 50 years.

166
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,199
This is a big change.

167
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,576
I'm positive.

168
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,213
It's time for this guy to get out there
and prove himself.

169
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,168
I love green hills, but, you know,
I want to help people in real trouble.

170
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,467
I want someone to turn to me
in a life-and-death situation

171
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,218
and I'll be there for 'em.

172
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,133
I get it.

173
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,186
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

174
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,064
And so it is with a heavy heart
that I tell you all

175
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,359
that I've accepted a position
at the San Francisco police department,

176
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,152
effective immediately.

177
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,028
It's gonna be tough to leave my hometown
and all my friendships.

178
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,110
But this is something
I feel like I need to do

179
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,286
to grow... as both an officer and a man.

180
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,203
What do you think, sergeant sprinkles?

181
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,964
That wasn't so bad, right?

182
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,001
Now all I gotto do is...

183
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,545
Tell everyone who isn't a donut.

184
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,974
Whoa, the playoffs!

185
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,304
So cool.

186
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,548
Bottom of the ninth, tie score.

187
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:46,110
And exactly who you want at the plate
with the game on the line... Sonic!

188
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,986
But staring him down
from the pitcher's mound

189
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,285
is the most fearsome southpaw
in green hills...

190
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,737
Also Sonic.

191
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,288
Okay. Focus, Sonic.

192
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,333
If you win this game, you'll be
the most beloved kid in green hills.

193
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,216
Hit it to the guy in left!
He's a real space case.

194
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,380
I can't with that guy.

195
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:14,593
Hey, batter Sonic. Hey, batter Sonic.
"Suh-wing," batter Sonic.

196
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,601
I got it, I got it, I got it!

197
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,895
I don't got it.

198
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,830
Go home! Go home!

199
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,658
Come on!

200
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,630
Safe!

201
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,795
Yes! Yes! I did it!

202
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,676
Did you see that? I did it. I did it.

203
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,774
I really am alone.

204
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,031
All alone. Forever.

205
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,691
I'm sure no one noticed
that giant blue explosion, right?

206
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,622
- Hey, Wade.
- Hi, Tom.

207
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,416
Wade here.

208
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,164
What is going on?

209
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,166
Well, gosh, I think the power's out.

210
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,590
Yeah, no dur! The lights are out.
The whole town is freaking out.

211
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,668
- What should I do?
- Okay, relax.

212
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,593
Take a deep breath, call Gil,

213
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,763
see if they can locate
the downed line, then...

214
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,263
Call zim and see if he can
get his generator over to the super q

215
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,593
so the food stays fresh.

216
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:24,476
Call zim before Gil?

217
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,979
- Call Gil... hello?
- I'll call you back.

218
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,310
Wait! Hello?
Was that the end of the instructions?

219
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,818
Okay, all right. You can do this.

220
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,740
What was the first thing he said to do?

221
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,497
Right. Relax.

222
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,729
Twenty minutes ago,

223
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:06,476
an energy surge knocked out power
across the entire pacific northwest.

224
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,567
What do we know?

225
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,064
Well, our first instinct was
it was an emp.

226
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,563
But electromagnetic pulses
don't have that kind of power.

227
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,240
NASA has ruled out
meteor strikes or solar flares.

228
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,805
The department of energy says
it's not a power plant malfunction.

229
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,696
Well, sounds like we're really good
at figuring out what it wasn't.

230
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,077
This could be a prelude
to a larger attack.

231
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,368
I'm suggesting we scramble
the fifth and sixth regiment.

232
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,500
No, no, no, no.

233
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,125
This needs a much more sophisticated mind.

234
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,002
Someone who understands technology.

235
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,835
- You want to send in a lab rat?
- Not just any lab rat.

236
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,419
A lab rat with teeth.

237
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,675
You're not suggesting
who I think you're suggesting.

238
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,506
I know, he's a little weird.
Weird?

239
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,138
- No. No way.
- He's a psychological tire fire!

240
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,642
But he's also brilliant.
Five phds, IQ off the charts.

241
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,394
And his drone tech is revolutionary!

242
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,350
You're sure he can handle this?

243
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,356
He has a perfect operations record.

244
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,358
- Remember the coup in Pakistan?
- No.

245
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,905
Or the uprising in azerbaijanistan?

246
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,075
- That's not even a country.
- Exactly.

247
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,368
And you can thank robotnik for that.

248
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,572
I can't believe
you're bringing that freak into this.

249
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,999
Neither can I, but...

250
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,035
We have no choice.

251
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:35,864
What the...

252
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,335
Are you in charge here?

253
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,590
- Yes, I am...
- Nope!

254
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,591
- My...
- Wrong!

255
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,013
- Name...
- I'm in charge!

256
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,431
- Is major...
- Me!

257
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,179
- Ben...
- I'm in charge.

258
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,658
You've never seen
anything like this before.

259
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:14,647
It says I'm the top banana
in a world full of hungry little monkeys.

260
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,068
Allow me to clarify.

261
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,926
In a sequentially ranked hierarchy
based on level of critical importance,

262
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,066
the disparity between us
is too vast to quantify.

263
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,447
- Agent stone?
- The doctor thinks you're basic.

264
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,620
I'm initiating a sweep sequence.

265
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,706
Ten miles in every direction
should suffice.

266
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,959
- Is he still looking at me funny?
- Yes, he is.

267
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,816
Tell him to stop
or I'll pull up his search history.

268
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,546
If you don't stop looking at the doctor,

269
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,362
- he'll take a closer look...
- I'm not deaf.

270
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,342
And tell him his men report to me now.

271
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:44,134
Excuse me? Listen, pal,
I don't know if you realize...

272
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,056
I'm sorry, major. What was your name?

273
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,804
- Benning...
- Nobody cares!

274
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,263
Nobody cares. Listen, major nobody cares.

275
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,644
You know why nobody cares who you are?

276
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,101
Because nobody cares
about your feeble accomplishments.

277
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,063
And nobody cares how proud your mommy is

278
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,648
that you're now reading
at a third-grade level.

279
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:07,282
Have you finished Charlotte's web yet?
Spoiler alert... she dies in the end.

280
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,409
But she leaves a big creepy egg sac.

281
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,000
My babies.

282
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,256
You know what I love about machines?

283
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,552
They do what they're told.
They follow their programming.

284
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,972
They don't need time off to get drunk
and put the boat in the water.

285
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,558
Now you do what you're told.

286
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,352
Stand over there on the edge
of your personal abyss...

287
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,439
And watch my machines do your job.

288
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,652
- Can you feel it, stone?
- I can feel it, doctor.

289
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,813
It's evolution, stone.

290
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,365
It's evolution!

291
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,521
- Agent stone?
- Doctor.

292
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,528
- Nothing at all, doctor.
- Of course you don't.

293
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,542
Your eyes weren't
expertly trained to spot tracks

294
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,164
by the native American shadow wolves.

295
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,251
That's extraordinary.

296
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,461
No.

297
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,139
What's extraordinary is
I've determined the exact height, weight

298
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,762
and spinal curvature of this creature,

299
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,343
and my computer
can't find a single match for it

300
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,975
anywhere in earth's animal kingdom.

301
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:02,568
This blackout was not a terrorist attack,
and that's no baby bigfoot.

302
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,147
This guy is something else...

303
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,195
Entirely.

304
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,028
Divert all search units
to the site of the footprint.

305
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,489
That's one small step for man,

306
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,870
one giant leap for me.

307
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,130
Okay, okay. Everything is fine.

308
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,307
You played some baseball,
got a little upset,

309
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,386
lightning shot out of your butt,
and now they're coming for you.

310
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,571
All right, all right.
Earth isn't safe anymore.

311
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,519
Time for plan b... mushroomville.

312
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,397
But I gotta take my stuff.
Okay, essential items only.

313
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,820
Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste,
hair gel, night-light.

314
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,943
Funny hat. This half-eaten cantaloupe.

315
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,899
Oh, and my scented candle.

316
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,077
My entire comic book collection.
Beanbag chair.

317
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,744
Can a beanbag chair fit in a backpack?

318
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,823
No, no, no. Of course not. That's stupid.

319
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:00,535
Okay, what else? The rings!
The rings, yes, of course.

320
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,207
Here we go. Ring time.

321
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,960
Mushroom planet, here I come.

322
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,174
Oh, no. They're right outside.

323
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,967
I gotta go somewhere else.

324
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,303
Goodbye, cave.

325
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,191
Whatcha doing?

326
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,767
Just coloring with jojo and Rachel.

327
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,944
Ah, that sounds half fun.

328
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,192
Hey, exciting stuff here.
We had a power outage.

329
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,148
The whole town went dark.

330
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,575
It was like a sign telling me
to get out of dodge.

331
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,698
- Wade must have lost his mind.
- Yeah.

332
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,201
And he does not have much to lose.

333
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,908
How's your sister?
Did she convince you to leave me yet?

334
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,245
No, but she did tell me
to check your phone for dating apps.

335
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,484
The only apps on my phone
are the ones that came with it

336
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,464
and the olive garden.

337
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,463
- Because when you're there...
- You're family.

338
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,008
No way.

339
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,887
The raccoons are back.

340
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,843
And they are in for a surprise.

341
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,351
Your surprise better not be
my tranquilizer gun.

342
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,441
They're just hungry.

343
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,187
And also, that's for bears.

344
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,270
- Good. Now I know it'll work.
- Tom!

345
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,481
I'm kidding. I'm just gonna
use it to scare 'em.

346
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,815
Possibly to death.

347
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,150
- Love you, honey. Bye!
- Tom...

348
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,199
D-1-v-o-r-c-e.

349
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:24,911
Okay, I'm in.

350
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,667
With minimal damage
to donut lord's property.

351
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,752
Here we go.

352
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,404
It didn't work out on earth,
but that's okay.

353
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,713
You're going to a safe world.

354
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,296
A nice, safe world full of mushrooms...

355
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,554
Mushrooms that'll be your only friends.

356
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,555
That sounds awful. I can't do this.

357
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,682
You have to do it.
There's no other option.

358
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:45,775
All right.

359
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,735
Sfpd, pending background check.

360
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,312
Paws in the air!

361
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,699
Uh, meow?

362
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:07,245
"San... Francisco"?

363
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,563
No.

364
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,987
What?

365
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,052
The blue devil.

366
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,446
- Donut lord?
- It can talk.

367
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,574
You're not here to abduct me, are you?

368
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,071
You abducted me.

369
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,825
Okay, that's a fair point. What are you?

370
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,748
Why are you hiding out in my garage?

371
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,166
I needed somewhere safe.

372
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,619
And you're the only person
I could think of, donut lord.

373
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,067
Why do you keep calling me donut lord?

374
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,958
'Cause you talk to donuts
and then eat them if they get out of line.

375
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,796
Again, fair.

376
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:39,299
Wait. Where are all the mushrooms?
Why am I still on earth?

377
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,677
What is... oh, no! I lost my rings.

378
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,053
What?

379
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,354
What's happening?
Is this your mother ship?

380
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,651
I'm not in the mood to get probed.

381
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,445
You think you're worried?
I'm not even wearing pants.

382
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,325
What the...

383
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,268
- They're coming for me!
- Who? What's that got to do with me?

384
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,412
I don't have time to explain,
but you have to help me.

385
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,543
No, I don't. Why?

386
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,122
Well, my legs, which normally
would be classified as lethal weapons,

387
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,332
feel like spaghetti.

388
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,213
I need your help.
Please. It's life or death.

389
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,723
Fine. Come with me.

390
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,599
Little help?

391
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,824
All right, stay here. And be quiet.

392
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,657
Good plan. Great plan!
We're already working so well together.

393
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,662
Practically finishing
each other's sentences.

394
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,711
Okay, bye.

395
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,419
Can I help you?

396
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,681
Good morning, my rural chum.

397
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,687
I'm... from the power company,
investigating the blackout.

398
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:15,106
If you don't mind, I'd like to take
a few readings inside your house?

399
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,025
No kidding? You're from the power company?

400
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,649
You must know my buddy Spencer.
We play softball together.

401
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,150
Spence.

402
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,360
He's a good man.

403
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,906
- Yeah. Come on in!
- Great.

404
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,362
Take all the readings you need.

405
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,197
Except,

406
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,332
doesn't the power company usually take
their readings from outside the house?

407
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,500
That way they can check them
even if you're not home.

408
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,547
Also my buddy Spencer
works for the gas company,

409
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,274
and he's more of an ultimate frisbee guy.

410
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,918
So, you want to tell me
why you think I'm dumb enough

411
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,549
to just let you walk inside my house?

412
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,730
I'm sorry, mister... wachowski.

413
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,682
But everyone calls me Tom.

414
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,643
Except my dentist, he calls me Tim.

415
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,538
But it's gone on for so long
that it would be weird if I corrected him.

416
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,569
Well, Tom whose dentist calls him Tim,

417
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:09,370
you may have noticed that this entire town
has been experiencing a power outage.

418
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,492
Yep, no lights. Picked up on that.

419
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,416
Twenty minutes ago, I tracked
an energy pulse with a similar signature

420
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,585
to the one that caused that disruption.

421
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,431
Listen, mister...

422
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,807
Doctor.

423
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,640
Dr. robotnik. But my dentist calls me Rob.

424
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,816
Look, Dr. robotskeez.

425
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,067
I'm sure what you're here for
is very serious,

426
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,558
but it's got nothing to do with me.

427
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,903
You can ask anyone in town.

428
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,951
- Everyone knows me.
- I bet they do.

429
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,280
I'm sure you're hella popular
with the jebs and merles and Billy Bobs

430
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,957
in this glorified gas-station rest stop.

431
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,251
Betcha go way back
to the days of tippin' cows

432
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,919
and playin' in a jug band!

433
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,047
And maybe someday you'll achieve your goal

434
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,800
of getting a costco card
or adopting a labradoodle.

435
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:14,476
But the reality is, I surpassed
everything you're ever going to do...

436
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,349
Before I was a toddler.

437
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,358
I was spitting out formulas
while you were still spitting up formula.

438
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,227
I was breastfed, actually.

439
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:26,314
Nice. Rub that in my orphan face.

440
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,235
Mr. wachowski,

441
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:33,037
are you familiar with us code 904,
title 10, article 104?

442
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,037
Yeah, who isn't...

443
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:39,334
"Anyone who attempts to aid an enemy
of the United States shall suffer death."

444
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,621
And if I'm the one that catches you,

445
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,589
it'll be even worse.

446
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,009
Worse than death?

447
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,386
Okay, I'm a ball, just a normal ball.
I'm blending in like a ball.

448
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:56,810
Stop talking. No, you stop talking.
Be quiet, Sonic. You be quiet, Sonic.

449
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,479
Oh, I hope they aren't
scanning me with x-rays.

450
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,306
I had kind of an embarrassing lunch.

451
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,369
Don't freak out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

452
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,857
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

453
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,287
I'm freaking out!

454
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,126
Why don't you have
your staircase carpeted?

455
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,544
Compared to what I...

456
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,416
0old pipes. Yeah.

457
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,967
Probably just the house settling.

458
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,715
Nothing to see here!

459
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,005
Hey!

460
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,765
Here's the thing.

461
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,723
I'm never wrong.

462
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,897
Well, first time for everything, I guess.

463
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,352
Would you like some cake?

464
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,727
I hear raccoons have the cleanest mouths
of any animal that routinely eats garbage.

465
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,373
Look at that.

466
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,747
I was right.

467
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,297
Shall we try this again?

468
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,690
I'm going to give you five seconds
to tell me where it is.

469
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,422
- Five.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

470
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,936
- Four.
- Hey, tough guy. I'm a cop.

471
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,299
And you're threatening an officer.

472
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,905
How can you threaten somebody
who never existed? Three.

473
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,275
Come on! Rack your brain.

474
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:40,706
You might be able to come up with some
lame excuse to go on living, in two...

475
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,745
One.

476
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,952
Wait! Don't hurt him!

477
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,388
This feels excessive.

478
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,180
Stay behind me.

479
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,619
Don't worry.
I got it right where I want it!

480
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,713
Can you believe Amazon is gonna deliver
packages with these things?

481
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,169
This was a horrible plan!
What was I thinking?

482
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:39,089
I'm gonna puke!

483
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:46,100
Come on! We gotta get out of here.

484
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,182
Oh, don't tell me that's all you got!

485
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,516
I'm just getting started!

486
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,818
Let me know if you want to go
round two with the blue.

487
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,590
Doctor! Are you okay?

488
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:16,092
I saw a guy race out of here and thought...

489
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,885
That you should stop them?

490
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,092
Open your mouth

491
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,591
and say you thought
that you should stop them.

492
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:26,224
No, I thought that maybe I should check
to see if you were okay.

493
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,914
You know what's hard about being
the smartest person in the world?

494
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,352
You got that one.

495
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,986
Whatever this creature is,
it's our job to secure it,

496
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,990
neutralize it,
uncover the source of its power.

497
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,491
And if it resists...

498
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,784
We take it apart... piece by piece.

499
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,961
See what makes it tick.

500
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,672
- Stone?
- Doctor?

501
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,374
Call optical illusions.

502
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,718
Tell them I need new frames.

503
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,882
They know what kind I like.

504
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,973
Oh, and bring that quill.

505
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,471
Yes, doctor.

506
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,524
All right, pal,
you need to start talking right now.

507
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,023
Who are you? What are you?

508
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,729
I'm a hedgehog!
I feel like that's obvious.

509
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,189
And I'm in big trouble.

510
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,524
Oh, you're in big trouble?

511
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,097
You're not the one who punched
some government weirdo back there.

512
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,908
You think you have problems?
I lost my rings.

513
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,719
- Rings? What are you talking about?
- Okay.

514
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,455
Rings are how all advanced cultures
travel between worlds.

515
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,003
And now mine are
on top of a pointy building

516
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,456
I've only ever seen
on your skintight t-shirt.

517
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,461
Hey.

518
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,508
So, I'd like you to take me
to San Francisco

519
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:42,838
so I can get back my rings and use them
to go to the mushroom planet.

520
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,425
Mushroom planet. Yes!

521
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,388
Right.

522
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,814
Okay, pal, out you go.

523
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,642
- I'm sorry, what?
- Look.

524
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,820
This is the worst possible time
for me to get myself into trouble, okay?

525
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,023
You asked me to save your life,
I saved your life.

526
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,280
Now, please, go find your rings
and your mushroom land.

527
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,098
Hopefully I'm gonna wake up
in a hospital bed

528
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,643
and the doctor's gonna tell me
that my colonoscopy was a big success.

529
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,667
Okay? So goodbye.

530
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,951
- Okay. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

531
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,715
- Why aren't you leaving?
- I don't know where San Francisco is.

532
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:19,882
It's west. West?

533
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,255
- Straight shot, can't miss it.
- Fine. That's cool.

534
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,178
I'm totally cool saying goodbye now.

535
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:33,472
So, as I crashed into the cold,
dark water of the pacific,

536
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,272
I realized a few things.

537
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,313
A, I have no idea where I'm going.

538
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,646
B, salt water stings.

539
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,029
C, I shouldn't even be
on this planet right now, but I am.

540
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,985
Why“? Because you shot me!

541
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,991
- I know.
- You shot me!

542
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:53,246
All right, I heard you the first time.
You don't have to pile it on. Good grief.

543
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,203
I'm wet. I'm cold.

544
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,162
There's a fish on my head!

545
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,466
And clearly, I'm not gonna be able
to do this on my own.

546
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,761
All right, get in the truck.

547
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,592
Really? You're gonna help me?

548
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,332
I guess it is a little bit my fault
that all this is happening to you.

549
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,473
Not a little bit. Entirely.
It is entirely your fault.

550
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,328
Okay, it's entirely my fault.
Are you coming?

551
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:19,897
Yes.

552
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,365
Road trip!

553
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,617
What am I doing?

554
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,639
All right,
there's gonna be rules on this trip.

555
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,496
Number one,
do exactly as I say all the time.

556
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,661
- Got it?
- Got it, donut lord.

557
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,367
Would you stop with the "donut lord"?

558
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,793
I have a name. It's Tom.

559
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,423
I'm Sonic.

560
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,131
Sonic. Sonic.

561
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,627
So you've been spying on us all for years.

562
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,158
I mean, I wouldn't call it “spying.”

563
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,513
We were all just hanging out,

564
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,182
only I wasn't invited
and no one knew I was there.

565
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,760
I can't believe crazy Carl
was right all this time.

566
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,562
Yeah. You should call him
super observant Carl instead.

567
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,978
Oh, my god, stop the car right now!
“What? What?

568
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,230
"The world's largest rubberband ball"?

569
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,529
- We gotta see it!
- No. No.

570
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,278
No, this is not some
fun family road trip, okay?

571
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:11,077
The government wants to dissect you
and arrest me. This is serious.

572
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,239
You're right. It was lame.

573
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,746
Gift shop was cool though.
I got you a mouse pad.

574
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,497
When are we gonna get there?

575
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,670
We will get there when we get there.

576
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,646
I'm gonna go check in with Wade,
see if he knows what's going on.

577
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,228
You're gonna see Wade in that glass thing?

578
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,279
What is it, a teleportation box?

579
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,115
It's a pay phone.

580
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,570
It's mostly for drug dealers
and fugitives from the law, which is us.

581
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,585
Stay in the car.
I don't want anybody seeing you.

582
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,334
Fine.

583
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:20,556
Okay, okay. That is the coolest place
on earth, but you have to stay in the car.

584
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,529
Be strong. Be strong.

585
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,834
Hello. Green hills police department.

586
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,661
- Wade, it's me.
- Hj

587
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,246
I'm so glad that you called.

588
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,798
So, some guys came in
asking some questions.

589
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,547
They're a little creepy.

590
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,299
Kind of reminded me
of the guys from men in black,

591
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,678
but not as likable
or charming as will Smith.

592
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,053
Wait, what kind of questions?

593
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,512
Questions about terrorism?

594
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,724
I told them that
I've gone ice fishing with Tom.

595
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,228
He doesn't know how to make a bomb.

596
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,686
He can't even make bait in the cold.

597
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,800
All right, Wade, listen to me.
This is really important.

598
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,314
Don't tell them that we talked, okay?

599
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,949
You know, I think they already know.

600
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,125
Mr. wachowski.

601
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,377
Tom.

602
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,877
I want you to know
that the only other person

603
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,172
who ever punched me in the face
was the school bully.

604
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,796
He hit me in the cafeteria,
causing a blunt-force contusion

605
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,503
to the soft tissue
surrounding my orbital bone.

606
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,634
Humiliated me
in front of the entire school!

607
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,386
And do you know what I did in response?

608
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,594
I'm assuming that you reported him
to the principal's office

609
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,625
'cause that kind of behavior
is really unacceptable.

610
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,937
No. I examined the inefficiency of a world
where brawn trumped brain,

611
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,985
and I used technology
to resolve that inefficiency.

612
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,155
The boy ate his meals
through a straw for a year.

613
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,981
And I have never lost a fight again.

614
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:55,494
Until today.

615
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,068
Hey, hooray for me then, huh?

616
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,155
No, because you're about to become
the bully with the straw!

617
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,831
I'm coming for you, Mr. wachowski.

618
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,284
And when I catch you, ['ll...

619
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,836
Hello.

620
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,003
Hello?

621
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:09,675
Hello, hello, hello?

622
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:13,001
I think he actually hung up,
because I notice that the light isn't on.

623
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,586
Thank you, officer brainfart.

624
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,797
If you give me a second,
I can get an outside line.

625
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,098
No. Don't be bothered.

626
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:24,100
You just sit there and be "u"... 'Seless.

627
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,779
No one's gonna erase my memory here?

628
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,779
I will tell people about this!

629
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:43,289
Okay, not exactly
the healthiest meal, but...

630
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,495
Sonic?

631
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,880
Oh, no.

632
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,166
No, no!

633
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,766
Yeah!

634
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,648
Howdy, pardner!

635
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,171
I'm not your partner.
Come on. We're leaving.

636
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,937
But there's a zz top cover band.
You gotta see their beards.

637
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,552
You're gonna have to catch 'em
some other time. Let's go. Get up!

638
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,534
If we stay, I promise I won't say
another word for the rest of the trip,

639
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,156
starting... now.

640
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,868
Welcome to the piston pit.
What can I get you fellas?

641
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,245
I want nachos and buffalo wings.
Oh, and guac.

642
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,702
Funny word, isn't it? Guac, guac! Guac.

643
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:33,961
Hey, no kids allowed in here.
What's he got on, some kind of mask?

644
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:38,591
He's actually 43 years old
and suffers from a very rare skin disease

645
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,970
that stunts his growth
and makes him look... like that.

646
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,267
The face, I was born with.

647
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,719
The confidence, I picked up along the way.

648
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,772
- Make his a mello yello, please.
- Okay.

649
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,643
- You owe me one.
- I never sat on a barstool before.

650
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,194
So squishy!

651
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,862
Oh, look at this. It spins.

652
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,860
- Yes.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

653
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,657
- That's nice.
- I feel sick.

654
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,828
Are you having fun? Gonna check
this off the ol' bucket list, huh?

655
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,906
Big night for you.
What's a bucket list?

656
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,824
A bucket list is...

657
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,502
It's a list of things
you want to do in your life

658
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,955
before you, well, kick the bucket.

659
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,665
I've never kicked a bucket either!

660
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,466
Oh, I gotta make my list.

661
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,679
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

662
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,882
Oh, Sonic!

663
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,967
Uh-huh.

664
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,268
What? What's the matter?

665
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,692
There's so much stuff I've never done.

666
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:38,567
And now that I'm leaving earth forever,
I guess I missed my chance.

667
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,768
Well, I guess this is the kind of place
you could get a lot of living done

668
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,453
in a short period of time.

669
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,534
I suppose we can spare an hour.

670
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,166
What? You're gonna bucket-list with me?

671
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:57,090
- Sure, why not?
- You won't regret this.

672
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,666
Oh, I'm pretty sure I will.

673
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,484
New high score!

674
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:34,122
Wait a second. Is this bull
missing a head, or does it have two butts?

675
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,456
This is easy.

676
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:39,666
Okay.

677
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:45,672
I'm a cowboy, baby!

678
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,551
I'm okay.

679
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,277
Yeah!

680
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,524
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.

681
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,106
Nice work, Romeo.

682
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,533
- Glad you're having a good time.
- I am having a good time!

683
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,488
I'm having the best time.
I mean, what could go wrong?

684
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,201
Can we help you?

685
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:16,911
We don't like your kind around here.

686
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,962
Our kind? What kind is that?

687
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,260
Hipsters.

688
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,631
- How dare you.
- Hey. You know what?

689
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,202
We were leaving anyway. Weren't we?
There's not a problem here.

690
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,348
- No, no, no, it's okay.
- No, no, no, we're leaving.

691
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,177
I know exactly
how to handle this situation.

692
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,887
Pop quiz, hotshot.

693
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,314
You just picked a fight
with a poorly disguised hedgehog

694
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,517
who's seen way too many action movies.

695
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,024
What do you do? What do you do?

696
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,148
Am I crazy? It's supposed to break, right?

697
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,766
Break, please. Break, please.
Break this bottle, please.

698
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,280
- Please, please, please.
- Sonic?

699
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,376
Uh-oh!

700
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,755
Nice going!

701
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,552
Thanks! It's awesome right?

702
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,076
All right, who's next? Who wants some?

703
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,761
Who do I get to beat up?

704
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,676
Hey! Has anybody seen my waitress?

705
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,807
Still waiting on those buffalo wings.

706
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:18,351
Why, you!

707
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,117
Uh-oh!

708
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,578
Really?

709
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:04,339
Ole'

710
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,563
- So, should we get out of here?
- Yeah, time to go.

711
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,811
That was amazing!
Wait a second. Did we even pay our tab?

712
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,270
It doesn't matter!

713
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,365
Watch this, watch this.
I always wanted to do this.

714
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,904
- Get 'em!
- See ya, suckers!

715
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:41,161
I can't say for sure,
but I think they liked me.

716
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,372
Come on! Don't let 'em get away!

717
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:47,962
- Yes!
- Yeah!

718
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,381
- Yes!
- Ouch!

719
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,175
- He got you pretty good.
- I'm all right. I've been hit harder.

720
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,094
Did you see how much toilet paper I used?

721
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,389
The next person that goes into that
bathroom will have nothing to wipe with!

722
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,551
The floors were sticky.
The crowd was rough.

723
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,136
And the odds were against us.

724
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:05,519
But there was no stopping
donut lord and the blue blur.

725
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,066
Scratch another one off my list.

726
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,361
You are a weird little dude.

727
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,621
Okay.

728
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:25,952
So, what are we gonna do now?

729
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,999
I'm gonna pass out watching TV.
I think you should too.

730
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,629
But this is my last night on earth.

731
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,460
I want to soak up every last second.

732
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:37,638
All right, anything you can find to do
in this room, you knock yourself out.

733
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,389
Good times.

734
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,278
Oh, come on.

735
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,777
That's awful. What did you eat?

736
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,231
I think it's called a chili dog?

737
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,908
You might want to check your fur
on that one, buddy.

738
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,988
Hey. So, what's this next planet
you're supposed to go to like?

739
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,414
It's no earth, I can tell you that.

740
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:08,245
There's no people, just breathable air
and giant mushrooms and stuff.

741
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,496
Well, look at it this way.

742
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,298
At least you won't be the only "fun-guy."

743
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,381
No. Don't ever do that again.

744
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,887
I liked it.

745
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,100
I'm really gonna miss this place.

746
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:26,896
I know I have to leave earth to be safe,
but what if longclaw was wrong?

747
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,016
Maybe I could have a life here.

748
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,106
All right. We should get some sleep.

749
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,900
You sleep. Don't worry about me.

750
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,158
I'm gonna stay up all night
enjoying earth while I can.

751
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,493
Sure, kid.

752
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,745
As long as we're on the road by 8:00.

753
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,675
I had a chili dog.
That's why my farts smell.

754
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:16,354
Thomas wachowski, accused of committing
an act of domestic terrorism.

755
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,281
Wachowski is considered
armed and dangerous.

756
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,233
Any information regarding his whereabouts

757
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,070
should be reported
lo local authorities immediately.

758
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,789
Did he say where he was going?

759
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,917
Maybe. Maybe not.

760
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,172
Like I'd ever tell you.

761
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,430
Stand down, agent stone.

762
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,803
This well-meaning citizen
obviously doesn't understand

763
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,179
the urgency of the matter.

764
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,142
Really?

765
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,276
Now that's what I call good cop, bad cop.

766
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,531
Left yourself open.

767
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,961
Judging by the quickest route
to San Francisco,

768
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:09,161
the approximate speed of their vehicle,
and local weather conditions...

769
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,204
They should be...

770
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,833
Right about...

771
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,422
Here.

772
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:21,127
- That's brilliant, sir.
- Thanks... for nothing.

773
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,514
- So, what's on your bucket list?
- Who, me?

774
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,202
Yeah. Everyone has a bucket list, right?

775
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,932
Sure, but, I mean,
you're the one leaving earth,

776
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,355
and I'm not planning on dying
anytime soon.

777
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:36,775
Don't be so sure.
Your best friend is a magnet for danger.

778
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,195
- Are you anointing yourself as the bestie?
- Mm-hmm.

779
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,648
A little presumptuous,
but... I mean... what, no...

780
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:46,452
I like you, of course, but,
you know, we're not best friends.

781
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,078
You tucked me in last night.

782
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,781
Fine, fine, fine. Best animal friend.

783
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,616
- That would be my dog, ozzy.
- Okay.

784
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,169
Let's drop this increasingly humiliating
topic of conversation.

785
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,962
Bucket list. Give it to me!

786
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,082
Okay, there is one thing.

787
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,669
In green hills, I've always felt,

788
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:07,052
I don't know, more like a babysitter
than a real cop, you know?

789
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:10,054
So I want a chance to prove myself,
under real pressure.

790
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:13,387
I'm gonna move to San Francisco,
become a street cop.

791
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:15,973
And, I don't know,
see if I have what it takes.

792
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,111
What?

793
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:20,978
Why... why is your face doing that?

794
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,029
You're leaving green hills?

795
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:24,774
Okay.

796
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,610
B-b-but why?
Why would you leave green hills?

797
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,350
This may be hard for you to understand,
but green hills is a small town.

798
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,580
It's a very small town.

799
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:34,500
It's not small.
There are hundreds of people.

800
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,996
That's a small town, dude!

801
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,921
It's a perfect town,
and the people need you.

802
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:42,374
Please. I clean out their gutters.
I jump-start their cars in the winter.

803
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,863
They could call anybody to do that.

804
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:47,926
Sure, they can call anybody,
but they don't. They call you.

805
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,445
Eeny, meeny, miny...

806
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,450
Mayhem.

807
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,902
- You're not making any sense.
- Would you calm down?

808
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,542
You come from a great town
with great people and, by my count,

809
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,548
zero bad guys trying to kill you!

810
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,683
Besides,

811
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:34,386
what could possibly be more important
than protecting the people you care about?

812
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,268
Look, I get your poi...

813
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,646
Yeah!

814
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:56,790
You know what? I was wrong about you.
You're not the donut lord at all.

815
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,583
You're more like the jerk lord.

816
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,036
Have you noticed the harpoon
stuck in our dash?

817
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,089
Sonic!

818
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,886
I was forced from my home.

819
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,659
Your home is perfect,
and you're leaving it.

820
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,344
Why would you do that?

821
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,559
- Your body!
- Oh, no, not again!

822
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,682
Hey! Hold on!

823
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,513
- Why?
- Because I'm gonna do this.

824
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,662
Sonic!

825
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,043
Sonic!

826
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,672
Guess I had a bonus life.

827
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,592
Oh, yeah, baby!

828
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,925
Sonic, one. Big tank, zero. I'm sorry.

829
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,305
- Did we get that on camera?
- How are you not dead?

830
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,103
I have no idea.

831
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,397
- Do you see me dancing?
- Yes, I saw you dance.

832
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,940
Is that all you got?

833
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,938
No, but thank you for asking.

834
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,358
- Uh-oh.
- Sonic! Get back in the truck!

835
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,317
You go. I'll catch up.

836
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,585
I think that tank just had a baby.

837
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,182
Incoming!

838
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,441
- It's my turn!
- You just had one. It's mine!

839
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,610
Hey, stop fighting
or I'm taking that thing away!

840
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:49,732
Yeah, right, dad.

841
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:02,627
Where are you going?

842
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:05,453
Just drive the car.
I'll take care of this.

843
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,412
And if I don't make it, just ditch me.

844
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,747
You seem good at that.

845
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,763
Hey, everyone!
Welcome back to my livestream.

846
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,061
Today we're destroying robots. Step one.

847
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,897
Yes, we did it!

848
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,067
We did not do it. Who is this guy?

849
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,699
Ever wonder
where your tax dollars are going?

850
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:40,825
My turn.

851
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,828
Here, just keep us going straight.
I put it in cruise control.

852
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,659
I feel just like vin diesel.

853
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,585
"It's all about family, Tom."

854
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:55,798
Quick suggestion.

855
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,756
Roll up into a ball
and smash him with your body.

856
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,218
Where'd you learn how to drive?

857
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,682
Here. In this truck.
It's happening as we speak.

858
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:09,975
I can't reach it. Bring him in closer.

859
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,527
- What?
- Bring it in closer! Hit the brakes.

860
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,820
You mean this one?

861
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:15,981
The other brakes!

862
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,336
Give me a big, fat break!

863
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:41,427
This one is cute. Let's keep him.

864
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,011
Oh, come on!

865
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,597
How could something so adorable
be so terrible?

866
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,230
You've got car insurance, right?

867
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,363
Buzz off.

868
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,070
That doesn't sound good.

869
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:05,497
- No, beeping is bad. Get rid of it!
- I'm trying.

870
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,324
Throw it out the win... throw it anywhere!

871
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:09,705
- I can't get it off.
- All right, I'm pulling over.

872
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,507
- Did I get it?
- Nope.

873
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,224
Here. Hold still.

874
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,388
It's going, it's going...

875
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:26,719
It's still here.

876
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,143
Get off me.

877
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:33,194
Nailed it!

878
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,035
Sonic!

879
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:52,623
No, no.

880
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:03,467
Hey. Come on.
You're all right. Wake up. Wake up.

881
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:11,896
Did we get 'em?

882
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,599
No, there they are.

883
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,185
They are real survivors, those two.

884
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,700
Can we have a moment”?

885
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,075
Pin yourself to the wall.

886
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,787
You know,
I won't miss you when you're gone.

887
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:35,746
Human beings are unreliable and stupid,
and I care very little about them.

888
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,548
But my machines are diligent, relentless.

889
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,466
They're everything to me!

890
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,831
Come on, buddy.

891
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,292
You're gonna be all right.
You'll be all right.

892
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,058
- Is maddie here?
- No, no.

893
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,496
- Not today. Goodbye.
- It's an emergency!

894
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,476
- Bye-bye.
- Rachel, stop! Please! Maddie!

895
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,054
Don't do this. This is important.

896
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:36,294
- Oh, my god! Rachel, let him in.
- I am calling the police.

897
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:38,525
No, I am calling the FBI.
I am calling the CIA.

898
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,464
- Stop. Don't do that.
- I am calling your mother.

899
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,149
- Okay, got it.
- Maddie, can we talk?

900
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,150
Tom, what's going on?

901
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,344
You're all over the news.
I've been trying to call you.

902
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,138
I had to ditch my phone
so they couldn't track me.

903
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:48,572
- Ditch his phone?
- Track you?

904
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,075
- Uncle Tommy!
- Jojo! Hey!

905
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,657
Now your niece is an accessory to treason.

906
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,272
- No, she's not.
- Would you calm down?

907
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:57,328
Calm down? I will not calm down!

908
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,037
- Enough.
- Yes, calm down. Stop talking.

909
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,293
No. Ozzy, please. Good to see you too.

910
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,175
Little lord baby Jesus.

911
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,547
What is that, Tom?

912
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,004
Is that plutonium? Is it e-mails?

913
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,804
Yes, it's plutonium.

914
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:11,725
Can we please go in the other room
and talk... stop it, ozzy. Quit it!

915
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,517
This is why I told you he was no good.

916
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:15,971
- I'm not engaging.
- No, ozzy, quit it.

917
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:20,187
Ozzy, no! Ozzy, no!

918
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,110
Oh, catch me, jojo.

919
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,273
Thank god.

920
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,572
Can I get a glass of water?

921
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,672
I just thought you might like a latte
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

922
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:16,512
What do I look like, an imbecile?

923
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,811
Of course I want a latte.
I love the way you make them!

924
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,986
Ready the prototype.

925
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:30,814
With this kind of power,

926
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:34,822
my machines can finally reach
their full potential.

927
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:42,997
He's gonna be okay, jojo.

928
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,084
Oh, thank god. He's gonna be okay, right?

929
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:49,666
I'm a vet, Tom. I don't even know
what I'm looking at here.

930
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,877
He's a hedgehog. Or so he says.

931
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,632
- It talks?
- Almost constantly.

932
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:55,217
Okay.

933
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,266
Holy... what?

934
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,809
His pulse is super fast.

935
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,727
That actually might be normal for him.

936
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,455
I don't know. You gotta help him, maddie.

937
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:05,265
I don't know his physiology.

938
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:07,897
He doesn't seem to have any broken bones.

939
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,194
He's just really banged up.

940
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,699
Oh, look at his poor little feet.

941
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:20,531
Hang in there, buddy.
You're gonna be all right.

942
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,332
Jojo? Untie your mother. Jojo!

943
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,505
Untie mommy.

944
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,707
Sweetie. Jojo!

945
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,378
I have to go to the bathroom.

946
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:37,589
He's gonna be okay, right?

947
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,595
He'll snap out of this.
He'll wake up soon?

948
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,347
Oh, smelling salts!

949
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:44,805
Don't you have, like, vet smelling salts,
like, for cats or parakeets or something?

950
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:48,312
- No. They don't make cat smelling salts.
- They should.

951
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:52,567
I have human smelling salts
in my human first aid kit.

952
01:05:53,992 --> 01:05:55,198
Okay.

953
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,909
- Here we go.
- Come on, buddy.

954
01:05:58,997 --> 01:05:59,997
Gotta go fast!

955
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,746
Where am I? What year is it?
Is the rock president?

956
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:07,498
Whoa, buddy, you're okay. Calm down.

957
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:08,795
Hi, pretzel lady!

958
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,338
Hi.

959
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:12,502
Tom? Yeah.

960
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:13,754
Can I talk to you, please?

961
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,259
Space hedgehog, stay there. Try to rest.

962
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,931
You got it. I am great at resting.

963
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:22,509
I rest faster than anybody.

964
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:23,844
Still talking.

965
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:27,726
First of all, can we take a moment to
acknowledge how under control I've been?

966
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,523
- Amazing.
- Didn't freak out.

967
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,943
- No.
- Totally calm.

968
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,145
Thank you.

969
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,609
Second of all...

970
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:39,367
What the heck is going on?
Is that thing an alien?

971
01:06:39,454 --> 01:06:43,197
Okay, so, remember how crazy Carl
is always going on about the blue devil?

972
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,701
The blue devil!

973
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,908
- That's him? He's real?
- Yeah.

974
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,959
What is he doing here?
What are you doing here?

975
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:53,461
I kinda, sorta, shot our
little blue friend with your trang gun.

976
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,088
- No, you did not.
- I didn't mean to.

977
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,135
Okay. This is kinda hard
for me to explain.

978
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,963
And it's gonna sound a little bit crazy.

979
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:03,676
He has to get to the Transamerica
building, and I promised I'd take him.

980
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,011
Uh-uh! Aliens?

981
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:08,562
Maddie, your husband's lost his mind.

982
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,641
Use this as an opportunity to leave him.

983
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,441
No one would judge you.

984
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,107
So you won't hurt your feet anymore.

985
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,697
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

986
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:24,533
No one's ever given me a gift before.

987
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,373
I gotta check that off my bucket list.

988
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,964
All right! Looking good!

989
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,141
Okay.

990
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,051
You said you wanted to help
people in real trouble, right?

991
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,386
Well, that's what you're doing.

992
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,973
Blue alien hedgehogs
still count as people. Right?

993
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,353
I think so too. Yeah.

994
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,650
- I think.
- Okay.

995
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,898
I love you. Did I tell you that already?

996
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,821
I don't deserve you. You know that?

997
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,193
I know that.

998
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:07,246
So, you're supposed to be Tom's
best friend that he won't shut up about.

999
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,541
Well, I don't see the appeal.

1000
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:13,957
Stop!

1001
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,255
That is very gross.

1002
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:18,883
= Sean

1003
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,178
so, my truck still runs,
but it's pretty much totaled.

1004
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,326
You think your sister would mind
if we borrowed her car?

1005
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,931
You have got to be kidding me!

1006
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:28,581
- She'll be fine.
- Yeah, let's do that.

1007
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:29,890
Mm-hmm.

1008
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:32,267
This is my house!

1009
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,482
Coming through!

1010
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,568
Now this is my turn, and I go around him.

1011
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:41,068
Sorry! And, perfect park.

1012
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,137
- What are you, crazy?
- Is there anything you didn't hit?

1013
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,867
Why did we let the alien drive?

1014
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,912
Hey, I got us here.
And please, five stars.

1015
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:52,621
- So, this is it?
- That's it. That's your pyramid.

1016
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,128
Wow, look at that thing!

1017
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,374
What happens now?

1018
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,874
- He's... gone.
- Yep.

1019
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,586
No good. You need a special key
to get to the roof.

1020
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,972
What now?

1021
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:09,388
Time for me to abuse
the power entrusted to me.

1022
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,812
We got a jumper on the roof.

1023
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,787
Gotta get up there fast or we're gonna
have a human pancake on our hands.

1024
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,071
You came all the way from Montana.

1025
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:28,903
Yeah. That's how serious it is.

1026
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:34,795
Okay.

1027
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,004
You just saved a life.

1028
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,473
How much longer? I can't breathe in here.

1029
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:54,103
Hello? Anybody there?

1030
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,932
- Do you have your child in that bag?
- No.

1031
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,151
I mean, yes, it's a child,
but it's not mine.

1032
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,280
It's not your child.

1033
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,860
Relax. I'm a cop, okay?

1034
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,470
Plus, he likes it in there,
don't you, buddy?

1035
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:07,984
Why would I like it in here?

1036
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,912
This is worse than the dog cage
you had me in earlier.

1037
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:12,874
Such a kidder.

1038
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,456
- Okay.
- No, I'm scared of the dark!

1039
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,295
Is anybody there?

1040
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,386
What were you keeping in this bag?

1041
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,016
A jar of pickled farts?

1042
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:37,597
All right. What are we looking for?

1043
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,275
This.

1044
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:45,070
Okay. What happens now?

1045
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,220
Now all I have to do is think of where I
want the other end of the ring to appear,

1046
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,244
and I throw it.

1047
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,323
So, that's it? We did it?

1048
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:52,745
Yeah. We did it!

1049
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:57,037
Hey. Sorry we didn't get to do
everything on your bucket list, pal.

1050
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:59,835
It's okay.
I did the ones I needed the most.

1051
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:03,294
You two are so cute.

1052
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,625
- Oh, please. What?
- We are not.

1053
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,051
No. We're not cute.

1054
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,800
We are a couple of loose cannons
just living by our own rules.

1055
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:10,891
Exactly.

1056
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,090
Really? Yeah.

1057
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,927
And our rules include
expressing heartfelt emotions.

1058
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,431
If you say so.

1059
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,934
- Okay, then.
- All right.

1060
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,129
- You gotta go, right?
- Yeah, I gotta go.

1061
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:23,393
I gotta go. We gotta go too.

1062
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,069
See... all right, bye-bye.

1063
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:31,572
Just one more thing.

1064
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,544
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

1065
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:47,425
I know it's a tough decision
for you to leave green hills.

1066
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:51,926
Walking away from something
you care about has to be painful.

1067
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:54,223
You're not sure
you really want to go, huh?

1068
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:58,686
I don't want to go, but I can't stay.

1069
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:01,264
As long as I'm here,
I put everyone in danger.

1070
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,391
I can't do that.

1071
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:08,362
I just want you to know
that these last two days have been

1072
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,986
the best two days of my life.

1073
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:15,807
You know, I never thought I'd say this,

1074
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,992
but I'm actually gonna miss you,
you little blue devil.

1075
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,207
I'll miss you too, donut lord.

1076
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:22,254
Thank you.

1077
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:23,922
For what?

1078
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,380
For saving my life.

1079
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:47,230
Okay. Did someone leave
their "find my phone" on?

1080
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,631
Welcome to San Francisco, Mr. wachowski.

1081
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,513
Are you enjoying the clam chowder?

1082
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:21,832
It's the government wack job
who keeps trying to kill us.

1083
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:23,312
Unsuccessfully!

1084
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,319
Nice of you to swing by
on your way to comic-con.

1085
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:26,565
Yeah, what are you wearing?

1086
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:33,072
It's a flight suit, designed to modulate
my body temperature and reduce drag.

1087
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,740
Yeah, and yet you still are one.

1088
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:36,609
Good one.

1089
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:38,660
You are catching fire, Thomas.

1090
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:41,114
And speaking of heat,
I see you've taken a lover.

1091
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:45,330
Does she have a name, or should we
just call her "collateral damage"?

1092
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,536
Hey, watch your mouth.

1093
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,067
Unless you want a little more
of what I gave you earlier.

1094
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,547
I punched him in the face.

1095
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,876
He punched him right in the face!
It was awesome!

1096
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,882
The time for talking is over!
It's time to push buttons.

1097
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:59,136
Your flying eggs are pretty impressive,
Mr. eggman,

1098
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,512
but let's face it, you'll never catch me.

1099
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,469
Confidence!

1100
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:05,600
A fool's substitute for intelligence.

1101
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:14,776
That's not good.

1102
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:18,781
Sonic, I know you got the super speed
and everything, but maddie and I...

1103
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,682
Totally defenseless?
Probably gonna get blown up?

1104
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,037
Pretty much, yeah.

1105
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,332
Don't worry. I know exactly what to do.

1106
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:34,716
I was not expecting that.

1107
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:37,803
But I was expecting not to expect
something, so it doesn't count.

1108
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:39,566
Come on!

1109
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,609
Come on, come on, come on.

1110
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,128
No, no, no!

1111
01:16:08,731 --> 01:16:09,766
Hi, Tom.

1112
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,064
Glad you're here. Could use some help.

1113
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:13,891
Old bessie's about to give birth.

1114
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:16,360
Give me a minute.

1115
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:22,358
Can I give you one genius piece of advice?

1116
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:24,443
Don't run.

1117
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,870
It'll only hurt more if you do.

1118
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:29,243
And it's bad for your joints.
They've proved it.

1119
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,667
All right, eggman. You wanna get fast?

1120
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:32,914
Let's get fast.

1121
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:37,540
The hard way it is.

1122
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,485
That was an illegal left, by the way.

1123
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,281
So, here we are again.

1124
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,075
We've been through so much together.

1125
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,744
Now you understand
why there's a psychotic robot doctor

1126
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:10,073
chasing a supersonic blue hedgehog.

1127
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,749
Want to know how it ends? Yeah, me too.

1128
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,719
How is this possible?

1129
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:33,896
No one's ever caught up to me before.

1130
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,323
Coming through!

1131
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:44,617
Sacrebleu/

1132
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,905
excusez-moi, monsieur!

1133
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:54,208
Here we go. Room to open it up.

1134
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:04,627
I can't lose him!

1135
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,651
If you can't beat 'em, blind 'em.

1136
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,819
Lost visual contact.

1137
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:35,537
You're not allowed up there!
It's one of the seven wonders!

1138
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:12,570
You're an astonishing little creature.

1139
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:17,074
It'll be fun to take you back to the lab

1140
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:19,410
for a litany of invasive
exploratory procedures.

1141
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,042
Any last words?

1142
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,750
Guac. I like that word.

1143
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:29,824
I don't have to tell you
how many scientific breakthroughs

1144
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,214
have been made possible by animal testing.

1145
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:33,389
You're being very selfish.

1146
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:34,637
Going my way?

1147
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:35,934
What the...

1148
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,316
Who the hell do you think you are?

1149
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,147
I'm the donut lord, you son of a...

1150
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:54,995
Autopilot, adjust.

1151
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:57,159
Why?

1152
01:19:57,251 --> 01:20:00,038
Why would you throw
your life away for this thing?

1153
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:01,994
That's why I don't have friends.

1154
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,171
Next thing you know,
you're somebody's best man.

1155
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:07,458
They want to have the wedding out of town.
Like nobody has anything better to do!

1156
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,757
Anyway, where were we?

1157
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:13,385
Oh, yes. You were about to die.

1158
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,350
That's our sheriff you're messing with.

1159
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:22,352
And our blue devil, who,
as everyone can see,

1160
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:26,857
is a very real creature
and not at all invented by me.

1161
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,277
- Careful.
- Just... just put it away.

1162
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,574
Tom?

1163
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,169
I don't mean to be indelicate here,

1164
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,673
but someone should get some ice,
keep the body fresh.

1165
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,924
He's just a silly little alien.

1166
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:58,846
He didn't belong here!

1167
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:02,350
That little alien...

1168
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:06,726
Knew more about being human
than you ever will.

1169
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:08,519
His name was Sonic.

1170
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:11,066
This was his home.

1171
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,490
And he was my friend.

1172
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:39,759
He's all yours.

1173
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:42,853
Everyone get back!

1174
01:21:46,443 --> 01:21:49,105
I think you have something
that belongs to me.

1175
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:01,989
This is my power.

1176
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,666
And I'm not using it to run away anymore.

1177
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:08,211
I'm using it to protect my friends.

1178
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,638
Now you've done it!

1179
01:23:07,733 --> 01:23:09,018
Guess what, eggman?

1180
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:11,646
I'm not leaving earth. You are.

1181
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:13,564
Donut lord?

1182
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,949
- I told you, you got this.
- Hey, we got this.

1183
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:20,008
- I think these belong to you.
- Thank you very much.

1184
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:24,639
- No more pushing people off of buildings.
- You know I can't promise that.

1185
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,222
- You did pretty good, space 'hog.
- Thanks, donut lord.

1186
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:34,433
You're gonna have to explain
this "donut lord" thing.

1187
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:36,610
Nope, sorry.
That's for me and the little guy. Right?

1188
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:39,688
We got our thing,
you got your thing with your... sister.

1189
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:40,783
Oh, my god, my sister.

1190
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:45,577
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

1191
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,279
Jojo, put on my fitbit...

1192
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,036
So I can at least get some steps.

1193
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:51,458
We can never go back there.

1194
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:53,838
I mean, are we"?

1195
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,753
'Cause it kind of feels like
we're home right now.

1196
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:00,630
Really?

1197
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:06,716
I kind of feel like I checked
the "save a life" box off my bucket list.

1198
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:13,147
Now all I want to do is spend my life
with the people I care about.

1199
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:15,808
I want to check that box.

1200
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:18,860
Okay, I like that.

1201
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:22,022
All right, everybody. Nothing to see here.

1202
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,197
Let's disperse.

1203
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:25,150
Just another ordinary day in green hills.

1204
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:26,701
Carl, I'll take that chain saw.

1205
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:29,242
Come on. Let's go!

1206
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:30,869
You act like you've never seen a fight

1207
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:35,544
between an intergalactic space rodent
and a robot with a doctorate.

1208
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:46,008
You got enough there?

1209
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:48,591
- Yes, Mr. manager.
- Need any more?

1210
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:50,095
You get that away.

1211
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:02,149
Mr. and Mrs. wachowski?

1212
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:03,824
Yes?

1213
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,739
A token of appreciation
from your government

1214
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,867
for keeping quiet about recent incidents
which never occurred.

1215
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:15,618
Wow!

1216
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:18,787
- Wonder what it is.
- Money to fix the house?

1217
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,123
Letter from the president?
You'll see.

1218
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:22,628
Okay.

1219
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:27,846
Olive garden. Yeah.

1220
01:26:27,933 --> 01:26:30,390
The way you said "you'll see"
made me think

1221
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:32,357
it was something better
than the things we said.

1222
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:34,557
Have you tried their
never ending pasta bowl?

1223
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:36,688
It never ends.

1224
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:39,061
- That sounds... fancy.
- Mm-hmm.

1225
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,313
Well, thank you.
We appreciate the gesture.

1226
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:45,356
Hey. I guess we can close the file
on that robotnik guy, huh?

1227
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,450
Just disappeared.

1228
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:51,074
I'm sorry, but no such person exists
or ever has existed.

1229
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,747
I wish that were true.

1230
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,826
You haven't by any chance been in contact
with a certain alien creature

1231
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,251
since the incident, have you?

1232
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:02,547
Uncle Sam would love to have a chat
with him. Very casual. Brunch, perhaps.

1233
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,551
You mean the little blue guy. No.

1234
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,629
- No, nothing. No.
- Mm-mmm.

1235
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:10,885
- Doubt we'll ever hear from him again.
- Mm-mmm.

1236
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:12,977
Very well.

1237
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:14,972
Okay.

1238
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,599
- Thank you.
- Great.

1239
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:19,734
Yep.

1240
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,771
To be honest,
I'm pretty pumped about the pasta bowl.

1241
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,486
So, do you guys wanna
watch a movie or what?

1242
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:31,472
Sorry, buddy. It's a school night.
It's time for you to go back to your cave.

1243
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,612
What? It's 3:00 in the afternoon!

1244
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,288
You know how you get when you're tired.

1245
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:36,865
Me” I'm not like anything.

1246
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:40,161
- You guys are so uncool.
- Yeah, yeah, we know.

1247
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:43,764
- Hey, buddy, where you going?
- You said I have to go back to my cave.

1248
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,544
We did.

1249
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:02,899
Oh, my... are you kidding me?

1250
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,814
I can't believe it.

1251
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,479
How did you...

1252
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,448
It's... it's all here.

1253
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:23,207
Look at this! Are you kidding?
And the beanbag?

1254
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,289
No way! How did you even get this?

1255
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:26,964
And you got it all the way over...

1256
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,925
I love it, I love it!

1257
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,262
Well, welcome home.

1258
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:38,890
Thank you, so much.

1259
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,442
Oh, no, you don't.

1260
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:52,275
No second-best animal friends
allowed in my room.

1261
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,029
Wait. What are you doing?

1262
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,452
Stay away from me. Stop it!

1263
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:58,531
I'm warning you. I've got nunchucks!

1264
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:01,116
Hey, stop. Okay, you can stay.

1265
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:21,804
My grasp on sanity remains... absolute.

1266
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:25,148
Isn't that right, agent stone?

1267
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,439
Why don't you get a head start?

1268
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,234
Do some rock-connaissance.

1269
01:29:37,622 --> 01:29:40,534
Rock-connaissance!
Come on! That's hilarious!

1270
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,365
What's the matter with you?

1271
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:45,994
Here's the "sitch." Uninhabited planet.

1272
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:51,216
No resources. No supplies.
No apparent way home.

1273
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:55,344
A lesser man would die here.

1274
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,304
I'll be home by Christmas.

1275
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:21,867
Rock-connaissance!

1276
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:26,956
Come on! Cheer up!

1277
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,417
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

1278
01:32:31,504 --> 01:32:32,789
I found him.

1279
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:34,667
I just hope I'm not too late.
