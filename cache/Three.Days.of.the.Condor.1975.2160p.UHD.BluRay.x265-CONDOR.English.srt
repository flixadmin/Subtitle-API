1
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,584
So tell her what you got.

2
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:51,208
Male, Caucasian, mid-40s,
appears to have been shot.

3
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,792
- Where?
- In his room.

4
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:55,083
- Very funny, Harold.
- OK, OK.

5
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,625
The wound is just below the heart.

6
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,667
- Was he shot once?
- Seems to have been, yeah.

7
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:01,333
First you said,
"Appears to have been shot…"

8
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:02,959
Mr Turner.

9
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,043
Dr Lappe, I'm sure he's gonna be here
any second now.

10
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,459
Really?

11
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,375
Mr Turner's late again.

12
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:35,167
Just get back to work.

13
00:02:35,292 --> 00:02:37,667
Come on. We can dope it out
in five minutes and get back to work.

14
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:39,625
If Joey were here,
you know what he would say…

15
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:44,125
- Joey isn't the only mind in this place.
- Come on. What calibre slug?

16
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,459
- You're missing the point, Ray.
- What do you mean?

17
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,959
The machine will come back
with a "Rephrase"

18
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,959
or "Please express in other words."

19
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,500
Well, so what do you want to feed in?

20
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,167
- Turner, Joseph. No middle initial.
- You're 17 minutes late.

21
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:59,459
Make it 12, will you?
I was bucking headwinds.

22
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:02,625
Dr Lappe,
anything in the early pouch for me?

23
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,792
- Dr Lappe. Is there anything…
- Yes?

24
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,043
Nothing in response to your report.

25
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:11,001
And please have the book
I left on your desk analysed

26
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,167
- and on the computer by four o'clock.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:16,917
Better get the <i>tolmieas</i>
moved closer to the light, Doctor.

28
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:19,375
You're getting a blight on the leaf.

29
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,751
At ease, Sarge. At ease.

30
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:25,959
Going to rain today. 10:20.

31
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:33,333
- There's got to be more details.
- I only read two chapters.

32
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:35,292
- No other clues?
- Not so far.

33
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:36,876
What time did they find him?

34
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,292
Just the same afternoon,
just early evening.

35
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,876
They never said
what the calibre of the bullet was.

36
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:44,751
- Apparently a .38.
- There it is again, "apparently."

37
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:48,083
Well, it made an entry wound
characteristic of a .38,

38
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,043
but they couldn't recover
the slug itself.

39
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:52,459
Hey, we're getting somewhere.

40
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:56,292
You guys figure it out.
I have <i>Far East</i> journals to read.

41
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:58,125
Hey, was the slug
smashed against the wall?

42
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,500
No. As a matter of fact,
there was no exit wound.

43
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,709
We're not getting anywhere.
Finish the book, Harold.

44
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,584
- Hi. What we've got so far is…
- Ice.

45
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,584
Instead of lead. Ice.

46
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:18,709
The murderer pours water
into a .38 calibre mould

47
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:21,125
and freezes it
and keeps it solid until the crime.

48
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,500
- Great.
- Then he shoots the guy

49
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,667
with the ice bullet.

50
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:27,043
Cops show up in a half an hour,
and there's just a few drops of water.

51
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,917
- No bullet, no ballistics.
- That's great.

52
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:31,375
- Hey.
- Yeah?

53
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,584
What is this?

54
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,375
- Calligraphy's getting beautiful.
- What is it?

55
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,417
- That means heaven.
- That's it? Nothing else?

56
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:47,500
Well, it can mean "the best."
"Tops" sometimes. Why?

57
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,333
I'm not sure.

58
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,208
We're going to Sam
and Mae's tonight, right?

59
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,375
Mmm-hmm.

60
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,167
Well, why don't you talk
to Sam about it?

61
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,625
- About this? I did.
- Mmm-hmm.

62
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:01,917
He says, "Well, that's interesting,
but it's not my department."

63
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:06,167
Which means he doesn't think
there's anything, just like Dr Lappe.

64
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:10,208
- And you.
- Well, there's not much.

65
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,333
- A mystery that's been translated?
- A mystery that didn't sell,

66
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:16,167
that's been translated into
a very odd assortment of languages.

67
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:20,084
Turkish, but not French.
Arabic, but not Russian or German.

68
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,084
Dutch.

69
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,043
- Spanish?
- Yes.

70
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:28,333
Yes.

71
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,292
Hey, where'd you get that thing
about the ice?

72
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,208
- Dashiell Hammett?
- Dick Tracy.

73
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,834
Are you sure about this ideogram?

74
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:39,625
Look at this face.
Could I be wrong about an ideogram?

75
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:45,250
It's a great face,
but it's never been to China.

76
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,167
Ray, when can I get
some computer time?

77
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,167
- Dick Tracy?
- He was a very underrated detective.

78
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,876
There's some free time at 2:45.

79
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:03,834
Morning pickup.

80
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,167
No, no, no, no.
Stay on schedule. I'll get it.

81
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:11,292
- Four pieces, right?
- Right.

82
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,459
- Hold it. Hold it.
- Five.

83
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:16,542
- Affirmative. Fiver.
- Where is Mr Heidegger?

84
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,375
He called in sick, Dr Lappe.

85
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,751
He's probably hungover again.

86
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:22,292
This is extraordinary.
I was just checking the files

87
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,500
and I came across this carbon copy

88
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,043
of an inquiry he sent
to Persian Gulf command.

89
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,834
He did that for me.

90
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,876
It never went through my office.

91
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,459
I asked him to do
some research for me.

92
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:35,375
I guess he didn't feel
it was that important.

93
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,876
I wish you people
would go through channels.

94
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,709
What's on your mind?

95
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,584
OK.

96
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:40,792
This was in the pouch
from New York Center.

97
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:44,125
HQ at Langley said there's nothing
from any other intelligence source

98
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,959
- to support your theory.
- Gentlemen.

99
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:48,792
Is this your idea
of working on that book?

100
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:50,333
I'll have it on the computer by 4:00.

101
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,834
We have people
to service these machines.

102
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,625
These things are really pretty simple.
They just look complicated.

103
00:08:55,751 --> 00:09:01,250
Mr Turner, I wonder if
you're entirely happy here.

104
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,584
- Within obvious limits, yes, sir.
- Obvious limits?

105
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,125
It bothers me
that I can't tell people what I do.

106
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,959
Why is it taking you so long
to accept that?

107
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:15,584
Well, I actually trust a few people.
That's a problem.

108
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,500
Well, I believe it's your turn
to bring in lunch.

109
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,500
What time is it?

110
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:26,250
- 11:22.
- The rain's gonna stop by 11:30.

111
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,834
You can wait eight minutes.

112
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,333
Yes, yes.

113
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,208
Mr Turner? Hey! Hey!

114
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:17,834
Damn it. It's not a proper exit.

115
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,709
He always goes out that way
when it rains. Saves him a block.

116
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:25,167
Personnel should enter and exit
the premises by authorised means only.

117
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,375
Jimmy.

118
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,084
- Hey, Shakespeare, how's it going?
- Terrific.

119
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,417
I'm building up a great collection
of rejection slips.

120
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:23,333
Yeah, I know the feeling.
I always wanted to be Escoffier.

121
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,751
Well, maybe it's not too late.
You know, Van Gogh was 30

122
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:27,709
- before he started to paint.
- No kidding?

123
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:30,208
There's no mayonnaise on Dr Lappe's.

124
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,876
On the other hand, Mozart was three
when he started to play the piano,

125
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:36,917
- and he was composing at six.
- Fast starter. It's probably better.

126
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:39,043
I don't know.

127
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,417
Van Gogh never sold a painting
in a whole lifetime.

128
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,208
Mozart died a pauper.

129
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,167
Where am I,
the New York Public Library?

130
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:46,834
Hey, that's a very bright man.

131
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,333
It's very educational.
That's why I come in here.

132
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,792
You come in here to get sick,
just like everybody else.

133
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,417
Hey, come on.

134
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:56,500
Hey, no butter on Ray's sandwich.
He gets very panicky about butter.

135
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,500
Give it to Jennings in the back.
He'll sign for it. Just…

136
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:23,250
Edwina Rose…

137
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:46,375
Mrs Russell,
was the Kirkus report in this…

138
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:18,751
Wait, wait, wait!

139
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,001
Would you move
from the window, please?

140
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,375
Pardon?

141
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,292
Would you move
from the window, please?

142
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:14,751
I won't scream.

143
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,250
I know.

144
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,084
A little breakdown
in the security there?

145
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:07,292
Well, what… What are you doing?

146
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:17,459
What…

147
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:12,333
Come on, now.
Now, come on.

148
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:38,959
Harold.

149
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,333
For Christ's sake!
What the hell you doing, Mac?

150
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:04,084
Do your sleeping at night, will you?

151
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,959
- This is the Major.
- This is Joe Turner. Listen…

152
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:33,417
- Identification.
- What?

153
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:34,917
'Identification.'

154
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:36,917
My name is Turner.
I work for you. Now listen…

155
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:39,417
- Identify yourself.
- I… I don't…

156
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,168
'What is your designation?'

157
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:42,625
Condor.

158
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,959
Section 9, department 17.
The section's been hit.

159
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:47,459
- What level?
- What level?

160
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:50,043
- Level of damage.
- Everybody.

161
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:53,876
Dr Lappe, Janice, Ray, Harold.
Harold was in the…

162
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,625
'Are you on a company line?'

163
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:58,751
No, no. I'm in a phone booth.
I'm just a block away. I'm in the street.

164
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:01,584
You're in violation of secure
communication procedures, Condor.

165
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:04,292
Listen, you son of a bitch!
I'm telling you, I came back with lunch,

166
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:07,292
and it was raining, and the whole house
was murdered. Everybody is dead.

167
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:11,168
'Right. Has the incident been discovered
by anyone outside the company?'

168
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:13,500
I don't… I don't know.
I don't think so.

169
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,375
'Are you damaged?'

170
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:17,375
Damaged?

171
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,667
- No.
- Are you armed?

172
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,459
I don't… I have Mrs… I don't…
I can't remember her code name.

173
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,625
Nightingale.

174
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:29,168
She was afraid of being raped.
She kept a gun. I've got the gun.

175
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:30,333
Identify the armament.

176
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:35,168
It's a .45 automatic.
Will you guys bring me in, please?

177
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:37,375
I'm not a field agent.
I just read books.

178
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,959
- Leave the area.
- All right. Well…

179
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:41,751
Well, do I come in
to headquarters now?

180
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:44,333
'Negative. Find a secure location.'

181
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,126
- Where?
- Avoid any place you're known.

182
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,333
Do not go home.

183
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:50,542
Do not go home.

184
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:53,917
Surface again in two hours,
and call the Major.

185
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,959
That'll be 14:30, your time.

186
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,500
Wait a minute.
All right. 2:30, right?

187
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,542
'Now, walk away from the phone.
Don't hang it up.'

188
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,001
Don't…

189
00:22:17,584 --> 00:22:19,667
This is the panic officer.

190
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,709
Section 9-17 may have been hit.

191
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:28,292
'Activate following procedures:
NY 127, DC 469er.

192
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:30,542
'Replay of the report upcoming.
Stand by.'

193
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:24,751
'Augie One to New York Center.'

194
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:27,084
This is New York Center.
Go ahead, Augie One.

195
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,208
- 'Who am I talking to?'
- Higgins, Deputy Director.

196
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,333
- I'm holding the baby, go ahead.
- Hit confirmed.

197
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:33,500
Maximum as reported. Six cold items.

198
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,375
- What was the quality of work?
- Clean, fast, first-rate.

199
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:38,792
Did you say six?

200
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,667
'Excepting Condor,
there should be seven.'

201
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:43,625
Repeat. Six.
Here's a rundown on those items.

202
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:48,043
Lappe, Chong, Russell,
Jennings, Martin, Mitchell.

203
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:50,792
All right, Augie One. Find seven.

204
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,043
Thank you.

205
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,625
Condor.

206
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:09,126
Researcher type
who likes to read comic strips.

207
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,709
Who is it?

208
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,126
Jesus.

209
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,625
Hey, you. You ring my buzzer?

210
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,792
- It was a mistake, buddy.
- Not you guys.

211
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:03,043
Hey. Hey!

212
00:26:03,168 --> 00:26:05,292
Hey, who are you?

213
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:07,500
Hey, who the hell are you?

214
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,876
'Augie Three here.
We found item seven, Ralph Heidegger.

215
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:13,043
'He bought it at home.'

216
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:15,876
'OK. Button it up, Augie.
I'll send you more janitors.'

217
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:20,250
'Yes, sir.'
'I need Langley right away.'

218
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:22,709
'Garber speaking.'

219
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:27,043
'This is Higgins, Deputy Director,
New York. Let me have department 17.'

220
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:35,043
Somebody took out
one of your sections.

221
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:37,043
- What?
- 9-17.

222
00:26:37,168 --> 00:26:39,792
That's New York.
Somebody got mugged, maybe.

223
00:26:39,917 --> 00:26:41,709
They were hit.

224
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,584
- They're bookworms, for Christ's sake.
- They got seven out of eight.

225
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:46,876
We're on the shuttle to LaGuardia side.
30 minutes.

226
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:48,584
You say one of my people is still OK?

227
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:50,292
- Condor. You know him?
- No.

228
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:51,834
Is he OK enough
to say what happened?

229
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:54,542
They didn't touch him.
He was literally out to lunch.

230
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:57,126
- What does he say happened?
- He's not in yet.

231
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,375
First call was a little wild, scared.

232
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,250
- Who's bringing him in?
- Higgins.

233
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:02,876
- Higgins.
- 'Transportation.'

234
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,876
- We're already booked on the shuttle.
- This is Wicks, OIC department 17.

235
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:09,084
I want a chopper on the pad,
fuelled for New York, now.

236
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:27,333
- Hey, Lois.
- They're waiting for you.

237
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:28,876
- What?
- Your two friends.

238
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:34,417
They said you'd be home early.

239
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:37,792
They just got here.
Said you gave them the keys.

240
00:27:40,751 --> 00:27:42,250
Mr Turner?

241
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:17,250
- This is the Major.
- 'This is Condor.'

242
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:20,917
Stand by, Condor.
I'm routing you to New York Center.

243
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,375
'Condor 1-1, Mr Higgins.'

244
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:28,250
Hello, Condor.

245
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,459
'Who is this?'

246
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:31,292
Deputy Director Higgins,
New York Center.

247
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,459
I'm controlling now, Condor.
Where are you?

248
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:35,584
How come I need a code name
and you don't?

249
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:39,292
Where are you, Turner?

250
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:41,751
Here.

251
00:28:44,168 --> 00:28:47,001
- You all right?
- Are you insane? Everybody's dead.

252
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:50,876
Take it easy. Just take it easy,
and we'll bring you home.

253
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:53,709
Now, here's how we'll do it.
Do you know the Ansonia Hotel?

254
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:57,834
- 'Broadway and 71st.'
- Broadway and 73rd.

255
00:28:58,584 --> 00:29:01,333
There's an alley behind the hotel.

256
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:04,043
One hour from now at exactly 15:30,

257
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:07,417
I want you to enter that alley
from the 73rd Street side.

258
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:09,001
Will you be there?

259
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,168
The head of your department
just came here from DC.

260
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:15,375
He's gonna bring you home.

261
00:29:16,168 --> 00:29:18,250
- I've never met him.
- 'Don't worry.'

262
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,667
'He's studying your photos now.'

263
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:24,001
Turner?

264
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:27,375
Turner.

265
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,751
I don't know you, either.

266
00:29:32,876 --> 00:29:34,542
We'll meet.

267
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:39,209
He'll be carrying a <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
in his left hand.

268
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,876
- There were two guys at my house.
- What were you doing there?

269
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:45,043
- You were told not to go there.
- I was homesick. Who were they?

270
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:48,250
- They were ours.
- What were they doing in my house?

271
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,709
I'm not going into any alley
with you or anybody,

272
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,250
and fuck <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

273
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,959
Turner, it's been a long, bad day.
You've been under…

274
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:58,667
You're damn right I've been under.

275
00:30:03,834 --> 00:30:05,625
All right, Turner.

276
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,667
We'll bring along a familiar face,
somebody you know.

277
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:11,333
Who's left?

278
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:14,459
'You got a friend in statistics
named Sam Barber.'

279
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:17,001
Sam…

280
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,333
- You guys are something.
- 'Will he do?'

281
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:24,209
Yes, Sam will do.

282
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,084
All right, Turner.

283
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:30,168
Stay well for 60 minutes,
and you're home.

284
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:33,209
- Can I ask a question?
- 'Sure.'

285
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:35,959
What is happening?

286
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,168
I'll talk to you in 60 minutes.

287
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,001
You've got 55.

288
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:46,876
This is ridiculous.

289
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:49,126
You're not a field agent.
It's standard procedure.

290
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,542
To pick up a friend?

291
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:53,209
- What about you, Mr Wicks?
- No, thanks.

292
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,876
- Side arm?
- I don't know. Have you got a .45?

293
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:59,625
- You bet.
- Here, let me help you with that.

294
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:04,375
How long have you known Condor?

295
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,792
Who, Joey?
I knew him before he was a bird even.

296
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:11,584
- We went to CCNY. My wife Mae, too.
- Yeah?

297
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:14,876
- She ever Condor's girl?
- Here you go, Mr Wicks.

298
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:22,917
Hey, can you tell me anything
about what happened today?

299
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:25,043
- When?
- This morning.

300
00:31:25,168 --> 00:31:26,542
All those murders.

301
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,126
What murders?

302
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:30,084
Sam?

303
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:36,375
Sam.

304
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,542
Here he is. Joe!

305
00:32:55,126 --> 00:32:56,500
Hey, Sam,

306
00:32:58,584 --> 00:33:00,917
where's that other…

307
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,500
What are you doing?
It's him! It's him!

308
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:11,792
Joe!

309
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:24,709
Katherine Hale. H-A-L-E.

310
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:31,084
O8, 1156, 172, 208, 875.

311
00:34:31,209 --> 00:34:33,709
Amount, $51.86.

312
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,542
Where's there enough snow this early?

313
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:39,084
- Vermont, I hope.
- What's open now, Sugarbush?

314
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:41,542
No, I don't do downhill.
This is for cross-country.

315
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:43,959
Don't like the lift lines, huh?

316
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,417
474? Thank you.

317
00:34:58,043 --> 00:34:59,417
Kathy!

318
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:03,292
Kathy. Where have you been?
Here, let me give you a hand.

319
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:07,709
- Wait a minute, I don't know…
- Don't do anything. Be quiet.

320
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:10,126
Get in the car.
Don't make a sound. Don't be dumb.

321
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:12,834
Come on. Hurry up.

322
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,251
Get in.

323
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:20,542
Listen, please don't hurt me.

324
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,126
Where do you live?
Where do you live?

325
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:24,251
- Brooklyn Heights.
- Alone?

326
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:27,043
I live with a friend.

327
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,876
You live alone.
Come on, let's go.

328
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:02,001
Leave the stuff.

329
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,834
Hey, Kathy.

330
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,751
You should have said hello.

331
00:38:16,834 --> 00:38:18,792
- Where is it?
- Here.

332
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,126
"Condor shot us both."

333
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:29,375
Evidently, that was
the only statement he could make

334
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,333
before they took him
into the operating room.

335
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:34,126
And the other man,
Barber, he's dead?

336
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:36,084
Before he hit the ground,
Mr Atwood.

337
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:39,333
You should add that
it was a remarkable shot,

338
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:41,084
a half inch above his flak jacket.

339
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:43,500
- I thought this guy was…
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

340
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:46,084
Was Condor qualified with a handgun?

341
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:52,375
Two years military service,
Signal Corps.

342
00:38:53,043 --> 00:38:55,459
Telephone lineman, long lines,
switchboard maintenance.

343
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:56,792
Six months overseas.

344
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:00,417
Separated 9/'61. Worked at
Bell Labs Communication Research.

345
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:01,709
College on the GI Bill.

346
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:05,333
The question was, Mr Higgins,
is he qualified with a handgun?

347
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:07,792
No handgun, sir.
M1 rifle and carbine.

348
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:10,917
Evidently, it was sheer luck.

349
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:13,667
Or else…

350
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:16,375
- Yes?
- Or else what, Mr Higgins?

351
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,834
This Condor isn't the man
his file says he is.

352
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,751
Then where did he learn
evasive moves?

353
00:39:20,876 --> 00:39:22,500
- He reads.
- He…

354
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:26,917
- What the hell does that mean?
- It means, sir, that he reads everything.

355
00:39:27,043 --> 00:39:30,542
- I don't understand.
- Yes. Very good.

356
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,792
- Has Operations got anything?
- Absolutely nothing, sir.

357
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:37,959
- Extraordinary.
- It was very well executed.

358
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,625
Which requires planning,
communications, tracks.

359
00:39:41,751 --> 00:39:44,168
I'm not asking for footprints,

360
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:47,792
but a blade of grass, a broken twig,
something disturbed.

361
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:49,333
Yes, sir.

362
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:52,625
- Wicks seems to be all we've got.
- Where do we have him?

363
00:39:52,751 --> 00:39:53,876
We don't.

364
00:39:57,876 --> 00:40:00,834
They rushed him to Gouverneur
Emergency before we got word.

365
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:03,333
Maybe we should leak
the name of the hospital,

366
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:05,333
try to get Condor to make his move.

367
00:40:05,459 --> 00:40:09,126
Of course, Len, don't expect
too many mistakes from this man.

368
00:40:09,251 --> 00:40:11,126
After all, he does seem
rather more interesting

369
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:14,251
than just another
of our reader-researchers.

370
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:18,293
For example,
has he gone into business for himself?

371
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,667
Was he turned around?
Does someone operate him?

372
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:27,043
Is he homosexual?
Broke? Vulnerable?

373
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,584
Could he be a soldier of fortune?

374
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:32,625
Did he arrange the hit?

375
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:35,667
Is that why he's still in flight?

376
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:39,625
Still, he may be an innocent.

377
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:44,625
But then, why didn't he come in gently
with Mr Wicks?

378
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:50,792
- Tentrex Industries.
- It's a cover.

379
00:40:50,917 --> 00:40:52,625
- For what?
- I work for the CIA.

380
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:54,584
Oh, Jesus.

381
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:58,876
Your assignment for today
was to go out and kidnap a girl.

382
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:02,209
Look it up. Look it up.
Tentrex Industries.

383
00:41:05,459 --> 00:41:07,459
Then look up the number
for the CIA in New York.

384
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,667
You mean they're listed,
like my Aunt Gladys?

385
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:11,542
It's under "US Government Agencies."
Go on.

386
00:41:16,584 --> 00:41:19,709
Is this what you do?
This photography?

387
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,584
OK.

388
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:25,251
It's the same number.

389
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:26,959
You could have had the card made.

390
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:30,251
Yes, I could've made the card
in a machine, but I didn't.

391
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:32,333
You really get into it, don't you?

392
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:33,792
Sit down!

393
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:39,500
I told you I had a friend.

394
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,251
15 and a half, 34.

395
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,500
I dig 15 and a half 34s.
What size are you?

396
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:47,126
- What are you, a clown?
- I'm scared!

397
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:48,584
- So am I!
- What are you scared for?

398
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:50,001
- You've got the gun!
- Yes!

399
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:55,500
Yeah, and it's not enough.

400
00:42:12,043 --> 00:42:13,375
Listen.

401
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:17,251
I work for the CIA.
I am not a spy.

402
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:23,709
I just read books.

403
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:34,293
We read everything
that's published in the world.

404
00:42:35,251 --> 00:42:40,584
And we… We feed the plots,
dirty tricks, codes… into a computer,

405
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:46,001
and the computer… checks against
actual CIA plans and operations.

406
00:42:46,459 --> 00:42:48,251
I look for leaks.
I look for new ideas.

407
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:53,625
We read adventures
and novels and journals.

408
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,084
I…

409
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:01,500
Who'd invent a job like that?

410
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:05,084
I… Listen!

411
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,625
- People are trying to kill me!
- Who?

412
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:11,168
I don't know, but there's a reason.

413
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:14,584
There is a reason!

414
00:43:16,209 --> 00:43:17,917
And I just need

415
00:43:19,084 --> 00:43:22,209
some safe, quiet time
to pull things together.

416
00:43:24,293 --> 00:43:25,792
- Here.
- Here.

417
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:31,043
That's only fair.

418
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:48,043
Where is the guy with the shirts?

419
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:52,625
He's at a ski place,
in the Green Mountains.

420
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:57,168
We just want to go
cross-country skiing

421
00:43:57,293 --> 00:44:01,126
for a couple of weeks,
away from everything.

422
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:08,251
- What time does the news go on, six?
- Six o'clock.

423
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:09,751
40 minutes.

424
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,625
- Come here.
- No, please. Please don't.

425
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,001
Lie down.

426
00:44:32,293 --> 00:44:34,792
Lie down. Against the wall.

427
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:38,959
Put this arm behind you,
and keep it there.

428
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:44,834
Now you listen to me.
I am tired.

429
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:48,834
I've got to close my eyes for a while.

430
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,293
I can't think straight.

431
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:56,584
If you try and move,
or climb off the bed,

432
00:44:57,792 --> 00:44:59,959
I'll know it. I'll feel it,

433
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,751
and I promise you I'll hurt you.

434
00:45:05,542 --> 00:45:07,500
Couldn't you let me stay
in the other room?

435
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:08,917
No.

436
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,084
I believe what you told me.

437
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:17,168
No, you don't.

438
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:20,500
I don't know if I do.

439
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:24,043
That includes Condor, of course.

440
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:26,084
Yes, I owe you Condor.

441
00:45:26,584 --> 00:45:29,293
- Otherwise…
- Otherwise does not exist.

442
00:45:31,709 --> 00:45:33,459
Will Condor take long?

443
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:36,751
- Do you want an estimate?
- There is a time factor.

444
00:45:36,876 --> 00:45:38,751
Always with you people.

445
00:45:41,168 --> 00:45:43,126
Condor is an amateur.

446
00:45:43,251 --> 00:45:45,709
He's lost, unpredictable,

447
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:48,667
perhaps even sentimental.

448
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:52,084
He could fool a professional.

449
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:57,084
Not deliberately,
but precisely because he is lost.

450
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:59,792
He doesn't know what to do.

451
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:01,834
Unlike Wicks,

452
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:05,334
who has always been
entirely predictable.

453
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:12,293
The man Condor killed in the alley.

454
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:14,542
Some friend of his.

455
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:18,375
- Close friend?
- I suppose so. Why?

456
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,542
It interests me.
What was his name?

457
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:22,584
I don't know.
He was nobody. He was…

458
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:32,084
Right.

459
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:34,293
What about Wicks?

460
00:46:39,084 --> 00:46:41,542
You want the firm to question him?

461
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:44,500
They will, you know.

462
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:47,917
We don't want that.

463
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:51,417
Cost you nothing.

464
00:46:52,001 --> 00:46:54,084
I was careless with Condor.

465
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:58,001
Wicks will be done for nothing.

466
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:04,709
- What time is it? What time is it?
- It's news time.

467
00:47:07,209 --> 00:47:08,417
Get up.

468
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:55,959
Lonely pictures.

469
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,792
So?

470
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,043
You're funny.

471
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:12,542
You take pictures of… empty streets
and trees with no leaves on them.

472
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:15,625
It's winter.

473
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,043
Not quite winter.

474
00:48:20,209 --> 00:48:21,834
They look like

475
00:48:23,542 --> 00:48:24,876
November.

476
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:28,126
Not autumn, not winter.
In-between.

477
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:34,917
I like them.

478
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:39,334

was coming in, the section chief…

512
00:50:14,709 --> 00:50:16,500
Wait a minute. He's…

513
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:19,084
Section chief would be coming in
from Washington.

514
00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:22,209
He'd have to reach Sam.
Sam would have to call me.

515
00:50:30,251 --> 00:50:31,459
'Hello?

516
00:50:34,209 --> 00:50:35,334
'Hello?'

517
00:50:50,043 --> 00:50:52,459
- I need your car.
- That's called grand theft.

518
00:50:52,584 --> 00:50:55,168
You don't want to get in trouble
with the police.

519
00:50:57,542 --> 00:51:00,959
This guy in Vermont, what's
he gonna do when you don't show up?

520
00:51:01,084 --> 00:51:02,834
Probably call very soon now.

521
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:04,709
Call, or do I have to worry
about him showing up here?

522
00:51:04,834 --> 00:51:06,209
You're not entitled
to personal questions.

523
00:51:06,334 --> 00:51:07,709
That gun gives you the right
to rough me up,

524
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:09,834
- it doesn't give you the right to ask me…
- Rough you up?

525
00:51:09,959 --> 00:51:12,251
- Have I roughed you up?
- Yes! What are you doing in my house?

526
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:13,792
Have I? Have I? Have I raped you?

527
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:16,334
The night is young.

528
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:35,667
You don't believe
anything I've said, do you?

529
00:51:39,001 --> 00:51:42,542
I believe you're in trouble, danger,

530
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:46,709
but I don't know what kind,

531
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:50,792
and I'm not sure
how much of it is made up,

532
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:53,168
real, but…

533
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:55,500
Doesn't make any difference.
Doesn't matter.

534
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:57,251
- Just wait a minute. Will you…
- Forget it.

535
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:58,917
I'm trying to understand
what you're saying to me!

536
00:51:59,043 --> 00:52:00,834
Go on in.

537
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:03,751
Ow!

538
00:52:03,876 --> 00:52:06,043
What are you doing? Let me go!

539
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:12,043
You're hurting me. Wait a minute.

540
00:52:14,293 --> 00:52:15,667
You bully!

541
00:52:16,584 --> 00:52:18,334
Don't tie me up! Come on, please!

542
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:23,917
This is…

543
00:52:25,168 --> 00:52:26,334
… unfair.

544
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,584
I know.

545
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:43,500
Hi, Joey. You're early. Come on in.

546
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:48,876
Hey, is Janice working late?

547
00:53:52,084 --> 00:53:53,667
So is Sam.

548
00:53:58,043 --> 00:54:00,792
Hey, pour one for me, too,
will you, Joey?

549
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:05,959
It's their own fault if we're zonked
when they get here.

550
00:54:09,376 --> 00:54:10,959
Hey, I've got it.

551
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:13,417
We'll give them an hour,
and if they're not here,

552
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:16,542
then it's you and me, babe,
just like old times.

553
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:21,959
Joey.

554
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:23,959
What is it?

555
00:54:24,084 --> 00:54:26,667
- Hey, what is it, Joey? What?
- Mae.

556
00:54:27,459 --> 00:54:29,334
- What's wrong?
- Mae.

557
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:32,168
How do you know Sam's working late?

558
00:54:32,293 --> 00:54:35,168
- What do you think he's doing?
- When did he call?

559
00:54:35,293 --> 00:54:37,293
I don't know.
Two or two-thirty.

560
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:38,959
What did he say? Exactly.

561
00:54:39,084 --> 00:54:42,376
He didn't exactly.
He had the Center call.

562
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,542
- Who at the Center?
- I didn't recognise his voice.

563
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:48,667
It wasn't that lady that usually…

564
00:54:58,293 --> 00:54:59,459
Hello?

565
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,084
- What is it?
- Third damn time tonight.

566
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:05,251
Third time?

567
00:55:05,376 --> 00:55:07,084
It's some creepy burglar
casing the joint.

568
00:55:07,209 --> 00:55:08,459
Mae, I want you to get out of here.

569
00:55:08,584 --> 00:55:11,334
- Well, I can't, Joey. I'm cooking.
- Right now. Just do what I tell you, Mae.

570
00:55:11,459 --> 00:55:13,667
- What about dinner?
- Don't ask me. Go to Bill and Eileen's.

571
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:16,459
- Stay there until I call.
- Joey, what's going on?

572
00:55:16,584 --> 00:55:17,625
Please.

573
00:55:17,751 --> 00:55:21,209
- Joey, you…
- Don't argue. Move! Move!

574
00:55:21,334 --> 00:55:23,876
- Joey, this is crazy.
- Go upstairs and stay there.

575
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:27,293
Do what I'm telling you.
I'll call you. And stay there.

576
00:55:27,417 --> 00:55:29,751
- Joey. Joey, you're scaring me.
- I'll call you.

577
00:55:29,876 --> 00:55:33,043
- Do what I'm telling you, please!
- What about Sam?

578
00:56:26,334 --> 00:56:27,792
Yours?

579
00:56:31,834 --> 00:56:32,917
No.

580
00:56:40,168 --> 00:56:43,959
♪ Happy birthday to Grandpa

581
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:49,792
You're always pushing the buttons.

582
00:56:49,917 --> 00:56:52,751
- Would you stop it, would you?
- That's nice.

583
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,334
Fifth floor, ladies' underwear.

584
00:57:05,001 --> 00:57:06,709
Kids.

585
00:57:07,334 --> 00:57:09,667
Probably the same everywhere.

586
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:33,667
This is the second floor.

587
00:57:36,459 --> 00:57:37,834
I do it all the time.

588
00:57:50,625 --> 00:57:52,751
- After you.
- No. Go ahead.

589
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:58,417
OK.

590
00:58:37,417 --> 00:58:39,584
- Anybody here good with a coat hanger?
- What?

591
00:58:39,709 --> 00:58:41,334
I locked my keys in my car.
I need to get in.

592
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:42,917
I'll give you some money,
couple of bucks, OK?

593
00:58:43,043 --> 00:58:44,334
Anybody can get in the car?

594
00:58:44,459 --> 00:58:46,459
Come on, you can't tell me
you've never busted into a car before.

595
00:58:46,584 --> 00:58:48,251
- OK. I've busted a car. But how much?
- No, come on.

596
00:58:48,376 --> 00:58:50,459
Five bucks.
Five bucks if you help me get in my car.

597
00:58:50,584 --> 00:58:52,293
- Five bucks? Why not? Yeah.
- I don't have much time.

598
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:53,709
- Can you give me a break?
- Yeah.

599
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:56,709
- Do you mind?
- All right. Five bucks. Five bucks.

600
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,959
- I'll be right back. Come on, man.
- You can all come.

601
00:58:59,084 --> 00:59:01,376
Have some fun.

602
00:59:19,168 --> 00:59:20,667
Damn.

603
00:59:24,917 --> 00:59:26,376
Wait a minute.

604
00:59:28,043 --> 00:59:29,667
Give me the money.

605
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:32,834
Hey!

606
01:00:50,959 --> 01:00:54,667
- I want you to answer the phone.
- I'm not going to answer the…

607
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:59,251
- I'm not answering any phone!
- Answer it. Answer it.

608
01:00:59,376 --> 01:01:01,959
You answer this phone! Tell him
what a brave son of a bitch you are.

609
01:01:02,084 --> 01:01:04,084
Get in there and answer.

610
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:08,251
I want you to be casual and nice.

611
01:01:13,459 --> 01:01:15,917
- Hello?
- 'Where the hell are you?'

612
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:18,959
- Ben?
- 'Who do you think it is?'

613
01:01:20,084 --> 01:01:21,293
Ben.

614
01:01:22,084 --> 01:01:24,459
'You were supposed to
be up here by now.'

615
01:01:24,584 --> 01:01:27,334
- I know.
- 'You haven't even left yet.'

616
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,542
I was held up.

617
01:01:30,584 --> 01:01:33,959
'Held up? That's no excuse.

618
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:37,500
'Come on, what's going on?
Doesn't this trip matter to you?'

619
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:40,168
- It matters.
- 'Yeah, sure.'

620
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:42,500
- No, it does.
- 'Ah, come on. Come on.

621
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:45,959
'This has happened over and over again.
The last minute, some excuse.'

622
01:01:46,084 --> 01:01:47,959
No, this is different.

623
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:49,834
'What's the hold-up?'

624
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:54,876
- The car.
- 'What about it?'

625
01:01:55,001 --> 01:01:58,584
- Broke down.
- 'What do you mean? What broke down?'

626
01:01:58,709 --> 01:02:02,209
- The generator went.
- 'Oh, Christ, the generator.

627
01:02:02,334 --> 01:02:05,084
- 'That's going to take forever.'
- Maybe not.

628
01:02:06,418 --> 01:02:08,876
I tried to call you before, but…

629
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:11,293
'The generator… It's…
Look, it's gonna take too long.

630
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:13,418
'Why don't you just…
Look, forget about the car.

631
01:02:13,542 --> 01:02:16,376
'Just take the bus up
first thing in the morning.'

632
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,001
I'll try.

633
01:02:19,209 --> 01:02:20,667
'Try?

634
01:02:21,459 --> 01:02:25,168
'What's… What the hell's going on?
Are you OK? What… What's…'

635
01:02:25,293 --> 01:02:27,709
No, I'm OK. I'm fine.

636
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:30,792
'You don't sound so fine.'

637
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:33,667
I… I wish you would understand.

638
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,334
'I do. I do, I do. It's just…

639
01:02:37,459 --> 01:02:40,751
'God damn it,
I'm just disappointed, that's all.

640
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:43,584
'I really…

641
01:02:43,709 --> 01:02:48,751
'I really wanted to be with you up here,
tonight, babe, you know?'

642
01:02:50,001 --> 01:02:51,168
I know.

643
01:02:53,876 --> 01:02:56,168
- We'll have time.
- 'Yeah.

644
01:02:57,293 --> 01:02:58,917
'Look, get…

645
01:02:59,043 --> 01:03:02,209
'Get the very first bus out
in the morning, OK?'

646
01:03:02,834 --> 01:03:04,418
All right.

647
01:03:06,584 --> 01:03:09,251
- Good night, sweetheart.
- 'Good night, babe.'

648
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:52,001
Listen, I'll be going… in the morning.

649
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:58,876
Where?

650
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:10,418
Was it all right?

651
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:14,293
All right?

652
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,876
Outside, was it safe?
Wherever you went.

653
01:04:19,917 --> 01:04:21,709
Oh…

654
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:25,126
I'm not sure.

655
01:04:33,876 --> 01:04:35,084
Oh, God.

656
01:04:37,834 --> 01:04:39,334
I wish I knew more.

657
01:04:42,209 --> 01:04:43,584
About you.

658
01:04:46,001 --> 01:04:47,376
Yesterday.

659
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:49,709
Today.

660
01:04:51,376 --> 01:04:53,459
I don't remember yesterday.

661
01:04:56,376 --> 01:04:58,001
Today it rained.

662
01:05:02,084 --> 01:05:04,459
Why did you have to
tie me up like that?

663
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:10,251
You thought I'd call the police.

664
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,168
I wouldn't have.

665
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:19,043
Why?

666
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:25,917
Sometimes I take a picture that

667
01:05:27,084 --> 01:05:30,917
isn't like me, but I took it,
so it is like me.

668
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:33,084
It has to be.

669
01:05:38,667 --> 01:05:40,709
I put those pictures away.

670
01:05:42,709 --> 01:05:44,542
I'd like to see those pictures.

671
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:47,209
We don't know each other that well.

672
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,043
Do you know anybody that well?

673
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:01,667
I don't think
I want to know you very well.

674
01:06:04,334 --> 01:06:07,001
I don't think
you're gonna live much longer.

675
01:06:10,293 --> 01:06:13,043
Well, I may surprise you.

676
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:17,792
Anyway, you're not telling the truth.

677
01:06:19,293 --> 01:06:21,209
- What do you mean?
- You'd rather be with somebody

678
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:23,293
who's not going to live much longer,

679
01:06:23,418 --> 01:06:26,751
at least somebody
who would be on his way.

680
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:30,625
- I'm not…
- You take pictures,

681
01:06:32,084 --> 01:06:33,876
beautiful pictures,

682
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:36,792
but of empty streets

683
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:40,001
and trees with no leaves, November.

684
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:43,876
Why haven't you asked me
to untie your hands?

685
01:06:50,876 --> 01:06:53,043
How much do you want?

686
01:06:59,043 --> 01:07:02,792
I just want to stop it.

687
01:07:10,334 --> 01:07:12,001
For a few hours.

688
01:07:14,584 --> 01:07:16,625
For the rest of the night.

689
01:07:20,334 --> 01:07:21,959
And then I'll go.

690
01:10:01,084 --> 01:10:02,751
'Joe!'

691
01:10:35,834 --> 01:10:37,876
What was his name?

692
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,376
What is it Higgins said? Was it…

693
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,709
'The head of your department
just came here from DC.

694
01:10:42,834 --> 01:10:44,751
- 'He's gonna bring you home.'
- 'I've never met him.'

695
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:54,834
'Anything in the early pouch?'

696
01:10:57,126 --> 01:10:59,376
'Headquarters at Langley
says there's nothing

697
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,001
'from any other intelligence source
to support your theory.'

698
01:11:05,751 --> 01:11:08,168
'Headquarters at Langley
says there's nothing

699
01:11:08,293 --> 01:11:11,667
'from any other intelligence source
to support your theory.'

700
01:11:43,917 --> 01:11:45,168
Wicks.

701
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:13,500
- You didn't sleep well.
- You didn't?

702
01:12:14,792 --> 01:12:16,293
No, you didn't.

703
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,460
You're up early.

704
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:22,584
Well, I had some thoughts.

705
01:12:25,001 --> 01:12:26,460
I've got a plan.

706
01:12:27,792 --> 01:12:30,542
I don't know if it'll work or not, but…

707
01:12:33,209 --> 01:12:34,751
I'll need your help.

708
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:37,376
Have I ever denied you anything?

709
01:12:37,501 --> 01:12:38,876
Hey.

710
01:12:43,709 --> 01:12:45,917
Well, when things quiet down,

711
01:12:47,751 --> 01:12:50,584
you're really a very sweet man
to be with.

712
01:12:54,334 --> 01:12:56,043
You had bad dreams.

713
01:12:56,834 --> 01:12:58,709
Talked in your sleep.

714
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,876
What did I say?

715
01:13:02,876 --> 01:13:04,084
Who's Janice?

716
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:11,792
Was she a volunteer
or a draftee like me?

717
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:20,501
She was… a friend.

718
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:22,792
She's dead.

719
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:30,751
Do I have permission to take a shower?

720
01:13:30,876 --> 01:13:34,334
- You don't have to help, you know.
- No, no. I'll help.

721
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,501
You can always depend
on the old spy-fucker.

722
01:13:42,834 --> 01:13:44,709
OK.

723
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:46,043
- I'm sorry.
- No.

724
01:13:46,168 --> 01:13:47,876
No, I didn't mean…

725
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:52,501
I didn't mean to say that.

726
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,293
I'm really sorry.

727
01:13:56,376 --> 01:13:58,209
I'd like to help you.

728
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,043
- Eighteen, isn't that…
- Yes.

729
01:14:27,584 --> 01:14:30,293
AID in ICU, 10-9-8.

730
01:14:39,334 --> 01:14:40,542
Yeah?

731
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:43,501
Insured package for Katherine Hale.

732
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:50,251
Could you leave it out on the stoop?

733
01:14:50,376 --> 01:14:52,542
Somebody's got to sign for it.

734
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:55,709
Well, she's… She's not here.

735
01:14:55,834 --> 01:14:57,667
It's OK, you can sign.

736
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:08,542
- Yeah?
- Her name on top, yours on the bottom.

737
01:15:09,084 --> 01:15:10,751
All right.

738
01:15:10,876 --> 01:15:13,293
- Wonderful.
- Government pens.

739
01:15:13,418 --> 01:15:15,126
Look, I don't have another pen.

740
01:15:17,209 --> 01:15:18,625
I'll get one.

741
01:16:45,126 --> 01:16:47,501
Don't… Don't… No, no.

742
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:49,126
No, no. No.

743
01:16:49,251 --> 01:16:51,834
Now listen. You're OK. You're OK.

744
01:16:51,959 --> 01:16:54,001
Now listen to me. You're OK.

745
01:16:54,126 --> 01:16:59,001
Can you get dressed? You're OK.
Can you get dressed? Please, hurry.

746
01:17:42,834 --> 01:17:44,293
'Stella Boutique.'

747
01:17:45,959 --> 01:17:47,834
Extension 1891, please.

748
01:17:49,168 --> 01:17:50,584
'Pardon me?'

749
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:56,959
Is this 662-3799?

750
01:17:57,625 --> 01:18:00,293
- 'Yes. Who's this?'
- There's no extension 1891?

751
01:18:00,418 --> 01:18:03,251
'Are you kidding? We're lucky
if we have any phone service at all.'

752
01:18:03,376 --> 01:18:04,584
Sorry.

753
01:18:14,084 --> 01:18:15,792
- 'Operator.'
- Operator.

754
01:18:16,376 --> 01:18:19,542
What's the area code
for Washington? DC.

755
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:21,376
'That's 202.'

756
01:18:23,834 --> 01:18:25,001
Kathy.

757
01:18:31,584 --> 01:18:32,959
'6311.'

758
01:18:34,917 --> 01:18:36,418
CIA? Langley?

759
01:18:37,001 --> 01:18:38,418
'6311.'

760
01:18:40,376 --> 01:18:41,876
Extension 1891.

761
01:18:43,667 --> 01:18:45,209
'1891.'

762
01:18:46,584 --> 01:18:48,667
Let me speak to Mr Wicks.

763
01:18:50,876 --> 01:18:53,667
'He's not here just now.
May I ask who's calling, please?'

764
01:18:54,418 --> 01:18:58,460
- How do you feel? You OK?
- What did you do to those people?

765
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:02,376
What people?
I don't know who they are anymore.

766
01:19:02,501 --> 01:19:05,001
I file a report,
and a guy in Washington reads it.

767
01:19:05,126 --> 01:19:07,084
He's supposed to read it.
He's my section chief,

768
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:09,084
and he comes to New York to shoot me.

769
01:19:09,209 --> 01:19:11,168
- Did you know him?
- No.

770
01:19:12,251 --> 01:19:14,293
Did you know the mailman?

771
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:17,584
No, but the guy in Washington did.

772
01:19:18,209 --> 01:19:19,917
Then you won't know
the next one, either.

773
01:19:20,043 --> 01:19:21,667
I'm not gonna wait
for the next one.

774
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:25,209
- 'Has he gone double or dirty?'
- I don't know, sir.

775
01:19:25,334 --> 01:19:29,209
- 'You think he's still in New York City?'
- I wouldn't be.

776
01:19:29,334 --> 01:19:30,376
Question.

777
01:19:30,501 --> 01:19:33,709
Is there an intelligence network,
undetected by CIA,

778
01:19:33,834 --> 01:19:37,168
linking certain Arabic-speaking countries
with Dutch and Spanish-speaking?

779
01:19:37,293 --> 01:19:40,418
'We're already visible.
Let's not become conspicuous.'

780
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:43,751
If company agents aren't enough,
use freelance.

781
01:19:43,876 --> 01:19:46,543
Use whatever it requires, but end it.

782
01:19:57,084 --> 01:19:58,376
OK.

783
01:20:09,293 --> 01:20:11,334
Let's get it over with, OK?

784
01:20:14,418 --> 01:20:15,584
Kathy.

785
01:20:17,584 --> 01:20:18,751
Thanks.

786
01:20:41,168 --> 01:20:42,834
Applications here.

787
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:47,876
OK.

788
01:20:49,751 --> 01:20:53,460
See Mr Addison.
Turn right, first door on your left.

789
01:20:54,709 --> 01:20:56,084
Mr Marcus.

790
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,751
- Mr Addison?
- No.

791
01:21:25,334 --> 01:21:27,876
He's in Clearance.
You passed it. It's on your left.

792
01:21:28,834 --> 01:21:32,751
Oh, sorry. Thank you.

793
01:22:29,084 --> 01:22:31,251
Yep. I didn't get the job.

794
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:37,293
Looks good,

795
01:22:37,418 --> 01:22:41,043
but I have this friend,

796
01:22:41,168 --> 01:22:43,126
and he asked me
to give you a message.

797
01:22:43,251 --> 01:22:46,209
Quote, "Dear Mr Higgins,

798
01:22:46,334 --> 01:22:49,876
"this will introduce a friend of mine,
Sparrow Hawk.

799
01:22:50,959 --> 01:22:55,917
"Please accompany her to
the Nassau Street exit of this place.

800
01:22:56,043 --> 01:22:57,084
"Now."

801
01:22:59,959 --> 01:23:01,834
Personally, I'd do it,

802
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:06,667
because he has this huge gun,
and he's looking at us right now.

803
01:23:08,625 --> 01:23:10,543
I'll save this for you.

804
01:23:11,376 --> 01:23:12,543
Shall we?

805
01:23:17,043 --> 01:23:18,876
To your left, please.

806
01:23:40,293 --> 01:23:41,751
OK, sit up. Sit up!

807
01:23:41,876 --> 01:23:44,584
All the way up.
Back up against the panel.

808
01:23:45,293 --> 01:23:48,251
Take it easy. Take it easy.
I'm not armed.

809
01:23:48,376 --> 01:23:50,293
They could be DF-ing us
if you have a transmitter

810
01:23:50,418 --> 01:23:52,293
hidden somewhere on your clothes.
What's this?

811
01:23:52,418 --> 01:23:54,543
DF, huh?
You do read everything, don't you?

812
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:57,543
This is no goddamn book. Somebody
or something is rotten in the company.

813
01:23:57,667 --> 01:23:59,168
You never complained till yesterday.

814
01:23:59,293 --> 01:24:01,418
You didn't start killing my friends
till yesterday.

815
01:24:01,543 --> 01:24:03,709
- Who's she?
- Who hit the Lit Society?

816
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:07,501
We had a big meeting about that.
Your name came up.

817
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:10,209
Five Continents Imports. Ring a bell?

818
01:24:13,084 --> 01:24:15,043
- Where'd you get that?
- The mailman.

819
01:24:15,168 --> 01:24:16,376
- Mailman?
- The one you sent.

820
01:24:16,501 --> 01:24:19,543
You know, the one with the uniform,
cute little leather pouch, automatic gun.

821
01:24:19,667 --> 01:24:22,209
- We never use mailmen.
- Would you also happen to be familiar

822
01:24:22,334 --> 01:24:25,168
with a very tall gentleman,
about 6'4", blond hair,

823
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:27,460
strong like a farmer, not American?

824
01:24:27,584 --> 01:24:30,792
Accent. Country, near Germany.
Maybe Alsace-Lorraine?

825
01:24:57,751 --> 01:25:00,126
- Yes?
- 'Was the letter delivered?'

826
01:25:00,251 --> 01:25:03,209
The return receipt has not arrived.

827
01:25:03,334 --> 01:25:06,001
'You should've delivered it yourself.'

828
01:25:06,126 --> 01:25:09,084
A more complicated package
had to be handled.

829
01:25:09,876 --> 01:25:12,584
But I might have
underestimated this one.

830
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:15,709
'I was told you never make
that kind of mistake.

831
01:25:16,917 --> 01:25:19,043
- 'What will you do?'
- Wait.

832
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:20,917
'For what?'

833
01:25:21,876 --> 01:25:25,917
People who move
leave word of change-of-address.

834
01:25:26,043 --> 01:25:28,418
- I wanna see that report, Turner.
- No, no, Higgins, come on.

835
01:25:28,543 --> 01:25:30,168
- Do you know him?
- Professionally, yes.

836
01:25:30,293 --> 01:25:32,334
- Professionally, he kills people.
- Yes.

837
01:25:32,917 --> 01:25:33,959
Yes.

838
01:25:34,084 --> 01:25:35,584
He works for the company?

839
01:25:35,709 --> 01:25:37,834
He did once. He's a contract agent.

840
01:25:37,959 --> 01:25:40,084
- Contract agent.
- Freelance.

841
01:25:41,126 --> 01:25:42,293
Where did you see him?

842
01:25:45,084 --> 01:25:46,584
Uh-uh.

843
01:25:47,334 --> 01:25:49,209
- It would help if I knew.
- Who would it help?

844
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:51,792
- Who'd hire him now?
- Anybody.

845
01:25:51,917 --> 01:25:53,043
Terrific answer!

846
01:25:54,751 --> 01:25:56,959
- I wouldn't accept it, either.
- What's his name?

847
01:25:57,084 --> 01:26:00,667
- When I knew him, Joubert.
- Come on, Higgins. Who'd hire him?

848
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:02,585
You don't look up Joubert
in the Yellow Pages.

849
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:03,834
That's right.

850
01:26:04,709 --> 01:26:07,334
It would have to be
somebody in the community.

851
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,625
- Community?
- Intelligence field.

852
01:26:09,751 --> 01:26:13,792
Community! Jesus, you guys are
kind to yourselves. Community.

853
01:26:15,709 --> 01:26:17,251
I want to see that report, Turner.

854
01:26:17,376 --> 01:26:19,667
That report was sent to headquarters
and disappeared.

855
01:26:20,376 --> 01:26:23,043
- Who read it?
- You mean besides Wicks?

856
01:26:24,959 --> 01:26:26,376
You tell me.

857
01:26:30,126 --> 01:26:32,876
I pick up traces of what
I think's an intelligence network

858
01:26:33,001 --> 01:26:35,209
the company doesn't know about,

859
01:26:35,334 --> 01:26:36,667
and I report it.

860
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:40,460
Now, why is that going to
make anybody mad, Higgins?

861
01:26:40,585 --> 01:26:43,126
Unless it was the company's network
and you didn't want it blown,

862
01:26:43,251 --> 01:26:45,293
not even to your own guys.

863
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:49,126
Now, somebody is lying, Higgins.

864
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:50,460
Come on.

865
01:26:51,501 --> 01:26:53,460
Why is everybody so shy?

866
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,251
I'm not shy.

867
01:26:58,667 --> 01:27:01,084
I don't know. That's what worries me.

868
01:27:02,959 --> 01:27:05,293
- I don't know.
- Ask Wicks.

869
01:27:05,418 --> 01:27:06,667
Wicks died.

870
01:27:10,834 --> 01:27:14,334
Someone yanked him off the life
support system at Gouverneur Hospital.

871
01:27:25,126 --> 01:27:26,625
Get me in, Higgins.

872
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:31,585
What good would that do
if you're right, and they are inside?

873
01:27:31,709 --> 01:27:33,667
What good would it do to bring you in?

874
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,418
What am I supposed to do?

875
01:27:40,376 --> 01:27:41,585
I'm sorry.

876
01:27:43,084 --> 01:27:44,418
You're sorry?

877
01:27:51,792 --> 01:27:53,251
You're sorry.

878
01:27:57,084 --> 01:27:58,376
Oh, I get it.

879
01:28:00,293 --> 01:28:02,834
I get it. You expect me to draw fire,

880
01:28:03,876 --> 01:28:05,792
like one of those penny arcade bears

881
01:28:05,917 --> 01:28:08,084
that parades back and forth,
waiting for somebody,

882
01:28:08,209 --> 01:28:10,293
somebody very good,
just to take another shot.

883
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:11,751
And you're just gonna hang around

884
01:28:11,876 --> 01:28:13,876
and pick him up before he does it,
or just after?

885
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:15,667
I'm gonna try
and find out what's going on.

886
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:18,251
- I'm gonna cross-check all those names.
- Nice talking to you, Higgins.

887
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:19,792
- Now wait a minute.
- Have a nice day.

888
01:28:19,917 --> 01:28:21,834
Where are you going?
Where will I find you?

889
01:28:21,959 --> 01:28:23,168
I'll find you.

890
01:28:32,126 --> 01:28:34,043
Do you trust him?

891
01:28:34,168 --> 01:28:35,751
Trust.

892
01:28:35,876 --> 01:28:37,751
Does he trust you?

893
01:28:37,876 --> 01:28:40,084
He's in the suspicion business.
He can't trust anybody.

894
01:28:40,209 --> 01:28:42,709
But they all are. How could
anybody sneak in and fool them?

895
01:28:42,834 --> 01:28:44,667
Maybe nobody did.

896
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:48,084
- Then…
- Maybe there's another CIA

897
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:51,084
inside the CIA.

898
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:16,126
Hey, Sal.

899
01:29:17,043 --> 01:29:19,751
The lights went off.
Come on over here.

900
01:29:21,585 --> 01:29:23,418
The generator went off.

901
01:29:26,959 --> 01:29:29,876
- It's a hotel room.
- What hotel?

902
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:33,209
There's no tag.
It's Room 819, City of New York.

903
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:35,585
There's a code number cut in the edge.

904
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:37,293
You in the trade?

905
01:29:38,043 --> 01:29:41,251
- I read about it in a story.
- Was the story about locksmiths?

906
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:45,084
It's the lock manufacturer's code.
He can give you the name of the hotel.

907
01:29:45,209 --> 01:29:48,293
Look, I don't want to read
about you in the paper, sonny.

908
01:29:48,418 --> 01:29:50,334
Will you make the call?

909
01:30:28,334 --> 01:30:29,501
Yes?

910
01:30:31,209 --> 01:30:33,001
I'm doing a survey.

911
01:30:34,084 --> 01:30:37,043
Do you believe the Condor is
really an endangered species?

912
01:30:58,501 --> 01:31:00,959
'Your room number, please.'
'819.'

913
01:31:06,585 --> 01:31:08,001
- 'Hello?'
- Yes.

914
01:31:08,126 --> 01:31:10,625
- I just had an interesting call.
- 'Who is this?'

915
01:31:10,751 --> 01:31:14,084
In reference to an all but extinct bird,
the condor.

916
01:31:14,209 --> 01:31:17,418
'Have you had such a call?'
'You're a fool to call me here.'

917
01:31:17,543 --> 01:31:20,667
- You had no such call?
- 'No.'

918
01:31:20,792 --> 01:31:22,834
Must have been the Audubon Society.

919
01:31:22,959 --> 01:31:25,334
I assume they're still located
in New York City.

920
01:31:30,043 --> 01:31:32,876
'Langley Computer.
State your program at the tone.'

921
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:35,001
G.

922
01:31:35,751 --> 01:31:37,334
Carriage return.

923
01:31:38,251 --> 01:31:39,751
TRS. Tone.

924
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:42,709
Symbol for number.

925
01:31:43,876 --> 01:31:46,043
'Computer is ready.'

926
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:59,834
'That number is 202-227-0098.'

927
01:32:16,834 --> 01:32:20,418
- 'CNA, Mrs Coleman speaking.'
- This is Harold Thomas, Mrs Coleman.

928
01:32:20,543 --> 01:32:29,168
Customer service,
requesting a CNA on 202-227-0098.

929
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:31,084
'One moment, please.

930
01:32:33,667 --> 01:32:36,543
'That would be a Mr Leonard Atwood.

931
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:40,084
'365 Mackenzie Place,
Chevy Chase, Maryland.

932
01:33:16,585 --> 01:33:17,876
All right.

933
01:33:18,001 --> 01:33:21,792
Cross-check this tape against Wicks
and hold any intersects.

934
01:33:33,334 --> 01:33:34,585
Hat size.

935
01:33:40,959 --> 01:33:42,209
"Lucifer."

936
01:33:43,251 --> 01:33:45,251
All right, run Lucifer.

937
01:33:45,376 --> 01:33:46,667
Coming up.

938
01:34:08,334 --> 01:34:11,585
I'll be damned. I'll be damned.

939
01:35:03,876 --> 01:35:08,084
- This is the Major.
- 'Condor. Find me Higgins.'

940
01:35:08,585 --> 01:35:11,168
Routing you, Condor. Stand by.

941
01:35:16,709 --> 01:35:18,251
Hello, Condor.

942
01:35:18,376 --> 01:35:22,251
- The Holiday Inn, 57th Street.
- 'Is that where you are now?'

943
01:35:22,376 --> 01:35:26,251
Room 819. If you move it, you'll find
the Alsatian gentleman we spoke of.

944
01:35:26,376 --> 01:35:27,792
'Where are you, Condor?'

945
01:35:28,585 --> 01:35:32,376
- Where are you?
- Quiet down.

946
01:35:33,792 --> 01:35:34,917
Hey, Higgins?

947
01:35:35,043 --> 01:35:37,334
Yeah, I'm right here.

948
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:40,168
Who is Leonard Atwood?

949
01:35:49,876 --> 01:35:51,334
Where are you, Higgins?

950
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:58,209
Ain't we pals anymore?

951
01:36:01,626 --> 01:36:03,876
- Something?
- Major?

952
01:36:04,001 --> 01:36:06,501
- Got him.
- Let me see that.

953
01:36:09,543 --> 01:36:11,293
What's he doing in Brooklyn?

954
01:36:11,876 --> 01:36:13,501
Condor.

955
01:36:13,626 --> 01:36:16,084
- We can get a unit…
- Wait.

956
01:36:23,959 --> 01:36:28,043
- What's going on, Major?
- Son of a bitch wired together 50 phones.

957
01:36:28,168 --> 01:36:29,209
What?

958
01:36:29,334 --> 01:36:32,460
Everybody in Brooklyn's
talking to each other.

959
01:36:50,209 --> 01:36:53,376
- I didn't know you smoked.
- I quit three years ago.

960
01:36:55,751 --> 01:36:58,585
- You're so pale.
- It's the light in here.

961
01:37:03,418 --> 01:37:05,501
What are you gonna do there?

962
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:08,585
- See a guy.
- More secrets.

963
01:37:09,334 --> 01:37:11,543
Like those pictures you hide.

964
01:37:12,751 --> 01:37:13,876
Yes.

965
01:37:15,084 --> 01:37:18,251
Someday, I'd like to show them to you,

966
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:21,876
if you live through this.

967
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:25,834
You could drive me to Washington.

968
01:37:31,959 --> 01:37:33,709
No, I couldn't.

969
01:37:37,334 --> 01:37:41,917
You…
You have a lot of very fine qualities,

970
01:37:44,251 --> 01:37:47,209
- but…
- What fine qualities?

971
01:37:55,876 --> 01:37:57,626
You have good eyes.

972
01:37:59,501 --> 01:38:05,376
Not kind, but they don't lie,
and they don't look away much,

973
01:38:06,667 --> 01:38:08,876
and they don't miss anything.

974
01:38:10,959 --> 01:38:13,084
I could use eyes like that.

975
01:38:15,418 --> 01:38:17,209
But you're overdue in Vermont.

976
01:38:24,209 --> 01:38:25,959
Is he a tough guy?

977
01:38:27,418 --> 01:38:29,084
He's pretty tough.

978
01:38:31,001 --> 01:38:32,626
What will he do?

979
01:38:33,751 --> 01:38:35,585
Understand, probably.

980
01:38:38,084 --> 01:38:40,959
Boy, that is tough.

981
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:43,334
'Last call, track six,

982
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:47,792
'Newark connection passengers destined
for Washington DC, all aboard.'

983
01:38:51,084 --> 01:38:53,585
Kathy, I need time.

984
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:57,418
Eight hours or so, that's all.
Just till noon.

985
01:38:57,543 --> 01:38:59,460
To do what I have to do.

986
01:39:00,543 --> 01:39:04,168
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- No.

987
01:39:04,293 --> 01:39:06,168
Are you going right to Vermont?

988
01:39:08,418 --> 01:39:09,709
Yes.

989
01:39:10,626 --> 01:39:13,834
What I mean is don't call anyone.

990
01:39:15,917 --> 01:39:17,626
Don't stop, please.

991
01:39:19,209 --> 01:39:21,293
Don't tell anyone about…

992
01:39:30,959 --> 01:39:32,460
- Jesus.
- What?

993
01:39:33,418 --> 01:39:34,585
Jesus.

994
01:39:35,084 --> 01:39:36,626
I… I didn't…

995
01:39:36,751 --> 01:39:38,251
'All aboard!'

996
01:39:39,709 --> 01:39:40,751
Hey.

997
01:39:42,418 --> 01:39:46,460
- You take care of yourself.
- I'll do my best.

998
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:49,917
Do your best.

999
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:01,792
Why aren't you further along,
Mr Higgins?

1000
01:40:01,917 --> 01:40:03,585
You mean
with the company, sir?

1001
01:40:03,709 --> 01:40:05,585
You seem perfect for it.

1002
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:11,084
Are you perfect for it, Mr Higgins?

1003
01:40:12,668 --> 01:40:14,209
I have tried to be, sir.

1004
01:40:15,043 --> 01:40:17,959
- You were recruited out of school?
- No, sir.

1005
01:40:18,084 --> 01:40:20,251
Company interviewed
a few of us in Korea.

1006
01:40:21,084 --> 01:40:24,376
You served with Colonel Donovan
in the OSS, didn't you, sir?

1007
01:40:24,501 --> 01:40:28,251
I sailed the Adriatic
with a movie star at the helm.

1008
01:40:30,084 --> 01:40:33,834
Doesn't seem like much of a war now,
but it was.

1009
01:40:35,251 --> 01:40:37,585
I go even further back than that.

1010
01:40:37,709 --> 01:40:41,418
Ten years after the Great War,
as we used to call it,

1011
01:40:42,834 --> 01:40:45,209
before we knew enough
to number them.

1012
01:40:46,334 --> 01:40:49,251
- You miss that kind of action, sir?
- No.

1013
01:40:50,709 --> 01:40:52,917
I miss that kind of clarity.

1014
01:40:57,418 --> 01:40:58,460
Yes?

1015
01:41:00,959 --> 01:41:02,209
Thank you.

1016
01:41:04,043 --> 01:41:06,293
He's being held at New York Center.

1017
01:41:13,084 --> 01:41:16,460
Mr Higgins, you do understand
the company's position.

1018
01:41:19,293 --> 01:41:22,751
There's nothing in the way
of your doing this, is there?

1019
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:08,668
What is this? What's going on?

1020
01:42:27,543 --> 01:42:29,084
Who are you?

1021
01:42:38,543 --> 01:42:39,959
Who are you?

1022
01:42:40,959 --> 01:42:42,917
What are you doing here?

1023
01:42:44,293 --> 01:42:45,709
I'm Condor.

1024
01:42:49,668 --> 01:42:51,168
Sit down.

1025
01:42:52,834 --> 01:42:54,917
What do you do for a living?

1026
01:42:55,501 --> 01:42:57,834
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No.

1027
01:42:59,084 --> 01:43:02,876
What do you do exactly?

1028
01:43:05,751 --> 01:43:08,001
Deputy Director of Operations.

1029
01:43:09,751 --> 01:43:11,126
What section?

1030
01:43:11,751 --> 01:43:13,001
Middle East.

1031
01:43:15,543 --> 01:43:17,543
What are you working on?

1032
01:43:20,084 --> 01:43:21,792
What are you doing?

1033
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:27,501
What's the secret worth murdering
everybody at the ALHS house?

1034
01:43:28,209 --> 01:43:30,751
- There's no secret.
- Wicks showed you my report.

1035
01:43:30,876 --> 01:43:32,585
What report? Yes.

1036
01:43:38,460 --> 01:43:40,626
It was your network I turned up.

1037
01:43:43,834 --> 01:43:45,084
Doing what?

1038
01:43:46,792 --> 01:43:48,126
Doing what?

1039
01:43:49,792 --> 01:43:52,792
What does Operations care
about a bunch of goddamn books?

1040
01:43:52,917 --> 01:43:54,460
A book in Dutch.

1041
01:43:56,126 --> 01:43:58,001
A book out of Venezuela.

1042
01:43:58,126 --> 01:44:00,418
- Mystery stories in Arabic.
- Wait.

1043
01:44:00,543 --> 01:44:02,751
What the hell is so important about…

1044
01:44:08,834 --> 01:44:10,126
Oil fields.

1045
01:44:14,751 --> 01:44:15,876
Oil.

1046
01:44:28,376 --> 01:44:30,126
That's it, isn't it?

1047
01:44:35,334 --> 01:44:37,834
This whole damn thing was about oil.

1048
01:44:39,959 --> 01:44:41,917
Wasn't it? Wasn't it?

1049
01:44:43,501 --> 01:44:44,917
Yes, it was.

1050
01:44:46,626 --> 01:44:48,001
Don't turn for a moment.

1051
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:51,501
Put your thumb in front of the hammer.

1052
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:59,043
Release it slowly.

1053
01:45:02,917 --> 01:45:04,751
Set down the gun on the desk.

1054
01:45:11,084 --> 01:45:12,834
And don't move.

1055
01:45:24,501 --> 01:45:25,709
Back up.

1056
01:45:32,334 --> 01:45:34,585
You were quite good, Condor, until this.

1057
01:45:38,209 --> 01:45:39,460
This move was predictable.

1058
01:45:42,917 --> 01:45:44,084
Hey!

1059
01:46:05,209 --> 01:46:06,418
What?

1060
01:46:08,126 --> 01:46:09,293
What?

1061
01:46:09,917 --> 01:46:11,917
Did you touch anything
except the chair?

1062
01:46:14,251 --> 01:46:16,293
You're working for the company again.

1063
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:20,001
The desk? The lamp?

1064
01:46:21,543 --> 01:46:23,585
Jesus. They took you back.

1065
01:46:25,293 --> 01:46:28,126
Just for this. For Atwood.

1066
01:46:30,043 --> 01:46:33,501
How… He's with the company. Why?

1067
01:46:34,501 --> 01:46:36,168
I don't interest myself in why.

1068
01:46:36,293 --> 01:46:42,084
I think more often in terms of when,
sometimes where, always how much.

1069
01:46:43,626 --> 01:46:46,792
I suspect he was about to
become an embarrassment,

1070
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:49,585
as you are.

1071
01:46:57,626 --> 01:46:59,001
So you're not finished.

1072
01:46:59,126 --> 01:47:00,418
Pardon?

1073
01:47:00,543 --> 01:47:04,293
Oh, no. I have no arrangement
with the company concerning you.

1074
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:07,834
They didn't know you'd be here.
I knew you'd be here.

1075
01:47:13,001 --> 01:47:14,751
But didn't you send the mailman?

1076
01:47:15,751 --> 01:47:18,668
That was a business arrangement
with Atwood.

1077
01:47:18,792 --> 01:47:20,376
But you see…

1078
01:47:27,668 --> 01:47:29,043
Come on.

1079
01:47:36,959 --> 01:47:38,293
Come.

1080
01:48:12,084 --> 01:48:14,001
Tell me about the girl.

1081
01:48:17,543 --> 01:48:19,293
What about the girl?

1082
01:48:20,751 --> 01:48:23,168
She was chosen how?

1083
01:48:24,501 --> 01:48:25,834
By age?

1084
01:48:25,959 --> 01:48:29,959
- Her car? Appearance?
- At random.

1085
01:48:31,376 --> 01:48:33,959
- Chance.
- Really?

1086
01:48:37,626 --> 01:48:39,209
Can I drop you?

1087
01:48:45,043 --> 01:48:47,376
I'd like to go back to New York.

1088
01:48:50,376 --> 01:48:52,209
You have not much future there.

1089
01:48:58,543 --> 01:49:00,710
It would happen this way.

1090
01:49:01,668 --> 01:49:03,293
You may be walking.

1091
01:49:04,876 --> 01:49:08,084
Maybe the first sunny day
of the spring,

1092
01:49:09,293 --> 01:49:11,668
and a car will slow beside you,

1093
01:49:12,501 --> 01:49:13,751
and the door will open,

1094
01:49:13,876 --> 01:49:16,917
and someone you know,
maybe even trust,

1095
01:49:17,668 --> 01:49:19,334
will get out of the car.

1096
01:49:21,376 --> 01:49:24,501
And he will smile, a becoming smile,

1097
01:49:26,710 --> 01:49:29,460
but he will leave open
the door of the car

1098
01:49:31,334 --> 01:49:33,668
and offer to give you a lift.

1099
01:49:39,710 --> 01:49:42,209
You seem to understand it all so well.

1100
01:49:45,126 --> 01:49:46,834
What would you suggest?

1101
01:49:48,043 --> 01:49:50,084
Personally, I prefer Europe.

1102
01:49:50,751 --> 01:49:53,126
- Europe?
- Yes.

1103
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:58,084
Well, the fact is,
what I do is not a bad occupation.

1104
01:49:59,460 --> 01:50:01,418
Someone is always willing to pay.

1105
01:50:06,209 --> 01:50:10,876
I would find it… tiring.

1106
01:50:11,001 --> 01:50:15,168
Oh, no. It's quite restful.
It's almost peaceful.

1107
01:50:15,293 --> 01:50:18,293
No need to believe in either side
or any side.

1108
01:50:19,209 --> 01:50:20,751
There is no cause.

1109
01:50:21,293 --> 01:50:23,209
There's only yourself.

1110
01:50:24,126 --> 01:50:26,418
The belief is in your own precision.

1111
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:35,251
I was born in the United States, Joubert.

1112
01:50:37,501 --> 01:50:39,876
I miss it when I'm away too long.

1113
01:50:40,917 --> 01:50:42,293
A pity.

1114
01:50:45,293 --> 01:50:46,917
I don't think so.

1115
01:50:50,668 --> 01:50:53,043
Is it any trouble to drop me
at the Union Station?

1116
01:50:53,168 --> 01:50:56,751
Oh, no. It would be my pleasure.

1117
01:51:05,334 --> 01:51:06,668
For that day.

1118
01:51:27,126 --> 01:51:28,376
Higgins!

1119
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:33,001
Higgins!

1120
01:51:50,710 --> 01:51:53,251
Turner. Why'd you call so late?
We were worried about you.

1121
01:51:53,376 --> 01:51:55,293
Likewise. The car for me?

1122
01:51:55,418 --> 01:51:58,543
Yeah, it's all right. It's safe.
You have a few hours of debriefing.

1123
01:51:58,668 --> 01:52:00,543
- Hey, Higgins?
- Yeah?

1124
01:52:02,001 --> 01:52:07,834
Let's say for the purposes of argument,
I had a .45 in one of my pockets.

1125
01:52:09,917 --> 01:52:12,543
And I wanted you to take a walk
with me. You'd do it, right?

1126
01:52:14,418 --> 01:52:15,751
Which way?

1127
01:52:16,792 --> 01:52:17,917
West.

1128
01:52:18,792 --> 01:52:19,917
Slowly.

1129
01:52:20,043 --> 01:52:23,126
Stay in front of me about three
or four steps.

1130
01:52:31,585 --> 01:52:33,334
Where are we going?

1131
01:52:34,710 --> 01:52:36,710
Wave them on ahead, Higgins.

1132
01:52:46,751 --> 01:52:49,543
Do we have plans
to invade the Middle East?

1133
01:52:50,084 --> 01:52:52,376
- Are you crazy?
- Am I?

1134
01:52:52,501 --> 01:52:54,543
- Look, Turner…
- Do we have plans?

1135
01:52:54,668 --> 01:52:56,959
No. Absolutely not.

1136
01:52:57,084 --> 01:52:59,876
We have games. That's all.

1137
01:53:00,001 --> 01:53:02,043
We play games. What if?

1138
01:53:02,752 --> 01:53:05,084
How many men?
What would it take?

1139
01:53:05,752 --> 01:53:08,834
Is there a cheaper way
to destabilise a regime?

1140
01:53:08,959 --> 01:53:12,626
- That's what we're paid to do.
- Walk on.

1141
01:53:12,752 --> 01:53:14,084
Go on.

1142
01:53:18,626 --> 01:53:21,084
So Atwood just took
the games too seriously.

1143
01:53:21,209 --> 01:53:23,792
He was really going to do it, wasn't he?

1144
01:53:23,917 --> 01:53:25,959
A renegade operation.

1145
01:53:26,084 --> 01:53:28,585
Atwood knew 54/12
would never authorise it.

1146
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:30,668
There was no way,
not with the heat on the company.

1147
01:53:30,792 --> 01:53:32,293
What if there hadn't been any heat?

1148
01:53:32,418 --> 01:53:35,668
Supposing I hadn't stumbled
on their plan, say nobody had.

1149
01:53:36,792 --> 01:53:38,834
Different ballgame.

1150
01:53:38,959 --> 01:53:41,792
Fact is,
there was nothing wrong with the plan.

1151
01:53:41,917 --> 01:53:45,251
The plan was all right.
The plan would've worked.

1152
01:53:47,001 --> 01:53:49,334
Boy, what is it with you people?

1153
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:52,959
Do you think not getting caught on a lie
is the same thing as telling the truth?

1154
01:53:53,084 --> 01:53:56,001
No. It's simple economics.

1155
01:53:56,126 --> 01:53:58,001
Today it's oil, right?

1156
01:53:58,126 --> 01:54:02,876
In 10 or 15 years, food, plutonium,
and maybe even sooner.

1157
01:54:03,001 --> 01:54:06,251
Now, what do you think the people
are going to want us to do then?

1158
01:54:07,418 --> 01:54:08,460
Ask them.

1159
01:54:08,585 --> 01:54:11,876
Not now. Then.
Ask them when they're running out.

1160
01:54:12,001 --> 01:54:14,834
Ask them when there's no heat
in their homes, and they're cold.

1161
01:54:14,959 --> 01:54:16,834
Ask them when their engines stop.

1162
01:54:16,959 --> 01:54:20,418
Ask them when people who've never
known hunger start going hungry.

1163
01:54:20,543 --> 01:54:22,126
You want to know something?

1164
01:54:22,251 --> 01:54:25,710
They won't want us to ask them.
They'll just want us to get it for them.

1165
01:54:27,084 --> 01:54:30,959
Boy, have you found a home?

1166
01:54:33,126 --> 01:54:35,126
Seven people killed, Higgins.

1167
01:54:35,251 --> 01:54:38,168
- The company didn't order it.
- Atwood did.

1168
01:54:38,293 --> 01:54:39,668
Atwood did.

1169
01:54:40,501 --> 01:54:43,585
And who the hell is Atwood?
He's you. He's all you guys.

1170
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:45,501
Seven people killed!

1171
01:54:45,626 --> 01:54:49,543
- And you play fucking games!
- Right.

1172
01:54:49,668 --> 01:54:52,126
And the other side does, too.

1173
01:54:52,251 --> 01:54:54,917
That's why we can't let you stay outside.

1174
01:54:55,043 --> 01:54:58,501
Well, go on home, Higgins.
Go on. They've got it.

1175
01:55:00,084 --> 01:55:01,668
- What?
- You know where we are.

1176
01:55:01,792 --> 01:55:05,334
Just look around. They've got it.
That's where they ship from.

1177
01:55:05,460 --> 01:55:07,293
They've got all of it.

1178
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:21,293
- What? What did you do?
- I told them a story.

1179
01:55:21,418 --> 01:55:25,084
You play games,
I told them a story.

1180
01:55:33,293 --> 01:55:34,668
Oh you…

1181
01:55:35,501 --> 01:55:41,792
You poor, dumb son of a bitch.
You done more damage than you know.

1182
01:55:43,752 --> 01:55:45,251
I hope so.

1183
01:55:53,668 --> 01:55:55,834
You're about to be a very lonely man.

1184
01:55:59,917 --> 01:56:01,585
It didn't have to end this way.

1185
01:56:02,126 --> 01:56:03,752
Of course it did.

1186
01:56:06,084 --> 01:56:07,585
Hey, Turner.

1187
01:56:09,626 --> 01:56:11,043
How do you know they'll print it?

1188
01:56:13,792 --> 01:56:15,084
You can take a walk,

1189
01:56:16,501 --> 01:56:18,834
but how far if they don't print it?

1190
01:56:19,543 --> 01:56:21,001
They'll print it.

1191
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:24,251
How do you know?
