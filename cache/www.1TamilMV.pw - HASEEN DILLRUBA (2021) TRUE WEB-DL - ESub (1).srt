1
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:22,458
DEDICATED TO MY DEAR FATHER
MR. LILARAM RAI SINGHANI

2
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:03,083
Rishu.

3
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,375
Rishu.

4
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,625
Rishu!

5
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,458
Rishu!

6
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,625
Rishu!

7
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:35,750
RANI

8
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,458
Name, Rishabh Saxena.

9
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,125
Age, 32 years.

10
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,875
Time of blast was between 4:00 and 4:30.

11
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,125
Everything is burnt.

12
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:02,625
He was hit on the head with
a heavy object, probably before the blast.

13
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,875
I see. Find out when it happened.

14
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,500
Sir, we've got fingerprints of one hand.

15
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,333
The rest of the body is completely burnt.

16
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,708
-There is a deep wound on the head.
-Yes, sir.

17
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,292
The body is completely burnt.
Only this hand remains.

18
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,083
There is a deep wound on the head.

19
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,708
Seems like he died before the blast.

20
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,000
There's "Rani" tattooed on the wrist…

21
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,083
Rani is his wife, she's sitting there.

22
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:27,708
This is not an accident, sir.

23
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,667
Once we get the murder weapon,
everything will be clear.

24
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,875
Stop sulking.

25
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,792
We're going to see
a girl for you to marry!

26
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,625
We'd done this two years ago as well.

27
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,583
Remember?

28
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:05,833
Exactly.

29
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,458
It's been two years!

30
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,875
You met Meera for all of two minutes,
but you're still not over her.

31
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,792
Tell me, what else do you like?

32
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:19,083
Mahesh.

33
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:22,750
I really like Mahesh.

34
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,583
We studied together in college.

35
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:28,417
I've not been able
to tell Daddy about him.

36
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:33,917
Who falls in love
with the first girl he meets?

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,625
You've been moping around since.

38
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:39,167
And here we have got such a nice proposal.
Your horoscopes have also matched.

39
00:04:40,417 --> 00:04:41,542
Her name is lovely too.

40
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,917
Rani Kashyap.

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,042
Rishu-Rani, the names sound good together.

42
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:50,708
The girl is pretty, well-mannered…

43
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,042
she's a vegetarian and fair-skinned too!

44
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,375
She has completed her Masters
in Hindi Literature.

45
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,292
Stop it now, Mommy.
I'm meeting her now anyway.

46
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,958
And please, don't use the "going to the
washroom" excuse to survey the house.

47
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:03,167
Let's go.

48
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,833
Please, have some more food.
Rani has cooked all the food.

49
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:24,958
-All of these?
-Yes.

50
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:28,417
-And this <i>kachori </i>as well?
-Of course.

51
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,667
She has also embroidered
these covers on the sofa.

52
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,542
Do you like him?

53
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,625
He's an engineer
at the Jwalapur Electricity Board.

54
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,125
Don't know.

55
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:45,750
I don't want to live in Jwalapur.

56
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,542
Don't think of it like that.

57
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,750
Remember your boyfriend of five years,
what's his name…

58
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,583
Neeraj Khaitan.
That gasbag vamoosed off to America.

59
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,542
And the other guy you dated for two years…

60
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,333
Aunty, I know… He was my boyfriend.
I remember very well.

61
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,583
Stop dreaming of
these romantic novel heroes

62
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,750
and grab a simple guy like him.

63
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,292
Plus, you're not getting any younger.

64
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,125
Also, it's very difficult
to find a match for your horoscope.

65
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,958
Your father has found only
two matches in the last two years.

66
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,958
Look at your other option.

67
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,875
This man from Mumbai.

68
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,750
Your horoscope has matched with his.

69
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,333
And this… Jwalapur.

70
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,542
Jwalapur?

71
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,167
So what?

72
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,792
Your husband seems like a quiet man,
just like mine.

73
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:33,625
Rani would like to talk to Rishu,
in the kitchen.

74
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:36,750
Please come.

75
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:40,917
Just don't ask her what else she likes.

76
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,958
Please come.

77
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,625
-Hello.
-Hello.

78
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:15,417
Okay, let me start with some
bullet points about myself.

79
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,833
I have studied literature.

80
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,792
I work as a beauty salon manager,
as a hobby.

81
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,000
And I hate doing household chores.

82
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:29,958
Apart from this,
I'm a well-mannered and homely girl.

83
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:37,333
You're getting a great combo here,
a beauty with brains and a hot bod.

84
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:45,958
All we want is a simple and homely girl.

85
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,750
In that case, it's a perfect match.

86
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,250
Have you read books
written by Dinesh Pandit?

87
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,542
He's the best crime novelist!

88
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:59,250
His forte is writing about
spine-chilling murders in small towns,

89
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,333
which nobody can solve.

90
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:02,708
Have you heard of him?

91
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,750
No. I just heard of him now, from you.

92
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,583
Do you have anything else
you'd like to ask me now?

93
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:13,292
Or do you plan to come back to Delhi,
to continue this conversation?

94
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,708
Er, no…

95
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,208
Never mind, tell me about your hobbies.

96
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,333
-My hobbies…
-Yes, what are your hobbies?

97
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,833
I'm telling you.

98
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,750
Well…

99
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:31,417
My neighbors call me over on weekends
to fix their electronic appliances.

100
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,417
I like fixing gadgets.
I'm an engineer. They must have told you.

101
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,542
That's great. It's perfect timing!

102
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,958
-Thank you.
-Let me test you on this.

103
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:40,708
This fan has conked off.

104
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,000
Fix it.

105
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:46,917
Now?

106
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,708
Do you need anything from here?

107
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,125
Beena, where's the toilet?

108
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,125
This way.

109
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:02,583
Go straight and take a left.

110
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,542
It's…

111
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,292
I was looking for the toilet.

112
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:14,042
Let us discuss this with our
<i>guruji </i>and we'll let you know.

113
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:14,958
Okay?

114
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,458
Listen!

115
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:24,958
If you insist on marrying this girl,
I'll drink this poison.

116
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:27,083
Mommy, I really like Rani Kashyap.

117
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:49,250
In that case, I'll hang myself and die.

118
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,208
You can marry her after I'm dead.

119
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,958
Fine, I'll jump to my death.

120
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:03,125
What?

121
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:04,708
Won't you stop me?

122
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,292
I'm confused as to what to stop you from.

123
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,875
Poisoning, hanging,
or jumping to your death?

124
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,750
Decide and let me know.

125
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,833
Mark my words,
both of you won't get along.

126
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,167
You won't be able to handle her.

127
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,250
I'm an engineer, Mommy.

128
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,500
I handle livewires every day.

129
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,917
Of course, I can handle her.

130
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,042
You know what, Uncle?

131
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,250
-All she needs is to be trained.
-Really?

132
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,750
You can easily train her
in the first ten days.

133
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,042
Besides she seems very bubbly.

134
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,667
They all seem very
bubbly in the beginning.

135
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,250
So did she, when I married her.

136
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:41,375
You looked like a bubble too, at first,
and then my bubble burst.

137
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,833
<i>Everyone looks at me in wonder</i>

138
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:50,333
<i>As I call out your name, day and night</i>

139
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,375
<i>My happiness knows no bounds</i>

140
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,333
<i>Sparks of desire fly everywhere</i>

141
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:59,875
<i>Fly everywhere</i>

142
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,083
<i>As our eyes meet</i>

143
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,042
<i>A fire comes alight</i>

144
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,917
<i>And in its flames</i>

145
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,292
<i>My poor heart melts</i>

146
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,250
<i>As our eyes meet</i>

147
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,292
<i>A fire comes alight</i>

148
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,875
<i>And in its flames</i>

149
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,375
<i>My poor heart melts</i>

150
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,458
That loser has struck gold!

151
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,875
The poor guy doesn't know
what's about to hit him!

152
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,042
DINESH PANDIT
<i>WRATH OF KASAULI</i>

153
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,042
<i>Confusion.</i>

154
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:43,542
<i>He is naughty yet a bit naive</i>

155
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,917
<i>The guy is so very naive</i>

156
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:50,958
<i>I too feel some sparks within me</i>

157
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:54,958
<i>Sparks light up within</i>

158
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:58,375
<i>My heart flutters when I see him</i>

159
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:02,042
<i>But I'm confused if he's hot or not</i>

160
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,458
<i>Hot or not</i>

161
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:08,875
<i>My heart leads meHere and there</i>

162
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,625
<i>It knows not what it wants</i>

163
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,042
<i>Everything gleams and shines</i>

00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,083
<i>The girl is nice</i>

165
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,917
<i>The guy is crooked</i>

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,542
<i>A bunch of lies</i>

167
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,417
<i>Oh, ho, ho</i>

168
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,542
<i>The guy is naive</i>

169
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,250
<i>The girl is sly</i>

170
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,958
<i>And therefore it's a</i>

171
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:30,542
<i>No, no, no</i>

172
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,583
<i>As our eyes meetA fire comes alight</i>

173
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,208
<i>And in its flames</i>

174
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:38,667
<i>My poor heart melts</i>

175
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,208
<i>My poor heart melts</i>

176
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,125
<i>Who switched off the lights?</i>

177
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,458
Ms. Rani.

178
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,917
Sir will be here in five minutes.

179
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,917
Your tiffin box fell, sir.

180
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,333
This is my favorite case.

181
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:16,917
But why, Rastogi?

182
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,708
Finally, after all
the riot and burglary cases,

183
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:23,375
I can relax, have my tea and snacks
as we discuss this case.

184
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:28,250
Rastogi, this case
is a breath of fresh air.

185
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:31,625
It's like poetry, with love and conflict

186
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,083
This case has riled Kishore Sir,
hence his personal interest…

187
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:35,500
He thought it was an open and shut case.

188
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,292
This woman looks like a murderer.

189
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,250
Case file solved. Medal received.

190
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,375
But madam has got…

191
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,292
-…his knickers in a twist!
-…his knickers in a twist !

192
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,125
Oh!

193
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,833
Any news of that boy?

194
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,125
It's a dead-end, sir.

195
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,583
The team returned today.

196
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,875
Sir?

197
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,333
Madam has been waiting
for the last two hours.

198
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:58,917
Good.

199
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:01,458
Let her get used to being in prison.

200
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,792
Rishabh Saxena.

201
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:13,458
Madam, we've been going over
the same story for two months now.

202
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,125
Why don't you tell me the truth, for once?

203
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,875
So madam, why did you kill your husband?

204
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:33,917
Only a vile woman
can kill such a loving husband.

205
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,292
He had even tattooed
your name on his wrist.

206
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,500
"Rani."

207
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,833
And you blew him to pieces?

208
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,917
All that remained of him
was his hand… bearing witness.

209
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:50,875
Rani Kashyap, you may have fooled
Rishu and everyone else,

210
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,417
but I'm certain
that you are the one who killed Rishu.

211
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,333
Should I tattoo your name
on my wrist as well?

212
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,333
"Killer Rani Kashyap!"

213
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:00,667
Huh?

214
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,125
Go ahead, sir.

215
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,667
But that won't change the truth.
That I am innocent.

216
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,917
Really?

217
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,625
Let's start from the beginning.

218
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,042
What was your relationship like,
with your husband?

219
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,000
Like any other
husband-and-wife relationship…

220
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:28,917
Sometimes good…

221
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:31,875
sometimes not so good.

222
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,083
Take this, Rani.

223
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,208
-It's been an hour. Still no sign of him.
-He's still not here.

224
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,250
-Did you speak to him?
-Did you tell him what time…

225
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:03,542
-There he is.
-Afzar has come!

226
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:08,167
Bro, there's a lot of traffic
at the junction.

227
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,833
Why don't you take Rani in the car?

228
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,417
I'll get the luggage in that one.

229
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,750
-Okay.
-Hello, Rani.

230
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,417
Please go ahead. I got the car cleaned.

231
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,208
<i>A new city. </i>

232
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,375
<i>New people.</i>

233
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,333
<i>A new husband.</i>

234
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,917
<i>Dinesh Pandit would have liked Jwalapur…</i>

235
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,875
<i>but I didn't care much for it.</i>

236
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:34,167
<i>Our first meeting, the skies weptand the city drowned…</i>

237
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,042
<i>Seems like Jwalapur didn't caremuch for me either.</i>

238
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,083
Hello! Fetch me too. Already forgotten me?

239
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,042
Don't you… have any friends?

240
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,000
There was no one to receive us.

241
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:26,333
But Afzar was there.

242
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,625
There wasn't any musical band
to welcome us either.

243
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,583
It was getting very late.

244
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:36,125
I thought we'd celebrate tomorrow.

245
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:39,917
Also, it's raining so heavily.

246
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:42,958
In Delhi, we don't let
such small things ruin our plans.

247
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,458
Er, sorry. A lot of rainwater came inside.

248
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:10,292
Give me two minutes, I'll clean this mess.

249
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:49,708
Misers!

250
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,917
Hello, Uncle.

251
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,042
Hello, Aunty.

252
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,583
Hi.

253
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:02,042
Hi.

254
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:04,583
Oh, there's tea!

255
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:13,500
It's empty.

256
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,167
I'll get some more.

257
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,500
Thanks.

258
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:23,417
Rani, our neighbors
will come to meet you today.

259
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Why don't you make
some delicious onion and potato fritters?

260
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:33,375
Sorry, Aunty,
I don't know how to make fritters.

261
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,708
You know what,
I can't even make a decent cup of tea.

262
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:40,125
No problem, I am good at it.
I'll get a cup for you.

263
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,500
-Great.
-Hold on.

264
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:43,875
Wait a minute.

265
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:49,083
Your mother said that you
had cooked all the food

266
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,083
that we ate at your house.

267
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,917
And I'd told Rishu…

268
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,917
hadn't I?

269
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,417
The <i>kachoris</i> were very crispy.

270
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,792
-Yes, you did.
-Aunty…

271
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,083
don't believe everything my mother says.

272
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:02,417
She will even claim
that my father can build airplanes.

273
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,917
Don't take her seriously.
She has a bad habit of exaggerating.

274
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,833
Because of this bad habit of hers,
now we're saddled with you.

275
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:13,333
She had guaranteed
that you are docile and talented.

276
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:16,500
Show us how docile you are!

277
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:18,667
I am very docile, Aunty.

278
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,375
I religiously fast on Mondays.
I am a vegetarian.

279
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,458
It's just that I don't know
how to make fritters, that's all.

280
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,917
I can do everything else.

281
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Threading, waxing,
bikini wax, cleanup, manicure-pedicure.

282
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,125
I can even get rid of your blackheads.

283
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,458
We've landed up with a beauty parlor
instead of a daughter-in-law.

284
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,375
Your biodata said
that you are a homely girl.

285
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,792
Let's not talk about biodatas, Aunty.

286
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,208
Your son's biodata said that he's 5'10".

287
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:48,083
There's no way he's more than 5'8"!

288
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,208
I'll… I'll get the tea and fritters.

289
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:56,917
Problem solved.

290
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,167
Please carry on.

291
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,500
I'll… I'll be back.

292
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:25,875
Did you study homeopathy?

293
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,458
Not really. It's my hobby.

294
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,708
Okay, let me test your knowledge.

295
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:38,042
What if I'm losing hair?

296
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,250
Are you?

297
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,875
It's just a test.

298
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,167
Oh, okay.

299
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:49,458
For hair loss, Thallium Metallicum.

300
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,958
Naturum Muriaticum for alopecia ariata.

301
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:59,208
For mild alopecia,
Ferrum Phosporicum should work.

302
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:01,167
Hmm.

303
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:09,625
What if it hurts here?

304
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:17,625
If your heart, er…
chest hurts, then Kalium Carbonicum.

305
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:18,875
But if it's severe…

306
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:22,667
What if my body itches, all over?

307
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,250
A new bar of soap, maybe?

308
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,500
Mother was asking me
about our honeymoon plans.

309
00:22:30,792 --> 00:22:34,375
I've made a booking in Goa, for next week.

310
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,958
Did your parents try to set you up
with anyone else, before we got married?

311
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,500
Marriage?

312
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,542
Er…

313
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:51,917
You must have met other girls,
even if you didn't like them much.

314
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,500
Yes…

315
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I had met a girl, Meera.

316
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:05,958
She was really pretty.

317
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,792
Do you know, she pursued Masters as well?

318
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,917
No, I didn't.

319
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:12,750
What did she study?

320
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,125
Home Science.

321
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,375
Didn't you think of studying homeopat…

322
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:25,625
She'd said that she could
even cook Italian food, lasagne.

323
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:31,167
I love eating good food
and watching TV with my family.

324
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,208
-Yeah, I saw. I saw that.
-I love it.

325
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,458
Why didn't you marry her?

326
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,667
Things didn't work out.

327
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,875
So? Am I a consolation prize?

328
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:43,833
What?

329
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,583
What do you mean?

330
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:52,667
It means… I'm modern and outgoing,
but still, I am a homely girl.

331
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,083
Yes.

332
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,875
But you wanted the girl
who cooks Italian food, Ms. Lasagne!

333
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,792
-No.
-No?

334
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,958
When your mother lectured me
about fritters this morning,

335
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:02,750
you didn't speak up for me.

336
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:03,958
Er, I did.

337
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,292
This is the problem.

338
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:09,958
Without any effort,
without dating, without any hard work,

339
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:12,458
you've landed yourself
a beautiful and hot wife.

340
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:14,208
-So you take her for granted.
-No, no.

341
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:16,000
This is the problem
with arranged marriages.

342
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,792
Love marriages need a lot of work.

343
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,625
While in arranged marriages,
you're handed a wife on a platter.

344
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:22,375
And she's expected
to fry fritters for you.

345
00:24:22,458 --> 00:24:24,250
Don't frit…
You don't have to fry fritters.

346
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,208
Go fry them yourself!

347
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,125
Tell your mother to fry them!

348
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:30,000
You should've mentioned
that you wanted to marry a cook.

349
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:34,292
You asked for a docile and pretty girl,
and you got one.

350
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,333
What's her name again?

351
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:43,542
Ms. Lasag-Ne!

352
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,375
-M… Meera.
-Yes.

353
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,583
Why didn't you marry her?

354
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,083
Didn't she know how to fry fritters?

355
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,458
Everybody wants docile cows
in arranged marriages!

356
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:21,792
You sauntered off to the market,
saddling me with this beauty parlor.

357
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,125
Now she's pandering to
your father's midlife crisis!

358
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,708
And look. Look at your new father.

359
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:35,625
He'll get you a new mother,
to live with your wife.

360
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:38,958
Er, I'd asked Aunty
if she wanted to color her hair too.

361
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:42,500
I was bored, so I thought…

362
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:46,167
So you'll make us show-monkeys,
to keep yourself entertained?

363
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,458
Here I am, chopping vegetables all day…

364
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:51,125
And Her Highness hasn't even
stepped inside the kitchen.

365
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,000
-Let me chop the vegetables.
-Why don't you just chop off my head?

366
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,125
Eyebrows!

367
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,125
She didn't even spare his eyebrows!

368
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,333
Looking good, aren't I?

369
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,292
You've let your wife
run wild in the house.

370
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,500
And she has turned him wild as well.

371
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:15,125
I've been telling you, start her training!

372
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,417
You mean physical training?

373
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,250
Not PT, TT.

374
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,333
A time table.

375
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,708
Tea at 7:00 a.m. Breakfast at 9:00 a.m.

376
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:24,042
Ironing your clothes at 10:00 a.m.
Et cetera, et cetera at 11:00 and 12:00.

377
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,792
Keep her busy with domestic chores.

378
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,458
This is how an arranged marriage works.
Right, Uncle?

379
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,083
You've been through this.

380
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:30,792
You're right, son.

381
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:35,333
Give me a pen and paper.

382
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:38,000
Which idiot walks around
with paper and a pen in his pocket?

383
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:39,125
I do.

384
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:41,458
Learn from him.

385
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,542
Here.

386
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:45,542
Demand tea at 7:00 a.m., without sugar.

387
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:47,542
Once served,
tell her you'd asked for sugar.

388
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,292
Okay? Show some attitude!

389
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,750
This will fan her desires
and make her pamper you.

390
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,958
<i>You should try and control your anger.</i>

391
00:26:55,042 --> 00:26:56,792
Try to seduce him.

392
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:59,000
For now, calm down.

393
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:01,750
You can unleash all your anger
on him after a month.

394
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,458
Then, give him a tight slap
when he's sleeping.

395
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:05,625
But I've already screamed at him.

396
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,542
<i>Be an angel in the first month.</i>

397
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,542
<i>Dripping sweetness.</i>

398
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:14,167
<i> Once he salivates like a dog,for you, you can control him.</i>

399
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,000
<i>Work your magic on him.</i>

400
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:19,417
In the next couple of days, seduce Rishu
by flaunting your cleavage.

401
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
"Oh no, oops!"

402
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:23,000
<i>Make sure you wear tight blouses.</i>

403
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:25,000
Turn him on and then get busy
doing something else.

404
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:30,375
Rani, it's seven, where's my tea?

405
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,083
7 A.M.
TEA

406
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,875
Rani, it's 7… Er…. Um…

407
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:02,500
8 a.m. No, not 8, 9! 9 a.m.!

408
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:04,125
Rani, I want breakfast at eight.

409
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:06,083
Rani, eight o'clock… Shit, she's here.

410
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,500
Rani?

411
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,208
Rani?

412
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,542
Rani!

413
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,625
Serve my breakfast at… at nine.

414
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,083
Vegetables are so expensive.

415
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:10,083
What do you two do all night…

416
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,042
that you have to flaunt your cleavage
during the day?

417
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:16,250
What's wrong?

418
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,083
Nothing. Continue watching your shows.

419
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:28,625
You've gone through enough.

420
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,375
Now that you've made a time table,
step two for the training is…

421
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,625
What?

422
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,292
Winning her over in the bedroom.

423
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,917
Be a lion.

424
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,875
Be a macho guy. Then you'll win her over.

425
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,708
Which is the most important part
of the body?

426
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:43,792
The head.

427
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:45,958
Understand?

428
00:29:46,042 --> 00:29:47,875
Becoming a lion won't help, Afzar.

429
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,833
Selenium Metallicum,
Phosphoricum Acidum, Yohimbinum…

430
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,292
These medicines will help.

431
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,792
I hope all these x-cum, y-cum medicines
help you come at the right time!

432
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:59,125
What was that medicine you mentioned,
Urinum-cum-cum?

433
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:02,083
Please act your age, Daddy.

434
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:06,458
And stop dyeing your hair black.

435
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:07,875
You look like a scarecrow.

436
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,417
Mommy might use you to
scare away the devil himself.

437
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,375
Right.

438
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,333
Weren't we discussing something important?

439
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,083
-I only wanted to clarify…
-Can't you see we're talking here?

440
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:16,833
You don't need to know
that medicine, Daddy.

441
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,417
Rishu?

442
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:49,458
Rishu?

443
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,167
-Are you sleeping?
-Hmm?

444
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,167
Can you…

445
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,917
open this hook?

446
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,625
This… this hook?

447
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,667
Yes.

448
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,625
One…

449
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:24,958
Two…

450
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,833
It's done.

451
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,083
Ouch.

452
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:37,958
-Is it bleeding?
-No, no, it's not bleeding.

453
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:39,833
-Is there a cut?
-No.

454
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:42,000
Want me to give you two drops of Arnica?

455
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,667
Your pain will vanish in two seconds.

456
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,667
Should I?

457
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:47,125
You just… switch off the light.

458
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,000
Sorry, I'll come over to this side.
Should I come to this side?

459
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,583
Yes. Sorry, sorry.

460
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,542
One minute. My leg…

461
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:04,042
Get up.

462
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,125
-Okay.
-Er… I…

463
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,542
Okay.

464
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:12,500
Here.

465
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:22,750
Slowly, Rishu.

466
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,000
Rishu?

467
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,167
Rishu?

468
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,458
So how was last night?

469
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:26,000
What last night?

470
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,458
I told you I wanted a love marriage.

471
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,667
Husbands make no effort
in arranged marriages.

472
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,500
It's wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am
and the show's over.

473
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,458
The wife is left high and dry.

474
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,833
Didn't he come onto you?

475
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,875
He came. Too soon!

476
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:41,833
He's like a firefly.

477
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:43,875
Do you get it? A firefly!

478
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:47,250
Their light flashes for one second
and then it's game over!

479
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,833
Try and make him feel manly.

480
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,375
Be "homely," make him feel "manly…"

481
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:57,583
How many feelings do I need to give him
for such a simple thing?

482
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,083
I'm stuck in this back of beyond Jwalapur.

483
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:03,083
There'll be no fireworks between us.

484
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,958
Rishabh Saxena turned out
to be a damp squib!

485
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:09,667
Mother was right, I can't handle her.

486
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,542
She shares all our private details
with her family members.

487
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:14,833
She must have been joking with them.

488
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:17,125
You better stop drinking
those concoctions,

489
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:19,292
and don't take things personally.

490
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,458
And stop sulking.

491
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,125
UGVN LIMITED
ELECTRICITY DEPARTMENT -CHILA

492
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,917
Get it done, it's been pending…

493
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,208
Rishu, what are you doing here?

494
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,583
Aren't you on leave?

495
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:05,208
You know how it is.
Sir calls me on a whim.

496
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:06,458
-Rishu?
-Sir.

497
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:07,917
What are you doing here?

498
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,375
You should be on your honeymoon.

499
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,333
Focus on your performance there
and not here.

500
00:35:11,417 --> 00:35:14,167
I think he wants to spend
his honeymoon with you, sir.

501
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,292
Remember, it's a Sunday tomorrow.

502
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,375
Don't turn up at the office.

503
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:18,667
Keep that in mind.

504
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,708
Get it?

505
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,583
-Should I serve you dinner?
-No, I have eaten already.

506
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:55,167
Rishu?

507
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:58,292
Should I serve you food?

508
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,625
I don't want to eat.

509
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,208
Lights are off, she must've gone to sleep.

510
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,875
Can I leave now?

511
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,542
You are bored with me, right?

512
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,125
No, nothing like that.

513
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,583
Lies.

514
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:00,208
Let's play a game of Truth or Dare.

515
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:04,500
If you choose truth, you'll tell me
why you're running away from me.

516
00:37:05,917 --> 00:37:10,667
If you choose dare, I'll take off
my blouse, and you, your pants!

517
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,042
I heard you speak to your mother and aunt.

518
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,083
What kind of a man
were you looking for, Rani?

519
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Someone…

520
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,833
with a sense of humor,

521
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:40,417
who's dashing, naughty,

522
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,500
and madly in love.

523
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,417
Sometimes wild,

524
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,417
sometimes passionate,

525
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,708
and a little crazy.

526
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,750
You'll need five to six different people.

527
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,292
You won't find all this in one guy.

528
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:09,250
But can't that guy have
at least one of these qualities?

529
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,000
Or is that too much to ask?

530
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:23,125
The office will start
MBA classes tomorrow.

531
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,250
I will attend the classes after work.

532
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:30,167
Also…

533
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,583
you didn't get the six-in-one man
you were looking for,

534
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,208
instead you got me…

535
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:39,625
I'm sorry for that.

536
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:50,667
That was when
Rishu and I started drifting apart.

537
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,458
All I got from Rishu was his anger.

538
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:05,833
<i>Even though we are together</i>

539
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:08,625
<i>You feel so distant</i>

540
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:14,000
<i>As we can't express our feelings</i>

541
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,625
<i>We remain silent</i>

542
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:21,333
<i>Or bicker all the time</i>

543
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:26,042
<i>Words of love remain unspoken</i>

544
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:30,292
<i>Do I convince her</i>

545
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,958
<i>Or convince myself</i>

546
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:37,958
<i>How do I change our fate?</i>

547
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:42,042
<i>Now I leaveEverything to fate</i>

548
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:44,958
<i>Everything to fate</i>

549
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:49,750
<i>Everything, I leaveTo destiny</i>

550
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:52,458
<i>I tried to get close to him many times.</i>

551
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:56,958
<i>But it seemed he didn't love me anymore.</i>

552
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,417
DINESH PANDIT
<i>WRATH OF KASAULI</i>

553
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,167
<i>Oh</i>

554
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,833
<i>Days go by</i>

555
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:09,292
<i>And night begins</i>

556
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:14,333
<i>All nightI pace around my home</i>

557
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:16,708
Since you're washing clothes,

558
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:18,917
wash Rishu's as well.

559
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,125
<i>Oh</i>

560
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:24,042
<i>I close my eyes</i>

561
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:26,792
<i>And hide my tears</i>

562
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:31,792
<i>How do I change our fate?</i>

563
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:36,125
<i>Now I leaveEverything to fate</i>

564
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:39,250
<i>Everything to fate</i>

565
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:42,792
<i>Everything, I leaveTo destiny</i>

566
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:43,917
<i>And abandon us</i>

567
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,167
<i>Now I leaveEverything to fate</i>

568
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,042
<i>Everything to fate</i>

569
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:55,000
<i>Everything, I leaveTo destiny</i>

570
00:40:55,833 --> 00:41:00,042
<i>Now I leaveEverything to fate</i>

571
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:03,083
<i>Everything to fate</i>

572
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:06,042
<i>Everything, I leaveTo destiny</i>

573
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,333
Sure, I can drop you.

574
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:09,667
Rani?

575
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:14,083
Studying hard, aren't you?

576
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:18,417
Just giving her some directions…

577
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,375
Directions?

578
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:21,792
He's forgotten his way back home.

579
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,375
But he'll give you good directions.

580
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,833
This is your MBA?

581
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,333
It's only been a month since our wedding.

582
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:33,458
He tried just once, and failed.

583
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:36,292
Just thought you should know.

584
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:38,875
Getting an MBA, huh?

585
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:45,333
<i>Now I leaveEverything to fate</i>

586
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:49,083
<i>Everything to fate</i>

587
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:53,875
<i>Everything, I leaveTo destiny</i>

588
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,875
Can I come home for a few days?

589
00:41:55,958 --> 00:42:00,250
No, it won't look good
if you come home so soon.

590
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:02,667
I'll only stay for a few days.

591
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,000
I know, but I'm going
to my brother's house tomorrow…

592
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:08,833
<i>for a week.</i>

593
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:11,458
<i>And you'll be goingfor your honeymoon soon.</i>

594
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:14,792
<i>Things like these happen.</i>

595
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,375
<i>Everything will be fine.</i>

596
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:20,500
I'll call you later.

597
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:42,708
Should I start packing, for Goa?

598
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:01,333
There will be no honeymoon.

599
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:11,000
Will these dogs keep barking every night?

600
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:15,583
I can't stop these dogs from barking
for you to sleep peacefully.

601
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:16,833
I knew it!

602
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:19,333
I knew you would say something like this.

603
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:22,292
You shouldn't have married me, then.
You should've refused.

604
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,625
I was a fool.

605
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:26,917
This was my destiny.

606
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,958
These dogs were also in your destiny.

607
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,125
Try and befriend them.

608
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:40,583
So your house is opposite Rishu's?

609
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:42,750
-Yes.
-You must have seen what happened.

610
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:49,542
The thing is, a husband-wife relationship
is like a delicate thread.

611
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:53,167
You have to handle it with utmost care.

612
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,208
If you don't, it will break.

613
00:43:56,292 --> 00:43:58,792
What's with all this poetry?

614
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:00,583
Explain it to me clearly.

615
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:03,167
Officer, try and understand
a woman's heart.

616
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:06,875
Neel is Lata's nephew.

617
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,917
He'd come to stay with them.

618
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,042
Why didn't you come for the wedding?

619
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,292
I did go to Delhi.

620
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:32,208
Why didn't I see you, then?

621
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:34,667
Because the wedding procession
had left by then.

622
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,000
-And the wedding was over.
-Crazy boy!

623
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,625
Where did you disappear last month?

624
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:42,417
Aunty… You know, I'm a free bird,
flitting around here and there.

625
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,750
Your mother was so worried.

626
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,583
You were asking about Rishu's wife.

627
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:49,125
Here she is.

628
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:52,833
This is Neel.

629
00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:54,833
My nephew.

630
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,625
He'll stay with us for a few days.

631
00:44:57,208 --> 00:45:01,750
During tourist season,
he takes tourists around on his row boat.

632
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:02,958
Aunty…

633
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:05,542
What she means is rafting.

634
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:06,958
River rafting?

635
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:10,917
Exactly. On a row boat!

636
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,542
Did Rani just wake up?

637
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:23,333
The sun is blazing already.

638
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:26,458
My sun isn't blazing yet, Neel.

639
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:28,167
Aunty…

640
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:31,958
why don't you ask Rani
to cook something special for me?

641
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:35,917
Don't talk about cooking.

642
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,583
She's no good at that.

643
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:41,000
The only thing she's good at
is using her scissors.

644
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,958
And stay away from her scissors.

645
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:46,750
Or you'll end up looking like
your uncle, Mr. Rambo.

646
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,458
Want a taste of my scissors?

647
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,125
No.

648
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,500
You're back.

649
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:02,958
Freshen up, I'll serve your dinner.

650
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,083
Rishu, my favorite cousin!

651
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,667
Neel? When did you arrive?

652
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,667
-Today, morning.
-This morning?

653
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,125
Nobody told me about this.

654
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:13,458
Please switch off the light, Rishu.

655
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:18,375
Seeing your father in his
glamour-boy haircut is hurting my eyes.

656
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:19,708
Just look at him.

657
00:46:19,792 --> 00:46:21,667
And get your wife to stop her snipping.

658
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:24,125
She's quickly snipping away
our reputation.

659
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:25,917
You better control your wife.

660
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,792
The mother committed the murder
and implicated the wife.

661
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:56,292
DINESH PANDIT
<i>HORROR OF LUST</i>

662
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,625
So you've read Dinesh Pandit's novels?

663
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:05,917
Sorry, do you mind?

664
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:09,458
It's only a matter of a month.

665
00:47:09,542 --> 00:47:12,917
Jwalapur will kill you if smoking doesn't.

666
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,708
You look fine to me.

667
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:21,667
Yeah, I look fine.

668
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:43,875
Is it a good pic?

669
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:52,667
<i>She has stolen my heart</i>

670
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,042
<i>From afar</i>

671
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:56,000
Yes, yes.

672
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,917
<i>I've been feeling this love</i>

673
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,958
Have you got everything?

674
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:03,458
<i>For some time now</i>

675
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:07,083
<i>To her I bestow</i>

676
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,875
<i>Every moment of my life</i>

677
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,625
<i>She's the reason for my being</i>

678
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:14,292
<i>She is my world</i>

679
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:17,792
<i>She is magical</i>

680
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:21,667
<i>My heart says to me</i>

681
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:24,125
<i>Slip away</i>

682
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:28,875
<i>My heart says to me</i>

683
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:31,875
<i>Slip away</i>

684
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:36,208
<i>My mind says to me</i>

685
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:39,208
<i>Drift away</i>

686
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,833
<i>My heart says to me</i>

687
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:43,458
Can I get a cup of tea?

688
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:46,125
<i>Slip away</i>

689
00:48:57,542 --> 00:48:58,750
Do you want a cup of tea?

690
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:02,625
Are you going to make it?

691
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,625
Yes.

692
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,208
Sure.

693
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:35,333
Tea leaves?

694
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:38,833
Next to the sugar.

695
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,292
Another two spoonfuls.

696
00:49:58,875 --> 00:49:59,792
And sugar?

697
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:00,875
Three spoonfuls.

698
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:43,667
You'll need a sieve.

699
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:10,292
It's good.

700
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:23,333
<i>Oh, I don't know what is right</i>

701
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:25,833
<i>Or wrong</i>

702
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,875
<i>This fever of love</i>

703
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:31,792
<i>Surges within me</i>

704
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:33,042
You make tea so well…

705
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:36,250
I'll happily die for food cooked by you.

706
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:40,375
<i>Oh, I don't know who is friend</i>

707
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:43,167
<i>Or foe</i>

708
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,625
<i>This wave of joy</i>

709
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:47,000
<i>These mobile videos don't givethe correct instructions.</i>

710
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:49,792
<i>Has saved me</i>

711
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:53,542
<i>As I dive</i>

712
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,292
<i>Into the depths</i>

713
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:57,208
<i>The flame is too high.</i>

714
00:51:57,292 --> 00:52:00,917
<i>She comes closer</i>

715
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,125
<i>Closer to me</i>

716
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:07,958
<i>Longing to touch her</i>

717
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:11,500
<i>Waiting for that moment</i>

718
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:13,333
<i>She is my reason</i>

719
00:52:13,417 --> 00:52:15,250
<i>She is my refuge</i>

720
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:18,958
<i>She is everywhere</i>

721
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:22,167
<i>My heart says to me</i>

722
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,375
<i>Slip away</i>

723
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:29,583
<i>My mind says to me</i>

724
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:30,917
<i>Slip away</i>

725
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,542
Are you okay, Rishu?

726
00:52:41,125 --> 00:52:42,125
Rani.

727
00:52:44,542 --> 00:52:45,417
Rani!

728
00:52:46,042 --> 00:52:47,000
Rani!

729
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,083
Rani!

730
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:20,625
<i>My heart says to me</i>

731
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:24,875
<i>Slip away</i>

732
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:30,667
<i>My mind says to me</i>

733
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,167
<i>Drift away</i>

734
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,292
Who's she?

735
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:46,125
<i>Slip away</i>

736
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:52,792
Don't you dare touch me again!

737
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,833
Rani!

738
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:41,917
Rani! Rani!

739
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,583
Where are you?

740
00:55:58,667 --> 00:55:59,875
This needs a little more salt.

741
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:04,708
I think she is a gifted cook.

742
00:56:06,917 --> 00:56:10,000
I'm craving some mutton curry.

743
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:12,542
You can't cook mutton in my kitchen.

744
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:28,625
<i>Madam, over here.</i>

745
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,542
<i>Madam, big pieces or small?</i>

746
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,958
-Meat?
-Hmm.

747
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:45,083
You said you're vegetarian.

748
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,792
Where did you get this meat from?

749
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:48,042
-I…
-What's wrong, Mommy?

750
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,167
Rishu, she wants to cook meat
in my kitchen.

751
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,417
-It's alright.
-Return it.

752
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,583
Don't worry, it won't go to your kitchen.

753
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:53,958
Come with me.

754
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,458
<i>…she killed her husband so brutally.</i>

755
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:47,583
Disposed of the murder weapon
and helped her lover escape…

756
00:57:48,125 --> 00:57:50,333
these two are fucking with us now.

757
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:56,292
Women like her are very cunning.

758
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:02,792
Once I get a lead, she'll rot in jail!

759
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,458
He was my only friend, sir.

760
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:13,958
He was crazy about his wife.

761
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:19,458
Sir, this witch…

762
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:23,958
and her lover killed my friend.

763
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,417
They burnt him alive.

764
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:29,292
Wasn't his love enough for you?

765
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:32,125
She burnt him alive, sir!

766
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,458
He loved you so much.
She'll go to hell for this!

767
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,542
Arrest this woman, sir.

768
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:42,792
This witch has killed him.

769
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:51,042
How would you describe your relationship
with Neel Tripathi?

770
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:56,042
Sometimes good…

771
00:58:57,875 --> 00:58:58,917
sometimes not so good.

772
00:58:59,417 --> 00:59:01,042
Did you have a physical relationship?

773
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:09,083
Officer…

774
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:12,625
Dinesh Pandit writes,

775
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:15,250
that a relationship is a meeting of minds.

776
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:18,958
If it's only physical, it's lust!

777
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:29,750
Didn't you plan this with your lover?

778
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:42,083
Where's the lighter?

779
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:51,958
Thank you.

780
00:59:54,417 --> 00:59:56,292
I'm cooking mutton, Afzar-style.

781
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:58,167
I got the recipe from Fatima.

782
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:01,875
Come here.

783
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,875
How many photos will you take?

784
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:14,458
I'm leaving next week.

785
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,333
Fine, I'll leave for Delhi as well,
next week.

786
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:20,208
Then I'll come to you.

787
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:27,292
<i>Tell me…</i>

788
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,667
Sure you can cook mutton?

789
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,542
It takes a lot of sweat and blood.

790
01:00:33,417 --> 01:00:35,583
Once you taste my dish,
you can guess my blood group.

791
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:39,167
<i>I'll put my heartand soul into cooking it.</i>

792
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:46,500
And what about Rishu?

793
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:48,583
I'll tell him everything.

794
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:50,333
The truth.

795
01:00:55,917 --> 01:00:56,792
Stop!

796
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:58,167
Don't bring the mutton over here.

797
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,833
Rishu will return late.

798
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:01,833
You can give it to him when he's back.
Don't keep it here.

799
01:01:01,917 --> 01:01:03,792
What about Neel? He'll eat it.

800
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,208
He left. Neel has left.

801
01:01:05,292 --> 01:01:08,083
He quickly packed his stuff
and drove off suddenly.

802
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:09,417
Without saying bye?

803
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,625
Yes. He left without saying bye.

804
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:14,458
I wonder what the hurry was!

805
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,625
-Have some more.
-Weird fellow…

806
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:19,250
left without saying goodbye.

807
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,667
He didn't just leave.

808
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:25,333
He ran away.

809
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,167
He ran away.

810
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:33,833
What are you waiting for?

811
01:01:33,917 --> 01:01:35,250
Go and keep it inside.

812
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:30,417
Rani.

813
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:33,375
Serve Rishu his dinner.

814
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,417
She's always lost in her thoughts.

815
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,458
Wow!

816
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:12,458
I can see that you're making an effort.

817
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:20,333
Actually, you're so beautiful
that I get nervous in front of you.

818
01:03:26,625 --> 01:03:28,667
I am sorry for all that has happened.

819
01:03:34,042 --> 01:03:35,417
Can we start afresh?

820
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:49,292
Nice.

821
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:51,875
I had cooked the mutton for Neel.

822
01:03:56,042 --> 01:03:58,667
I had fallen in love with him.

823
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:04,042
I wanted to be with him

824
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:10,167
but he ditched me and ran away,

825
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:14,792
and I got left behind… with you.

826
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:46,417
The mutton is delicious.

827
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:02,750
<i>And he didn't say anything after that.</i>

828
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:10,542
<i>I kept looking at himand he continued eating.</i>

829
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:16,583
It's a good story.

830
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:22,542
But I suspect you and your lover
killed Rishu.

831
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:27,042
There is a wound on his head
after being hit with something heavy.

832
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:30,208
I like your story as well, sir.

833
01:05:37,292 --> 01:05:38,917
You'll like the ending as well,

834
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:44,417
when I find the murder weapon
and your lover.

835
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,792
OFFICE OF JWALAPUR INSPECTOR GENERAL

836
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:58,167
So you don't regret it?

837
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,542
Having an extramarital affair?

838
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:09,917
No.

839
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:13,750
If I hadn't met Neel…

840
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:15,875
I wouldn't have met the real Rishu.

841
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:14,042
JWALAPUR TO DELHI

842
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:00,542
Rishu.

843
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:01,958
-Neel, how dare you!
-Are you mad?

844
01:08:10,458 --> 01:08:11,708
Rishu…

845
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,625
Crazy man…

846
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:36,833
Let's go.

847
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:38,708
Sorry, sorry… It's nothing…

848
01:08:58,833 --> 01:08:59,958
I admit, it was a mistake.

849
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:03,042
I was attracted to her.

850
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,917
And I fucked up.

851
01:09:07,667 --> 01:09:10,208
If you'd satisfied her,
she wouldn't be so lonely.

852
01:09:10,292 --> 01:09:11,833
I wouldn't have come between you two.

853
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,125
But Rishu…

854
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,625
why did you not consummate
your relationship with her?

855
01:09:20,542 --> 01:09:22,208
Because I'm a fucking idiot!

856
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:29,208
I wanted to win her heart first.

857
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,583
And you thought…

858
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:43,333
"Rishu is a simpleton, screw him!

859
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,375
Let me screw his wife as well.

860
01:09:47,042 --> 01:09:48,708
He won't protest."

861
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Why didn't you get her with you?

862
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,292
At least the two of you
would have been happy.

863
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:22,125
Where were you?

864
01:10:27,083 --> 01:10:29,667
I tried calling you, Rishu.

865
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:37,667
Won't you talk to me?

866
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:45,375
Let's play Truth or Dare now.

867
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,375
Where did you go?

868
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:52,917
To get beaten up by Neel.

869
01:10:56,292 --> 01:10:57,208
Why?

870
01:10:57,792 --> 01:10:59,375
Because he left you.

871
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:07,125
You loved him so much,
but he didn't love you back.

872
01:11:11,125 --> 01:11:12,000
Why?

873
01:11:34,042 --> 01:11:38,250
-I am sorry.
-Stay… stay away from me.

874
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:42,250
What do I do, Rishu?

875
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:45,292
I made a mistake.

876
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,375
Should I leave?

877
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:56,917
Yes, please leave.

878
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:58,583
Really. Leave.

879
01:12:00,292 --> 01:12:01,958
This is for the best.

880
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,583
I loved you so much, Rani!

881
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,917
So much that I couldn't live without you.

882
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,458
But now I can't live with you either.

883
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:23,208
You really should leave.

884
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:29,792
Because I feel like strangling you.

885
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:37,708
Leave, Rani, or else I'll kill you.

886
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,917
Just go.

887
01:12:57,542 --> 01:12:58,375
Rishu?

888
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,583
Oh, no! What happened to you now?

889
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:03,333
You keep falling and getting hurt.
Can't you be careful?

890
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:07,333
We're going to Uncle's place,
we'll be back in the evening.

891
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:09,625
What's wrong?

892
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:00,792
Can you drop me off at the station?

893
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:04,750
Go by yourself.

894
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:27,958
Stop, stop.

895
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:29,667
What's wrong?

896
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:32,375
Hello, Rani.

897
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:35,292
Are you leaving?

898
01:14:36,208 --> 01:14:37,750
Neel has also left.

899
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:41,750
I'll drop you. Get off.

900
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,083
Please come. Hop on, Rani.

901
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:44,833
Can't three of us ride together?

902
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:46,875
You won't get a rickshaw at this hour.

903
01:14:46,958 --> 01:14:48,792
It won't take long, I can drop you.

904
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:51,458
We're just like Neel, Rani.
We'll keep you happy.

905
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:54,667
Ride with us, Rani. It will be fun.

906
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:55,875
We'll take good care of you.

907
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,292
It's our duty after all.

908
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:01,792
-Go inside. I'll deal with it.
-Oh, Rishu is here.

909
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:05,708
Rishu, are you taking Rani somewhere?

910
01:15:05,792 --> 01:15:07,958
You've come out and she's going in…

911
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:09,542
We'll miss her so much, Rishu.

912
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:10,583
Rickshaw!

913
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:13,333
You know, Neel had called me.

914
01:15:13,417 --> 01:15:16,833
He told me to look after both of them.

915
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:20,667
Let's all go… row, row, row your boat…

916
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,125
Don't worry, Neel is my bro.

917
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:24,458
Rickshaw!

918
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,208
You can't even stop a rickshaw…

919
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:29,792
Guess we'll have to do that for him too!

920
01:15:33,042 --> 01:15:35,208
Rishu, can I send her a friend request?

921
01:15:35,292 --> 01:15:36,708
Will she accept it?

922
01:15:36,792 --> 01:15:37,917
Of course,

923
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:40,500
I'm sure she will.

924
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:44,833
We should get her handle for live stories.

925
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,167
<i>#hotbhabhi.</i>

926
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:51,833
You didn't even invite us
to the wedding, Rishu.

927
01:15:51,917 --> 01:15:54,125
Give us a chance, let's have fun together.

928
01:16:01,875 --> 01:16:02,958
There it is.

929
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:07,500
Come on, let me help you…

930
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,750
<i>My mistake…and Rishu was bearing the brunt of it.</i>

931
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,500
<i>There's Neel… who had run away.</i>

932
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,042
<i>And Rishu… </i>

933
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:18,125
<i>who was fighting my battles.</i>

934
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:35,625
Please take my suitcase out.
I am not leaving.

935
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:44,833
You can punish me as you like,
but I'm staying with you.

936
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:46,167
I am not leaving.

937
01:16:49,167 --> 01:16:52,667
<i>That day I decided, no matter what,</i>

938
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:55,458
<i>I wouldn't ever leave Rishu.</i>

939
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,250
Don't know if it was my stubbornness,

940
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:05,667
love…

941
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,125
or my guilt.

942
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,167
Can I have your wallet?

943
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:21,708
I have to pay for the laundry.

944
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:24,250
It's inside.

945
01:19:56,208 --> 01:20:00,417
<i>In front of me was a manwith murder in his eyes.</i>

946
01:20:01,542 --> 01:20:03,667
<i>And I almost died… several times.</i>

947
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:11,917
But as they say, love and hate are
two sides of the same coin.

948
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,042
Wallet.

949
01:20:21,667 --> 01:20:23,542
<i>When I met Rishu for the first time…</i>

950
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:26,042
<i>I had met an engineer.</i>

951
01:20:27,625 --> 01:20:30,583
<i>The next time we met, he was my husband.</i>

952
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:35,000
<i>The third time around,I met the lover in him.</i>

953
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:39,292
A lover with whom
I was falling madly in love.

954
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:45,167
So deep was my love,
that I was willing to lose my mind…

955
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:48,167
and risk my life for him.

<i>His heart will beat for me someday."</i>

959
01:21:36,917 --> 01:21:40,500
So you knew
that your husband wanted to kill you.

960
01:21:41,792 --> 01:21:43,750
And you didn't report it to the police?

961
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:45,750
You didn't even tell your family members?

962
01:21:45,833 --> 01:21:47,542
You stayed on,
so that he could kill you, is it?

963
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:49,875
I didn't tell anyone, sir.

964
01:21:49,958 --> 01:21:51,042
I stayed.

965
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:54,833
I'd made a mistake

966
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:56,917
and I'd have to pay the price for it.

967
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:03,333
Madam, are you mad,
or are you trying to drive us mad?

01:22:46,917 --> 01:22:50,417
So your official statement is that your
deceased husband wanted to kill you?

978
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:53,083
Yes.

979
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,250
And then, what did you do?

980
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:00,625
I waited.

981
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:02,125
For what?

982
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,792
For the right moment to kill him?

983
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:07,167
For his forgiveness.

984
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:12,417
Rani is here.

985
01:23:15,042 --> 01:23:16,417
How are you, Rani?

986
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,625
Dinner is ready. Should I serve your food?

987
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:21,250
Sure.

988
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:23,917
Mix it with poison, while you're at it.

989
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:38,833
Let me tell you
an interesting story, Afzar.

990
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,708
Everyone in the neighborhood
already knows.

991
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:46,417
Why should you be left out?
You're my friend after all.

992
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,667
Listen to this.

993
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:48,917
Rishu.

994
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,833
Have you heard the story
of the emperor who goes to the market?

995
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:53,083
Rishu, please.

996
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:55,750
Which emperor?

997
01:23:57,042 --> 01:24:00,083
In the story, the mighty emperor

998
01:24:00,167 --> 01:24:04,417
proudly walks around the market,

999
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:07,167
wrapped in a silk shawl.

1000
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:10,667
When suddenly a little boy shouts out,

1001
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,667
"The emperor is naked."

1002
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:23,500
Then the emperor realizes,
he has been butt-naked all this time,

1003
01:24:24,958 --> 01:24:26,458
and he didn't even know it.

1004
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:30,917
He smiled and walked around,

1005
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:33,167
while everyone else laughed at him.

1006
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,458
I don't get it.

1007
01:24:35,542 --> 01:24:36,625
You will.

1008
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:44,417
My situation is similar to the emperor's.

1009
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:50,375
I am butt-naked!

1010
01:24:52,792 --> 01:24:58,458
Everyone here knows that my wife
had an affair with my cousin.

1011
01:24:59,042 --> 01:24:59,958
Rishu…

1012
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:04,125
A real steamy affair!

1013
01:25:05,542 --> 01:25:06,417
What nonsense!

1014
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,750
It's not nonsense. It's the truth.

1015
01:25:08,833 --> 01:25:10,917
-Enough!
-Here I was, being the good guy…

1016
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:16,292
And someone came and stole my love,
right in front of my eyes.

1017
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:19,167
You've had too much to drink.
Eat and go to bed.

1018
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:21,208
-I'll eat dinner.
-Where are you off to?

1019
01:25:21,708 --> 01:25:22,750
See you tomorrow morning.

1020
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:23,958
Sit for a while.

1021
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:28,458
Hey, Afzar, I've just started.

1022
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:32,458
What!

1023
01:25:32,542 --> 01:25:34,000
No one wants to talk to me.

1024
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,042
You can talk to me.

1025
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:41,375
You're punishing me anyway.

1026
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:44,250
Go ahead and vent your anger.

1027
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:45,667
But why?

1028
01:25:46,917 --> 01:25:48,583
Will you go on, like this?

1029
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:53,208
What else can I do, Rani?

1030
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:10,750
This is your chance.

1031
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:11,708
Push me.

1032
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,792
I had told you,
if you leave, I won't stop you.

1033
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:56,958
I'll kill you now!

1034
01:26:57,042 --> 01:27:00,125
Rishu, if you had to kill me,
you would've done it already!

1035
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,125
Want to kill me, right?
Push me off the ledge.

1036
01:27:03,208 --> 01:27:04,708
Push me… now!

1037
01:27:04,792 --> 01:27:06,708
Or get a knife and stab me.

1038
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:09,875
If you can't do this…

1039
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:12,833
then please forgive me.

1040
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:15,958
Please forgive me, I'm sorry.

1041
01:27:16,042 --> 01:27:19,250
I made a mistake. I'm really sorry.
I made a mistake.

1042
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:22,208
I am sorry.

1043
01:27:24,417 --> 01:27:25,750
You're a good man.

1044
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:31,292
You're a very good man.

1045
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:38,042
If you love me even a little bit,
that will do.

1046
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:40,250
That is enough for me.

1047
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:42,583
You don't deserve my love.

1048
01:27:42,667 --> 01:27:45,167
No, I don't, right?

1049
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:48,417
But you still loved me… a lot.

1050
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:57,125
You loved me so much
that I hate myself for betraying you.

1051
01:27:57,208 --> 01:27:59,875
I am sorry. It was my fault.
I am really sorry.

1052
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,875
I said… sorry.

1053
01:28:02,667 --> 01:28:04,167
I am so sorry.

1054
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:10,542
Ordinary people like me…

1055
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:14,333
go unnoticed.

1056
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,750
Everyone thinks of us
only when they want something fixed.

1057
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:23,500
-We are no heroes.
-No.

1058
01:28:23,583 --> 01:28:24,875
I don't want a hero.

1059
01:28:25,542 --> 01:28:26,833
I want Rishu.

1060
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:28,792
I want you.

1061
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:32,125
Can't we start over again?

1062
01:28:33,167 --> 01:28:34,583
Just once, please.

1063
01:28:35,917 --> 01:28:36,958
Please.

1064
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:42,792
I'm sorry… sorry.

1065
01:28:48,167 --> 01:28:49,167
Sorry.

1066
01:29:28,042 --> 01:29:30,833
<i>All that happened, is in the past</i>

1067
01:29:30,917 --> 01:29:33,458
<i>These new moments</i>

1068
01:29:33,542 --> 01:29:37,250
<i>Let us cherish them</i>

1069
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:40,292
<i>Slowly</i>

1070
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,958
<i>With you</i>

1071
01:29:43,708 --> 01:29:47,500
<i>My days are happy again</i>

1072
01:29:48,417 --> 01:29:51,333
<i>These precious dreams of mine</i>

1073
01:29:51,417 --> 01:29:53,792
<i>I give to you</i>

1074
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:58,167
<i>Come and see them</i>

1075
01:29:58,250 --> 01:30:00,875
<i>Our lives</i>

1076
01:30:00,958 --> 01:30:03,750
<i>Have come together</i>

1077
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:08,458
<i>And everything is bright again</i>

1078
01:30:08,542 --> 01:30:10,875
<i>You've come to me</i>

1079
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:13,375
<i>Like we've never been apart</i>

1080
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:16,500
<i>You've come to me</i>

1081
01:30:18,625 --> 01:30:21,250
<i>Love has blossomed</i>

1082
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,833
<i>Like things were never amiss</i>

1083
01:30:23,917 --> 01:30:27,208
<i>Love has blossomed</i>

1084
01:30:28,208 --> 01:30:29,458
<i>You are mine</i>

1085
01:30:29,542 --> 01:30:30,625
Was he killed?

1086
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:33,792
The neighbor rang the bell and saw…

1087
01:30:37,458 --> 01:30:39,125
What are we having for lunch?

1088
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:40,458
-Lust.
-Lust?

1089
01:30:40,542 --> 01:30:41,708
Lust for peas.

1090
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,750
-"Lust for peas"?
-Er, just carrots and peas.

1091
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:54,292
<i>May the fragrance of your love</i>

1092
01:30:54,375 --> 01:30:56,958
<i>Now be mine</i>

1093
01:30:57,042 --> 01:31:02,125
<i>Your eyes speak a thousand words</i>

1094

<i>Your heart beats</i>

01:31:05,458 --> 01:31:07,083
<i>Together with mine</i>

1096
01:31:07,167 --> 01:31:10,958
<i>I feel alive</i>

1097
01:31:13,042 --> 01:31:15,500
<i>My destiny</i>

1098
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:17,958
<i>Lies in your hands</i>

1099
01:31:18,042 --> 01:31:22,333
<i>We will never be apart</i>

1100
01:31:22,417 --> 01:31:25,292
<i>Let me give you</i>

1101
01:31:25,375 --> 01:31:28,333
<i>Many new reasons</i>

1102
01:31:28,417 --> 01:31:32,458
<i>To smile</i>

1103
01:31:32,542 --> 01:31:35,333
<i>You've come to me</i>

1104
01:31:35,417 --> 01:31:37,833
<i>Like we've never been apart</i>

1105
01:31:37,917 --> 01:31:42,167
<i>You've come to me</i>

1106
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:45,500
<i>Love has blossomed</i>

<i>You are mine</i>

1110
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,250
Rishu?

1111
01:32:15,375 --> 01:32:16,542
Sorry.

1112
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,500
Rani?

1113
01:32:24,667 --> 01:32:27,500
What's she doing? Is she crazy?

1114
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:47,125
Rishu, I've dropped that girl off.

1115
01:32:47,208 --> 01:32:50,333
Ask her if she wants to ride with me.

1116
01:32:56,250 --> 01:32:57,500
-I will…
-Rishu.

1117
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:18,083
Please let him go, Rishu.

1118
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:19,958
I won't leave him.

1119
01:34:05,583 --> 01:34:07,583
-What happened?
-The tires are stuck.

1120
01:34:20,167 --> 01:34:22,500
The timing belt is broken.
It will take time.

1121
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,167
I want to wash my hands.
Where's the washbasin?

1122
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,875
On the right.

1123
01:34:28,167 --> 01:34:29,333
Okay, hurry up.

1124
01:34:43,292 --> 01:34:44,292
Does it hurt?

1125
01:34:45,708 --> 01:34:46,708
Just a little.

1126
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:50,417
When I got burnt at the gas stove,

1127
01:34:51,125 --> 01:34:52,708
that hurt a lot more.

1128
01:34:55,917 --> 01:34:56,917
I was angry.

1129
01:34:59,417 --> 01:35:00,750
Sorry.

1130
01:35:00,833 --> 01:35:05,125
I haven't come across a criminal like you,
not even in Dinesh Pandit's books.

1131
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:07,875
Thank goodness,

1132
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:11,417
I'm better than him
at something, at least.

1133
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,167
"You don't listen to your mind

1134
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:19,958
and I don't listen to my heart.

1135
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:24,042
"No one listens to each other
in this city."

1136
01:35:26,167 --> 01:35:27,458
<i>-Wrath of Kasauli.-Wrath of Kasauli.</i>

1137
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:33,375
When did you start reading
Dinesh Pandit's books?

1138
01:35:35,375 --> 01:35:36,833
After I fell in love.

1139
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:56,292
-Ouch.
-Sorry. Are you hurt?

1140
01:36:38,917 --> 01:36:43,917
<i>And then,it seemed like everything would be okay.</i>

1141
01:37:26,667 --> 01:37:29,208
According to the neighbor,
on the day of the explosion,

1142
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:31,917
Neel arrived at the house at 2:30 p.m.

1143
01:37:35,167 --> 01:37:38,625
<i>15 minutes later, Rishu went in.</i>

1144
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:43,292
<i>And a little later, she left the house.</i>

1145
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:45,250
Sir.

1146
01:37:45,333 --> 01:37:48,583
If Rishu was dead before
she left the house…

1147
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:51,625
She left the house
and sent the little girl

1148
01:37:52,167 --> 01:37:54,667
<i>to tell Rishu to lock the door.</i>

1149
01:37:55,167 --> 01:37:57,250
Munni, tell Rishu to lock the door.

1150
01:37:57,333 --> 01:37:58,667
-Rishu!
<i>-But, sir,</i>

1151
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:00,458
<i>Munni has testified </i>

1152
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:02,375
<i>that Neel closed the door. </i>

1153
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:06,125
Call the rickshaw driver.

1154
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,208
Hey, you, come here. Quick!

1155
01:38:09,208 --> 01:38:10,917
-Tell him everything.
-Tell him.

1156
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,958
Sir, madam was with me
from 3:15 p.m. to 4:15 p.m.

1157
01:38:17,042 --> 01:38:18,167
Where to?

1158
01:38:18,250 --> 01:38:19,333
The market.

1159
01:38:19,417 --> 01:38:21,792
<i>She went to the market in my rickshaw.</i>

1160
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:23,750
<i>I took her there.</i>

1161
01:38:24,792 --> 01:38:27,042
<i>I saw her walking around the market.</i>

1162
01:38:29,542 --> 01:38:30,542
<i>I waited.</i>

1163
01:38:32,375 --> 01:38:35,250
<i>And then I drove her back.</i>

1164
01:38:36,542 --> 01:38:39,333
<i>I saw her feed mutton to the dogs.</i>

1165
01:38:39,417 --> 01:38:41,542
Suddenly… there was a loud explosion.

1166
01:38:43,208 --> 01:38:44,833
Madam was outside the house.

1167
01:38:44,917 --> 01:38:46,167
How could she murder…

1168
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:47,958
She couldn't, right?

1169
01:38:48,042 --> 01:38:50,125
You scoundrel!
Looks to me like you're the murderer!

1170
01:38:50,792 --> 01:38:52,333
Mess with me and I'll break your legs.

1171
01:38:52,417 --> 01:38:55,000
You'll be riding a rickshaw with one leg.

1172
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:57,083
-Get lost.
-Buzz off.

1173
01:38:57,167 --> 01:38:59,125
Everyone has a different
version of the story.

1174
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,417
What beats me is, when there
was so much drama going on here,

1175
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:04,875
why would she leave
the husband and lover alone at home

1176
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:08,417
and go to the market?

1177
01:39:08,917 --> 01:39:11,750
Perhaps to hide the murder weapon, sir?

1178
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:12,875
Where is it?

1179
01:39:15,042 --> 01:39:16,292
When did she hide it and where?

1180
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:21,500
I am convinced
that this woman is behind it all.

1181
01:39:22,583 --> 01:39:24,292
She's just leading us
on a wild goose chase.

1182
01:39:28,667 --> 01:39:29,583
Hello?

1183
01:39:30,667 --> 01:39:32,042
What?

1184
01:39:38,917 --> 01:39:39,750
Hello, sir.

1185
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:43,292
What did you find, Mr. Singh?

1186
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:47,042
See this, sir.

1187
01:39:47,125 --> 01:39:49,125
The blast took place
during the Clean India campaign.

1188
01:39:49,208 --> 01:39:50,583
We were recording that.

1189
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:52,000
And here is Neel.

1190
01:39:58,167 --> 01:39:59,042
Oh.

1191
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:01,667
So here he is.

1192
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:02,833
See the replay, sir.

1193
01:40:03,917 --> 01:40:06,292
We've been searching
for the lover all this while…

1194
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:08,792
And here he is, swimming away!

1195
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:12,583
When you guys were busy recording videos,

1196
01:40:12,667 --> 01:40:14,542
madam's lover made the great escape.

1197
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:17,875
Instead of investigating, policemen are
now key witnesses in this case.

1198
01:40:17,958 --> 01:40:21,083
Tell me, what have you
discovered from this video?

1199
01:40:21,167 --> 01:40:22,792
-That…
-What's going on?

1200
01:40:23,542 --> 01:40:24,875
What's going on in here?

1201
01:40:24,958 --> 01:40:27,292
I see all the policemen here,
solving Rani Madam's case.

1202
01:40:27,875 --> 01:40:30,625
We have a good lead, sir.
He won't be able to escape now.

1203
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:32,917
You wasted two months
running after that Neel.

1204
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,917
-Sir, to solve the case…
-Did you solve it?

1205
01:40:35,792 --> 01:40:38,542
-Sir, actually…
-There is an honor killing case.

1206
01:40:39,125 --> 01:40:40,750
It is getting a lot of media attention.

1207
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:42,750
Forget madam's case. Focus on this.

1208
01:40:42,833 --> 01:40:44,875
Sir, please give me two days.

1209
01:40:44,958 --> 01:40:46,417
We already have a court order.

1210
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:49,417
We'll do a lie detector test
and everything will be clear.

1211
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:54,042
If you don't solve this madam's case
in two days, find another job.

1212
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:56,708
Idiot.

1213
01:40:58,875 --> 01:40:59,750
Where's Madam? Rani…

1214
01:41:01,042 --> 01:41:02,958
Go, call that woman.

1215
01:41:03,042 --> 01:41:04,417
Take a look at this.

1216
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,583
It's Neel.

1217
01:41:09,042 --> 01:41:11,750
He entered the lane at 2:30 p.m.

1218
01:41:11,833 --> 01:41:13,042
Then Rishu went into the house.

1219
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:14,625
After that, you came out.

1220
01:41:14,708 --> 01:41:16,083
And then there was an explosion.

1221
01:41:16,167 --> 01:41:19,250
And here we see Neel escaping,
right after the explosion.

1222
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:23,125
Where's Neel, madam?

1223
01:41:25,583 --> 01:41:26,417
I don't know, sir.

1224
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,208
You bloody whore.

1225
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:32,417
We're sick of your stories.

1226
01:41:32,958 --> 01:41:35,833
You better tell us where you've hidden
the murder weapon,

1227
01:41:35,917 --> 01:41:37,500
-or I'll beat you to a pulp.
-Bindiya.

1228
01:41:37,583 --> 01:41:39,583
She won't talk here.

1229
01:41:39,667 --> 01:41:41,917
Take her inside and get her to talk.

1230
01:41:42,417 --> 01:41:45,000
What were you saying, huh?

1231
01:41:45,542 --> 01:41:46,833
Madness in love…

1232
01:41:46,917 --> 01:41:49,167
Go in, let me show you. Give me that.

1233
01:41:49,708 --> 01:41:51,625
Madness, huh?

1234
01:41:55,208 --> 01:41:56,792
<i>What else does Dinesh Pandit write, huh?</i>

1235
01:41:56,875 --> 01:41:58,042
<i>Tell me!</i>

1236
01:41:58,125 --> 01:41:59,708
<i>What else does he say?</i>

1237
01:42:04,375 --> 01:42:07,917
Sir. She's an adamant one.

1238
01:42:08,542 --> 01:42:11,917
Even though I thrashed her,
she hasn't spilled anything.

1239
01:42:13,875 --> 01:42:17,125
Ask the technician if he can do
the lie detector test tomorrow.

1240
01:42:17,208 --> 01:42:19,000
-Okay, sir.
-Listen.

1241
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:21,083
Yes?

1242
01:42:22,125 --> 01:42:23,042
Let her go.

1243
01:42:24,583 --> 01:42:25,500
Okay.

1244
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:32,750
Hey! Rani, get up.

1245
01:43:02,917 --> 01:43:03,958
Madam?

1246
01:43:13,917 --> 01:43:15,625
Why is it taking so long?

1247
01:43:23,958 --> 01:43:26,708
Why don't I take you
to the doctor tomorrow?

1248
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,542
I need to go back
to the police station tomorrow.

1249
01:43:44,458 --> 01:43:45,917
Is everything ready, Mishra?

1250
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,708
The recordings are precise.

1251
01:43:47,792 --> 01:43:49,500
There's no chance of a mistake.

1252
01:43:50,667 --> 01:43:51,792
Please come in.

1253
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:54,292
This machine detects every minute detail,

1254
01:43:55,167 --> 01:43:58,583
perspiration, trembling of lips,
eye movement.

1255
01:43:58,667 --> 01:43:59,500
All these get noted.

1256
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,917
Your heartbeat is being monitored, anyway.

1257
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:05,792
-Should we start, Mishra?
-Sure.

1258
01:44:07,417 --> 01:44:09,083
Sir, may I go to the bathroom?

1259
01:44:17,708 --> 01:44:19,208
Hurry up.

1260
01:44:19,792 --> 01:44:21,708
How long will you take?

1261
01:44:21,792 --> 01:44:23,042
Come on out!

1262
01:44:23,708 --> 01:44:24,708
Rani!

1263
01:44:25,375 --> 01:44:26,917
What the hell are you doing?

1264
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,583
Hurry up!

1265
01:44:28,667 --> 01:44:30,333
Are you dead?

1266
01:44:30,417 --> 01:44:32,042
Don't be too smart…

1267
01:44:32,958 --> 01:44:34,958
I'll break the door and come in!

1268
01:44:35,042 --> 01:44:36,750
Is your name Rani Kashyap?

1269
01:44:36,833 --> 01:44:39,500
Rani! Come out, quickly!

1270
01:44:39,583 --> 01:44:41,208
Yes, my name is Rani Kashyap

1271
01:44:42,458 --> 01:44:43,958
<i>Is your name Rani Kashyap?</i>

1272
01:44:44,042 --> 01:44:46,042
<i>Yes, my name is Rani Kashyap.</i>

1273
01:44:46,125 --> 01:44:47,542
Are you 28 years old?

1274
01:44:48,667 --> 01:44:49,958
Yes.

1275
01:44:56,250 --> 01:44:57,958
Are you nervous, madam?

1276
01:44:59,292 --> 01:45:01,583
You heart is already beating very fast.

1277
01:45:02,583 --> 01:45:04,167
Yes, I am nervous.

1278
01:45:04,875 --> 01:45:06,375
Take a few deep breaths, madam.

1279
01:45:11,458 --> 01:45:13,208
What happened on the 30th of November?

1280
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:21,875
Sir, on that day, Rishu's parents
left for Bareilly, to attend a wedding.

1281
01:45:22,833 --> 01:45:27,083
Remember to turn off the gas valve,
or you'll end up blowing up the house.

1282
01:45:27,167 --> 01:45:28,375
-Bye.
-Take care.

1283
01:45:28,458 --> 01:45:29,417
Bye. You also take care.

1284
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:32,833
We had invited Rishu's friends
over that day.

1285
01:45:32,917 --> 01:45:34,792
Aren't your friends coming over today?

1286
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:39,542
I had asked Rishu to get a few things,
on his way back from work.

1287
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:41,917
I've already bought mutton.
Don't forget the spices.

1288
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,833
Send me a list of what you need.

1289
01:45:47,417 --> 01:45:50,125
<i>-But Rishu returned early.</i>
-I've got everything.

1290
01:45:50,208 --> 01:45:53,792
<i>And he saw me talking to Neel.</i>

1291
01:45:53,875 --> 01:45:56,250
Rishu, he…

1292
01:45:57,667 --> 01:45:59,667
Welcome home, Rishu.

1293
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:03,083
Why haven't you told him
that you're leaving with me?

1294
01:46:03,167 --> 01:46:04,042
Stop lying.

1295
01:46:04,125 --> 01:46:05,792
He's here to talk about something, Rishu.

1296
01:46:05,875 --> 01:46:07,583
Rani, go outside and let us sort this out.

1297
01:46:07,667 --> 01:46:11,042
<i>I tried to explain everything to Rishu.</i>

1298
01:46:11,125 --> 01:46:12,750
Go, Rani.
We are just talking, don't worry.

1299
01:46:13,458 --> 01:46:14,542
<i>But he wouldn't listen.</i>

1300
01:46:15,292 --> 01:46:16,542
<i>He insisted.</i>

1301
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:24,667
<i>And I left to go to the market.</i>

1302
01:46:25,917 --> 01:46:27,042
Rickshaw!

1303
01:46:27,125 --> 01:46:29,875
<i>As I left the house,the door was left open…</i>

1304
01:46:29,958 --> 01:46:31,958
Tell Rishu to lock the door.

1305
01:46:32,042 --> 01:46:33,708
Rishu! Lock the door.

1306
01:46:33,792 --> 01:46:34,875
<i>I saw Ruhina.</i>

1307
01:46:34,958 --> 01:46:36,708
I am making <i>kheer</i> today.
I'll send some over.

1308
01:46:36,792 --> 01:46:40,667
-That's great.
-<i>And I got into the rickshaw.</i>

1309
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:44,500
<i>I had a tiff with the butcher.</i>

1310
01:46:44,583 --> 01:46:45,625
Your knife looks rusted.

1311
01:46:45,708 --> 01:46:47,958
There's no way our knives are rusted.

1312
01:46:48,042 --> 01:46:50,125
Give it to me,
I'll get it cut from somewhere else.

1313
01:46:51,042 --> 01:46:53,375
<i>So I went to another butcher,</i>

1314
01:46:53,958 --> 01:46:57,208
<i>got him to cut the mutton,and was on my way back home.</i>

1315
01:46:57,792 --> 01:47:00,167
<i>I gave a few pieces of muttonto the stray dogs.</i>

1316
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:15,583
Rishu!

1317
01:47:16,417 --> 01:47:17,333
Rishu!

1318
01:47:19,625 --> 01:47:20,458
Rishu!

1319
01:47:30,042 --> 01:47:34,333
Her heartbeat is fast even
when answering general questions.

1320
01:47:34,875 --> 01:47:36,000
Which is normal.

1321
01:47:36,708 --> 01:47:38,708
But there's no change
when I ask the other questions.

1322
01:47:39,292 --> 01:47:41,083
It's difficult to come to a conclusion.

1323
01:47:42,333 --> 01:47:43,542
Now what?

1324
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,333
We can do one thing.

1325
01:47:47,167 --> 01:47:50,667
I'll ask her questions
she can reply, with a yes or a no.

1326
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:52,375
Okay.

1327
01:48:03,542 --> 01:48:06,583
Does she always wear these shoes?

1328
01:48:08,417 --> 01:48:09,250
Why?

1329
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:11,208
Got it. Let's go.

1330
01:48:11,833 --> 01:48:13,917
Remove your shoes, madam.

1331
01:48:23,625 --> 01:48:24,958
Look at this, sir.

1332
01:48:25,042 --> 01:48:26,833
She has put a nail inside the shoe.

1333
01:48:27,917 --> 01:48:29,583
This would have caused her pain.

1334
01:48:30,167 --> 01:48:32,458
And pain quickens the heartbeat.

1335
01:48:33,417 --> 01:48:37,042
Now she'll claim
that she was unaware of this.

1336
01:48:37,875 --> 01:48:41,000
Get her to talk, Mishra.

1337
01:48:44,583 --> 01:48:46,417
Is your name Rani Kashyap?

1338
01:48:49,417 --> 01:48:50,250
Yes.

1339
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:51,958
Are you 28 years old?

1340
01:48:52,458 --> 01:48:53,625
Yes.

1341
01:48:53,708 --> 01:48:55,750
Did you kill your husband?

1342
01:49:00,417 --> 01:49:01,625
No.

1343
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:10,750
Were you having an affair
with Neel Tripathi?

1344
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:12,667
Yes.

1345
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:15,125
Did your lover kill your husband?

1346
01:49:17,833 --> 01:49:18,667
I don't know.

1347
01:49:22,917 --> 01:49:25,583
Did you murder your husband?

1348
01:49:27,125 --> 01:49:28,458
No, I didn't.

1349
01:49:40,625 --> 01:49:42,458
<i>Sir, I am convincedthat she has committed the murder.</i>

1350
01:49:42,542 --> 01:49:44,625
She knows where her lover is.
The machine hasn't…

1351
01:49:44,708 --> 01:49:45,875
Enough of this nonsense.

1352
01:49:46,708 --> 01:49:50,083
Close Rani's case and start investigating
the honor killing case.

1353
01:51:12,458 --> 01:51:15,917
<i>Madam left and the case file was closed.</i>

1354
01:51:17,250 --> 01:51:19,875
<i>But this case will alwaysremain open for me.</i>

1355
01:51:20,625 --> 01:51:24,583
<i>Everyone said that I'd takenthis case very personally…</i>

1356
01:51:25,583 --> 01:51:29,333
<i>Five years went by and I got transferred.</i>

1357
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,667
-Have you taken everything?
-Yes, I have.

1358
01:51:36,583 --> 01:51:38,250
I've kept your luggage inside, sir.

1359
01:51:38,833 --> 01:51:40,750
Best wishes for your new posting.

1360
01:51:40,833 --> 01:51:42,167
We'll miss you, sir.

1361
01:51:43,083 --> 01:51:44,625
-Good to know!
-Thank you, sir.

1362
01:51:44,708 --> 01:51:46,667
-How much is it?
-Won't you share some?

1363
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:48,042
Give some to Uncle.

1364
01:51:48,125 --> 01:51:49,667
It's okay…

1365
01:51:50,375 --> 01:51:51,583
What about me?

1366
01:51:51,667 --> 01:51:54,708
Sir, have you read Dinesh Pandit's novels?

1367
01:51:54,792 --> 01:51:57,958
DINESH PANDIT
<i>WRATH OF KASAULI</i>

1368
01:51:58,542 --> 01:52:00,333
<i>Dinesh Pandit writes,</i>

1369
01:52:01,125 --> 01:52:05,833
"Eternal love will always be
stained with a few drops of blood!"

1370
01:52:08,333 --> 01:52:11,542
<i>Savitri had won overBhairav's heart once again.</i>

1371
01:52:12,125 --> 01:52:15,958
<i>But Bhairav didn't knowthat he had one last hurdle to cross,</i>

1372
01:52:16,542 --> 01:52:18,917
<i>before he could get her.</i>

1373
01:52:22,625 --> 01:52:28,667
<i>Cardamom, cloves, raisins,almonds, and… Rishu.</i>

1374
01:52:29,833 --> 01:52:32,708
<i>From a different perspective,Rani can be an endless debate.</i>

1375
01:52:33,417 --> 01:52:36,583
<i>One with accusations and insults for me…</i>

1376
01:52:37,333 --> 01:52:39,833
<i>But I want to have this debate…all my life.</i>

1377
01:52:40,875 --> 01:52:45,333
<i>Truth be told, I want to haveall my arguments only with her.</i>

1378
01:52:45,417 --> 01:52:46,417
Move aside, Munni.

1379
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:50,792
<i>I had wronged her greatly,but she stayed with me despite that.</i>

1380
01:52:51,542 --> 01:52:52,375
<i>And today…</i>

1381
01:52:52,458 --> 01:52:53,708
I've got everything.

1382
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,375
<i>…today I can do anything for Rani!</i>

1383
01:52:57,125 --> 01:52:59,250
Welcome home, Rishu.

1384
01:52:59,333 --> 01:53:02,250
We were talking about you.
Did you get the cashews and raisins?

1385
01:53:02,333 --> 01:53:03,417
Please leave, Neel.

1386
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:04,583
Tell him.

1387
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:08,083
Tell him that you're leaving with me.
Go on.

1388
01:53:08,167 --> 01:53:09,375
You're lying.

1389
01:53:09,458 --> 01:53:10,708
I'm lying?

1390
01:53:10,792 --> 01:53:14,083
Rishu, he's here to bother us,
nothing else.

1391
01:53:14,167 --> 01:53:16,000
I'm here to bother you?

1392
01:53:16,083 --> 01:53:18,958
He's the one who's been bothering me.

1393
01:53:19,042 --> 01:53:21,750
Why don't you tell her
what you've been up to, Rishu?

1394
01:53:21,833 --> 01:53:24,542
He'd come to Delhi,
to attack me with a screwdriver.

1395
01:53:25,125 --> 01:53:27,625
Now he's told my neighbors
that I'm a sex offender.

1396
01:53:27,708 --> 01:53:29,125
Me, a sex offender?!

1397
01:53:29,792 --> 01:53:33,958
Why did you guys get married,
if you can't satisfy your wife?

1398
01:53:34,625 --> 01:53:37,375
Then people like me get stuck
being called sex offenders.

1399
01:53:37,458 --> 01:53:39,375
Listen, I came here to clarify.

1400
01:53:39,917 --> 01:53:41,542
Neither of us is an offender.

1401
01:53:41,625 --> 01:53:43,958
What happened between us was consensual.
I didn't force her.

1402
01:53:44,042 --> 01:53:45,542
She's right here. Ask her.

1403
01:53:48,417 --> 01:53:49,750
And it was good.

1404
01:53:49,833 --> 01:53:51,042
I bet she thinks about it too.

1405
01:53:51,125 --> 01:53:54,250
Yes, I think about the
huge mistake that I made…

1406
01:53:54,333 --> 01:53:55,542
this is how I think of it.

1407
01:53:56,833 --> 01:53:57,792
A mistake?

1408
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:00,583
Why did you come to me, then?

1409
01:54:01,417 --> 01:54:04,958
Because one has to kiss many frogs
before one can find true love.

1410
01:54:05,042 --> 01:54:06,958
And you belong to that category.

1411
01:54:16,708 --> 01:54:17,792
A frog, huh?

1412
01:54:19,208 --> 01:54:21,667
This frog is a big fan of yours, Rani.

1413
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:23,625
Let me increase your fan base.

1414
01:54:24,250 --> 01:54:28,042
I'd taken a few videos
of us together, remember?

1415
01:54:28,958 --> 01:54:31,125
Let me share these
in a few WhatsApp groups.

1416
01:54:31,208 --> 01:54:32,500
And your fan base will increase.

1417
01:54:32,583 --> 01:54:36,000
Rishu, you better get
some more screwdrivers,

1418
01:54:36,083 --> 01:54:39,917
because you'll have to run after quite
a few boys, who'll watch these videos.

1419
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,292
See this. Don't you look nice?

1420
01:54:43,333 --> 01:54:45,500
Remember? You were having a good time too?

1421
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:53,333
-Rishu!
-Get off!

1422
01:55:02,833 --> 01:55:04,500
You're completely mad, you know?

1423
01:55:15,333 --> 01:55:16,792
Have you lost your mind?

1424
01:55:32,833 --> 01:55:33,958
Rishu…

1425
01:55:34,708 --> 01:55:35,583
Get up.

1426
01:55:42,625 --> 01:55:44,125
There's blood.

1427
01:55:49,792 --> 01:55:50,792
Neel?

1428
01:55:56,917 --> 01:55:58,375
Neel?

1429
01:56:00,375 --> 01:56:01,375
Neel!

1430
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:03,750
Neel!

1431
01:56:32,167 --> 01:56:33,458
Let me call the police.

1432
01:56:34,083 --> 01:56:36,167
-I'll call the police.
-What?

1433
01:56:36,250 --> 01:56:37,333
He is dead.

1434
01:56:38,542 --> 01:56:41,500
-He is dead.
-No… don't call the police.

1435
01:56:41,583 --> 01:56:43,500
-I killed him.
-You didn't kill him, Rani.

1436
01:56:44,250 --> 01:56:46,000
I killed him, Rishu.

1437
01:56:46,083 --> 01:56:47,708
It was an accident.
He died in an accident.

1438
01:56:47,792 --> 01:56:49,292
We didn't kill him on purpose.

1439
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:53,208
I won't let you go to jail for this.

1440
01:56:55,292 --> 01:56:58,750
You won't go to jail for this.
Listen carefully.

1441
01:56:58,833 --> 01:57:02,000
Finally, things have improved between us

1442
01:57:03,542 --> 01:57:05,000
and I want to be with you.

1443
01:57:16,042 --> 01:57:17,000
Now…

1444
01:57:19,417 --> 01:57:20,917
what next?

1445
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,958
What do we do?

1446
01:57:25,792 --> 01:57:28,583
In every unplanned crime,
you get one chance to hide it.

1447
01:57:31,792 --> 01:57:34,000
I've read only one of
Dinesh Pandit's novels,

1448
01:57:34,083 --> 01:57:35,083
<i>Wrath of Kasauli.</i>

1449
01:57:38,208 --> 01:57:39,583
-Rishu. No.
-We have no other option.

1450
01:57:39,667 --> 01:57:41,542
No Rishu, this is madness.

1451
01:57:41,625 --> 01:57:42,958
-We don't have a choice, Rani.
-I'll go to jail…

1452
01:57:43,042 --> 01:57:44,792
Nothing will happen.
No one will get caught.

1453
01:57:44,875 --> 01:57:45,750
Listen to me, please.

1454
01:57:45,833 --> 01:57:47,417
Everything will be fine!

1455
01:57:48,167 --> 01:57:49,542
No, I refuse to be parted from you.

1456
01:57:50,167 --> 01:57:51,500
Just do as I say, okay?

1457
01:57:52,792 --> 01:57:53,875
Please.

1458
01:57:55,958 --> 01:57:56,917
We will get caught.

1459
01:58:17,083 --> 01:58:18,125
Ice, ice!

1460
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:20,875
Ice!

1461
01:58:21,458 --> 01:58:23,042
Go and get some ice!

1462
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:28,125
Ice… Where's the ice?

1463
01:58:33,083 --> 01:58:33,958
Rani!

1464
01:58:35,417 --> 01:58:36,250
Rani!

1465
01:58:40,167 --> 01:58:42,000
Get some kerosene. Go.

1466
01:58:47,917 --> 01:58:49,458
Get some newspapers.

1467
01:58:51,625 --> 01:58:52,583
Give them to me.

1468
01:59:44,125 --> 01:59:45,875
No, I can't. No.

1469
01:59:49,083 --> 01:59:50,500
Hold this, Rani.

1470
01:59:52,167 --> 01:59:54,083
What's wrong with you, Rani?

1471
01:59:54,167 --> 01:59:55,750
-Please.
-I can't.

1472
01:59:57,417 --> 01:59:59,458
Want to be away from me? No, right?

1473
02:00:01,292 --> 02:00:03,458
Then you have to do this. Do this for us.

1474
02:00:03,958 --> 02:00:05,125
Please, Rani. Okay?

1475
02:00:05,208 --> 02:00:06,375
Come.

1476
02:00:08,125 --> 02:00:09,125
Hold this!

1477
02:00:09,958 --> 02:00:11,500
Rani! Just do it!

1478
02:00:27,875 --> 02:00:30,208
Rishu! Rishu!

1479
02:00:30,833 --> 02:00:33,625
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

1480
02:00:34,167 --> 02:00:36,000
Open your eyes, Rishu.

1481
02:00:40,625 --> 02:00:41,667
Rishu.

<i>We are our destiny</i>

<i>We only have each other</i>

1489
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:37,458

02:01:37,542 --> 02:01:40,583

<i>You've come to me</i>

1493
02:01:49,417 --> 02:01:52,333
<i>Like we've never been apart</i>

1494
02:01:52,417 --> 02:01:56,083
<i>You've come to me</i>

1495
02:01:58,333 --> 02:02:01,250
<i>Love has blossomed</i>

1496
02:02:01,333 --> 02:02:04,125
<i>Like things were never amiss</i>

1499
02:02:26,083 --> 02:02:28,292
Rickshaw!

1500
02:02:35,208 --> 02:02:37,833
Munni, tell Rishu to lock the door.

1501
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,625
Rishu! Rishu! Lock the door!

1502
02:02:43,125 --> 02:02:43,958
Rishu…

1503
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:49,125
I am making <i>kheer</i> today.
I'll send some over.

1504
02:02:55,208 --> 02:02:56,625
Don't play over here.

1505
02:02:58,333 --> 02:02:59,875
Go somewhere else.

1506
02:03:25,083 --> 02:03:26,417
Wait a minute.

1507
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:28,958
Give it to me,
I'll get it cut from somewhere else.

1508
02:03:36,042 --> 02:03:37,000
There's one more.

1509
02:03:37,542 --> 02:03:39,125
Can you cut this as well, please?

1516

What happened? Why are you laughing?

1517
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,625
He switched the lover's body
with his own and turned the case around.

<i>The lover will remain missing.</i>

<i>His body will never be found.</i>

1520
02:06:39,208 --> 02:06:42,458
The husband cut off his hand
and kept it with the dead body,

1521
02:06:43,375 --> 02:06:44,958

I'm sure, you wouldn't even sacrifice
a fingernail for me!
