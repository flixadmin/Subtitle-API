1
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,207
Seriously?

2
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:46,327
Isn't it common sense
to drive slowly at night?

3
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,630
That's quite a dent.

4
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:50,997
Are you okay?

5
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,713
- Yes, and you?
- I'm fine.

6
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,083
Why did you drive so fast
at night?

7
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,418
- How are the photos?
- Sorry?

8
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,537
There's really no need for that.

9
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,083
What are you talking about?

10
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,752
Photos are crucial
when claiming insurance.

11
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,707
You had better not
change your story.

12
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,128
It's scratched...

13
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:09,423
Another murder took place
in a land development site

14
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,668
near Cheonan early this morning.

15
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,748
Since last year, many murders
and missing person cases

16
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,423
have been reported all around
the South Chungcheong Province,

17
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,583
but the police
are yet to close the cases...

18
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:24,417
We want to close them too,
you know.

19
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,285
We want to close cases,

20
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
go on vacations,
and get promoted.

21
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,883
Turn off the siren!

22
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,672
No one in this town
gives a damn.

23
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,418
They just couldn't care less.

24
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,920
- What a filthy world...
- Tell me about it.

25
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,830
Gosh, look at those thugs.

26
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,287
Trash like them
should just die.

27
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,745
Where are you going?
We're on a case!

28
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,583
Whatever. Does it look like
we're on a case?

29
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,330
- Tae-seok!
- See you at the scene!

30
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:05,542
- Can't you even do that?
- I'm sorry.

31
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:06,748
Seriously.

32
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,809
Please be on your way.
Please go.

33
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,883
- Be on your way. I'm a cop.
- Sir.

34
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:12,712
I told you
to stay out of my sight.

35
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,245
Block the entrance.

36
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,877
Step aside.

37
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,125
To what do we owe the pleasure
on this hot day?

38
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:25,252
Does a cop need permission
from thugs to be here?

39
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Sir.

40
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,083
Come on, sir!

41
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,713
Come back another time.
Today's a bad day.

42
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,793
It must be one of those days.

43
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,543
The roads were jammed
but things aren't better here.

44
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,833
All right, fine.

45
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,883
Here. Now please go away.

46
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:54,625
You bastard. What do you take
Korean cops for?

47
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,328
How dare you try to bribe me?

48
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,167
GAMELAND

49
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,790
Here you go, fucking jerks.

50
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:06,917
You guys should've
been more careful.

51
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:12,535
How dare gangsters
try to block a cop's way?

52
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,172
Please continue.

53
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,207
I hope you win!

54
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,250
Boss.

55
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,883
That fucking cop's here.

56
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,750
Put it down.

57
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,710
- Wrap him up and send him back.
- Yes, Boss.

58
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,495
I received 200,000 won
in gift certificates.

59
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,705
Our share is ten percent,

60
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:21,997
so your total is 180,000 won.

61
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,293
Who the fuck...

62
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:26,883
Open it.

63
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:31,625
Salute.

64
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,748
Whatever.

65
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,080
You're charged with illegal
conversion of gift certificates.

66
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,963
Remain silent

67
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:43,502
or retain a lawyer if you want.

68
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,133
You're coming with me.

69
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,578
Detective, why don't
you come in for a second?

70
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,877
Buddy, come out here.

71
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,328
Don't forget to put those on.

72
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,430
- Good morning, Boss!
- Good morning, Boss!

73
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,883
Yes, it's me.

74
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,285
That bastard's back again.

75
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,498
What?

76
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:21,457
I sent him to a crime scene.
What's he doing there?

77
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:25,832
Ask the fucker yourself.

78
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,668
Tell Sang-do I'm heading there.

79
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,130
You can't do this, not when you
receive our monthly fee.

80
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,543
Taking all the money
for yourself

81
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,460
has caused your boys
to disrupt my business.

82
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,713
I already advised you against
gift certificate conversion.

83
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:45,327
Start a currency exchange shop
under someone else's name,

84
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:48,582
or share the stakes. You know
what I'm talking about.

85
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,710
All that for some chump change?

86
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,462
I'm busy as it is
setting up new operations.

87
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,575
Can't you cut him off
before he comes over?

88
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,332
My boys need the money.

89
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:00,627
All right, fine.
I'll take care of the bastard.

90
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:13,917
What?

91
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Are you kidding me?

92
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,288
I'm your superior, you know.
Where are you?

93
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,495
On my way to the crime scene.
I'm hanging up.

94
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,455
I really don't like this guy.

95
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:23,712
Let me just turn off...

96
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:25,582
- the electric fan.
- Keep walking.

97
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,167
Stop right there.

98
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:33,712
As you wish.

99
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:42,332
- Thanks for the ride.
- Thank you.

100
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,293
Seriously? Is this necessary?

101
00:09:48,417 --> 00:09:51,667
I gave you a ride!

102
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,825
Here's my payment.

103
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:57,998
Now, kneel on the ground!

104
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,253
I'm going to report you.

105
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,078
Bloody traffic jam.

106
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,577
Where the heck have you been?

107
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,205
Gosh, there's a crowd already.

108
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:09,998
Get rid of them.

109
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,210
Hello, reporters.
One moment, please!

110
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:16,712
You can take photos later.
Can you all move back for now?

111
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,288
Secure the scene properly!
What have you been doing?

112
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:23,922
Hey, move aside!

113
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,210
Stay back if you were late.

114
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,458
Don't head toward the bridge
and stay close.

115
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,173
I just received a call
requesting for backup.

116
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,133
Move back, please.

117
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:54,712
People are gathering over there!

118
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,042
We're gaining an audience!

119
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,325
Good day, officer.

120
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,125
Did you identify the victim?

121
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,708
We're checking his vehicle
number, so we'll find out soon.

122
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:10,963
He died only a few hours ago

123
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:14,753
between three and five
this morning.

124
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,628
Cause of death is blood loss
due to stabbing

125
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,208
or a heart attack.

126
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:21,752
That's my initial impression.

127
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,213
Hey, come and take some photos.

128
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,747
Did you get it?

129
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,495
Make sure
you don't miss anything.

130
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,748
Hey, Seo-jin. Over here!

131
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,203
Can you take a look at this?

132
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,883
I told you not to call me
by name at crime scenes.

133
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,997
My apologies, Chief Cha.
Anyway, please take a look.

134
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:52,383
What is it?

135
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:55,813
Looks like rear-end collision, right?

136
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:00,882
It does seem that way,
but then again, it doesn't.

137
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,168
Could this be the motive?

138
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:07,247
I wish it was. It's better
than premeditated murder.

139
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,503
By the way, I should thank you

140
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,628
for turning one of my boys
into a cripple.

141
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,173
There are rules for a reason,
you know.

142
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,207
Whatever.

143
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,883
So businesses will be separate
but we'll share engineers.

144
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:43,292
Got it.

145
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,330
Shouldn't we resolve
the turf issue though?

146
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,035
Let's be flexible about this.

147
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:57,037
- Sang-do.
- Yes?

148
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,213
If you keep getting favors,
you'll end up getting spoiled.

149
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:07,825
Don't make trouble, and manage
the shop I assigned you.

150
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,825
Everyone has his limit.

151
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,248
If you cross the line,
you'll die.

152
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:19,165
Come on, do you really think so?

153
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,788
Guus Hiddink once said this.

154
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,958
"I'm still fucking hungry."

155
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,422
I have no capital,
no connections,

156
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,753
so I'm still hungry.

157
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,208
Sir.

158
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,330
My boss is being lenient
because you two are friends.

159
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,628
That's why he's giving you
the technology and engineers.

160
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,883
The slot arcade business

161
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:52,038
is nothing like fighting
over these bars and clubs!

162
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,495
Are you raising your voice
in front of our bosses?

163
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,173
Give us what?
Just shut up, asshole!

164
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,880
Do you have a death wish?

165
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,330
Shut the fuck up!

166
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,792
Is this how you train your boys?

167
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:06,672
Look at him glaring at me.

168
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,540
Hey, Dong-su.

169
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,383
Why are you
acting so high and mighty

170
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,058
when all you give me
are only the crumbs?

171
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,083
This type of transaction
won't keep the peace.

172
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,415
Come here.

173
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Yes, Boss.

174
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,460
You shouldn't
interrupt our conversation.

175
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Come here.

176
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,285
You little fucker.

177
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,710
There. Now we can work in peace.

178
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,207
Drink up.

179
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,288
It's good.

180
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,785
CHEONAN POLICE STATION

181
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,333
Choe Jeong-gyu, 46 years old.

182
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,288
No enemies, debts, lawsuits
or anything like that.

183
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,000
The autopsy report was obvious.

184
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,753
He has over
a dozen stab wounds.

185
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,559
The murderer is obviously
an amateur.

186
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,963
He just went nuts.

187
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,133
I don't feel comfortable
calling the culprit an amateur.

188
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,035
No evidence was left behind.

189
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:42,173
No footprints, blood, hairs,
fingerprints, nothing.

190
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,538
Since the wallet's gone,
it could be a robbery.

191
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,575
However, the amount
is too small so...

192
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,787
People kill others
for the littlest things.

193
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,380
The meeting's over.
Get the Captain of Unit One.

194
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,208
Yes, sir.

195
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,833
I'm here, sir.

196
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,962
This case is likely
a robbery-homicide,

197
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,285
so look for anyone
with similar criminal records.

198
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,415
Yes, sir.

199
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,878
You guys, back up Unit One.

200
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,898
Three separate cases,
but one killer.

201
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:16,832
What cases?

202
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,167
Listen.

203
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,955
A reservoir in Seosan
on July 15,

204
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:25,667
Boryeong Sunbeach Motel
on July 23,

205
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,880
and then last night's case.

206
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,583
A knife was the murder weapon
in all three cases.

207
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,082
Considering the length
and width of the knife,

208
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,040
it could be the same.

209
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,535
No, I'm certain it is.

210
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,490
The suspect is a serial killer.

211
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,082
This isn't the USA, you know.

212
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,532
Gun possession is illegal,
so knives are the most common.

213
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,463
That's nonsense.

214
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,832
There are over
1,000 murders a year.

215
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,672
Going by your logic, half
of them is done by one guy.

216
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,790
Are you nuts?

217
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,828
Who are you to mess with
another jurisdiction's cases?

218
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:02,917
Does the killer care
about jurisdiction?

219
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,583
If we don't catch him soon,
we'll be in big trouble.

220
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,170
He's too meticulous
for this to be a random killing.

221
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,535
He could strike again
at any time...

222
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,145
This job is too easy for you,
isn't it?

223
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,788
Murder cases aren't a joke.

224
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,559
You can't just
jump to conclusions like that!

225
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,583
That's not...

226
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,287
These aren't random cases
I'm tying together.

227
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,833
They each happened
about a week apart

228
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,327
all around
South Chungcheong Province.

229
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,360
No matter how much we think
about it, we're getting nowhere.

230
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,507
Then the conclusion's pretty
obvious, isn't it?

231
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,293
Screw your nonsense.

232
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:37,309
Are you so clever that you
decided to raid an arcade

233
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,673
on your way to a crime scene?

234
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,958
Did you have the time do that?

235
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,825
Aren't they criminals too?

236
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,628
Gangsters and killers
are the same shit.

237
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,955
Jeong Tae-seok, what's wrong
with you?

238
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,173
Hey.

239
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,520
Are you that desperate
to get promoted?

240
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,665
Gosh...

241
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,125
Yes, that's what I'm after.

242
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,037
It's why I want
to catch the killer.

243
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,995
The meeting's over, so move it.
Let's get that killer.

244
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,667
I didn't drink, so I'll drive.

245
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:27,457
But, Boss...

246
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:29,827
Take the boys and head back.

247
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:31,382
Yes, Boss.

248
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,998
That's correct, Chairman.

249
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,752
Sang-do may be a bit rash,
but he's a smart man.

250
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,208
He won't make trouble anymore.

251
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:55,172
Yes, don't worry.

252
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:02,212
Have a good night.

253
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:30,832
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,458
The road was slippery.

255
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,627
It looks fine. You can just go.

256
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,040
Sorry?

257
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,170
But I still hit your car.

258
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:50,917
It's fine. You can go.

259
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:53,962
Are you sure about that?

260
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,127
Yes, it's fine.

261
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,380
Son of a bitch!

262
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,463
Damn it!

263
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:25,997
What the hell?

264
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,787
Who are you?

265
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,207
Come back here!

266
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,035
You're all dead!

267
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,460
You assholes!

268
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:50,672
Who's there?

269
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,328
Sang-do didn't send him.

270
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:15,882
I didn't recognize the attacker.

271
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:18,288
It was Sang-do, Boss.

272
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,325
He's not a member of a gang.

273
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,333
His attack felt purposeless
and empathetic.

274
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,708
It felt different.

275
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:28,632
Who else would try to attack you

276
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,168
in our line of work?

277
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,250
Give me that.

278
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,502
It was too dark
to see properly but...

279
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,173
WHITE SEDAN,
DAEJEON 23XX

280
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,708
- Get out!
- Locate the vehicle.

281
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:43,712
I told you to be careful,
didn't I?

282
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,172
We're actually friends.

283
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:49,877
Gosh, sorry to bother you.

284
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:52,422
The patient looks
damn comfy to me.

285
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,670
Who are you?

286
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,705
I brought a box of Red Bulls.

287
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,078
Anyway, I heard
you were stabbed recently.

288
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,633
The hospital
reported it to the police.

289
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Well, you must be
quite embarrassed

290
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:08,239
to have been attacked like that.
You're a thug, after all.

291
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,170
It's not as embarrassing
as being a cop.

292
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,415
Cops are so incompetent

293
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:17,423
that bad things keep happening
to model citizens.

294
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:19,632
Unbelievable.

295
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:26,002
Right, model citizen,
Jang Dong-su,

296
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,827
tell me everything
about last night.

297
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:31,247
I'll catch him for you.

298
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:34,628
I can probably catch him faster.

299
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:35,995
Really?

300
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,035
Jeez. Do you want to bet?

301
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,710
Spill it, asshole.

302
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,632
Like I said,
I'll catch him for you.

303
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,293
Fine. Do you mind?

304
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:59,333
I tripped last night
and hurt myself.

305
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,245
Right, okay.

306
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:11,998
You should really
watch your step.

307
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:17,035
Unlucky bastards can trip
and fall on multiple knives.

308
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,632
Jang's car is a black Mercedes
with the number 3849, right?

309
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,003
Got it, I'll hang up.

310
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,713
Son of a bitch.

311
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,583
A rear-end collision.

312
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:30,878
White sedan.

313
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,080
I was right, shithead.

314
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,245
WISH YOU A FAST RECOVERY,
HUR SANG-DO

315
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,330
Jeez, look at you.

316
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,665
Are you okay?

317
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,248
- Have a seat.
- I'm fine.

318
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:55,748
I feel so bad that
I can barely look at you.

319
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,880
What will happen now?

320
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:05,495
You made a mess right after
we signed the contract.

321
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:08,127
What would you like me to do?

322
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,920
A lot of my boys
are cripples now.

323
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,417
Pay hospital bills
and some compensation.

324
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:18,198
and hand over the main store
and also the one in Seongan.

325
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,748
I'll make sure your boys
are well compensated.

326
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,333
And the shops?

327
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,418
Was this your plan all along?

328
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,423
Dong-su.

329
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:40,997
If I gave the order,

330
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,915
you wouldn't be alive.

331
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,665
Anyway, think about it.

332
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,538
I'm curious too, you know.

333
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,535
Who would mess you up like this?

334
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:57,633
See you then.

335
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,875
So fucking embarrassing!

336
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:03,458
A gangster getting stabbed?
I'd just kill myself!

337
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,963
Trust me and give me
two men on this case.

338
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,542
I'll catch that guy in one go.

339
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,290
Why don't you just
go on a vacation?

340
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,290
I barely have enough men
to run this department,

341
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,250
so why are you offering
to take someone else's problem?

342
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,328
Chief, it's a huge case.

343
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:25,378
If you close one,
others will get solved as well.

344
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:28,247
It will be a long train
of solved cases.

345
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:29,957
Piss off!

346
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,793
We finally have a victim
who survived the attack.

347
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:40,917
Did a witness come forward?

348
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,790
Jang Dong-su.

349
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,578
What? Jang Dong-su?

350
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:57,165
He was stabbed a few days ago.

351
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,418
A two-hour surgery
barely kept him alive and...

352
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,580
Listen to yourself.

353
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,957
Just think about it
for a second.

354
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:07,542
What kind of psychotic idiot
would attack a gang leader?

355
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,995
The killer's not involved
with gangs.

356
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,543
I'm sure of it.
It's the serial killer!

357
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,625
Shut it!

358
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:20,037
This is a gang problem,
I'll assign it to Unit Two.

359
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:24,707
I'm warning you.
Don't get involved.

360
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:26,705
Now, get out.

361
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,713
Go easy on covering for him.

362
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,630
This isn't the time for that.

363
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,672
What did you say?

364
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,078
It's what you've been doing.

365
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:39,918
You son of a bitch!

366
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:47,125
Let's say you're right.

367
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:50,078
But Jang is the victim here.

368
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,133
You can't arrest a witness

369
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,168
for not reporting a crime.

370
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,000
How many crimes
has he committed?

371
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,583
We need to bring him in
and have him questioned.

372
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,785
He's pissed off
to say the least.

373
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,710
If we don't do anything,
he'll kill the killer.

374
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,763
That'll leave us
with three unsolved cases.

375
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,747
How can Jang find the killer?

376
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,960
He's a gangster, not a cop.

377
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:15,665
His men have the resources
to find someone in days.

378
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,080
Also, Jang saw...

379
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:22,752
the killer's face.

380
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Get out.

381
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,327
You're spewing
a lot of nonsense.

382
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,290
- Get out!
- Jeez.

383
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:52,327
Why don't you talk
to the landlord?

384
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:55,132
Jeez!

385
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,580
What am I supposed to do?

386
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,787
I need to work
in order to earn money!

387
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,577
What? Birthday?

388
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,000
How is that important right now?

389
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,078
I'm tired as hell!

390
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:12,712
I haven't slept in two days,

391
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,582
so don't nag me
about a kid's birthday!

392
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,708
It must be your kid's birthday.

393
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:20,125
What?

394
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,790
That goddamn kid you mentioned.

395
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:35,915
Give me that.

396
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,168
Sharp face,

397
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,420
thin cheeks, an angled chin,

398
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:51,037
and a narrow and long nose.

399
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:57,788
His lips are big
compared to his nose.

400
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,880
That's pretty close.

401
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,713
Then you shouldn't
have had the kid.

402
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:19,923
It's not the kid's fault.

403
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:27,245
Find him before the cops.

404
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:28,752
I understand, Boss.

405
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,040
Hey, where are we?

406
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:14,132
Wait. Who are you?

407
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,330
Block the door!

408
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:54,877
Don't let them come out!

409
00:34:57,542 --> 00:34:59,672
Thank you for your cooperation.

410
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,210
We're cracking down
on illegal slot arcades.

411
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:08,668
All gamblers should stay put.

412
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,878
So where's the boss?

413
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:13,745
Get him down here!

414
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:21,582
Yeah? Hold on.

415
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,708
Okay, go ahead.

416
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:30,832
Jang Dong-su,
that adorable piece of shit.

417
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,828
He's a scheming bastard.

418
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,960
He meddled with 63 out
of 97 slot machines.

419
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,290
- Should I get a warrant today?
- Hold on,

420
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,078
let me ask him.

421
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So, should I request a warrant?

422
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,752
What do you want?

423
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:47,497
The one who stabbed you.

424
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:51,167
Tell me everything,
and I'll let this one slide.

425
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,083
What if I don't?

426
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:58,418
Since you have my boss
on your side,

427
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,630
I'm no use to you, is that it?

428
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,750
Listen, Jang Dong-su.

429
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,250
The guy who stabbed you

430
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,000
is a serial killer.

431
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,998
He's a bit strange though.

432
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,583
He's different
from other psychos.

433
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,625
And you're the proof.

434
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:21,983
What the hell
are you talking about?

435
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:25,955
Why do you think
he messed with you?

436
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,040
Most psychopaths go after girls

437
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,101
or people who are weaker
and smaller than they are.

438
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,995
But the killer
attacks just about anyone.

439
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,500
If we don't find him soon,
more people will die.

440
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,832
What the hell's your problem?

441
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,793
Hand over the information
and do your gangster stuff.

442
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,325
It's a win-win.

443
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,210
I'll catch him,
put him on trial,

444
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:59,132
and lock him up for good.

445
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,250
Then what?

446
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,997
Nothing. That's how it ends.

447
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,080
That's it?

448
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,460
When the country's biggest
luxury casino is built

449
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:16,962
on the penthouse
of this skyscraper,

450
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,753
this entire area
surrounding our Zeus building

451
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:22,673
will become the hottest spot
in town...

452
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,500
Cut the crap. I heard
this place's ruined.

453
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:28,247
Damn it.

454
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:33,077
Everyone who lined up

455
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,707
for pre-construction units
have left.

456
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:39,043
Naturally, investors
are delaying their funding.

457
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:43,628
Weird rumors have been flying
since your accident.

458
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,830
The Cheongju region
is another problem too.

459
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:50,997
Sang-do's boys are moving
into our turf.

460
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,485
What about the punk
who stabbed me?

461
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,460
We found his car

462
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:58,212
on the Sintanjin-bound
national highway.

463
00:37:58,958 --> 00:37:59,958
His car?

464
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:03,038
It was parked at a rest area
for a few days.

465
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,630
The boys found it.

466
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:07,458
- Where is the car now?
- We brought it back.

467
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:11,125
Anyway, there was a murder
a few days ago in that area.

468
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,920
And this. I don't know
if it was dumped or lost,

469
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,540
but the boys found it
about 3km away from the car.

470
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:26,958
Hold onto it.

471
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,503
Yes, Boss.

472
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:37,168
- Hello.
- This is Jang Dong-su.

473
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,582
What a surprise.

474
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,915
Do you know
the Sintanjin murder case?

475
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:46,882
What about it?

476
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,578
That bastard did it.

477
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,290
What?

478
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,000
How do you know that?

479
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,423
We found his car in the area.

480
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,248
I've been doing quite well
lately.

481
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,040
I got all the way up here
by risking my life.

482
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,210
Then some random guy comes along
and gets in my way.

483
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,998
What other choice do I have
other than cutting him down?

484
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,851
It's not like I can move aside
for him.

485
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:23,125
But that psycho
disappeared without a trace

486
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:26,207
after walking all over
a gangster's reputation.

487
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:28,292
Hey,

488
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:31,882
whoever messes with me
has to pay the price.

489
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:35,877
Reputation is everything
to a gangster.

490
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:43,127
I'll chop him up
and put him on display.

491
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:47,498
Are you telling a cop
you'll kill a man?

492
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:50,422
We punish people
in ways that the law can't.

493
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:53,575
Are you saying a bad guy
will catch another bad guy?

494
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:55,082
No.

495
00:39:55,792 --> 00:40:00,042
Two bad guys will catch
a sicko that's even worse.

496
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,880
Here's his car key.

497
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:13,708
Do you not see me as a cop?

498
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,668
I can arrest you right away,
you know.

499
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,327
You won't though. Why?

500
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:24,132
Because you want him
more than I do.

501
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:36,328
I'll provide manpower
and pay the expenses.

502
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:38,958
We'll share information

503
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:41,923
and help each other out.

504
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:43,788
And the prize?

505
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:45,882
Do we split him in half?

506
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,415
Whoever catches him first
can keep him.

507
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:53,037
So if I catch him first,
he'll be punished by the law,

508
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,375
but if you catch him,
you'll finish him off, right?

509
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:58,767
Join the game
if you're confident enough.

510
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:10,915
Count me in.

511
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,210
You'll regret this, you know.

512
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,173
He's a handsome fellow.

513
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,078
How old did he seem?

514
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,035
About mid-30s.

515
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,745
Rain and darkness
obscured my vision, though.

516
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,325
Keep in touch using this.

517
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,580
A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.

518
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:41,167
This is interesting!

519
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:55,422
A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.

520
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,080
This is interesting!

521
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,880
You motherfucker.

522
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,378
We're in the same boat.

523
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,288
I'd be a fool
not to have insurance.

524
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:06,042
It's not like
we can draft a contract, right?

525
00:42:10,542 --> 00:42:14,292
So you went to all the trouble
to record me?

526
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,213
Fuck!

527
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,583
Did you really think
you could have leverage over me?

528
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,495
This is why I don't trust cops.

529
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:43,875
Unbelievable.

530
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:49,955
Just because I'm being lenient

531
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:51,962
doesn't mean
you can walk all over me.

532
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:53,792
Listen, you bastard.

533
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:58,205
When this is over,
I'll lock you up first, asshole!

534
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,915
He stabbed Jang Dong-su too

535
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,093
and is the culprit
behind the Sintanjin case.

536
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:08,752
So what does this mean?

537
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,380
If things go as planned,
we can close five cases at once.

538
00:43:16,292 --> 00:43:18,252
Mid-30s, male, average height.

539
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:21,247
Judging from his pattern,
he only kills at night.

540
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,630
He doesn't care whom he kills
and he only uses a knife.

541
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,130
It's one or the other.

542
00:43:26,667 --> 00:43:29,247
He has an obsession
or he's always prepared.

543
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,078
There are no other clues so far.

544
00:43:37,708 --> 00:43:39,248
I made a deal with
Detective Jeong.

545
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,630
We'll catch him together.

546
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,309
Obviously,
we won't tell the others.

547
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,883
How can we trust cops?

548
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,918
How can we trust gangsters?

549
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,200
Who said anything about trust?

550
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,708
We need manpower
to catch the killer

551
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:52,248
and this isn't a case
we can handle ourselves.

552
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:54,963
- Let's get the others involved.
- Then what?

553
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:56,962
The Major Case Squad
will take over,

554
00:43:57,042 --> 00:44:00,332
get the media involved,
and have all the glory.

555
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:03,672
That's not all.
The Chief is protecting Jang,

556
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,170
so this is the only way
to solve this case.

557
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,078
The Chief will get into trouble too.

558
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,000
Jang has seen his face
and has his car.

559
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,133
We can't only rely
on the drawing.

560
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:17,333
We need fingerprints and DNA.

561
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:20,628
We'll help the gangsters
find the killer

562
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,458
and move in to make the arrest.

563
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:26,543
I'll use the cops
and throw them away afterward.

564
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:39,248
We're all
tax-paying citizen too.

565
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,290
Let's get support
from the cops for once.

566
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:50,418
On the outside, it looks like
an abandoned cold store,

567
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:53,503
but thousands of slot machines
are built here

568
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:55,083
and distributed
all over the country.

569
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,327
Sons of bitches.

570
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,877
Jeez.

571
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:06,893
I'm sure there will be
something to find.

572
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:10,417
Probably his hair, fingerprint,
or even traces of his fart.

573
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,495
We have to find something
no matter what.

574
00:45:13,875 --> 00:45:15,325
We'll comb every inch of it.

575
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:16,918
Okay, let's begin.

576
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:20,958
We'll leave all the grunt work to Jang

577
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,963
and go through the cases
that have happened so far.

578
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,128
This is the security footage
from the highway.

579
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,578
Let's go over his pattern.

580
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:32,247
He used a vehicle
in all the murders so far.

581
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:34,877
He's always on the move
which makes him harder to catch.

582
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:39,035
We know of four open cases,
but there has to be more.

583
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:41,418
Even when dealing
with any other cases,

584
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,790
always consider the possibility
of serial killings.

585
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,800
If you find anything,
report to me right away.

586
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:47,625
He's a ticking time bomb.

587
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:51,288
He could pop up anywhere,
so check cases in other areas.

588
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,250
Also, make sure you're discreet.

589
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:04,628
We'll lock up the gangsters
once the case is over.

590
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:06,038
Nice, right?

591
00:46:08,208 --> 00:46:10,378
Ultimately, it's up to us
to catch the killer.

592
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:14,042
Before we do though,
let's take care of Sang-do.

593
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:12,498
Son of a bitch!

594
00:47:17,792 --> 00:47:18,882
Are you insane?

595
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:20,833
What are you doing here?

596
00:47:22,208 --> 00:47:23,578
What the hell do you think?

597
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:25,535
I was waiting for you.

598
00:47:27,167 --> 00:47:28,497
I think you broke my back.

599
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:30,503
You shouldn't have surprised me
like that.

600
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:31,883
I almost had a heart attack.

601
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,165
Give me some.

602
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:42,245
- Nice.
- Could you look into this?

603
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,713
- It's urgent.
- What is it?

604
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:49,173
Nothing special.
I found some hair and blood.

605
00:47:49,542 --> 00:47:51,752
- Please look into them.
- Jeong Tae-seok.

606
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:55,923
What's wrong with you?
This isn't like you.

607
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,038
What isn't like me?

608
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:01,332
It's a filthy world.

609
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:04,632
I ought to get
my hands dirty too.

610
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:06,038
Right, it is filthy.

611
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,330
He's a weird one.

612
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,415
He left the weapon
for us to see.

613
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:30,462
"Killer is still at large
but cops are clueless.

614
00:48:31,292 --> 00:48:33,172
Incompetent cops."

615
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:38,958
And now,
even a gang leader is dead.

616
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,418
What will you do?

617
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:43,827
What should we do about this?

618
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:46,578
Look at you all.
Cat got your tongue?

619
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:48,328
The Hur Sang-do case...

620
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:52,132
will be assigned to Unit Two
and they'll investigate it.

621
00:48:52,542 --> 00:48:54,002
Do you still not get it?

622
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:56,922
Stop staring at the monitor

623
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:58,883
and hit the streets.

624
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,000
Right now!

625
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:05,172
I don't care if it's dog crap,

626
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,490
search and investigate whatever
will help solve the case!

627
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:10,833
At least try to look
like you give a damn!

628
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:12,173
Hold your heads high!

629
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,500
Yeah, tell me.

630
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,753
Do you have a death wish?

631
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:18,213
- What is it?
- You said it's nothing special.

632
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:20,188
I just got the results
on the samples.

633
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:23,457
- I don't believe this.
- What is it? Tell me.

634
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:26,583
DNA of the recent
South Chungcheong murder victims

635
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:28,537
were detected in the samples.

636
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:29,625
Really?

637
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,630
Is that it?

638
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,633
Was there any unidentified DNA?

639
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:36,878
- None.
- That doesn't make sense.

640
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,643
Did you run the tests properly?

641
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:41,457
There was no one else's
but that's not the issue.

642
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:44,082
- Something big happened.
- Hold on a second.

643
00:49:47,917 --> 00:49:48,917
Go ahead.

644
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,380
DNA of the truck driver
and puppy mill owner

645
00:49:52,792 --> 00:49:55,502
were all found on the weapon
used in the Hur murder case.

646
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:56,583
What?

647
00:49:56,667 --> 00:49:58,247
It means one person did it all.

648
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:02,252
It will be officially classified
as a serial killer case.

649
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:04,958
I've got to go.

650
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,172
Jang Dong-su!

651
00:50:10,042 --> 00:50:11,212
It was you, wasn't it?

652
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,248
It was you!

653
00:50:15,792 --> 00:50:17,059
Sir, I'll have to call you back.

654
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:18,423
Answer me, motherfucker!

655
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:25,037
- Are you fucking nuts?
- Damn it!

656
00:50:35,917 --> 00:50:37,247
Bastard!

657
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,250
Your idiot's back.

658
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,208
He barges in here
like it's his house.

659
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,333
Who else?
One of your detectives.

660
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:50,753
Right, we'll talk later.

661
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:53,878
Damn it.

662
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:58,132
A cop in league with a gangster?
Fuck this world.

663
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:02,458
Aren't you a cop too?

664
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:05,125
Aren't you?

665
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:09,668
Tell me, asshole.

666
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:11,922
Did you kill Hur Sang-do?

667
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:16,375
Yes, I killed him.

668
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:26,375
I blame myself
for trusting a gangster.

669
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:30,213
You trusted me?

670
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,785
No one would buy that.

671
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,040
Nothing's changed.

672
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,708
We'll still catch
the killer together.

673
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Got it?

674
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:43,707
When...

675
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:47,248
this is all over,

676
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:51,423
I'll investigate you properly.

677
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:55,712
Whatever.

678
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:03,832
The murder cases in the region
since July this year

679
00:52:03,917 --> 00:52:06,457
were found to be killings
of a serial killer...

680
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:09,422
The police were yet
to find any substantial leads...

681
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,250
Major Case Squad
of the South Chungcheong Station

682
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:15,707
is now working alongside
the Cheonan Police.

683
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:19,577
The murders were handled
by various regional

684
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:22,167
police departments, but by
centralizing the investigation

685
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:27,633
there's new hope
for finally closing the cases.

686
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:29,955
We wish for these cases
to soon be solved

687
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:32,212
so that the people
can finally find peace again.

688
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:35,292
We'll hear more details
from the reporter on site.

689
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:36,535
You're here early.

690
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:38,288
Dong-cheol.

691
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:40,825
I'm outside Ace Hotel,
where the murder took place

692
00:52:40,917 --> 00:52:42,457
on September 3.

693
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:47,037
The victim of this crime
is said to be Hur Sang-do,

694
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:50,578
who led a gang
in the South Chungcheong region.

695
00:52:51,208 --> 00:52:54,828
He was said to be
in a turf war with...

696
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:58,077
If you'd handed over the case
from the beginning,

697
00:52:58,167 --> 00:52:59,497
it wouldn't have come to this.

698
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:02,665
Murder isn't some child's play.

699
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:06,633
You guys only ruined
the fucking investigation.

700
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:11,253
Shouldn't you be more polite
if you're on our home ground?

701
00:53:12,792 --> 00:53:15,082
Well, I'm not wrong, you prick.

702
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:16,633
Prick?

703
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:19,003
Keep talking, you piece of shit.

704
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,543
- What was that?
- Sir!

705
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:22,785
- Bring it on then!
- Come here!

706
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:27,458
- Fucker!
- Hey, stop it!

707
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:33,415
On the knife found
at the scene of Hur's murder,

708
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,170
DNA evidence of other victims
were discovered.

709
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:40,955
A task force was set up to
investigate not only Hur's case,

710
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:43,632
but other victims' cases
as well, as all the murders

711
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:46,828
are likely committed
by one killer...

712
00:53:47,042 --> 00:53:48,672
But that wasn't my doing.

713
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:51,712
The task force that consists
of the Major Case Squad

714
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:54,542
and Homicide units

715
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:59,673
will be joined by the country's
top criminal profiler

716
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:03,880
and forensic experts
from various fields

717
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:07,668
in order to conduct
a thorough investigation.

718
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:11,877
The police will remain vigilant
as they are expecting

719
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:16,173
a huge turnout of gangs
at Hur Sang-do's funeral.

720
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,420
I'm surprised to see you here.

721
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:34,252
Of course I came.
He was my friend.

722
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:20,788
- Hello?
- Get over here right now.

723
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,538
Why should I?

724
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:24,415
To clean up your
own fucking mess!

725
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,750
Get over here.

726
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,500
I don't think we've met.

727
00:55:55,417 --> 00:55:59,577
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE
BY SOMEONE ELSE

728
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,170
Find something useful
if you wish to catch the guy.

729
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:07,167
If Major Case Squad gets him
first, we are both fucked.

730
00:57:09,667 --> 00:57:11,667
Is this what you've been doing
your entire life?

731
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,330
I pity your sorry cop's life.

732
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:18,417
So don't commit any crimes,
you moron.

733
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,575
If people like me aren't around,
you would be out of a job.

734
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:22,883
That's how life is.

735
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:24,748
Some commit crimes
and some catch them.

736
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:27,963
Right, and some get stabbed.

737
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,210
The bastard
attacked me from behind.

738
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:33,132
Still, I took his knife
and got a piece of him too.

739
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:34,578
Wait, hold it.

740
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:37,172
- What now?
- You stabbed him?

741
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,250
I did. Why?

742
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,003
I think I found something.

743
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:52,035
What the hell?

744
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:55,077
Sons of bitches.

745
00:58:15,917 --> 00:58:17,287
Jang Dong-su, what's going on?

746
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,330
Who are these guys?

747
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:20,627
Punks.

748
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,038
Move!

749
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:30,415
Get up.

750
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,830
Go to hell, you asshole!

751
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,035
Shit...

752
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:38,748
Hey! Motherfucker, no!

753
01:00:39,208 --> 01:00:40,378
Fuck!

754
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:42,785
That's enough.

755
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:45,003
It's over now.

756
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,712
You should go.
I'll clean things up.

757
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:50,132
No, he's fine.

758
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:53,075
He just bled a lot.

759
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:54,463
It's just blood...

760
01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:56,632
Get out of here, asshole!

761
01:01:13,042 --> 01:01:14,322
Now that there
is enough evidence

762
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:16,035
to arrest Hur's killer,

763
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:19,632
the police stated that capturing
the suspect is a matter of time.

764
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:23,133
Due to the suspect's
limited method of killing

765
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:25,668
and small hunting ground,
the police are sure...

766
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:32,713
Honey, where are you?

767
01:02:08,542 --> 01:02:11,462
Are you seriously napping when
something huge has happened?

768
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,380
Wait. What's with his face?

769
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:17,128
Wake up, you idiot!

770
01:02:19,125 --> 01:02:22,245
What have you been up to lately?

771
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,290
What the...

772
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:28,078
Where are you going?

773
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:31,127
Here, take this.
It's a kidnapping case.

774
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:33,705
Sun-ho's already there,
so get going.

775
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,003
A kidnapping case?
How is that important right now?

776
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:39,128
We have
a serial killer to catch.

777
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:40,328
That's enough!

778
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:44,882
Hey.

779
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:49,577
Can't you see that
Major Case Squad is here?

780
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,830
They're working with Unit One,
so take care of this.

781
01:02:57,417 --> 01:03:01,667
I told you from the start
that this was a serial murder.

782
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:04,883
But now Major Case Squad
and Unit One have taken over.

783
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:06,882
What the hell
do they know anyway?

784
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,540
They're clueless jerks!

785
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:12,577
You shithead.
What did you just say?

786
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:13,917
Shut up!

787
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:18,333
Tae-seok.

788
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:20,518
You insisted
it was serial killing

789
01:03:20,542 --> 01:03:21,632
without any evidence.

790
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:24,458
There was no evidence
or even a witness.

791
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:25,748
If you were so confident,

792
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,193
you should have caught him
already.

793
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:31,998
Damn it.

794
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,290
The victim was a prolific CEO.

795
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:49,457
Tae-seok.

796
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:53,809
You'll find the killer if you
look into his acquaintances,

797
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:54,833
so get on it.

798
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,578
Did something happen
while you were with Jang?

799
01:04:01,542 --> 01:04:03,252
What's with all the scars?

800
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,170
Something happened, right?

801
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Cut the bullshit.

802
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:13,463
Ask his colleagues
about the women in his life.

803
01:04:14,958 --> 01:04:16,788
How many times does this make?

804
01:04:17,417 --> 01:04:19,417
Why do you keep changing
the meeting spot?

805
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,540
Is he even alive?

806
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,625
If you want the money,
put him on the phone!

807
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:28,582
This is the last time.

808
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:30,328
Be at Jeil Snack Bar
in Wolmyeong-dong.

809
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:31,998
Come right now.

810
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,330
What are you doing?
Go inside already.

811
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,923
Did you come by
to drop off the bag?

812
01:04:45,417 --> 01:04:46,877
- Yes.
- Please leave it with me.

813
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:51,673
Why is she handing her the cash?

814
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,710
What the hell.

815
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:01,788
Tell the world you're here
with cops, why don't you?

816
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,790
Hey. Who's that on the roof?

817
01:05:12,417 --> 01:05:13,707
It's him. He's on the roof!

818
01:05:14,042 --> 01:05:16,292
Dong-cheol, he's headed north!

819
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:17,455
Where is he?

820
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,960
Sun-ho, lure him
into the main street!

821
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,172
Hey!

822
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:25,082
- Where the hell were you?
- Hey, he's moving away!

823
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:27,133
Sun-ho, cut him off!

824
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:28,208
Stop!

825
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,415
- I don't see him!
- What? He's right there!

826
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,960
- The main street!
- Sun-ho, where the hell are you?

827
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:41,628
Stop, you bastard!

828
01:05:45,917 --> 01:05:47,037
Shit, he's bloody fast.

829
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:51,707
Stop right there!

830
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:57,043
- I'll head down!
- Hurry!

831
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:01,293
I don't see him from here!

832
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:03,495
- You're dead meat.
- Where did he go?

833
01:06:04,417 --> 01:06:05,577
Catch up when you can.

834
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,130
Up the stairs! Now!

835
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:10,247
Freeze!

836
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,373
He just turned the corner.
Block him from the front!

837
01:06:15,417 --> 01:06:16,497
Which way did he go?

838
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:20,578
Over there. That way!

839
01:06:22,792 --> 01:06:23,922
Go that way!

840
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:36,875
Why did you take the bag

841
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:38,498
when you don't know
what's inside?

842
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:42,455
Why are you shouting at me?
I didn't do anything wrong.

843
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,828
Someone asked me to take it.

844
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:46,923
Who asked you?

845
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:49,883
Tell us
or we'll have you arrested.

846
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:51,708
I've never seen him before.

847
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:55,462
He ate alone and asked me
to take the bag for him.

848
01:06:57,292 --> 01:06:58,792
He gave me 20 dollars.

849
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,670
What did he look like?

850
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:10,790
Well, he looked quite average.

851
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:12,422
Did he only eat food here?

852
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:16,537
He drank a bottle of soju too!

853
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:20,882
Where's the bottle?

854
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,420
The labels differ
depending on the brand,

855
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,170
but they come in
the same bottle.

856
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,710
Have fun searching.

857
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:31,828
You've got to be kidding me.

858
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:38,043
- Dong-cheol!
- Yes?

859
01:07:38,417 --> 01:07:39,667
Just check the relevant brand.

860
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,330
- It's not...
- Just the relevant brand!

861
01:07:41,417 --> 01:07:42,877
This is unbelievable!

862
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:44,882
All the bottles are the same!

863
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:49,807
There's no need
to work so hard, you know.

864
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:51,497
Are you serious?

865
01:07:54,667 --> 01:07:56,917
What about
the steering wheel cover?

866
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,673
The result will come out today
at the earliest.

867
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:05,165
That's why I'll only charge
two million won per machine.

868
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,125
Thank you.

869
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,330
I'll send the technicians
if you need them.

870
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:12,038
Isn't that too cheap, Mr. Jang?

871
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,750
Of course, your generosity

872
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,500
will make us very happy indeed.

873
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:22,670
I don't know if I should take
the good deals he offers though.

874
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,673
Look what happened to Sang-do.

875
01:08:26,167 --> 01:08:27,577
Watch out, everyone.

876
01:08:27,792 --> 01:08:30,632
After Dong-su got stabbed,
Sang-do was killed,

877
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:33,578
and his lackey disappeared too.

878
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:36,133
Just shut up and eat, will you?

879
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:02,785
What brings you by?

880
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:05,917
Look for this guy first.

881
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:09,915
I found an odd fingerprint.

882
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,960
I don't know if it's damaged.

883
01:09:13,458 --> 01:09:15,498
He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.

884
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:17,625
I found him with the partial
prints he left behind.

885
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,115
He's actually a missing person.

886
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:22,038
His print was found
on the steering wheel cover too.

887
01:09:24,125 --> 01:09:26,325
He hasn't come home
in about three months.

888
01:09:26,417 --> 01:09:27,627
Did he say where he was going?

889
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:30,918
When he's off on a job,
he'd be away for a month.

890
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,042
He's away quite a while
this time though.

891
01:09:33,292 --> 01:09:35,422
I reported it thinking
something had happened to him.

892
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:37,168
Did he make any trouble?

893
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:40,875
No, not at all.
He never missed his rent

894
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:45,578
and never drank any alcohol.
He's a faithful Christian too.

895
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:47,747
He lives a good, clean life.

896
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:59,833
BASIS OF MANKIND
WHO RAISED A MONSTER?

897
01:09:59,917 --> 01:10:02,627
NIGHT DARKER THAN DEATH
SACRED VIOLENCE

898
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:20,208
I found an odd fingerprint.

899
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,460
I don't know if it's damaged.

900
01:10:22,917 --> 01:10:24,957
He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.

901
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:03,458
It's 017-684-2784!

902
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:05,503
Do a background check
on that number.

903
01:11:06,417 --> 01:11:08,247
Also, the recording of
the kidnapper's voice.

904
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:10,633
Send it to me right away.
Right now!

905
01:11:14,125 --> 01:11:16,915
I heard you paid a ton
for Sang-do's funeral.

906
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:20,713
Isn't Dong-su one loyal guy?

907
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,538
I hope you
show me the same courtesy.

908
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:29,535
Didn't I tell you to just eat?

909
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:32,285
You talk too much.

910
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,790
Why are you ruining
this nice lunch?

911
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:40,287
I'm looking out
for your fucking interests.

912
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:43,825
Just eat your food!

913
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:51,713
Please continue.

914
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:55,417
I sent you a photo,
so check it right away.

915
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:56,882
Also, listen to this.

916
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:00,830
This is the last time.

917
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,750
Be at Jeil Snack Bar
in Wolmyeong-dong.

918
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:05,125
Come right now.

919
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,540
I'm sorry.

920
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,250
The road was slippery.

921
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:12,997
But I still hit your car.

922
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:24,627
Name, Kang Gyeong-ho. Age, 35.

923
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:28,458
He was abused by his father
and grew up in an orphanage.

924
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:29,785
He has no priors.

925
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:32,705
He calls his 70-year-old mother
everyday

926
01:12:32,792 --> 01:12:34,212
although both use
unlicensed phones.

927
01:12:34,292 --> 01:12:36,082
Until August, his calls were

928
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:37,667
mainly from
Chungcheong Province,

929
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:41,785
but he's been calling from
all over the country since then.

930
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:46,125
We traced his calls
and they were mainly from Ansan,

931
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:48,538
mostly from this district.

932
01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:50,253
- Daegyeong-dong?
- That's right.

933
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,883
There are a few colleges,

934
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:54,248
so tons of cheap rooms,
apartments,

935
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:57,713
and thousands of old houses
are in the neighborhood.

936
01:12:57,792 --> 01:13:00,132
What a hassle.

937
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:01,668
Which means,

938
01:13:02,458 --> 01:13:05,578
he hid here after stabbing Jang.

939
01:13:05,667 --> 01:13:08,247
You son of a bitch.
Where are your manners?

940
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,559
Jang? Don't address him
like he's your friend, asshole.

941
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:12,043
You fucking gangster.

942
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:15,543
You cops are no different.

943
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,000
Motherfucker!

944
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:21,458
- Damn it!
- Let go of me!

945
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:26,288
Do you want to die?

946
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:30,920
Come here.

947
01:13:40,167 --> 01:13:41,167
Guys.

948
01:13:42,708 --> 01:13:44,038
If we don't catch him,

949
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:47,038
we're all fucked,
don't you know that?

950
01:13:50,625 --> 01:13:52,245
We're in the same boat now,

951
01:13:53,292 --> 01:13:56,172
so let's see this through
no matter what.

952
01:13:57,792 --> 01:13:58,922
Let's just do it, all right?

953
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,460
- Did you all receive the photo?
- Yes, Boss!

954
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:27,878
As of this moment,
you have one single mission.

955
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:31,833
Find this fucker at all costs.

956
01:14:31,917 --> 01:14:32,957
- Yes, Boss!
- Yes, Boss!

957
01:14:34,417 --> 01:14:36,247
Keep a low profile,

958
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,880
and if you see anyone
who resembles him,

959
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:42,293
call your superiors at once.

960
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:44,955
There will be
five of you in a team.

961
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:47,518
The team leader will update us
every eight hours,

962
01:14:47,542 --> 01:14:48,752
three times a day.

963
01:15:01,792 --> 01:15:03,462
Centering on Daegyeong-dong,

964
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:07,207
search your designated areas
and keep looking further.

965
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:11,633
Check cheap motels,
inns, and studio apartments.

966
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:13,463
I've never seen him before.

967
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:15,958
Then check short-term renters

968
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:17,882
as well as
long-term guests at inns.

969
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:20,497
Search all these places
without fail.

970
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:22,633
Doan-dong.

971
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:28,127
In the afternoon,
check the downtown area,

972
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:31,878
markets, terminals
and other public areas.

973
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:43,132
At night, head to
bars, arcades, internet cafes,

974
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:44,878
karaokes, and others.

975
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:46,923
- Got that?
- Yes, sir!

976
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:56,668
Check out Jungho-dong as well.

977
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,080
That place closed down!

978
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:03,633
Damn it.

979
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:06,503
Shit.

980
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:12,673
Yes, I'm outside, so hurry up.

981
01:16:13,958 --> 01:16:14,958
Okay.

982
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:17,035
When is the bus coming?

983
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:26,250
Hey, kid. Come over here.

984
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:29,628
Take this then.

985
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:32,207
- I'm fine.
- Take it!

986
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:34,788
Okay. Thank you.

987
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:38,213
What about you though?

988
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:41,245
Study hard.

989
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:43,578
Hey, Jang Dong-su!

990
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:46,077
This isn't the time
to have a team dinner.

991
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:48,417
You can't keep them working
on an empty stomach.

992
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:50,328
O-seong will be here soon.

993
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:51,962
Didn't you bring an umbrella?

994
01:16:53,917 --> 01:16:54,957
There.

995
01:16:57,083 --> 01:16:58,543
Don't pretend to be a saint.

996
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:00,997
- You there!
- Yes?

997
01:17:01,167 --> 01:17:05,167
You can't receive items
from strangers like that.

998
01:17:05,917 --> 01:17:07,127
He's a thug!

999
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:08,998
You seem more like one
if you ask me.

1000
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,133
What?

1001
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,130
Don't laugh.

1002
01:17:14,292 --> 01:17:16,042
- Bye!
- Be careful, all right?

1003
01:17:16,208 --> 01:17:17,248
Thank you, sir.

1004
01:17:27,917 --> 01:17:31,577
- Our dicks may be many!
- But we have one heart!

1005
01:17:31,667 --> 01:17:35,077
- Until the end of time!
- We are one!

1006
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:37,205
- Thank you, Boss!
- Thank you, Boss!

1007
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:46,375
Hearing that
just made my dick tingle.

1008
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:47,628
What a fucking life.

1009
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:50,038
I can't believe
I'm in league with you all.

1010
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,920
Just get your job done.

1011
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:55,575
How is working for a salary the same

1012
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:58,037
as risking one's neck every day?

1013
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:02,497
You're still a fucking thug,
so you can have a drink.

1014
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:07,830
Just say thank you
when we give you good booze.

1015
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:10,537
I bring in these liquor,
so drink freely.

1016
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,875
You're involved
in every type of business.

1017
01:18:15,042 --> 01:18:16,252
Do you want to join us?

1018
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:18,673
Should I?

1019
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:21,003
You should.

1020
01:18:21,792 --> 01:18:25,332
You look the part
and will go far in a gang.

1021
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:27,245
Shut your face and have a drink.

1022
01:18:27,458 --> 01:18:28,918
Fine, pour me one.

1023
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:41,127
Hey, I wasn't turning away
to show respect or anything.

1024
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:46,875
Shit. My glass is so greasy.

1025
01:18:47,417 --> 01:18:50,207
Dal-ho! I feel shitty,
so sing me a song.

1026
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:54,083
Detective, did you know
that I was a boy band trainee?

1027
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:58,753
I'll sing a kick-ass song
for you all.

1028
01:18:59,375 --> 01:19:01,325
Today in Ansan,

1029
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:03,077
there was a murder...

1030
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:05,287
Wait, shut it. Turn that up.

1031
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:09,382
The high school victim
was on her way home

1032
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:11,248
when she was murdered.

1033
01:19:11,917 --> 01:19:15,627
Considering how young she is,

1034
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:19,212
the police are ruling out
revenge as a motive,

1035
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:21,673
and leaning towards
a sexual assault

1036
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:22,920
or a random attack

1037
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,960
as a potential motive...

1038
01:19:25,042 --> 01:19:26,082
O-seong.

1039
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:28,328
- Get the hell up!
- Yes, Boss!

1040
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:30,787
Search every unit
along the Bus 32 route.

1041
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:32,707
What did we miss?

1042
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:34,632
North of Dohwa-dong,
Southwest of Wolpo-dong.

1043
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:36,288
It's 1km from
the central square!

1044
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:37,458
Move it!

1045
01:19:37,542 --> 01:19:39,712
He's here somewhere,
so stay focused.

1046
01:19:39,792 --> 01:19:41,212
Come up from Daegyeong-dong.

1047
01:19:41,333 --> 01:19:42,833
We'll head down
from Songgeon-dong.

1048
01:19:42,917 --> 01:19:44,627
I'm searching
the central square!

1049
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:46,684
I think I found him,
It's the Dohwa motel district.

1050
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:49,418
Gather the boys
and check the cars too.

1051
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,830
Witness found
at the Dohwa motel district.

1052
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:53,457
Don't just search the motels

1053
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:56,132
and look into bars
and karaokes too.

1054
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:00,213
Excuse me, I'm a cop.

1055
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:03,128
He's staying in Room 304.

1056
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:13,672
What's going on?

1057
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,955
Tell me! Where is he?

1058
01:20:16,292 --> 01:20:17,922
He left a minute ago.

1059
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:19,328
Hey, I found him.

1060
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:21,998
Keep your eyes peeled.
We must get him first.

1061
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,963
Stay in your car
and see if he comes back.

1062
01:20:25,042 --> 01:20:27,752
Don't take any action
and let him walk back here.

1063
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:29,233
Don't tell me what to do,
you prick.

1064
01:20:31,292 --> 01:20:33,042
Cancel the search party

1065
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:34,665
and bring
just two more with you here.

1066
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:32,495
Stay still.

1067
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:03,248
Get down.

1068
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:25,147
Nice to meet you again,
little fucker.

1069
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,078
Fucking bastard.

1070
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:25,537
He drives like a maniac.

1071
01:23:34,958 --> 01:23:35,998
Hey!

1072
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,003
Stop the car, bastard!

1073
01:23:48,292 --> 01:23:49,332
Stop!

1074
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:52,248
Fuck.

1075
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:56,672
Stop the car!

1076
01:24:00,417 --> 01:24:01,457
Out of the way!

1077
01:24:14,708 --> 01:24:15,958
Damn them!

1078
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:52,578
You fucking asshole!

1079
01:24:53,583 --> 01:24:54,753
What was that?

1080
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:59,460
I was after that bastard!

1081
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:01,998
Over there.

1082
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:04,205
Son of a bitch!

1083
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:06,575
Fucking hell.

1084
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:14,833
You, go that way.

1085
01:25:15,292 --> 01:25:16,422
Asshole.

1086
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:05,383
Hey.

1087
01:26:06,042 --> 01:26:07,042
Hey!

1088
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:08,785
O-seong, no!

1089
01:26:09,417 --> 01:26:11,127
Stay with me, O-seong!

1090
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,207
- O-seong...
- Over there...

1091
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:15,423
That way!

1092
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:19,500
Hurry.

1093
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,040
Damn it.

1094
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:33,083
PANG PANG KARAOKE

1095
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:09,883
Where are you?

1096
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:11,498
This fucker is mine now.

1097
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:13,003
Where the fuck are you?

1098
01:28:20,792 --> 01:28:22,292
Track down Jang's location!

1099
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:24,633
He took the killer.
Find him fast!

1100
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:33,213
Fasten your seat belt.

1101
01:28:33,417 --> 01:28:35,457
You can't die before I kill you.

1102
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:38,463
- Stop at a rest stop.
- What?

1103
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:41,378
I'm starving.

1104
01:29:03,917 --> 01:29:04,917
This is fun.

1105
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:07,248
How are we different?

1106
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:13,503
That's pretty obvious,
don't you think?

1107
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:19,877
You shouldn't have stabbed me,
you puny jerk.

1108
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:23,628
Fucker.

1109
01:29:32,542 --> 01:29:33,632
Isn't it fun

1110
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:36,172
to play with a man's life?

1111
01:29:41,917 --> 01:29:44,327
He drove down to Cheonan.

1112
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:45,851
He was caught on camera
at the tollgate.

1113
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:47,035
Son of a bitch.

1114
01:29:50,917 --> 01:29:52,377
Do you know

1115
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:55,125
what the most
exhilarating part is?

1116
01:29:55,958 --> 01:29:58,038
Shut the fuck up.

1117
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:04,538
Do you like minced meat?

1118
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:09,333
I'm going to chop you up nicely

1119
01:30:10,375 --> 01:30:12,325
and spray your guts everywhere.

1120
01:30:13,167 --> 01:30:14,417
Motherfucker.

1121
01:30:16,167 --> 01:30:17,327
It's this moment.

1122
01:30:18,417 --> 01:30:22,417
When life and death
is in your hands.

1123
01:30:22,958 --> 01:30:24,418
Give it a go.

1124
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:26,880
Get on with it.

1125
01:30:27,667 --> 01:30:29,037
Kill me!

1126
01:30:31,417 --> 01:30:34,207
Do you even listen to yourself?

1127
01:30:35,917 --> 01:30:39,417
Did you think you'd live
after killing all those people?

1128
01:30:39,708 --> 01:30:41,538
That's why you should kill me.

1129
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:46,793
Try to stay still. I'd rather
not get your blood on me.

1130
01:31:12,208 --> 01:31:13,498
Shit.

1131
01:31:28,958 --> 01:31:30,378
Sorry, buddy,

1132
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:34,463
but I'm still a cop.

1133
01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:56,497
Nice to meet you, asshole.

1134
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:05,080
Kang Gyeong-ho, you're
under arrest for homicide.

1135
01:32:10,542 --> 01:32:12,422
Even a devil like you

1136
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:15,583
can retain an attorney

1137
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:19,333
and have the right
to remain silent.

1138
01:32:20,417 --> 01:32:23,127
Anything you say can be used

1139
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:26,745
against you in a court of law.

1140
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:30,918
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

1141
01:32:31,625 --> 01:32:33,455
one will be appointed to you
in courtesy of

1142
01:32:33,542 --> 01:32:36,752
this nation's taxpayers,
you asshole.

1143
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:55,455
- What the hell?
- Isn't it obvious?

1144
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:57,958
He's the serial killer.

1145
01:32:58,750 --> 01:32:59,790
Come here.

1146
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,130
What are you staring at?

1147
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:04,633
Go home!

1148
01:33:05,167 --> 01:33:06,497
Pack up!

1149
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:09,708
Come here, you psycho.

1150
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:13,575
- One moment, please!
- Make way!

1151
01:33:13,667 --> 01:33:15,537
- Let us through.
- Make way!

1152
01:33:15,625 --> 01:33:19,625
While investigating a kidnapping
case from September,

1153
01:33:19,792 --> 01:33:24,382
the Cheonan Police obtained
key evidence that led to Kang.

1154
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:27,878
He's currently being treated
for minor injuries,

1155
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:29,708
and he'll be investigated
by the police

1156
01:33:29,792 --> 01:33:33,502
before being handed over
to the prosecutor.

1157
01:33:33,792 --> 01:33:34,832
Let's move on.

1158
01:33:34,917 --> 01:33:39,077
Slot arcades are becoming
a social issue as of late.

1159
01:33:39,292 --> 01:33:41,712
The prosecution traced

1160
01:33:41,792 --> 01:33:44,252
how these arcades
are funding gangsters

1161
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:48,785
and is currently after
Zeus' gang leader Jang.

1162
01:33:49,333 --> 01:33:52,383
Jang who operates
several dozen slot arcades

1163
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:56,213
has made a fortune
by illegally modifying

1164
01:33:56,542 --> 01:33:58,792
and distributing
arcade machines.

1165
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:02,463
However, his current
whereabouts are unknown.

1166
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:06,945
This is all your doing, isn't it?

1167
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:09,665
No.

1168
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:12,710
You convinced the world
that he's the killer,

1169
01:34:13,542 --> 01:34:14,559
but now there's no evidence?

1170
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:17,213
Everything we have on him
is circumstantial.

1171
01:34:18,083 --> 01:34:19,923
Nothing directly ties him
to the murders.

1172
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,710
Even if I were the judge,

1173
01:34:21,792 --> 01:34:23,882
I wouldn't
give him the death penalty.

1174
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:29,918
- What's this?
- A knife.

1175
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:33,963
Yes, one you used
to murder all those people.

1176
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:38,075
What has been
your concept in life?

1177
01:34:38,958 --> 01:34:41,538
I just can't figure you out.
Do you know why?

1178
01:34:43,542 --> 01:34:45,042
It's because you're not human.

1179
01:34:45,458 --> 01:34:46,998
Then what's yours?

1180
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:51,960
A good cop? A model citizen?

1181
01:34:53,792 --> 01:34:55,002
You can't answer me, can you?

1182
01:34:55,792 --> 01:34:58,332
Who lives their life
by following a concept?

1183
01:34:59,417 --> 01:35:02,417
We live because we do.

1184
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,290
I wore gloves for my first kill,

1185
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:10,627
but I couldn't grip
anything properly with them on.

1186
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:13,037
Each stab should
always be clean.

1187
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:16,543
That feeling when it goes in?

1188
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:19,290
You can feel it
from the tips of your fingers.

1189
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,290
I guess
it's something like that.

1190
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:25,418
And these photos?

1191
01:35:37,417 --> 01:35:38,497
What is it?

1192
01:35:39,292 --> 01:35:41,082
The order's all wrong.

1193
01:35:44,125 --> 01:35:47,075
Besides, how can you say
that these are mine?

1194
01:35:49,125 --> 01:35:52,785
And even if I get
the death penalty,

1195
01:35:54,167 --> 01:35:55,577
you know I won't die.

1196
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:57,705
You little bastard.

1197
01:35:58,417 --> 01:35:59,827
- I'll kill you!
- Hey, stop!

1198
01:35:59,917 --> 01:36:00,957
Stop it!

1199
01:36:01,042 --> 01:36:03,712
- Come here. I'll kill you!
- Stop it!

1200
01:36:03,792 --> 01:36:05,292
Don't do it!

1201
01:36:08,625 --> 01:36:12,375
If you sentence me to death
without proper evidence,

1202
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,750
then that's murder.

1203
01:36:16,208 --> 01:36:20,878
The real devils are those who
commit crimes with kind faces.

1204
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:24,380
Think about it as creators
and enforcers of the law.

1205
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:26,748
Do you really have that right?

1206
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:29,825
If you're innocent,

1207
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:33,498
then I am too.

1208
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:45,588
Did you state that
you've never seen this knife?

1209
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,040
I did.

1210
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:53,075
This knife was used
to kill five victims

1211
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:55,463
between July
and September of 2005.

1212
01:36:55,542 --> 01:36:56,962
Objection, Your Honor.

1213
01:36:57,333 --> 01:36:59,463
The prosecution has not provided
any concrete link

1214
01:36:59,542 --> 01:37:02,882
between the knife
and my client during this trial.

1215
01:37:03,292 --> 01:37:05,672
It cannot be concluded
that the knife belonged to him.

1216
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:06,790
Yes, you're right.

1217
01:37:08,208 --> 01:37:10,458
This knife has nothing to do
with the defendant...

1218
01:37:11,167 --> 01:37:12,497
at least until now.

1219
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:18,035
Your Honor, we'd like
to request a sole survivor

1220
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:23,502
of Kang's vicious knife attack
as the state's next witness.

1221
01:37:24,125 --> 01:37:26,495
Witness, please take the stand.

1222
01:37:52,958 --> 01:37:55,668
You've got balls showing
your face in front of me.

1223
01:37:55,833 --> 01:37:57,463
Damn, you look terrible.

1224
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:05,790
We pay tax so that you can
arrest and kill those fuckers.

1225
01:38:05,875 --> 01:38:08,535
That's how the law is.

1226
01:38:09,292 --> 01:38:11,832
It arrests people
and punishes them,

1227
01:38:11,917 --> 01:38:15,167
but it also fucking protects us.
That's what it's there for.

1228
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:18,250
Shut the fuck up.
You should've let me kill him!

1229
01:38:22,667 --> 01:38:25,457
You're my last resort.

1230
01:38:26,167 --> 01:38:29,417
Let's use the law
to kill the bastard.

1231
01:38:31,958 --> 01:38:33,458
Stop your bullshit.

1232
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:42,790
Turn yourself in.

1233
01:38:43,042 --> 01:38:45,712
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

1234
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:52,170
- Did you kill Hur Sang-do?
- Yes, I did.

1235
01:38:53,917 --> 01:38:56,377
- Yes, I did.
- Bastard!

1236
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,830
Once this goes public,
you and I are both screwed.

1237
01:39:01,292 --> 01:39:04,632
Don't force me to use this.
All right?

1238
01:39:05,625 --> 01:39:06,865
Surrender and become a witness.

1239
01:39:07,417 --> 01:39:08,747
You're the only witness.

1240
01:39:09,042 --> 01:39:11,132
With you on the witness stand,

1241
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:12,998
I can link him
to all the murders!

1242
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:15,248
I'd rather...

1243
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:17,790
just get screwed together.

1244
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:22,383
I swear that the evidence that
I shall give shall be the truth,

1245
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:25,995
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help me God.

1246
01:39:30,375 --> 01:39:31,415
Your Honor.

1247
01:39:31,792 --> 01:39:34,042
The prosecution's witness is
a wanted head of a gang

1248
01:39:34,125 --> 01:39:35,785
who is accused
of several serious crimes

1249
01:39:35,875 --> 01:39:38,875
including illegal gambling
as well as embezzlement.

1250
01:39:38,958 --> 01:39:41,418
Nothing in the law states that

1251
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:44,250
a criminal suspect
can't testify in another case.

1252
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:45,583
I accept.

1253
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:47,165
Witness,

1254
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:52,080
how can you verify that you
were stabbed by the defendant?

1255
01:40:00,542 --> 01:40:02,922
Guys like me
who get stabbed regularly

1256
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:06,920
don't forget our attackers
until the day we die.

1257
01:40:08,542 --> 01:40:10,502
That bastard was the one.

1258
01:40:11,917 --> 01:40:12,957
Here.

1259
01:40:13,792 --> 01:40:19,082
I had this sketch composited
right after I was stabbed.

1260
01:40:22,417 --> 01:40:24,377
Your Honor,
that is simply a drawing

1261
01:40:24,458 --> 01:40:27,168
one drew in
his or her free time.

1262
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:29,309
It has no legal ground and
cannot be proved scientifically

1263
01:40:29,333 --> 01:40:31,423
and therefore cannot be
admitted as evidence.

1264
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:32,580
Your Honor,

1265
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:36,833
this is the witness'
medical record from the hospital

1266
01:40:37,458 --> 01:40:39,458
stating his condition
immediately after the attack.

1267
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:41,495
The witness is a gang leader.

1268
01:40:41,667 --> 01:40:44,537
Getting stabbed
is normal for him.

1269
01:40:44,875 --> 01:40:46,785
How can that be evidence

1270
01:40:46,875 --> 01:40:48,643
when he could've been
stabbed by someone else?

1271
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:50,877
He's violating
the defendant's rights

1272
01:40:50,958 --> 01:40:52,578
and is mocking this court!

1273
01:40:52,667 --> 01:40:54,497
Damn, that fucker talks a lot.

1274
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,790
- Hey, Mr. Attorney.
- Witness!

1275
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,500
Would you be able to say that

1276
01:40:59,583 --> 01:41:01,003
if your family
was killed by him?

1277
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:04,923
The defendant's right?
Nutjobs don't deserve that.

1278
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:08,383
That fucker
killed people for fun.

1279
01:41:09,083 --> 01:41:12,333
I'm not decent myself,
but he doesn't deserve to live.

1280
01:41:13,208 --> 01:41:14,208
Evidence?

1281
01:41:15,292 --> 01:41:16,582
I'll show you the evidence.

1282
01:41:27,458 --> 01:41:31,998
That night, he forced me out
of my car by crashing into it.

1283
01:41:32,208 --> 01:41:35,128
Then he stabbed me twice
in my side.

1284
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:38,708
During the struggle,
he stabbed me in the chest.

1285
01:41:38,792 --> 01:41:42,922
I also cut my fingers trying
to grab his knife. See?

1286
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:48,418
If I were the average man,
I'd be dead too.

1287
01:41:50,167 --> 01:41:52,247
You should have him
take his clothes off too.

1288
01:41:52,625 --> 01:41:55,915
I stabbed his left chest,
so there will be a wound.

1289
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:06,630
Also check his hands.
You'll find a lot of scars.

1290
01:42:06,875 --> 01:42:08,075
Stabbing is a tricky job,

1291
01:42:08,167 --> 01:42:10,127
so you cut yourself
here and there.

1292
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:11,915
Your nails get broken too.

1293
01:42:13,792 --> 01:42:15,042
And lastly,

1294
01:42:19,042 --> 01:42:20,712
that fucker wrote this.

1295
01:42:23,208 --> 01:42:25,248
Analyze his handwriting,
and you'll get a match.

1296
01:42:26,583 --> 01:42:28,833
For reference,
Hur Sang-do was my friend.

1297
01:42:28,917 --> 01:42:31,417
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE

1298
01:42:32,583 --> 01:42:35,333
Hur and his lieutenant
are both dead.

1299
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:37,377
I feel bad for O-seong,

1300
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:39,875
but if Kang spills everything,

1301
01:42:40,208 --> 01:42:42,078
we can blame O-seong for it.

1302
01:42:44,167 --> 01:42:46,287
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE
BY SOMEONE ELSE

1303
01:42:48,542 --> 01:42:51,002
HUR WAS KILLED WITH MY KNIFE

1304
01:42:51,208 --> 01:42:55,748
Considering the defendant's
extremely violent tendencies,

1305
01:42:56,583 --> 01:42:59,883
wanton disregard for human life,

1306
01:43:00,625 --> 01:43:02,665
and the pain
suffered by the victims,

1307
01:43:03,417 --> 01:43:09,417
his sentence was decided
by weighing all the offenses.

1308
01:43:10,167 --> 01:43:13,037
Ergo, defendant Kang Gyeong-ho

1309
01:43:15,375 --> 01:43:16,665
is sentenced to death.

1310
01:43:23,167 --> 01:43:24,747
61ST POLICE APPRECIATION DAY

1311
01:43:26,083 --> 01:43:27,083
Thank you, sir!

1312
01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:28,498
About-face!

1313
01:43:30,375 --> 01:43:31,495
Salute!

1314
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:52,745
Boss is coming! Let's greet him!

1315
01:43:53,792 --> 01:43:55,632
- Good afternoon, Boss!
- Good afternoon, Boss!

1316
01:44:56,042 --> 01:44:58,252
- Only on one condition.
- Which is what?

1317
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:01,670
Have me locked up
in the same prison.

1318
01:45:28,292 --> 01:45:30,632
Three men played the game
with their necks on the line.

1319
01:45:30,917 --> 01:45:32,197
It should damn well be finished.

1320
01:45:51,542 --> 01:45:54,502
DON LEE aka MA DONG SEOK

1321
01:45:57,292 --> 01:45:59,042
KIM MOO YUL

1322
01:46:01,292 --> 01:46:03,672
