1
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,630
You've got too
much wood in there.

2
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,384
But the more wood, the bigger the fire.

3
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,428
It needs to breathe.

4
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,513
- Take off that big log.

Ah.

6
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,609
You know your fires.

7
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,954
Someone built your fires for you growing up?

8
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,749
It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach.

9
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,126
And there were servants, of course.

10
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,755
I knew you were highborn.

11
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,429
Oh, I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

12
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:06,812
Buried treasure.
Thousands of years old. I think.

13
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:10,191
What does it do?

14
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:13,736
I'm not sure that it does anything.

15
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,030
It's beautiful, though, isn't it?

(BABY GURGLING)

17
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,456
How much longer?

18
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:29,043
Not so far. A few more days.

19
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,214
Is the Wall as big as they say?

20
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,632
Bigger.

21
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:39,136
So big you can't even see the top sometimes.

22
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,055
It's hidden in clouds.

23
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,266
You're playing with me.

24
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,476
I'm not.

25
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:51,190
It's 700 feet high, all made of ice.

26
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,567
On a warm day you can see it weeping.

27
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,658
Castle Black is nice enough.

28
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:06,747
They keep a fire burning in the long
hall day and night.

29

And Hobb makes venison stew with onions.

30

Very tasty.

31
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:18,467
Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing.

32
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,344
Dareon sings best.

33
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,431
- Do you sing?
- No.

34
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:26,142
No, no, no. (CHUCKLES) Not very well.

35

Sing me a song.

36

Oh, all right. Let's see.

The Father's face is stern and strong

40
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:50,624
He sits and judges right from wrong

41
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,836
He weighs our lives, the short and long

42
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,214
And loves the little children

43

The Mother gives the gift of life

And watches over every wife

And she loves her little children

47

That's not how you skin a rabbit.

48
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,323
I know how to skin a rabbit.

49
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,241
Not by the looks of it.

50
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,134
OSHA: You grow up north of the Wall,

51
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,845
you learn the proper way to handle game.

52
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,097
I didn't see any game before I got here.

53
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,476
If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen.

54
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:52,436
Well, I made this bow myself.

55
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,688
Guess you don't learn
how to do that north of the Wall.

56
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,774
You learn how to use your fists.

57
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,776
Oh, you're gonna punch the rabbits to death?

58
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,319
I had someone else in mind.

59
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,695
Well, someone else is sitting right here.

60
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,490
You're both very good at skinning rabbits.

61
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,284
Some of us are just a little better.

62
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,702
Well, some of us would say thank you

when someone else
hunts down their breakfast for them.

64

Or don't they teach you
to say thank you north of the Wall?

65
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,961
You've got
a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.

Just stop it.

Lady Reed here's got a stick so far up her ass,

70
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,053
it's a wonder her feet touch the ground.

71
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,765
You've been nasty
to her every day. Of course she's nasty back.

72
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,559
Me? It's my fault?

73
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,310
First time I met her,
she put a knife to my throat.

First time I met you, you held a knife at me.

You saw him? At Castle Black?

He was on the wrong side of the Wall,

209

It's a terrible thing to say,

213

but by the time I came
to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord.

214

I decided that He, that all the Gods,

215

were stories we
told the children to make them behave.

00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,460
(BOY LAUGHS)

330
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,421
Terrible guess.

331
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,423
(GROANS)

332
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:09,801
(GROANING)

333
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,264
Now, where?

334
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,018
Last Hearth.

335
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,562
(LAUGHS) Do I look like
a fucking Umber to you?

336
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,982
(SCREAMS IN PAIN)

337
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,110
Karhold!

338
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,785
Karhold?

339
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,832
How did you know that?

340
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,253
Did you see any banners
flying when we came in?

341
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:46,546
No.

342
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,464
It was just a guess.

343
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,635
Very good, Lord Theon.

344
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,472
And who am I?

345
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,350
Torrhen Karstark.

346
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,852
He's dead.

347
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,689
Strangled by the Kingslayer.

348
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,359
He was your brother.

349
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:17,326
Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.

350
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:27,920
You swore to tell me if I...

351
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,255
You're right.

352
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:33,926
Lord Rickard Karstark
is Robb Stark's bannerman.

353
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,971
I betrayed Robb.

354
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,349
That's why you're torturing me.

355
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,771
Yes.

356
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,525
You win.

357
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:03,998
Of course, you forgot to ask one question.

358
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,667
You forgot to ask if I'm a liar.

359
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,506
(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

360
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:14,884
I'm afraid I am.

361
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,512
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

362
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,973
Everything I told you is a lie.

363
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:26,354
This isn't happening to you for a reason.

364
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:28,606
But, well, one reason...

365
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,149
I enjoy it.

366
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:33,402
THEON: Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!

367
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,238
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

368
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,285
I win.

369
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,038
ROBB: Thank you for riding here so quickly.

370
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,499
I know travel isn't easy in these times.

371
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:49,252
The roads are crawling
with cutthroats and bandits.

372
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,129
When the King of
the North summons us, we come.

373
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:55,925
LOTHAR: Our father
has instructed us to tell you that his alliance

374
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,846
with the North can continue
if his terms are met.

375
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,807
Lord Frey requires a formal apology

376
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,061
for your violation of your sacred oath
to marry one of his daughters.

377
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,022
Of course.
He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.

378
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,567
As restitution for this betrayal,

379
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,778
he demands Harrenhal
and all its attendant lands.

380
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:17,196
I don't think that's...

381
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,656
We are fighting for the North.

382
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,326
Harrenhal is not in the North.

383
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:27,957
It is his once the war is over and we have no
further strategic need for it.

384
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,586
And there's something else.

385
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:35,047
We will do whatever
we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.

386
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:38,551
Not what, whom.

387
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:41,971
What?

388
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:47,977
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

389
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,061
Uh, no.

390
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:54,150
Our father requires Lord Edmure to
wed one of his daughters. Roslin.

391
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,318
How old is she?

392
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:56,485
Nineteen.

393
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:57,862
Could I see her first?

394
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,322
You want to count her teeth?

395
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,991
We depart for the Twins in the morning.

396
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:04,076
We need an answer before we leave,

397
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,786
and a wedding not more
than a fortnight thereafter

398
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,496
or this alliance is at an end.

399
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:10,499
Your father does
realize we're in the middle of a war?

400
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,960
Father is old.

401
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:17,757
It will put his heart at peace if he could see
her wed to a good husband.

402
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:22,428
And his recent experience
has made him wary of long engagements.

403
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,805
He has every right to be.

404
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,017
Please excuse us while we discuss it.

405
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,110
(DOOR OPENING)

406
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:48,287
Why should I let
that old ferret choose my bride for me?

407
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:51,248
At the very least,
I should be offered the same choice you were.

408
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:52,875
I'm his liege lord.

409
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:55,127
ROBB: He's a proud man
and we've wounded him.

410
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,547
EDMURE:
I didn't wound him. My answer is no.

411
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:07,598
Listen to me and listen very carefully. You...

412
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,226
The laws of gods and men are very clear.

413
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:12,979
No man can compel another man to marry.

414
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,314
The laws of my fist
are about to compel your teeth.

415
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:17,817
It's all right. You heard him.

416
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:21,737
If you refuse,
our alliance with the Freys is dead.

417
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,574
He's wanted me for
one of his daughters since I was 12.

418
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,451
He's not gonna stop wanting it now.

419
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,496
When I say no, he will come back

420
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,623
and offer me a daughter of my choosing.

421
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,333
You're willing to risk our freedom

422
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,127
and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?

423
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,796
I have a war to fight.

424
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,383
We can't win it without them.
I have no time to haggle.

425
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,594
You said you wanted
to make amends for the Stone Mill.

426
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:49,265
You recall that heroic engagement?

427
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:56,230
I had something less permanent in mind.

428
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:00,443
I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war.

429
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:07,616
If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.

430
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:14,623
I'll marry her.

431
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:20,004
You're paying
for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right.

432
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,423
I'll remember it.

433
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:32,433
BOLTON: I see my men have finally found
you something appropriate to wear.

434
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,685
BRIENNE: Yes. Most kind of them.

435
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,439
You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.

436
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,858
I am acting on Lady Stark's orders

437
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,319
to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.

438
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:47,031
When King Robb left
Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner.

439
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:50,493
If she wasn't his mother,
he'd have hanged her for treason.

440
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,086
I should send you back to Robb Stark.

441
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,421
You should.

442
00:32:02,505 --> 00:32:06,675
But instead,
you're sitting here, watching me fail at dinner.

443
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,637
Why might that be?

444
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,682
Wars cost money.
Many people would pay a great deal for you.

445
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,185
We both know who would pay the most.

446
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:21,023
Or make you pay the most
if he found out you had captured me

447
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,359
and sent me back up north
for a summary execution.

448
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,027
You're right.

449
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:29,615
Perhaps the safest thing
to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.

450
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,991
JAIME: It would be,

451
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,829
if you honestly believed
my father would never find out about it.

452
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:37,164
King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.

453
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,542
He doesn't have time for anything else.

454
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,418
He'll make time for you.

455
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,633
As soon as you're well enough to travel,

456
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,802
I will allow you to go to King's Landing

457
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:53,389
as restitution
for the mistakes my soldiers made.

458
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:56,767
And you will swear to
tell your father the truth,

459
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:59,353
that I had nothing to do with your maiming.

460
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,528
Shall we drink on it?

461
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:08,863
I don't partake.

462
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,410
You do understand
how suspicious that is to ordinary people?

463
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:17,454
Very well.

464
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:23,419
My lady, may our journey
continue without further incident.

465
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:24,920
Oh, she won't be going with you.

466
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:27,673
I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to...

467
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:30,259
BOLTON: You are charged
with abetting treason.

468
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,720
I'm afraid I must insist.

469
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,264
You're in no place to insist on anything.

470
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:38,392
I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson

471
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,103
about overplaying your position.

472
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,151
- OLENNA: Impossible.
- Why?

473
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,028
My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.

474
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:53,032
The most desirable bachelor
in all seven kingdoms.

475
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,576
- Your daughter...
- Is rich,

476
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:59,038
the most beautiful woman
in all seven kingdoms,

477
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,458
and the mother of the King.

478
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,584
Old.

479
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:05,669
Old?

480
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,172
Old.

481
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:11,258
I'm something of an expert on the subject.

482
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,802
Her change will be upon her before long.

483
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:17,431
I'll spare you the details
of what will happen then.

484
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,100
You may have a stomach
for bloodshed and slaughter,

485
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:22,311
but this is another matter entirely.

486
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:26,106
The years punish us as well,
I promise you that.

487
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:32,571
My stomach remains quite strong, however.

488
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,658
The only thing that might turn it are details

489
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,327
of your grandson's nocturnal activities.

490
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:40,537
Do you deny them?

491
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:41,705
Oh, not at all.

492
00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:43,666
A sword-swallower through and through.

493
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:47,294
A boy with his affliction
should be grateful for the opportunity

494
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:50,005
to marry
the most beautiful woman in the Kingdoms

495
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,549
and remove the stain from his name.

496
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:55,719
Did you grow up
with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?

497
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:59,556
Sons of your
father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?

498
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:01,517
Of course.

499
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,020
And you never...

500
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:07,064
No.

501
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,818
Not once? Not in any way?

502
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:12,903
Never.

503
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,656
I congratulate you upon your restraint.

504
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,909
But it's natural,
boys having a go beneath the sheets.

505
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:24,331
Perhaps Highgarden
has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.

506
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:25,749
I wouldn't say that.

507
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,419
True, we don't tie ourselves in knots

508
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,005
over a discreet bit of buggery, but

509
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,883
brothers and sisters...

510
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:41,056
Where I come from,
that stain would be very difficult to wash out.

511
00:35:41,432 --> 00:35:43,642
I will not breathe further life

512
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,978
into a malicious lie by discussing it.

513
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,648
Lie or not,

514
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:52,985
you must admit many people
find it quite convincing.

515
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,446
Convincing enough
to put swords in their hands

516
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,741
and send them off
to kill Lannisters and Tyrells,

517
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,576
thanks to our new affiliation.

518
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,703
I don't care what people believe.

519
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:04,580
And neither do you.

520
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:05,956
(CHUCKLES)

521
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:09,168
As an authority on myself, I must disagree.

522
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,796
Now, if the rumors about
my children were true,

523
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,758
then Joffrey is no king at all,

524
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:19,845
and House Tyrell
is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.

525
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:23,724
And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children,

526
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:28,687
we're throwing another
prized flower into the dirt.

527
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:31,440
It is a chance we simply cannot take.

528
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:34,443
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable?

529
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:36,653
All right.

530
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:39,365
I'll remove it for you.

531
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,327
If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei,

532
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:46,288
I will name him to the Kingsguard.

533
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:49,625
I'm sure you're familiar
with the Kingsguard vows.

534
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,503
He will never marry.
He will never have children.

535
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:54,254
Ah.

536
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,547
The Tyrell name will fade.

537
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,718
And Highgarden will
go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.

538
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:04,098
You would have your grandson protected
by someone who disgusts you?

539
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:07,893
I would have my grandson
protected by a skilled warrior

540
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:11,021
who takes his vows seriously.

541
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,690
So, shall I draw up the order?

542
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,653
Or do you consent to this match?

543
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:28,539
It's a rare enough thing,
a man who lives up to his reputation.

It's more of a brooch, really.

Though I suppose a brooch
is a sort of pin, so...

I'm very happy about...

Yes. I am as well.

Yes, me, too. Definitely.

I've dreamed of
a large wedding since I was young.

577
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:48,864
The guests, the food, the tournaments.

578
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,536
And the bride, of course.

(CHUCKLES)

580
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,668
The most beautiful bride in the world

581
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:05,756
in a beautiful gown of
gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves.

582
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,510
Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?

583
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,430
No. I had never left Winterfell

584
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,515
before I came to King's Landing.

585
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,645
But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it.

586
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,689
And to leave this place.

587
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,651
It's terrible, isn't it?

588
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,614
The most terrible place there is.

589
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:43,460
TYRION: I don't suppose
there's anything we can do about this.

590
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,337
We can have them both killed.

591
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,508
It's hard to say which of the four of us

592
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,468
is getting the worst of this arrangement.

593
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,471
Probably Sansa.

594
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:59,309
Though Loras will certainly come to
know a deep and singular misery.

595
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:01,311
Father doesn't discriminate.

596
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:05,148
We're all being shipped off to hell together.

597
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,983
On a boat you built.

598
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,986
The Tyrells were plotting
to undermine our family.

599
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,531
I did what I did to protect our family.

600
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,032
I'm your family.

601
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:18,120
A member of your family who has actively

602
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:20,622
contributed to that family's survival.

603
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,127
Whether or not you
or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.

604
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:26,962
I do admit it.

605
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,799
If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire,

606
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,927
Stannis would
have sacked the city before Father got here.

607
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:37,222
Our heads would still be
rotting on the city gate.

608
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:41,351
Trying to have me killed
is an odd way of saying thank you.

609
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,814
There are two people in King's Landing

610
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,983
who can give an order to a Kingsguard.

611
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,819
Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon

612
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,697
to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?

613
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,667
The impulse I understand.

614
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,963
He hates me because I'm the only one

615
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,716
who tells him what he really is.

616
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:22,350
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead. But his stupidity?

617
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:26,354
He could have had me
poisoned and no one would have known.

618
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:29,858
But the King orders a Kingsguard

619
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:33,779
to murder the Hand
of the King in full view of his own army.

620
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:35,322
The boy's an idiot.

621
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:36,907
What do you want me to say?

622
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,785
I want you to tell me
if my life is still in danger.

623
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:41,369
Probably.

624
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:45,499
But not from Joffrey.
He won't do anything now Father's here.

625
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:51,463
Seven kingdoms united in fear
of Tywin Lannister.

626
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:53,715
Not the Tyrells.

627
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,635
Soon they won't need to be afraid of him.

628
00:43:56,718 --> 00:44:00,138
Joffrey will
belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore,

629
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:03,016
and so will his children and their children.

630
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,101
History will be taken from our hands.

631
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:09,314
You may escape, at least.

632
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,525
Once Jaime gets back,

633
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:15,737
Ser Loras may come down with a terrible
case of sword through bowels.

634
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,449
When Jaime gets back, yes.

635
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:22,577
But when will that be?
He's out there somewhere.

636
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:28,458
Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.

637
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,672
Who's going to tell her?

638
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,259
Do you think people will like it?

639
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,261
SHAE: I don't think they will even notice it.

640
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:42,264
You're right. It's not my wedding.

641
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,350
Anyway, from what I can tell,

642
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,310
the dressmakers in Highgarden will be

643
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,312
far superior to the ones in King's Landing.

644
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,524
They'd never make me
anything as dull as this for my wedding.

645
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:56,570
Loras likes green and gold brocade.

646
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:58,446
I'm sure he does.

647
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:01,950
Will they let me invite my family?

648
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:04,286
They haven't asked my opinion.

649
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,204
But do you think they will?

650
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,415
No.

651
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:16,464
Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.

652
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:17,716
Should I...

653
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:19,718
I beg your pardon, my lady.

654
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:24,139
Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.
I was trying on a gown for Joffrey's wedding.

655
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:29,769
Yes, it should be quite a wedding.

656
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,481
I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.

657
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:34,649
Of course.

658
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,277
Alone, if I may.

659
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,112
Why do you need to speak to her alone?

660
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,947
Shae.

661
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:42,866
Please excuse her. She's not from here.

662
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:47,662
But I trust her,
even though she tells me not to.

663
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:53,376
Sometimes we think
we want to hear something,

664
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:56,338
and it's only afterwards, when it's too late,

665
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,632
that we realize we wished we'd heard it

666
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,967
under entirely different circumstances.

667
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:02,886
It's all right, really.

668
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,225
How to begin?

669
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:11,853
(DOOR CLOSES)

670
00:46:11,937 --> 00:46:13,313
TYRION: It's... This...

671
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:17,067
This... This is awkward.

672
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,030
VARYS: A thousand blades

673
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,950
taken from the hands
of Aegon's fallen enemies,

674
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:28,328
forged in the fiery breath
of Balerion the Dread.

675
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,205
There aren't 1,000 blades.

676
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:33,792
There aren't even 200.

677
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,293
I've counted.

678
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:37,629
VARYS: (SCOFFS) I'm sure you have.

679
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,215
Ugly old thing.

680
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:43,885
LITTLEFINGER: Yet it has a certain appeal.

681
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:46,304
The Lysa Arryn of chairs.

682
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:49,349
Shame you had to settle
for your second choice.

683
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,476
Early days, my friend.

684
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,020
It is flattering, really,

685
00:46:56,064 --> 00:47:00,986
you feeling such dread
at the prospect of me getting what I want.

686
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:05,407
Thwarting you has never
been my primary ambition, I promise you.

687
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,283
Although who doesn't like to see

688
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:09,035
their friends fail now and then?

689
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,453
You're so right.

690
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,415
For instance, when I thwarted your plan

691
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:16,167
to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.

692
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:18,128
If I'm going to be honest,

693
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:22,841
I did feel an unmistakable
sense of enjoyment there.

694
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:26,511
But your confidant,

695
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:30,056
the one who fed
you information about my plans,

696
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,684
the one you swore to protect...

697
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,229
You didn't bring her any enjoyment.

698
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:39,774
And she didn't bring me any enjoyment.

699
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:44,195
She was a bad investment on my part.

700
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:51,619
Luckily, I have a friend
who wanted to try something new.

701
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,247
Something daring.

702
00:47:55,623 --> 00:48:02,172
And he was so grateful
to me for providing this fresh experience.

703
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:09,179
I did what I did for the good of the realm.

704
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:11,097
The realm?

705
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,100
Do you know what the realm is?

706
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:19,314
It's the 1,000 blades of Aegon's enemies.

707
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:24,569
A story we agree
to tell each other over and over,

708
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,654
till we forget that it's a lie.

709
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:31,409
But what do we have left
once we abandon the lie?

710
00:48:31,493 --> 00:48:35,914
Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.

711
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:38,666
Chaos isn't a pit.

712
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,836
Chaos is a ladder.

713
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:48,927
Many who try to climb it fail
and never get to try again.

714
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,472
The fall breaks them.

715
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:06,820
And some are given
a chance to climb, but they refuse.

716
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:14,661
They cling to the realm or the Gods or love.

717
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,038
Illusions.

718
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,917
Only the ladder is real.

719
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:24,879
The climb is all there is.
