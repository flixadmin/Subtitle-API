819
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,685
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...

820
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:13,817
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

821
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,821

824

TASERFACE: I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.

825
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,875
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.

826

kill the fox herself.

I assure you...

829
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,847
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...

830
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,849
or a talking woodland beast.

831
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,060
I want 10% of the take...

832
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,522
and a couple more things.

833

is gonna execute the captain?

00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,744
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.

837
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:08,372

It's the best ship we got.

We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

840
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,954
What are you gonna do with your share?

841
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,170
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me

842
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,092
battle one another in training.

843
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,175
Every time my sister prevailed...

844
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:26,683
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...

845
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,514
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

846
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:32,438
But she won...

847
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:37,444
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.

848
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,405
So after I murder my sister...

849
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,690
I will buy a warship

850
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,776
with every conceivable
instrument of death.

851
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:48,571
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...

852
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,205
piece by piece...

853
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:53,744
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

854
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:57,039
I know every single day.

855
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:00,257
Yeah.

856
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,468
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.

857
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,216
Or a nice hat.

858
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,099
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"

859
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,273
Anyways, happy trails.

860
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:26,534
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.

861
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,780
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.

Peter...

863
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,908
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.

864
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,451
But you left...

866
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,122

867
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,713
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

868
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,049

to my planet...

Why did you send Yondu?

to come and fetch me?

873

874
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,475
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...

875
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,485

You can't imagine what that's like!

876
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:04,022
I know exactly what that feels like!

877
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,940
I had to watch her die!

878

Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

879

I've made many mistakes, Peter.

880
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,170
But you're not one of them.

881
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:25,718

I think I shall call him...

1949
02:12:01,330 --> 02:12:02,695
Adam.

1950
02:12:03,999 --> 02:12:05,535
(THE SNEEPERS
FT. DAVID HASSELHOFF'S

"GUARDIANS INFERNO" PLAYING)

1952
02:14:04,703 --> 02:14:06,159
<i>Ugh, dude.</i>

1953
02:14:07,122 --> 02:14:08,704
Seriously?

1954
02:14:08,874 --> 02:14:10,785
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.

1955
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:12,371
I am Groot.

1956
02:14:12,545 --> 02:14:14,456
I am not boring. You're boring.

1957
02:14:14,630 --> 02:14:15,461
You know what's boring?

1958
02:14:15,631 --> 02:14:18,794
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.

1959
02:14:18,968 --> 02:14:22,552
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!

1960
02:14:23,097 --> 02:14:24,303
I'm not boring!

1961
02:14:24,473 --> 02:14:25,463
I am Groot.

1962
02:14:27,142 --> 02:14:29,634
And now I know how Yondu felt.

HASSELHOFF:
In these times of hardship...

1964
02:15:08,809 --> 02:15:10,846
just remember...

1965
02:15:11,478 --> 02:15:15,517
We. Are. Groot.

1966
02:15:18,819 --> 02:15:19,980
Hey, fellas.

1967
02:15:20,154 --> 02:15:21,815
Wait, where are you going?

1968
02:15:21,989 --> 02:15:24,356
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1969
02:15:24,533 --> 02:15:26,194
How will I get out of here?

1970
02:15:26,368 --> 02:15:27,654
Hey! Aw, gee...

1971
02:15:27,745 --> 02:15:30,487
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1972
02:15:30,664 --> 02:15:31,870
AW, guys.

1973
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:34,373
Oh, gee...
