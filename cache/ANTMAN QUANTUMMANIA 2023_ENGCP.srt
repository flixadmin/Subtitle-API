- Hey.
- Oh...

4
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,434

people ask me the same thing.</i>

12

the ride take you?"</i>

<i>If I knew that,
it wouldn't be a ride.</i>

<i>- For everyone.</i>

20

You're too much.

22

No, no, no.

23

Your money's no good here.

24
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,125
Aw. Are we still talking
about that?

25
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,208
Yes, of course.

26
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,667
Rubin, you are the best.

Thank you, Spider-Man.

28
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,083
<i>So, let's make time for
the stuff that really matters.</i>

29
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,458
<i>Like friends.</i>

30
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,250
<i>Friends you didn't
even know you had.</i>

31

<i>Remember the people
who got you here.</i>

32
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,020
<i>You couldn't have done it
without them.</i>

33
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,750
<i>Hey, I'm just a guy who
got fired from Baskin-Robbins.</i>

34

<i>Sometimes you just get lucky.</i>

35
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,458
<i>I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.</i>

36

<i>I think you know who she is.</i>

37
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,250
<i>She's taken back
her dad's company.</i>

38

<i>Now she's using the Pym Particle</i>

39

40

<i>A lot of people say they want
to save the world,</i>

41

she saves it every day.</i>

42

Come on.

Hey. Is she okay?
Have you heard anything?

Not yet. No. Oh.

76
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,667
Hi, Hope.
Hey, Dad.

77
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,625
Cassie. What happened?

78
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:57,792
Sign here.

79
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,792
Oh, you know, just jail stuff.

80
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,583
Give it back.

- I know it was you.

Are you sure?

83
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,653
I mean, it was
kind of hard to see

84
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,267
through all that tear gas
you fired into the park

85

full of peaceful protestors.

Where is it?

87
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,999
I'm sorry. This must be
really embarrassing for you.

Oh!

89
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:18,917
I did find this though.

90
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,792
You shrank a cop car?

91
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,041
What were you thinking?

92
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,810
What was I supposed to do?
Look the other way?

93
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,184
They were clearing out
a homeless camp

94
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,017
- in the middle of the night.
- No, I'm not saying that...

95
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,101
And where do
they expect them to go?

96
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,976
It's not their fault that they
lost their homes in the Blip.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I... I know that.

98
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,309
No one can even
afford rent right now,

99
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,125
unless you're
some trust-fund asshole.

100
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,518
I'm not telling you what to do.

101
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:41,976
- I'm just saying...
- Telling her what to do.

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,333
Telling me exactly what to do.

103
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,041
No, you do what you want.

104
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm suggesting
another way to do it.

105
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,083
Okay.

106
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,542
You know, I promised your mom

107
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,851
that you would
only use this stuff

108
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,166
when one of us was around.

109
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,417
It's really dangerous tech.

110
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,834
I know it's dangerous.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,267
What if the cops
took it from you? Huh?

112
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,333
What if you lost it?

113
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,417
I didn't lose the suit.

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,834
You have a suit?
Wait, you have a suit?

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,518
I know how to
take care of myself, okay?

116
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,417
Trust me.
I'm pretty good at it by now.

117
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,625
Ouch.

118
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,476
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I know.

119
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,180
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay. It's all right.

120
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,375
I get it.

121
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:16,083
I just think you should get
to have a normal life.

122
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,125
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee

123
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,083
tried to kill me in my room
when I was six.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,709
I've never had a normal life.

125
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,500

00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:41,917
Was there a last time?

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,917
I mean, last time barely counts.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I didn't know that.

166
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,166
Why didn't you call me?

167
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,530
'Cause I knew
you'd be like this.

168
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,500
I would've just broken you out
with ants.

169
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,142
All right, you know what?
Family meeting.

170
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,226
Can we have a family meeting?

171
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,370
Isn't that what we're doing?

172
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,458
Yeah, I mean about this.

173
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,500
About everybody
being so fine with this.

174
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,500
Look, you wanna help.
I get it.

175
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,291
I do, Cassie. I really do.

176
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,768
But I don't want you
wasting your life.

177
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,917
At least I'm still trying
to do something with mine.

178
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,083
I literally saved the world.

179
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,208
Oh, did you?

180
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,011
Well, yeah, you never
mentioned that before.

181
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,792
Hey, everybody,
Scott saved the world.

182
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,125
How was that for you, Scott?

183
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,583
You should write a book
about it.

184
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,166
Ha ha. Hilarious.

185
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,208
Yeah, you're welcome
for all not being dust.

186
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,834
And what do you do now?

187
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:27,000
Sign books?

188
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,011
Aren't you the guy
who broke into VistaCorp?

189
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,017
Aren't you the guy who flew
all the way to Germany

190
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,000
just to fight Captain America
at the airport?

191
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,333
Fight with Captain America
at the airport.

192
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,083
Wouldn't fight Captain America.

193
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,250
Not insane.

194
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:42,542
People still need help, Dad.

195
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,375
At least we're trying
to do something that matters.

196
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:50,917
Who's "we"?

197
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,041
Hmm?
What are you three up to?

198
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,125
Science.

199
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,500
With ants.

200
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,667
Ant science.

201
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,208
I don't believe you.

202
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,417
Let's just show him.

203
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,917
Whoa.
What are they building?

204
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,208
Are you doing this?

205
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,583
Actually, no,
they built their own tech.

206
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,208
Pretty smart ants.

207
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,125
Okay, so when you were all,

208
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,291
like, gone those five years,
I had a lot of time.

209
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,792
And I started reading
Grandpa Hank's old journals,

210
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,000
and I got really into
the Quantum Realm and...

211
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,792
Whoa. The Quantum Realm?

212
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,000
I know we all
have a history there,

213
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,142
and I didn't want
to freak anyone out,

214
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,446
but we've been talking about it.

215
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,041
She had some questions, okay?

216
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,291
I can't help if people
are inspired by me.

217
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,458
So, you've been studying
the Quantum Realm?

218
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,166
Mm-hmm.

219
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,490
Why didn't you ask me about it?

220
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,625
I tried, Mom.

221
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:51,917
A lot.

222
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,750
You never wanted
to talk about it.

223
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,166
Cassie's just been curious

224
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,000
and we gave her some pointers.

225
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,792
This isn't exactly
ant science, is it, Henry?

226
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,959
You know how dangerous
the Quantum Realm is.

227
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,101
Yeah, we all do, Mom.

228
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,667
Nobody's going
to the Quantum Realm.

229
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,709
That's why we made this.

230
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,250
It's like a satellite
for deep space or the ocean.

231
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,959
But...

232
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,333
Quantum.

233
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,959
We just need a map.

234
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:21,959
And then we can study
and explore

235
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,542
the entire Quantum Realm.

236
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,458
Never even have to go.

237
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:30,208
Your daughter built
a subatomic Hubble Telescope

238
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,500
in a basement.

239
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:35,768
You know,
if I had something like this

240
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,959
when you were gone...

241
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,291
then I could have found you.

242
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:45,792
It's amazing.

243
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,041
I'm blown away.

244
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,792
How does it work?

245
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,917
It's kinda like that
two-way radio we used to have.

246
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,000
You send a signal down
from here,

247
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,976
and then it collects the data,
and it sends it back.

248
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,250
Wait. Wait a minute.

249
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:04,208
You're sending a signal
down to the Quantum Realm?

250
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:06,917
Yeah.

251
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,375
- Shut it down now.
- Janet...

252
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,298
- Why would we shut it...
- What's wrong?

253
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,500
You have to turn it off!

254
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,125
Stop and tell us what's wrong!

255
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:18,875
Janet?

256
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,686
There's something
I should have told...

257
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,250
Dad?

258
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:03,667
No!

259
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,458
- No!
- Mom!

260
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,250
No!

261
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,625
Damn it!

262
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,458
Dad?

263
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,583
Dad!

264
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,792
Dad!

265
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Cassie.

266
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,542
Dad!

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,959
Oh, Dad. Come on.

268
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:29,625
Okay.

269
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:30,709
Are you okay?

270
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:31,917
Yeah. I'm okay.

271
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,417
Where are we?

272
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Mom!

273
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,125
Dad!

274
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,000
Hope. Over here.

275
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:16,667
Are you okay?

276
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,125
We should be dead.

277
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,125
Why aren't we?

278
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,500
I don't know.

279
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:26,041
Are we where I think we are?

280
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,417
I would say yes,

281
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,083
but, uh, it wasn't like this.

282
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,291
Janet!

283
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:33,709
Mom!

284
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:35,834
Janet!

285
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Mom!

286
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:52,709
Do not move.

287
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:12,792
We need to find
Scott and Cassie.

288
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Right now.

289
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,893
<i>Hope?</i>

290
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:20,959
<i>Hope?</i>

291
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,041
<i>Hank? Can you hear me?</i>

292
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,625
<i>- Can anyone hear me?</i>
- Oh, my God.

293
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,309
- It's okay.
- What are we gonna do?

294
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,125
It's okay. It's okay.
We're okay.

295
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,476
We're okay.
It's gonna be okay.

296
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,700
You're saying "okay" too much.

297
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,917
Okay. All right. Okay.
Well, it's 'cause we are.

298
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,041
We're okay.
We are fine.

299
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,291
Hey, we're gonna find them,

300
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,709
- and we're gonna go home.
- Mm.

301
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,101
In the meantime, look around.

302
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,333
It's beautiful.

303
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,750
All right? We're outside.

304
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,625
It's like we're camping.
We love camping.

305
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:49,959
We've never been camping.

306
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,792
But we've always
talked about it.

307
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,333
Is that sun moving?

308
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,291
Get back!

309
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:16,917
Oh, my God.

310
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,500
I don't think this is a sun!

311
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,542
It's fine.

312
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,583
- Dad!
- Honey, it's okay.

313
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,750
Still okay.

314
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,041
Dad. Oh, my God.

315
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,208
That was weird.

316
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:42,583
Run.

317
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:14,500
There's Quantum people
in the Quantum Realm?

318
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:15,667
Yeah.

319
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,917
I didn't know that either.

320
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,417
What was that back there, Mom?

321
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,208
What was that ship looking for?

322
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,083
Keep your voice down.

323
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,333
You said there was nothing
down here.

324
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,893
Why didn't you tell us
about all of this?

325
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:32,518
Hope, I will explain
everything, but right now,

326
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,742
- I just need you to trust me.
- Then make me trust you!

327
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,250
Let's just calm down, all right?

328
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,333
We can talk about this...

329
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,583
We don't have time
to talk, Henry.

330
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,041
No, you need
to tell us what's...

331
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:42,165
And why didn't you listen?

332
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,528
I told you
to stay away from here.

333
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,458
Janet, I... I'm so sorry.

334
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,685
I should have told you
what we were doing.

335
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:49,917
I had no idea...

336
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,083
I know. It's...

337
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,417
We'll talk later.

338
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,375
Right now, we stick together,

339
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,709
we find Scott and Cassie,

340
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,959
and we go home. Okay?

341
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,458
- Okay?
- Okay?

342
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,625
- Okay.
- Okay.

343
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:03,792
Stay close.

344
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,542
This is incredible.

345
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,542
I've studied
the Quantum Realm for years.

346
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,083
Why didn't I see any of this?

347
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:21,625
You weren't able
to look deep enough.

348
00:19:21,792 --> 00:19:24,250
Not through
the Void and Subatomica.

349
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,375
There are worlds here,

350
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,250
worlds within worlds.

351
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,000
It's a place
outside time and space.

352
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,959
It's a secret universe

353
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,875
beneath ours.

354
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,959
Hey, get your hands off me!

355
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:10,959
Cassie?

356
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:14,750
Where's my daughter?

357
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:17,917
Where is she?

358
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Cassie?

359
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:24,959
Where's my daughter?

360
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,583
Cassie!

361
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,250
Dad!

362
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,083
Cassie!

363
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,208
Drink the ooze.

364
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,625
What?

365
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,959
I'll handle this.

366
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,500
Mom.

367
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,250
Was that a... a good stab?

368
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,166
I got us a ride.

369
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,500
He's friendly.

370
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,500
Quite a ride.

371
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,583
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

372
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:42,667
I like ants.

373
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,125
And I love that you love them.
Here.

374
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:48,166
These will help us blend in.

375
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,834
Where exactly
are we going on this?

376
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,760
We're not too far
from an old friend of mine.

377
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:55,834
If anyone's heard
where Scott and Cassie are,

378
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,917
it'll be him.

379
00:22:58,792 --> 00:22:59,792
After you.

380
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:02,917
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

381
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,375
Let me go! Let me go!

382
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:23,041
I don't know what you're saying!

383
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't know what you...

384
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:44,959
No! No!

385
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,262
Drink the ooze!

386
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:57,667
Drink the ooze!

387
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,709
Drink the ooze!

388
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,208
Drink the ooze!

389
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:03,959
- Hello.
- Whoa!

390
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,125
Hi. Hi.

391
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,542
Did you drink the ooze?

392
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,417
Why can I understand you?

393
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,750
Oh. Great. That's the ooze.

394
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,750
Hey, everybody, it worked!
Ooze worked!

395
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:17,917
We can finally be friends.

396
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,291
Hi. I am Veb.

397
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,417
You just drank me.

398
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:21,583
I did... What?

399
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,107
Oh. Do you need
some more ooze? Here.

400
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,226
I can pour some ooze
into your hole...

401
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,250
No, I'm okay.

402
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,875
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Oh, wow!

403
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:28,458
A big hole.

404
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,291
How many holes do you have?

405
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,434
I'm sorry.
Is that a personal question?

406
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,184
I don't have any holes.

407
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,208
His name is Scott Lang.

408
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,625
He has seven holes.

409
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,667
Yeah, that's right.

410
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,583
How did you...
How did you know that?

411
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,750
He's Quaz. He's a telepath.

412
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,125
You can read minds?

413
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:55,375
Yeah, and I really wish
I couldn't.

414
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:58,500
Everyone is disgusting.

415
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,375
Hmm.

416
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,858
Could you please
stop thinking that?

417
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,250
Sorry.

418
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,750
- Please, stop.
- Thinking?

419
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:07,250
- Thinking that.
- I'm trying.

420
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,000
Well, not very hard.

421
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,667
And I think you look weird too.

422
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,476
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

423
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,709
I wish my head glowed.

424
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:15,917
No, no, you don't.

425
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,476
I know I don't. I just...
I'm nervous, okay?

426
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
And it just came out.

427
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:19,583
What are you doing here?

428
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,542
- Are you a spy?
- What? No. No, no.

429
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,810
We should torture him.

430
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:23,834
Guys. No, it's okay.

431
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:26,583
We're not... We're not spies.
He's my dad.

432
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,166
Oh!

433
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,500
Oh... Thank you.

434
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:30,583
Welcome.

435
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:34,291
Then who is San Francisco?

436
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:36,018
- It's where we're from.
- It's a place.

437
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,126
- Then what's Earth?
- It's also where we're from.

438
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,351
We should torture them.

439
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,643
Why are you always
trying to torture people?

440
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:41,667
We have other options.

441
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,291
Do things come out
of your holes,

442
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,667
like milk, juice...

443
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,208
Veb, stop asking
about his holes.

444
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,417
Some of us have holes.

445
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,000
What are you doing here?

446
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:51,792
Where are you from?

447
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,875
- Okay.
- Up there. Up there.

448
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,142
- See, above this...
- The Earth.

449
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:56,846
- It's a different universe.
- Big Earth.

450
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:58,059
It's the same universe,
but it's bigger.

451
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,351
This is Earth,
but it's a very small Earth.

452
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:00,893
- Sometimes, I guess.
- I get big. I shrink.

453
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:01,917
And it's like...

454
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,226
But I wrote a book about it,
actually.

455
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,393
- I don't know.
- This is the Quantum Realm.

456
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:05,601
You have to shrink to
get in the Quantum Realm.

457
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:06,685
We shrunk.
Right now, we're really small.

458
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:07,768
It's bigger where we're from.

459
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:09,500
- So, we're small right now.
- It's bigger.

460
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:15,166
Okay, they're telling the truth.

461
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,375
It doesn't matter.

462
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,000
You come from above.

463
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,250
Like him.

464
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,417
So, he is hunting you.

465
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,709
He will burn the world
to find you.

466
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:32,625
Who?

467
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:35,542
The Conqueror.

468
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,917
There are beings down here.

469
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Intelligent beings.

470
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:45,125
I always theorized it was
possible, but to be here,

471
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,417
a subatomic universe.

472
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,041
This changes everything
we know about life,

473
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,625
evolution,
our place in the galaxy...

474
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,500
Holy shit!

475
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,542
That guy looks like broccoli.

476
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,250
Keep your head down.

477
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,375
Follow me.

478
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:15,834
Drink those.

479
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:17,875
I'll be right back.

480
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:33,500
I'm here for Krylar.

481
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,041
Oh.

482
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:39,458
It's... It's you.

483
00:29:39,792 --> 00:29:40,959
Let's keep that between us.

484
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:43,583
And Krylar.

485
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,750
Hello.

486
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:47,709
I don't know
your ways or customs,

487
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,959
but I assume
that you have a beverage

488
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:51,417
that can get me drunk?

489
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,667
Absolutely, sir.

490
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:58,041
Hmm.
So, what's your story then?

491
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
God.

492
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,041
Move.

493
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:04,458
It's time.

494
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Follow me.

495
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,959
Right this way.

496
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,625
- Hmm.
- Oh.

497
00:30:19,625 --> 00:30:21,959
How exactly
do you know this guy?

498
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:25,291
Old, uh, freedom fighter
friend of mine.

499
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,458
Sorry, you were
a freedom fighter?

500
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,667
Or terrorist.

501
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,875
Depends on who you ask.

502
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:34,417
But, trust me, he can help.

503
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,083
Janet Van Dyne?

504
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,625
I thought you were dead.

505
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,125
Been a long time, Krylar.

506
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:28,542
Officially, Lord Krylar now.

507
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:31,041
I fought like hell against that.

508
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,208
It sounds so elitist.

509
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:37,542
You have got to be Hank.

510
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:41,041
I've heard so much
about you and your ants.

511
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,375
What are ants anyway?

512
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:44,917
Do we have 'em down here?

513
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,709
I don't think so. No.

514
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,875
Oh. That's too bad.

515
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,083
Hope.

516
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,500
You have to be Hope.

517
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:56,291
She talked about you every day.

518
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,834
That's strange,

519
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,166
she never said
anything about you.

520
00:32:02,709 --> 00:32:04,750
I don't think I would have
told my kid either.

521
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:07,291
- Wild stuff.
- Funny.

522
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:08,959
- Hmm.
- How wild?

523
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,542
Very wild, Henry. Yeah.

524
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,125
Uh...

525
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:17,208
Krylar, we need your help.

526
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:21,333
Janet, after all
we've been through, together,

527
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:22,625
just ask me.

528
00:32:22,709 --> 00:32:24,250
Tell me, how can I help?

529
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:25,709
But...

530
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:28,917
is anyone starving?
I'm starving.

531
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,208
Boys...

532
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:32,542
Now.

533
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,375
They don't know anything.

534
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,625
About... anything.

535
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,072
Then get them out of here.

536
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,750
Excuse me.

537
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,083
Look, he's right.
I don't know what's going on.

538
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,690
We're just trying
to find our family.

539
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:53,917
Do you have a map?

540
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,083
All we wanna do is go... Whoa!

541
00:32:58,333 --> 00:32:59,375
Wait, wait. Don't shoot.

542
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:00,667
They're with us.

543
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,959
Is that building alive?

544
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,709
Yours are dead?

545
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,291
Look. Excuse me.

546
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,875
We just wanna go home.

547
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,125
At least you still have a home.

548
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:27,458
What happened here?

549
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,750
The Conqueror burned our homes.

550
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,166
Our stories.

551
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,417
He built his citadel
on the bones of our people.

552
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,083
Some of us escaped,

553
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:42,000
found others on the run.

554
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,625
We gathered
who we could to fight.

555
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,875
It was never enough.

556
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:49,375
I'm sorry.

557
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,250
We can help.

558
00:33:56,709 --> 00:33:59,208
- Uh, Cassie...
- Dad, you're an Avenger.

559
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:00,331
They need help.

560
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,458
No. What I need to do
is get you home.

561
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,083
Why don't you wanna help?

562
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,601
We don't know anything
about this place.

563
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,476
I mean, I don't even know
how time works down here.

564
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,780
Have we been gone
for 10 seconds?

565
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:09,976
Or have we been gone
for 10 years?

566
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,184
Think about your mom right now.

567
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,309
Can you imagine
what she must be...

568
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,458
Don't use Mom as an excuse.

569
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,709
- You just don't care.
- No, I do care.

570
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,542
I know you wanna help. I do.

571
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:19,500
But this is not our fight.

572
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:21,267
Just 'cause it's not
happening to you,

573
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,571
doesn't mean it's not happening.

574
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,041
Hey.

575
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,375
Would you look at me?

576
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:33,166
She's disappointed in you.

577
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,792
- I got that. Yeah. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

578
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,041
We'll talk about it later.

579
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,875
Right now,
let's just find the others.

580
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,291
No one knows this place
better than Janet.

581
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:44,625
What did you say?

582
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,208
What?

583
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,583
That name.

584
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:50,250
Janet Van Dyne.

585
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,333
Where is she?

586
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:53,417
That's what we're trying
to find out. You know her?

587
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,000
I know her.

588
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,583
She shouldn't be here.

589
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:01,333
Hey, bring a round
of the chasers, please.

590
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,041
Yes, thank you.

591
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:06,291
If you haven't had this,
don't try it

592
00:35:06,792 --> 00:35:08,875
unless you want
to change your life.

593
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,083
Mmm.

594
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:23,667
Krylar, we're looking
for friends of ours.

595
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:25,959
Two of them.

596
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,417
Human, like us.

597
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,208
Human, that's the word.

598
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:32,458
Totally forgot what you call
yourselves up there.

599
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:33,625
Human.

600
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:36,291
Are you not human?

601
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,458
Not technically, but yes.

602
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,458
In the ways that matter.

603
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,083
No!

604
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:50,959
Let us talk.

605
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:58,166
So, what is it that brings you
to us, Janet?

606
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:02,000
If I remember correctly,
you left.

607
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:05,458
You left all of us.

608
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,375
With him.

609
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,875
Janet, what is he talking about?

610
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:15,667
You didn't tell them about him.

611
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:20,208
Did you say anything

612
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,333
about what you did here?

613
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,834
How many people died
because of you?

614
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:34,250
Does your family even know
who you are?

615
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:39,083
Your mommy

616
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:42,375
is full of secrets.

617
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:43,625
You're lying.

618
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:44,917
I lie.

619
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,250
A lot.

620
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,709
Not about this.

621
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,792
Let them go.

622
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:58,583
He just wants me.

623
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,125
But you want them.

624
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,083
So they're coming too.

625
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:07,375
Along with those
other friends of yours.

626
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:10,625
I heard about them.

627
00:37:10,792 --> 00:37:13,000
But he did too.

628
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:16,417
And, uh, he sent the Hunter.

629
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,583
What kind of hunter?

630
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:21,959
Uh, not a man.
Not a machine.

631
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:26,000
A mechanized organism
designed only

632
00:37:26,166 --> 00:37:27,834
for killing.

633
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,333
Where are they?

634
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,792
No clue.

635
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:35,041
Dead.

636
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:38,625
Probably dead.

637
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:55,125
Oh, this is so sad
when all of this

638
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,834
could have been avoided, Janet.

639
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,125
Just give him what he wants.

640
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,792
What happened to you?

641
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,583
We fought against him.

642
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,583
He can be very persuasive.

643
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,166
Let's pay him a visit.

644
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,625
I think we're done here.

645
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:42,834
Can that ship
get us out of here?

646
00:38:45,542 --> 00:38:47,542
- Cover me?
- Always.

647
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,583
Henry, take the helm.

648
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:22,783
I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.

649
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:28,458
Where are the controls?

650
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,208
Those are the controls.

651
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,125
What the hell?

652
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,166
You'll be great.
It's like flying a bike.

653
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Is the bike alive?

654
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,083
Hands, all the way in!

655
00:39:57,709 --> 00:39:58,834
Like stuffing a turkey.

656
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,166
Ugh.

657
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:08,750
- Really, him?
- He used to be charming.

658
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:09,834
That guy?

659
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,834
I was down here
for 30 years, Henry.

660
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,709
- I had needs.
- Oh, my God.

661
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,667
Look, I get it.
I've got needs too.

662
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:16,834
Oh, my God!

663
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:19,125
I had dinner with someone
a few times.

664
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,166
Her name was Linda.

665
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,125
It didn't work out.

666
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,542
What went wrong?

667
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,583
She wasn't you, baby.

668
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,875
Get everyone in the ships.
We're leaving.

669
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:32,959
All right.

670
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,834
- And, Xolum.
- Right here.

671
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,208
Take them as far away
from here as you can.

672
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,417
- Why?
- What?

673
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:41,750
If you're looking for Janet,
he's looking for you.

674
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,959
You led them straight to us.

675
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:53,834
Come on, come on.

676
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,917
Take as many as you can.

677
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,250
We'll hold them off.

678
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:21,542
Go!

679
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,583
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

680
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,709
We gotta go! We gotta go!

681
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,000
Get on. Get on now!

682
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,333
We have to go now. Now!

683
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:48,333
Oh, my God!

684
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:07,417
Cassie, let's go!

685
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,917
Get to the sanctuary.

686
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:17,750
Wait for my message.

687
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:20,166
- Veb, we're leaving.
- No. No, wait!

688
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,417
- Move! Move!
- All my friends.

689
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:45,935
<i>Give up the travelers.</i>

690
00:42:45,959 --> 00:42:47,333
<i>The Conqueror
will show you mercy.</i>

691
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:48,875
I know his mercy.

692
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:03,500
Stay here. I'm...

693
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:05,792
Cassie?

694
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Oh, no.

695
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,125
Okay. I have a suit.

696
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,041
Yeah, I noticed.

697
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,083
- You okay?
- Yes.

698
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,166
Look, momentum, right?

699
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,250
Jump, tap, right?
One move. Jump, tap.

700
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,417
I know how to do it, Dad.

701
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:44,726
- Oh, do you? Really?
- Yes.

702
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,101
'Cause it didn't look like it
from my end.

703
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:47,525
I just... I messed up
on the timing.

704
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,208
Jump...

705
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Like that.

706
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,603
You see what I did?
You see what I did?

707
00:43:57,083 --> 00:43:58,709
No. You're like this small.

708
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:00,375
I jumped and tapped.

709
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:12,291
Jentorra, we have to go.

710
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,625
Get to the ship!

711
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:23,518
<i>Welcome back</i>

712
00:45:23,542 --> 00:45:25,291
<i>to the Quantum Realm, Scott.</i>

713
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:28,625
<i>I've been waiting
a long time for this.</i>

714
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:30,417
What?

715
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:33,125
Is someone in there?

716
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:35,250
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

717
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:38,000
<i>The destiny you cannot escape.</i>

718
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:41,291
<i>Our fates have always
been forged together...</i>

719
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,291
<i>ever since that day we met.</i>

720
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:47,792
Wow.

721
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:49,291
Scott Lang.

722
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,583
Get away from us!

723
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,250
<i>The day you broke me.</i>

724
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:57,333
<i>- Banished me down here.
- Wait.</i>

725
00:45:59,667 --> 00:46:00,667
Darren?

726
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:03,959
Surprised to see me?

727
00:46:05,875 --> 00:46:06,959
Yeah.

728
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,625
It's the bee guy?

729
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:10,542
- It's the bee guy?
- Cassie?

730
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,291
I almost didn't recognize you.

731
00:46:13,208 --> 00:46:14,834
How are you not dead?

732
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,917
I became the ultimate weapon.

733
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,208
That... That...
That's what this is?

734
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:22,333
Look, Darren.

735
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:27,792
Darren is dead!

736
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:31,458
There is only M.O.D.O.K.!

737
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:34,667
And there's no place
you can run, Scott.

738
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:35,959
Not from me.

739
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:38,208
And not from him.

740
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,417
He's the future.

741
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,291
He's the past.

742
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:47,333
And now all he needs is you.

743
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:54,750
Mom?

744
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:56,917
What's after Scott and Cassie?

745
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:00,250
We have to find them.

746
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,041
There's something
I have to do first.

747
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,625
They could be dead!

748
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:06,250
Hope, please.

749
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:08,041
And you're still
hiding things from us.

750
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:10,500
I am trying to protect you.

751
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:12,083
From what?

752
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,625
Who are you so afraid of?

753
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:30,542
Third time in jail?

754
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:33,709
Four.

755
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,500
<i>And here we are again.</i>

756
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:47,125
Face to face.

757
00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:51,125
That's a face. It's a...

758
00:47:52,542 --> 00:47:53,750
It's a big face.

759
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:55,542
Why are you
just a floating head?

760
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,792
Maybe you could
walk us through this, Darren.

761
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,875
You left Darren to die
in the Quantum Realm.

762
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:04,500
<i>But the Conqueror found me.</i>

763
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,208
<i>Rebuilt me.</i>

764
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:09,000
<i>Made me the ultimate weapon.</i>

765
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:11,959
<i>A mechanized organism
designed only for...</i>

766
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,041
Oh, M.O.D.O.K.?

767
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,458
Oh, uh, MO... Oh, I get it.
It's an acronym.

768
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:18,792
It's an acronym.

769
00:48:18,959 --> 00:48:21,959
Mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

770
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,000
Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.

771
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:27,166
I bet you thought
you'd seen the last of me.

772
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,583
Just now noticing the baby legs.

773
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,333
They're not baby legs.

774
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,875
A little bit like a Björn.

775
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:33,375
You think you're so smart.

776
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:36,667
Scott Lang, the man
who took everything from me.

777
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,291
Who stole my whole life.

778
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:39,542
But I did it.

779
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,709
I got you here.

780
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:44,875
I found your signal, Cassie.

781
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:46,250
Thanks for that, by the way.

782
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:47,653
Couldn't have done it
without you.

783
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,875
You're looking
at a man set free.

784
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:55,875
I've created so much more here

785
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:57,542
than you could possibly imagine.

786
00:48:58,709 --> 00:49:01,333
All for him.

787
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:07,166
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the Quantum Realm.

788
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:12,834
What is this place?

789
00:49:13,542 --> 00:49:15,417
<i>He said he was a traveler.</i>

790
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:18,625
A scientist
who crashed off course.

791
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:27,834
<i>He had a ship</i>

792
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:31,375
beyond anything I had ever seen.

793
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:35,083
<i>A ship that could travel
the Multiverse.</i>

794
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,458
The Multiverse?

795
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:40,000
As in alternate dimensions?

796
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:42,000
Parallel realities?

797
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,792
I didn't believe it at first.

798
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
But it's real.

799
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:50,208
<i>Just like we theorized.</i>

800
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,458
Can this take us home?

801
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:57,834
It can take you anywhere.

802
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,792
Yah!

803
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,917
<i>I'd never met anyone like him.</i>

804
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:23,417
<i>He felt so</i>

805
00:50:23,834 --> 00:50:24,917
<i>lost.</i>

806
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:27,834
<i>I guess we both were.</i>

807
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,166
<i>But we had a way out.</i>

808
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,542
<i>We tried everything</i>

809
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:37,500
<i>to recharge
his ship's energy core.</i>

810
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:44,709
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

811
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:50,917
<i>But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.</i>

812
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:53,625
I lied to Hope.

813
00:50:58,166 --> 00:50:59,834
I told her I was coming home.

814
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:05,834
I can see her by the door.

815
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,750
Waiting for me.

816
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:15,291
That's the last thing I did...

817
00:51:17,959 --> 00:51:19,125
was lie to her.

818
00:51:22,959 --> 00:51:25,000
I just thought
I'd have more time.

819
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:31,291
I can give that to you.

820
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:34,291
Time.

821
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:39,542
It's not what you think it is.

822
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,250
It's a cage.

823
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:48,417
And it does everything it can

824
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:50,166
to break you.

825
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:56,625
It's not until you free
yourself from it that you see

826
00:51:57,792 --> 00:51:59,208
just how small

827
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:01,417
it always was.

828
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,125
We're going to get out of here.

829
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:14,295
She's gonna open the door...

830
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:16,917
and you'll be there.

831
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:22,709
I promise.

832
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:29,125
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

833
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,417
<i>It took ages, but we did it.</i>

834
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,125
We brought it back to life.

835
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,750
Let's go home.

836
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,208
<i>His ship was neurokinetic.</i>

837
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,834
<i>Connected to his thoughts.</i>

838
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:56,792
<i>When I touched it...</i>

839
00:52:58,917 --> 00:53:00,417
I saw his mind.

840
00:53:01,792 --> 00:53:02,792
<i>I felt...</i>

841
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:05,959
<i>what he had done.</i>

842
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,583
<i>Entire worlds,</i>

843
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,458
<i>entire timelines.</i>

844
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:18,291
<i>Gone, like they
never even existed.</i>

845
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,083
Janet?

846
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:44,083
We can leave.

847
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:47,291
Right now.

848
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:53,917
Who is Kang?

849
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:00,667
Who I need to be.

850
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,333
He didn't crash here.

851
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,542
He was exiled here.

852
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:12,834
Outside space and time.

853
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:15,667
The only place

854
00:54:16,583 --> 00:54:18,208
that could hold him.

855
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:20,709
Exiled?

856
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:22,834
By who?

857
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,208
I don't know.

858
00:54:26,709 --> 00:54:28,500
But they sabotaged his ship.

859
00:54:29,792 --> 00:54:31,542
And trapped him here.

860
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,375
And because of me,

861
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:38,166
he was getting out.

862
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,458
Janet?

863
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:43,500
Stay away.

864
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:50,792
You saved my life.

865
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:57,500
I made a promise.

866
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:06,083
Just let me take you home.

867
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:08,917
And then?

868
00:55:11,083 --> 00:55:12,834
What are you going to do?

869
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,458
Win.

870
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:47,291
I told you
time isn't what you think.

871
00:55:49,417 --> 00:55:51,083
I can make it...

872
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:53,959
so you never left her.

873
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:58,500
Hope is going to open the door

874
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:01,250
and you'll be there.

875
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,583
And how many worlds will die...

876
00:56:06,041 --> 00:56:07,667
if you get out?

877
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,250
Not yours.

878
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,625
She'll never know.

879
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,959
Don't you want
to see your daughter again?

880
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:24,834
I can't let you leave.

881
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:29,291
Why do you think
you can stop me?

882
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,625
Give it to me, Janet.

883
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:51,208
Give it to me!

884
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:54,625
I couldn't beat him.
He was too powerful.

885
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,500
What did you do?

886
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:02,542
I'm sorry, Hope.

887
00:57:04,917 --> 00:57:06,083
No!

888
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:35,000
<i>I blew up his core.</i>

889
00:57:35,208 --> 00:57:37,375
<i>Cut him off from time.</i>

890
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:40,750
<i>And trapped us both
down here forever.</i>

891
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,709
But I gave him back enough.

892
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,500
Now that he had his suit back,

893
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:50,041
he became what he always was.

894
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:52,625
<i>A conqueror.</i>

895
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:55,375
<i>He's got weapons and technology</i>

896
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:59,208
<i>centuries beyond anything
we can dream of.</i>

897
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:03,834
<i>He took his prison
and made it his empire.</i>

898
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:08,125
I spent years fighting him,

899
00:58:08,291 --> 00:58:10,875
running from him,
hiding from him.

900
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,000
And then you saved me.

901
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:18,333
You brought me home.

902
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:21,333
But I didn't deserve it.

903
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:26,709
I unleashed a monster
on this place

904
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:28,709
and ran away.

905
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:32,542
Janet, you couldn't have known.

906
00:58:34,709 --> 00:58:36,667
I'm sorry I never told you.

907
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,625
I just wanted to forget.

908
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:43,458
I just wanted
to be your mom again.

909
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:51,792
I'm so sorry you had to
go through all of that alone.

910
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:55,375
But you are not alone now.

911
00:58:59,041 --> 00:59:00,458
We'll stop him together.

912
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,000
He's after the core.

913
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:06,500
But he needs Pym Particles
to reach it.

914
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:08,542
And if he's got
Scott and Cassie,

915
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:10,041
he's got Pym Particles.

916
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:12,041
- And a head start.
- Exactly.

917
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:13,848
- We gotta get out of here.
- Hope.

918
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:16,000
He cannot get out.

919
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,000
You're an interesting man...

920
00:59:42,667 --> 00:59:44,125
Scott Lang.

921
00:59:44,792 --> 00:59:47,000
Um, I don't know who you are,

922
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:49,959
but you've made a big mistake.

923
00:59:50,583 --> 00:59:51,625
Okay?

924
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:54,083
I'm an Avenger.

925
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:56,291
I've called
the other Avengers...

926
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,000
You're an Avenger?

927
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:02,166
Have I killed you before?

928
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:04,125
What?

929
01:00:04,959 --> 01:00:06,875
They all blur together
after a while.

930
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:10,750
You're not the one
with the hammer?

931
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:12,250
No, that's Thor.

932
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:15,250
We get confused a lot.

933
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:17,583
Similar body types.
Who are you?

934
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,125
Just a man

935
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:23,792
who's lost a lot of time.

936
01:00:23,959 --> 01:00:25,166
Like you.

937
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:29,542
But we can help
each other with that.

938
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:33,542
M.O.D.O.K. tells me
you're a good thief.

939
01:00:33,709 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah, he stole something
from me.

940
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:39,959
Do not speak
when I am in the room.

941
01:00:47,917 --> 01:00:50,375
Gotta say,
Janet was a lot more helpful.

942
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:52,375
You know Janet too?

943
01:00:53,709 --> 01:00:55,875
Does everyone down here
know Janet?

944
01:00:57,166 --> 01:00:58,792
She didn't tell you about me?

945
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:05,041
I guess that's not a surprise.

946
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:09,792
Janet stole something from me.

947
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,333
My ticket out of here.

948
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:18,959
And you're the only one
who can steal it back.

949
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:20,875
And why would I do that?

950
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:23,542
Because you want
to get out of here.

951
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:28,291
And I need to get out of here.

952
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,458
Because I know how it ends.

953
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:34,333
How what ends?

954
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:39,041
All of it.

955
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:45,583
I don't live in a straight line.

956
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,917
And with time,

957
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,000
it's hard

958
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,166
not to skip to the end.

959
01:01:55,917 --> 01:01:58,125
So, if you want
to stop what's coming,

960
01:01:58,959 --> 01:02:01,166
and trust me,

961
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:02,583
you do...

962
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:07,000
I am the only shot you have.

963
01:02:07,709 --> 01:02:08,834
What's coming?

964
01:02:10,959 --> 01:02:11,959
Me.

965
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:16,500
A lot of me.

966
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:24,500
They exiled me, down here.

967
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,417
They're afraid of me.

968
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:38,625
But I'm the man
who can get you home.

969
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:48,166
So,

970
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,500
do we have a deal?

971
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:55,792
No, I don't think we do.

972
01:03:03,959 --> 01:03:06,083
Dad!

973
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:08,583
Let me make this easy for you.

974
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,458
You will bring me what I need

975
01:03:10,625 --> 01:03:12,959
or I will kill your daughter
in front of you,

976
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:15,208
then make you relive that moment

977
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,667
over and over
again in time, endlessly,

978
01:03:18,834 --> 01:03:21,291
until you beg me to kill you.

979
01:03:22,542 --> 01:03:23,959
Do we understand?

980
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:28,709
Don't do this.

981
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,709
I'm a man
who likes to be understood.

982
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Dad.

983
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:41,375
Don't listen to him.

984
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,792
No! No!

985
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:46,035
Look, we can talk about this.

986
01:03:46,417 --> 01:03:47,542
Don't do it!

987
01:03:47,709 --> 01:03:49,125
You really should do it.

988
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:50,291
Please.

989
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:54,250
That's my daughter, please.

990
01:03:54,417 --> 01:03:56,875
Do you want her to live,
or do you want her to die?

991
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,041
Please!

992
01:03:58,208 --> 01:03:59,417
You think I'm lying?

993
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,291
Do I look like a liar to you?

994
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,041
Stop!

995
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:06,768
- Dad!
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

996
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:08,417
I'll do it. Just let her go.

997
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,125
Let her go. Let her go!

998
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:22,291
You're out of your league.

999
01:04:24,333 --> 01:04:25,333
Ant-Man.

1000
01:04:31,583 --> 01:04:33,375
Just be glad I need you.

1001
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:50,083
Don't touch her again.

1002
01:04:50,542 --> 01:04:52,125
Then give me what I need.

1003
01:04:53,875 --> 01:04:55,125
Where is it?

1004
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:38,083
What is that?

1005
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,625
It was a multiversal
engine core.

1006
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:43,709
A power source that can take you

1007
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:45,750
anywhere in space and time.

1008
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,083
Then Janet blew it up.

1009
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:54,750
It's in that?

1010
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,792
It is that.

1011
01:05:56,959 --> 01:05:59,000
And we have to get
to the center.

1012
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:01,291
That's good to know.

1013
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,476
You'll have to shrink down

1014
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,333
and pass through
the eye of the storm.

1015
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,125
Once you're inside,
find the core

1016
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:11,000
and size it back down.

1017
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:12,625
What does it look like?

1018
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:13,875
When I steal something,

1019
01:06:13,959 --> 01:06:15,142
I usually know
what I'm stealing.

1020
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:16,792
You'll know it when you see it.

1021
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,250
Get in and out
as fast as you can.

1022
01:06:19,417 --> 01:06:20,709
The longer you're in there,

1023
01:06:20,792 --> 01:06:22,709
the more your mind
will come undone.

1024
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:26,583
Better hurry.

1025
01:06:27,834 --> 01:06:29,041
Dad!

1026
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:33,000
I'm sorry.

1027
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,625
This is all my fault.

1028
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:37,917
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1029
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:39,291
No.

1030
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:42,166
I messed up.

1031
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:43,667
Cassie.

1032
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,834
My whole life happened
because I messed up.

1033
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:50,917
The only thing
I didn't mess up is you.

1034
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:55,291
Dad!

1035
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,041
It's okay.

1036
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,250
It's okay.

1037
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,458
I love you, Peanut.

1038
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,500
I love you too.

1039
01:07:49,583 --> 01:07:51,250
Okay. I'm in.

1040
01:07:54,542 --> 01:07:56,542
Darren, can you hear me?

1041
01:07:56,709 --> 01:07:57,709
Darren?

1042
01:07:58,583 --> 01:07:59,625
Darren?

1043
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,125
M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?

1044
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:05,411
<i>What?</i>

1045
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,333
- I'm in.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1046
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:10,583
Okay, so what do I do?
What's the plan?

1047
01:08:12,083 --> 01:08:13,250
<i>Don't die?</i>

1048
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,875
Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.

1049
01:08:17,041 --> 01:08:18,875
<i>Do you see it?</i>

1050
01:08:19,667 --> 01:08:20,834
Yeah. I see it.

1051
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,458
I'm heading in.

1052
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:29,834
Whoa!

1053
01:08:29,917 --> 01:08:31,667
What the hell?

1054
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:32,750
What the hell?

1055
01:08:32,834 --> 01:08:33,834
What the hell?

1056
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:35,017
<i>I told you, Scott.</i>

1057
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:36,667
<i>Getting in
was just the beginning.</i>

1058
01:08:36,834 --> 01:08:37,959
You never said that.

1059
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:39,375
Why am I looking at another me?

1060
01:08:39,542 --> 01:08:41,083
I'm not another me.
You're another me.

1061
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:42,250
You just came out...

1062
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:43,959
Why am I looking at another me?

1063
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:47,333
<i>You're looking at the
possibility of another you.</i>

1064
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,250
<i>You're in a Probability Storm.</i>

1065
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,542
What does any of that mean?

1066
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:53,375
- You don't know?
- Why would I know?

1067
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:54,601
Because you got me in here.

1068
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:55,865
Oh, so, I am the real one, huh?

1069
01:08:55,917 --> 01:08:56,917
No. I didn't say that.

1070
01:08:58,458 --> 01:08:59,738
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

1071
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:00,935
- What the hell?
- What the hell?

1072
01:09:00,959 --> 01:09:02,142
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- What the hell?

1073
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:03,208
What the hell?

1074
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:05,375
What is this place?

1075
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:07,542
<i>It's a Probability Storm.</i>

1076
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:10,542
<i>Every choice you could make,
existing all at once.</i>

1077
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:12,109
What is he saying?
What's he saying?

1078
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,226
What's he saying?

1079
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,851
<i>You're inside Schrödinger's box.</i>

1080
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:15,875
<i>And you're the cat.</i>

1081
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:17,643
- That doesn't make sense.
- Oh, I get it.

1082
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:19,375
Nobody move! All right?
Nobody move!

1083
01:09:19,542 --> 01:09:21,726
Why should we listen to you?
You're not even the real one.

1084
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,875
- What the hell?
- Am I real?

1085
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:24,000
- Am I real?
- Am I real?

1086
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:25,518
- I am the real one!
- What the hell?

1087
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:27,500
What the hell.
I'm the real one.

1088
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:29,166
Whoa, whoa, guys. Hey, relax.

1089
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:31,000
Take it easy. Breathe.

1090
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:33,250
We'll figure this out.
Together.

1091
01:09:33,417 --> 01:09:34,417
Who are you?

1092
01:09:34,583 --> 01:09:35,959
Why are you dressed like that?

1093
01:09:36,917 --> 01:09:38,417
Because I work
at Baskin-Robbins.

1094
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:40,333
This is my uniform.

1095
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,792
These are normal clothes.

1096
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:43,208
Why are you dressed like that?

1097
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:46,041
- Do you have ice cream?
- Enough! Let's do this!

1098
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:55,750
Oh, we're all gonna die.

1099
01:09:58,125 --> 01:09:59,667
Wait. Whoa, whoa.

1100
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:00,959
Wait. Wait!

1101
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:02,208
No! No!

1102
01:10:02,458 --> 01:10:04,834
<i>No! Wait! No!</i>

1103
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,333
I've got a read on Scott.

1104
01:10:21,959 --> 01:10:23,039
Out of the way!

1105
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,208
- Mom! What is this?
- What are you doing?

1106
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:27,215
<i>Don't look at them.
They're just possibilities.</i>

1107
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:29,709
<i>They're not you.</i>

1108
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:32,000
Scott, where are you?

1109
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,166
Why am I here?

1110
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,090
<i>Don't worry.
It'll work this time.</i>

1111
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:42,041
What are you...
Wait, wait, no, no. Stop.

1112
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:44,709
- Stop! No!
<i>- I got this, guys.</i>

1113
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,125
<i>I got this! I got it!</i>

1114
01:10:56,542 --> 01:10:57,750
Scott, where are you?

1115
01:10:58,333 --> 01:11:00,375
Scott!

1116
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:04,375
Where are you, Scott?

1117
01:11:05,709 --> 01:11:07,601
<i>- I can't breathe.
- Ow, that's my neck.</i>

1118
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:10,959
<i>Stop kicking me!</i>

1119
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:12,834
Help!

1120
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:14,357
<i>- Oh, my back!
- We're all gonna die!</i>

1121
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:15,417
Get off me!

1122
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,667
Dad.

1123
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,750
<i>Come back.</i>

1124
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,667
<i>Dad,</i>

1125
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:24,875
<i>if you can hear me,</i>

1126
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:27,959
<i>come back.
Just come back.</i>

1127
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,542
<i>- Don't give up.</i>
- Come on.

1128
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:32,434
<i>- Dad, just come back...</i>
- Come on.

1129
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:33,458
<i>One more time.</i>

1130
01:11:33,542 --> 01:11:35,262
<i>- She needs us.
- Please.</i>

1131
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,726
<i>- Yes, come on.
- Come back.</i>

1132
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,458
<i>She needs us.
Let's do it together.</i>

1133
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:40,709
<i>- Get him up! Get him up!
- Grab him! Grab him!</i>

1134
01:11:40,792 --> 01:11:42,083
Let's go.

1135
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:45,333
<i>- Come on, lift him!</i>
- Yes!

1136
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,709
<i>- I got ya, I got ya! Go.</i>
- Come on. That's it.

1137
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:48,851
- Come on!
<i>- Give him a boost!</i>

1138
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:49,917
<i>Give him a boost!</i>

1139
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:54,417
<i>Come on, we're doing it
for Cassie! Fellas, let's go!</i>

1140
01:11:54,583 --> 01:11:56,291
<i>Everyone together!</i>

1141
01:11:56,458 --> 01:11:57,500
What are you doing?

1142
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:59,792
How are you able to do that?

1143
01:11:59,875 --> 01:12:00,959
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>

1144
01:12:02,542 --> 01:12:04,208
We all want the same thing.

1145
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:07,834
And I'm coming, Cassie.

1146
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,875
Go get her, pal.

1147
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,792
Everyone, let's go!

1148
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:28,417
Come on!

1149
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:37,375
Come on, closer.

1150
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:38,500
<i>Get him higher!</i>

1151
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:40,250
<i>Hang on, guys, hang on.</i>

1152
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:43,083
<i>Careful. Steady, steady.</i>

1153
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:47,917
<i>Steady. That's it.</i>

1154
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,083
<i>Let's go.</i>

1155
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,500
<i>What?</i>

1156
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:01,681
<i>- No.
- What happened? Did it work?</i>

1157
01:13:01,834 --> 01:13:03,625
Sorry, buddy!

1158
01:13:03,709 --> 01:13:05,458
<i>- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.</i>

1159
01:13:15,542 --> 01:13:17,542
<i>Hope, are you real?</i>

1160
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:19,375
<i>I'm real.</i>

1161
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,040
<i>Then let's do this.</i>

1162
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,291
<i>You ready?</i>

1163
01:13:27,458 --> 01:13:28,458
<i>Ready.</i>

1164
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,542
Come on.

1165
01:14:15,709 --> 01:14:16,935
We gotta get
that thing out of here.

1166
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:19,083
No, no, no. Wait.
He's got Cassie.

1167
01:14:19,625 --> 01:14:20,875
- What?
- Scott.

1168
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:23,458
- Janet.
- Give that to me.

1169
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,542
- We have to go now.
- No.

1170
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:25,917
He's got Cassie.

1171
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:27,125
We will save her.

1172
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:28,750
I promise you we will save her,

1173
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:32,125
but you cannot give that to him.

1174
01:14:32,542 --> 01:14:33,750
I wouldn't trust her.

1175
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:39,458
Janet has a way of...

1176
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:43,959
changing her mind.

1177
01:14:50,792 --> 01:14:53,291
Hello, Jellybean.

1178
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:00,583
So...

1179
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,000
what's it gonna be, Scott?

1180
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:11,834
<i>Well, well.</i>

1181
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,834
<i>If it isn't my old mentor.</i>

1182
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:21,208
<i>Hi, Hank.</i>

1183
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:25,792
Darren?

1184
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:27,458
Didn't expect to see

1185
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:28,875
your protégé again after all...

1186
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:30,750
Holy shit, Darren.

1187
01:15:31,709 --> 01:15:33,041
What happened to you?

1188
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:35,625
I'm the ultimate weapon!

1189
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,959
Do I need to take it?

1190
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:49,583
Where is my daughter?

1191
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:52,667
Scott.

1192
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Don't.

1193
01:15:55,917 --> 01:15:58,125
We had a deal.

1194
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,125
She'll be fine without you.

1195
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,291
<i>So long, Hank.</i>

1196
01:16:34,834 --> 01:16:35,834
Henry.

1197
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,291
You left me right here to die.

1198
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:50,917
Let's see how they do.

1199
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,208
What did you see?

1200
01:18:01,917 --> 01:18:05,291
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

1201
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,417
But I always wondered.

1202
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:14,125
When you touched my mind...

1203
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:27,291
what did you see?

1204
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:29,417
A monster

1205
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:32,333
who thinks he's a god.

1206
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,166
When you can see time
the way I do,

1207
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:37,250
you don't get
to close your eyes.

1208
01:18:37,417 --> 01:18:40,125
And you're the only one
who sees?

1209
01:18:40,291 --> 01:18:45,000
I am the only one
that can see it's broken.

1210
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:46,458
And who broke it?

1211
01:18:48,959 --> 01:18:50,125
I did.

1212
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:54,333
Every version of me.

1213
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,959
My variants.

1214
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,041
Throughout the Multiverse.

1215
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:04,542
Playing with time,
like children.

1216
01:19:06,917 --> 01:19:10,000
But I saw how it ends.

1217
01:19:11,291 --> 01:19:13,291
I saw their chaos

1218
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:17,041
spreading across realities.

1219
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:20,458
Universes colliding.

1220
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:23,166
Endless incursions.

1221
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,458
I saw the Multiverse.

1222
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:29,041
And it was dying.

1223
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,083
All because of them.

1224
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:35,417
So, I took control.

1225
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:37,959
You mean you started a war.

1226
01:19:38,792 --> 01:19:40,041
And now you wanna wipe away

1227
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:42,041
any universe
that's a threat to you.

1228
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:44,750
That's what monsters do.

1229
01:19:44,834 --> 01:19:47,792
That's what conquerors do.

1230
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:51,041
They burn the broken world.

1231
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:54,875
And they make a new one.

1232
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:57,917
You don't care about saving
anything or anyone.

1233
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:02,375
You only want revenge
because they beat you.

1234
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,250
Because you lost.

1235
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:06,458
I have lost.

1236
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:12,250
You have no idea
what I have lost.

1237
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:17,667
And I will burn them out of time

1238
01:20:17,834 --> 01:20:19,250
for what they've done to me.

1239
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:24,166
You'll be wiping out
entire timelines.

1240
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:28,000
Murdering trillions of people.

1241
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:31,917
I wish that mattered, Janet.

1242
01:20:53,917 --> 01:20:55,375
<i>Oh, God.
What am I doing?</i>

1243
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:07,333
<i>What?</i>

1244
01:21:11,542 --> 01:21:12,542
<i>Hank!</i>

1245
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:17,500
Are these your ants?

1246
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:19,250
From the ant farm?

1247
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:21,291
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

1248
01:21:21,667 --> 01:21:23,083
How did you find them down here?

1249
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:27,250
I've been picking up strange
signals ever since we crashed.

1250
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:32,041
<i>First I thought
maybe it was a malfunction.</i>

1251
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:33,792
Some kind of interference.

1252
01:21:33,959 --> 01:21:35,834
What is that?

1253
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,125
But it wasn't.

1254
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,709
It was the ants.

1255
01:21:41,667 --> 01:21:44,542
They were reaching out
the whole time.

1256
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,583
<i>Apparently, they passed through</i>

1257
01:21:47,667 --> 01:21:49,458
<i>some sort of time dilation.</i>

1258
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:52,834
<i>They've lived thousands
of years in a single day,</i>

1259
01:21:53,417 --> 01:21:56,417
<i>expanding their knowledge,
their science,</i>

1260
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:57,917
<i>becoming more advanced</i>

1261
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,625
<i>than I could have ever thought.</i>

1262
01:21:59,959 --> 01:22:01,375
<i>I didn't find them.</i>

1263
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,500
They found me.

1264
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,208
I told you they were smart.

1265
01:22:09,667 --> 01:22:10,917
They've already built something

1266
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,667
of a technocratic
Class-Two civilization.

1267
01:22:14,959 --> 01:22:17,834
I mean, I know socialism
is a charged word,

1268
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
but we could
learn a lot from these...

1269
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:21,166
Dad.

1270
01:22:21,959 --> 01:22:23,250
Yeah, they're my ants.

1271
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
And ants don't give up.

1272
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:27,417
I don't care who this guy is.

1273
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,792
I don't care what he can do.

1274
01:22:28,875 --> 01:22:30,000
I'm getting Cassie.

1275
01:22:30,333 --> 01:22:32,542
So, how do we
even the odds against Kang?

1276
01:22:35,709 --> 01:22:37,125
We've got some ideas.

1277
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:38,291
What are you thinking?

1278
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:41,500
Well, as a great writer
once said,

1279
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,709
"There's always room to grow."

1280
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:48,166
You read my book?

1281
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:52,250
Every goddamn word.

1282
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:56,250
Come on. Let's go to work.

1283
01:23:09,166 --> 01:23:11,083
Hey! I'm sorry.

1284
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:13,000
That was probably terrifying.

1285
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:14,458
What are you doing here?

1286
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:16,333
I'm rescuing you.

1287
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:17,709
How?

1288
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:20,959
That's a good question.

1289
01:23:21,583 --> 01:23:24,250
Does this thing have like a key?

1290
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:26,417
Or a card? Like a room key?

1291
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:27,792
Do you know, like a...

1292
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:30,750
Shit!

1293
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:39,458
<i>Jump and tap.</i>

1294
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:49,500
Jentorra.

1295
01:23:50,917 --> 01:23:52,709
I'm sorry
I got your people hurt.

1296
01:23:54,417 --> 01:23:55,417
How can I help?

1297
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:01,625
Wow.

1298
01:24:01,792 --> 01:24:03,000
Let's hurt 'em back.

1299
01:24:04,208 --> 01:24:05,417
Damn, you're cool.

1300
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:07,458
Do you have a plan?

1301
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:08,862
Freeing you
was basically my plan.

1302
01:24:09,834 --> 01:24:10,917
Do you have a plan?

1303
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:13,403
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

1304
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:15,518
Then free our people
from the detention cells below

1305
01:24:15,542 --> 01:24:16,893
and launch a counteroffensive
from within.

1306
01:24:16,917 --> 01:24:17,917
Yeah, you have a plan.

1307
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,291
So, how do we get a message out?

1308
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:21,625
- Follow me.
- Okay. Great.

1309
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:29,250
I built an empire
down here, Janet.

1310
01:24:31,709 --> 01:24:33,250
And I'm taking it with me.

1311
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:50,709
You really should've let me out

1312
01:24:50,792 --> 01:24:52,166
when you had the chance.

1313
01:25:01,417 --> 01:25:04,542
History is not written.

1314
01:25:06,542 --> 01:25:07,792
<i>It is forged.</i>

1315
01:25:08,583 --> 01:25:10,417
<i>Today, we ascend.</i>

1316
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:12,834
<i>From this fortress,</i>

1317
01:25:12,917 --> 01:25:16,291
<i>I will take my revenge
on those who banished me.</i>

1318
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:21,125
<i>Today we conquer eternity.</i>

1319
01:25:21,917 --> 01:25:24,083
<i>And the dynasty of Kang shall...</i>

1320
01:25:28,083 --> 01:25:29,750
<i>Hello?
Is this working?</i>

1321
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:31,333
Cassie?

1322
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,375
<i>I can't tell if this is working.</i>

1323
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,250
Okay. I think we're on.

1324
01:25:36,417 --> 01:25:37,976
I'll hold them off.
Get the message out.

1325
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,680
I thought you were getting
the message out.

1326
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:42,417
Now!

1327
01:25:43,667 --> 01:25:45,834
We're inside.
We breached the tower.

1328
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
<i>And I'm with Jentorra.</i>

1329
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:48,583
<i>He's not invincible.</i>

1330
01:25:54,792 --> 01:25:56,750
I know it might feel like

1331
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:58,291
<i>it's too late,</i>

1332
01:25:58,834 --> 01:26:02,000
<i>like all we do is just lose.</i>

1333
01:26:02,542 --> 01:26:04,125
<i>But the family I've lost</i>

1334
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:06,375
<i>taught me to keep fighting.</i>

1335
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:08,458
<i>And if they were here,
they would too.</i>

1336
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:11,291
<i>We need to look out
for the little guy.</i>

1337
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:13,250
My dad taught me that.

1338
01:26:13,709 --> 01:26:15,458
<i>'Cause when people needed help,</i>

1339
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:18,291
<i>he didn't look the other way.</i>

1340
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:19,583
<i>And neither do we.</i>

1341
01:26:21,917 --> 01:26:23,125
We need to move!

1342
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:25,375
Come to the tower! Fight back!

1343
01:26:25,542 --> 01:26:27,917
<i>I know you've been waiting.
Now is the time to strike.</i>

1344
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:30,250
He knows
he can't take all of us.

1345
01:26:30,417 --> 01:26:31,542
<i>Come to the...</i>

1346
01:26:31,709 --> 01:26:32,709
Cassie.

1347
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:34,935
I think I found the signal.
Mom's gotta be there, too.

1348
01:26:34,959 --> 01:26:36,500
- Let's go.
- I'll drive.

1349
01:26:42,709 --> 01:26:44,083
Find Lang's daughter.

1350
01:26:47,417 --> 01:26:48,458
Kill her.

1351
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:08,743
Let's go. Let's go!

1352
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:10,488
If you want to fight, follow me!

1353
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:16,500
<i>It's over, Cassie.</i>

1354
01:27:16,917 --> 01:27:18,583
Free the others. Go!

1355
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:27,834
He's gonna see us coming.

1356
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,083
Yeah. I'll make sure of it.

1357
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,166
Begin the launch.

1358
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,100
<i>Your dad's not here, Cassie,</i>

1359
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,208
but I guess
that's not a big surprise.

1360
01:28:51,917 --> 01:28:53,125
<i>Kang!</i>

1361
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:56,166
<i>We had a deal.</i>

1362
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:00,583
<i>You took my daughter!</i>

1363
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,959
Holy shit.

1364
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:06,208
That's big.

1365
01:29:14,959 --> 01:29:16,583
<i>You lied to me!</i>

1366
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:20,000
<i>Our word is our bond.</i>

1367
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:23,542
<i>Without that, we're nothing!</i>

1368
01:29:25,083 --> 01:29:26,792
- Bring him down.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

1369
01:29:33,542 --> 01:29:34,917
<i>Keep going.
I've got them.</i>

1370
01:29:36,875 --> 01:29:38,208
<i>Yeah, come on!</i>

1371
01:29:52,709 --> 01:29:53,917
<i>There's so many!</i>

1372
01:29:54,083 --> 01:29:56,333
<i>Scott!
I can't hold them!</i>

1373
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:08,458
<i>They came.</i>

1374
01:30:10,208 --> 01:30:12,208
<i>Way to go, Cassie!</i>

1375
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:15,709
Yes!

1376
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:18,500
<i>Come on! Let's go!</i>

1377
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,700
Revolution!

1378
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:40,500
Burn it all down.

1379
01:30:40,667 --> 01:30:42,834
Fight!

1380
01:30:59,208 --> 01:31:01,083
Cover! Get down!

1381
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:11,250
What is the bridge code?

1382
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:12,875
<i>I'll die first.</i>

1383
01:31:12,959 --> 01:31:15,125
One-eight-one-four-seven.

1384
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:16,291
<i>Damn!</i>

1385
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:32,667
You'll need this.

1386
01:31:34,625 --> 01:31:35,875
Hi.

1387
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:37,750
This is our home!

1388
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:40,166
Let's take it back!

1389
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:45,625
No!

1390
01:31:52,959 --> 01:31:54,917
I have holes.

1391
01:31:56,709 --> 01:31:59,333
I have holes!

1392
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,291
I didn't know he could do that.

1393
01:32:17,041 --> 01:32:18,041
<i>Kang!</i>

1394
01:32:18,625 --> 01:32:19,917
<i>Where is she?</i>

1395
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:21,792
Launch now!

1396
01:32:31,834 --> 01:32:33,041
<i>Whoa.</i>

1397
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:34,625
<i>What is that?</i>

1398
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,458
<i>He's getting out.</i>

1399
01:32:36,834 --> 01:32:38,000
<i>Oh, no, he's not.</i>

1400
01:32:45,709 --> 01:32:47,250
Keep him away from the rings.

1401
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:27,583
Whoa! Dad!

1402
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:31,709
Dad, I'm coming!

1403
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:44,250
Dad!

1404
01:33:52,625 --> 01:33:54,125
Nowhere left to run.

1405
01:34:03,083 --> 01:34:04,323
Please let this work.

1406
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:24,184
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

1407
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:25,250
Let's go.

1408
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:27,500
You think this is over?
Come on! Let's go.

1409
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:29,166
Darren, just stop

1410
01:34:29,583 --> 01:34:31,959
trying to be whatever this is.

1411
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:34,250
I don't know what to be.

1412
01:34:36,333 --> 01:34:37,834
Tell me what to be.

1413
01:34:38,125 --> 01:34:40,291
I don't know.
Just don't be a dick.

1414
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,458
It's too late.

1415
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,208
Look at me.

1416
01:34:45,792 --> 01:34:47,333
I'm such a dick.

1417
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:50,166
It's never too late
to stop being a dick.

1418
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:57,041
<i>We've gotta stop him.</i>

1419
01:34:58,875 --> 01:35:00,250
<i>I have an idea.</i>

1420
01:35:02,792 --> 01:35:03,792
<i>Ready?</i>

1421
01:35:03,959 --> 01:35:05,125
<i>Probably not.</i>

1422
01:35:07,917 --> 01:35:10,417
<i>One, two, three. Now!</i>

1423
01:35:33,417 --> 01:35:34,750
Dad!

1424
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Dad!

1425
01:35:36,834 --> 01:35:37,834
Cassie?

1426
01:35:39,792 --> 01:35:40,792
You're huge.

1427
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:43,291
I'm huge.

1428
01:35:46,917 --> 01:35:48,500
I love you, Peanut.

1429
01:35:48,667 --> 01:35:50,041
I love you too.

1430
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:52,000
I'm so proud of you.

1431
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,792
I feel like
I'm hugging Godzilla.

1432
01:35:54,959 --> 01:35:57,542
I know. It feels so cool.

1433
01:35:57,834 --> 01:35:59,500
I know, right?

1434
01:36:00,250 --> 01:36:01,375
I'm so hungry.

1435
01:36:01,542 --> 01:36:02,542
Yeah, that happens.

1436
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:04,875
- I could eat everything.
- Everything. I know.

1437
01:36:05,417 --> 01:36:06,750
But I really want like a lime.

1438
01:36:06,834 --> 01:36:07,834
Right?

1439
01:36:07,917 --> 01:36:10,041
- Citrus. It's weird. I know.
- Citrus.

1440
01:36:10,125 --> 01:36:11,125
It's...

1441
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,375
Take the tower!

1442
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:56,291
It's over.

1443
01:36:58,208 --> 01:37:00,208
You still can't see it.

1444
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:05,083
It's never over.

1445
01:38:21,834 --> 01:38:23,583
- We have to go, right now.
- No.

1446
01:38:23,667 --> 01:38:24,667
- Come on.
- No!

1447
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:26,142
I know, I know,
but we have to go.

1448
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:27,542
- No!
- Come on.

1449
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:18,917
<i>You son of a...</i>

1450
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:23,625
- Oh, God.
- Scott.

1451
01:39:23,917 --> 01:39:24,917
Come on.

1452
01:39:29,667 --> 01:39:32,291
You think this is new to me?

1453
01:39:33,625 --> 01:39:38,333
Do you know how many
rebellions I have put down?

1454
01:39:40,041 --> 01:39:41,583
No, no, no, no, no.

1455
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:45,166
How many worlds I've conquered?

1456
01:39:46,041 --> 01:39:48,250
How many Avengers I've killed?

1457
01:39:48,417 --> 01:39:50,959
And you think you can beat me?

1458
01:39:51,125 --> 01:39:52,709
I am Kang!

1459
01:39:52,792 --> 01:39:53,834
You...

1460
01:39:54,875 --> 01:39:57,125
You talk to ants.

1461
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,542
My name is Darren,

1462
01:41:19,709 --> 01:41:24,250
and I am not a dick!

1463
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:47,000
Sorry I'm late.

1464
01:41:49,291 --> 01:41:50,542
Lotta ants.

1465
01:41:51,959 --> 01:41:52,959
Oh, is this you?

1466
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:56,542
Maybe you were right
about me, Cassie.

1467
01:41:57,834 --> 01:41:58,834
Darren.

1468
01:42:00,625 --> 01:42:01,625
Are you okay?

1469
01:42:04,375 --> 01:42:05,667
Probably not.

1470
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,667
- Darren?
- Hi, Hope.

1471
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:11,083
You changed your hair.

1472
01:42:13,834 --> 01:42:15,709
What the hell happened?

1473
01:42:16,458 --> 01:42:17,458
Yeah. No, it's...

1474
01:42:17,834 --> 01:42:19,394
It's a whole thing.
I'll tell you later.

1475
01:42:20,083 --> 01:42:21,083
That was... I...

1476
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:23,041
I don't know what to say.

1477
01:42:23,625 --> 01:42:24,917
Thanks, Scott.

1478
01:42:25,542 --> 01:42:28,750
You always were a brother to me.

1479
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:31,875
I was?

1480
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:40,834
I was.

1481
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,667
And at least I died

1482
01:42:58,208 --> 01:42:59,750
an Avenger.

1483
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,041
Yeah.

1484
01:43:05,083 --> 01:43:06,750
- You did.
- Yeah. No, it's...

1485
01:43:06,834 --> 01:43:08,375
You're in.

1486
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:26,041
A lot has happened today.

1487
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:28,000
<i>- Henry?
- Janet?</i>

1488
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:30,000
- Mom, where are you?
<i>- I'm in the tower.</i>

1489
01:43:30,166 --> 01:43:32,166
I think I can give us
one shot back.

1490
01:43:32,333 --> 01:43:34,125
But we don't have much time.

1491
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:35,959
If we wanna go home...

1492
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:39,834
we have to go now.

1493
01:43:40,458 --> 01:43:41,458
We'll finish this.

1494
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:44,792
Thank you.

1495
01:43:45,875 --> 01:43:47,250
Thank you.

1496
01:43:47,333 --> 01:43:48,750
Oh, wow!

1497
01:43:48,834 --> 01:43:50,375
Come on! Let's go!

1498
01:43:50,542 --> 01:43:51,750
All right. Good luck.

1499
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:53,166
Good luck.
Come on.

1500
01:44:23,875 --> 01:44:24,875
Thanks, buddy.

1501
01:44:27,208 --> 01:44:28,208
You did it.

1502
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,125
Let's go home.

1503
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Where's Scott?

1504
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:57,709
He was right behind me.

1505
01:45:40,792 --> 01:45:42,375
You should've
looked the other way.

1506
01:45:42,542 --> 01:45:45,208
Yeah, well,
never been great at that.

1507
01:45:53,166 --> 01:45:54,625
And you're not getting out.

1508
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:06,625
I want you to remember.

1509
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:09,667
You could've gone home.

1510
01:46:24,834 --> 01:46:26,875
You could've seen
your daughter again.

1511
01:46:40,625 --> 01:46:42,041
But you thought you could win.

1512
01:46:55,417 --> 01:46:56,917
I don't have to win.

1513
01:46:58,458 --> 01:47:00,375
We both just have to lose.

1514
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:52,834
Dad!

1515
01:47:59,959 --> 01:48:00,959
Where... Where...

1516
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,333
Where is she? Is she...

1517
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:03,792
- No, she's okay.
- Where is she?

1518
01:48:03,875 --> 01:48:05,625
She's okay.
She's okay. She's okay.

1519
01:48:05,709 --> 01:48:07,184
- Scott, they're all okay.
- She's safe?

1520
01:48:07,208 --> 01:48:08,583
They're all okay. You did it.

1521
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:09,750
You did it.

1522
01:48:13,166 --> 01:48:15,083
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.
- No, no, no.

1523
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:16,667
No, don't let go.
Don't let go.

1524
01:48:17,291 --> 01:48:18,458
Don't let go.

1525
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:19,875
Don't ever let go.

1526
01:48:21,542 --> 01:48:22,875
I got you.

1527
01:48:25,667 --> 01:48:26,834
You came back.

1528
01:48:37,208 --> 01:48:38,500
I love you, Hope.

1529
01:48:41,166 --> 01:48:42,500
I love you, Scott.

1530
01:49:56,375 --> 01:49:57,709
Let's go home.

1531
01:50:00,375 --> 01:50:01,583
Home's good.

1532
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,667
<i>My life doesn't make sense.</i>

1533
01:50:11,834 --> 01:50:14,125
<i>I used to ask myself
a lot of questions about that.</i>

1534
01:50:14,208 --> 01:50:15,542
- Ah.
<i>- "Scott you just saved</i>

1535
01:50:15,625 --> 01:50:17,041
<i>"the Quantum Realm
with your family</i>

1536
01:50:17,208 --> 01:50:19,083
<i>"and drank a guy without holes.</i>

1537
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:21,500
<i>"Why does this kind of stuff
keep happening to you?</i>

1538
01:50:21,667 --> 01:50:23,166
<i>"That doesn't make any sense."</i>

1539
01:50:23,333 --> 01:50:24,834
<i>But you know what?</i>

1540
01:50:24,917 --> 01:50:26,875
<i>Who said life has to make sense?</i>

1541
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:32,208
Rubin!

1542
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:34,750
You are the bug!

1543
01:50:34,834 --> 01:50:37,333
I was wrong. Yeah.
You are the other bug.

1544
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:38,792
You're the bug man.

1545
01:50:38,959 --> 01:50:41,542
You get big and get small
like a big bug!

1546
01:50:42,208 --> 01:50:44,834
You're right. That's me.
Just a coffee, please.

1547
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Twelve dollar.

1548
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:47,375
Oh.

1549
01:50:47,834 --> 01:50:48,875
Twelve!

1550
01:50:49,041 --> 01:50:51,583
<i>I used to wonder if this
chapter in my life was over,</i>

1551
01:50:51,750 --> 01:50:53,083
<i>but as Cassie reminded me,</i>

1552
01:50:53,166 --> 01:50:54,917
<i>"There's always someone
you can help."</i>

1553
01:50:55,709 --> 01:50:58,083
Came out of cake making
retirement for you.

1554
01:51:00,542 --> 01:51:01,542
Wow.

1555
01:51:02,166 --> 01:51:03,542
You... You made this yourself?

1556
01:51:03,625 --> 01:51:05,125
Yeah! I don't usually
make the cakes.

1557
01:51:05,208 --> 01:51:06,208
I know.

1558
01:51:06,291 --> 01:51:08,125
This is the first one
I've made since 1997.

1559
01:51:08,291 --> 01:51:09,500
You're a real artist.

1560
01:51:09,667 --> 01:51:11,625
<i>It's been a pretty wild ride.</i>

1561
01:51:11,792 --> 01:51:14,208
<i>One day you're fired
from Baskin-Robbins,</i>

1562
01:51:14,375 --> 01:51:17,166
<i>the next you're beating
a time-traveling space king.</i>

1563
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:20,208
<i>We did beat him, right?</i>

1564
01:51:21,667 --> 01:51:22,851
<i>I mean, yeah,
that's what happened.</i>

1565
01:51:22,875 --> 01:51:25,208
<i>He... He was getting out
and he didn't get out.</i>

1566
01:51:26,667 --> 01:51:27,750
<i>I think.</i>

1567
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:31,834
<i>But he also said
something bad was coming</i>

1568
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:34,709
<i>and that everyone would die
if he didn't get out.</i>

1569
01:51:35,875 --> 01:51:38,125
<i>Wait.
So, did I just kill everyone?</i>

1570
01:51:38,834 --> 01:51:40,875
<i>Is everyone gonna die
because of me?</i>

1571
01:51:41,041 --> 01:51:43,208
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1572
01:51:43,291 --> 01:51:44,750
<i>Oh, my... What did I do?</i>

1573
01:51:45,291 --> 01:51:46,875
<i>What... What did...</i>

1574
01:51:46,959 --> 01:51:48,333
<i>What did I do?</i>

1575
01:51:50,792 --> 01:51:52,500
<i>You know what?</i>

1576
01:51:52,583 --> 01:51:54,417
<i>It's probably fine.</i>

1577
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,583
<i>Like I said,
life doesn't make any sense,</i>

1578
01:51:56,750 --> 01:51:59,875
<i>so maybe stop asking
so many questions, Scott.</i>

1579
01:52:00,041 --> 01:52:01,500
<i>Stop overthinking it.</i>

1580
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,792
Surprise!

1581
01:52:05,959 --> 01:52:10,083
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

1582
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:12,625
It's not my birthday.

1583
01:52:12,792 --> 01:52:15,291
I know. But I missed a few.

1584
01:52:17,709 --> 01:52:19,583
<i>This is good.
We're all together.</i>

1585
01:52:19,959 --> 01:52:21,375
<i>You're fine.</i>

1586
01:52:21,542 --> 01:52:24,458
<i>Everything's probably fine.</i>

1587
01:52:24,625 --> 01:52:26,959
<i>Kang's gone. You did it.</i>

1588
01:52:28,083 --> 01:52:29,792
<i>Don't have to worry
about that guy anymore.</i>

1589
01:52:29,875 --> 01:52:31,041
Ah. Thanks.

1590
01:52:34,542 --> 01:52:36,542
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

1591
01:52:40,667 --> 01:52:42,125
Oh.

1592
01:55:14,375 --> 01:55:18,000
So, the exiled one is dead.

1593
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:22,208
You sure he's dead?

1594
01:55:22,834 --> 01:55:25,709
If it wasn't true,
I wouldn't call you.

1595
01:55:26,333 --> 01:55:27,667
Must really eat you up,

1596
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:29,458
that you're not
the one who killed him.

1597
01:55:29,792 --> 01:55:32,458
None of us

1598
01:55:33,291 --> 01:55:35,000
killed him.

1599
01:55:37,291 --> 01:55:38,667
They did.

1600
01:55:39,542 --> 01:55:44,083
They're beginning to touch
the Multiverse.

1601
01:55:44,750 --> 01:55:46,208
And if we let them,

1602
01:55:46,667 --> 01:55:48,500
they will take...

1603
01:55:49,917 --> 01:55:51,542
everything

1604
01:55:52,458 --> 01:55:54,458
we've built.

1605
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:58,041
So let's stop wasting time.

1606
01:56:01,709 --> 01:56:02,917
We're late.

1607
01:56:04,917 --> 01:56:07,250
How many did you call?

1608
01:56:07,583 --> 01:56:10,000
All of us.

1609
02:03:32,875 --> 02:03:37,917
Time is everything.

1610
02:03:43,166 --> 02:03:46,166
It shapes our lives.

1611
02:03:47,458 --> 02:03:51,417
But, perhaps, we can shape...

1612
02:03:53,208 --> 02:03:54,291
it.

1613
02:03:55,542 --> 02:03:56,667
It's him.

1614
02:03:57,083 --> 02:03:58,393
What?
You made him sound

1615
02:03:58,417 --> 02:04:00,375
like this terrifying figure.

1616
02:04:02,041 --> 02:04:03,125
He is.
