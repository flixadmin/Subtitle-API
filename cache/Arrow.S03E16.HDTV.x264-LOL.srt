1
00:00:00,404 --> 00:00:02,577
My name
is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,578 --> 00:00:04,356
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:04,358 --> 00:00:06,372
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,246
to save my city.

5
00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:10,385
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:12,761
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:16,169
To the rest of Starling City,
I am someone else.

8
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:19,305
I am...something else.

9
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:20,742
Previously, on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:22,481
I killed Sara.

11
00:00:22,483 --> 00:00:24,848
Malcolm gave me something
that made me

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,951
susceptible to suggestion.

13
00:00:26,953 --> 00:00:28,614
What happened wasn't
your fault, Thea,

14
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,381
because it wasn't
your decision.

15
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:32,747
Malcolm? He's going
to face justice.

16
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:36,791
He's gone. Malcolm Merlyn
will never be seen again.

17
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:41,259
Welcome to Nanda Parbat.

18
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:43,561
When I told you
that Malcolm killed Sara,

19
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:45,789
he wanted her dead,
but I am the one

20
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,027
who fired those arrows
into her chest.

21
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:50,330
I promised you your vengeance.

22
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,496
So take it.

23
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,827
Kill me.

24
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,032
But spare
John Diggle's life.

25
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,827
Let him go.

26
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,221
I will beg for it.

27
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:12,426
You've shown
tremendous strength,

28
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:14,086
fortitude,

29
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,187
and power.

30
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:19,422
No, Mr. Queen...

31
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:23,417
I don't want to kill you.

32
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:25,783
I want you to take my place.

33
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:30,884
I want you to become
the next Ra's al Ghul.

34
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:34,426
Ra's is a title greater
than any one man.

35
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,726
Wing ta Lao wo chey.

36
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:44,920
Am I supposed to understand
what that means?

37
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:49,460
No. It is from a dialect
no longer spoken.

38
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:52,323
Said to me by a man
whose place I took.

39
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:55,656
Contemplating the same offer.

40
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,989
And what it means is,

41
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:00,659
a tale to be told...

42
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:02,727
begins thus.

43
00:02:11,527 --> 00:02:12,987
Ayy!

44
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:38,698
Don't let your footing
betray you.

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,896
Let your power come not from
the strength of your attack

46
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:43,230
but from the ground
that holds your feet.

47
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:52,302
All men seek guidance,
a purpose.

48
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:55,572
The means to live
without pain.

49
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:58,664
Those who journey here have given
such an exchange

50
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,397
for their fealty.

51
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:04,636
You mean they have
to kill for you?

52
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:10,412
No, Mr. Queen,
they have to die for me.

53
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:24,622
Is all of this supposed
to impress me?

54
00:03:24,624 --> 00:03:26,662
No.

55
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,997
It's to inform you.

56
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:32,364
Surely men have
branded you a murderer,

57
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:34,163
a torturer.

58
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:39,433
But see, I would never
shame you with such bluntness.

59
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:43,606
Because I see it
in your eyes.

60
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:47,173
The struggle you have
with your dual identity.

61
00:03:47,175 --> 00:03:49,846
Oliver Queen and the Arrow.

62
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:52,279
Neither are giving you
what you crave.

63
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,983
But becoming
Ra's al Ghul will?

64
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:59,120
Oliver Queen is a man
destined to be alone.

65
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:02,590
He loves a woman
he knows he cannot have.

66
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:04,155
You don't know me.

67
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:05,689
But I know the Arrow.

68
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:08,351
"Al Sahhim."
You will never be

69
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:11,323
anything more than a vigilante
for those whose lives you save

70
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,353
at the risk of your own.

71
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:17,158
And the city will turn on you,

72
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,554
and your closest allies
within the police department

73
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:21,816
will call you a criminal.

74
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:24,055
You will be scorned

75
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:26,053
and hunted,

76
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:27,692
and then killed.

77
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,953
Dying as you began
your crusade...

78
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:35,852
Alone.

79
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,876

81
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:54,140
Your brother attempted to have me
believe that he killed Sara.

82
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:55,909
Your confession
is even less convincing.

83
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:57,876
I don't have
any reason to lie!

84
00:04:57,878 --> 00:04:59,180
Except to protect your father.

85
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:00,580
Why would I
protect Malcolm

86
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:03,020
when I turned him
over to you?

87
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:05,516
He gave me a drug
called Votura.

88
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:07,388
I put three arrows
into her chest,

89
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,292
and I had no idea
what I was doing.

90
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:12,229
He used me.

91
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:16,661
Someone she trusted.

92
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:18,365
So I don't deserve
to be living

93
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,333
any more than
Malcolm does!

94
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:23,804
There would be no justice
in killing you.

95
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:27,540
I killed Sara!

96
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,612
Kill me.

97
00:05:29,614 --> 00:05:30,781
Do it.

98
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:33,413
Do it.

99
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:38,255
The blood debt ends
with Malcolm's death.

100
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:41,594
Which, I can assure you,
my father has taken care of already.

101
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:42,994
Thea!

102
00:05:42,996 --> 00:05:45,130
Get away from her!

103
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,845
Nyssa, no!

104
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:04,364
Are you ok?

105
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:07,000
How the hell...

106
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:08,400
Did she get out?

107
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:11,812
It's League training,
probably.

108
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:13,581
What were you doing down
here in the first place?

109
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,486
I just wanted
to pay my respects.

110
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:23,086
It was Herodotus
who first wrote of these waters.

111
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:26,526
And Ponce de Deon traveled
the earth in search of them.

112
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:29,800
And their discovery by Al-Khidr

113
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:32,368
is chronicled in the Qu'ran.

114
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,840
And they have permitted me

115
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:38,040
to live way beyond my time.

116
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:42,448
You don't seem too fazed
by what I've told you.

117
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:46,586
I've seen things that
have helped me to believe

118
00:06:46,588 --> 00:06:52,122
that this world is a much bigger place
than people realize.

119
00:06:52,124 --> 00:06:55,858
As I told you
on the mountain, boy,

120
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,833
man can only evade
death for so long.

121
00:07:00,835 --> 00:07:02,465
The waters' powers

122
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:05,568
are losing
their effect on me.

123
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,367
My time is almost over,

124
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:10,671
but my legacy won't be
just ash and bone,

125
00:07:10,673 --> 00:07:12,343
it will be history.

126
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:16,542
And you think that I'll help you
secure that legacy?

127
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:18,949
You survived my sword.

128
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:21,845
Your resurrection wasn't a gift
from these waters,

129
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:25,821
rather by force
of your own will.

130
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:28,189
And what better heir
to immortality

131
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,789
than someone who has already claimed
victory over death?

132
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:35,061
I didn't defy death
just to become an instrument of it.

133
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,997
We are justice.

134
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,637
Isn't that what
you've dedicated your life to?

135
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,405
Then why confine your crusade
to a single city...

136
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:50,243
When I can give you
a whole world to save.

137
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:53,580
By executing anyone who
stands in my way?

138
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,789
You would command resources
that you cannot even fathom.

139
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,325
Numbers greater than any army.

140
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:05,789
And more loyal.

141
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:11,367
Now, if you wish for them
to renounce killing as you did,

142
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:14,872
thy will be done.

143
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:17,209
I doubt that.
It's called

144
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:19,377
the League of Assassins
for a reason.

145
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,313
The League's reason
would be your own.

146
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:27,418
You would be Ra's al Ghul.

147
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,298
And what if I say no?

148
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,203
Then you are free
to leave.

149
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:48,778
With your compatriots,

150
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,209
as a gesture of good will.

151
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,447
All debts forgiven,

152
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,215
and all blood oaths waived.

153
00:09:09,497 --> 00:09:12,833
Let's go home.

154
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:34,171
Really need to stop having these
"thank god you're not dead" reunions.

155
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,837
I agree.

156
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,542
- I'm working on it.
- You look ok.

157
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,047
Are you ok?

158
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,544
I'm fine.
Not even a scratch.

159
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,353
How is that
possible?

160
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:48,456
How did you get him back?

161
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,321
Doesn't matter.
What matters is,

162
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,961
you didn't kill him.

163
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:54,329
No, I wanted Ra's
to kill him.

164
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:56,529
And I still do.

165
00:09:56,531 --> 00:09:57,079
Thea...

166
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:58,866
He's not staying here.

167
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:01,265
You and I both know
there's nowhere else I can take him.

168
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,305
If you think I feel bad for him,
you're wrong.

169
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:04,810
I'm not asking you
to feel bad for him;

170
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,243
I'm not asking you
to forgive him.

171
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:10,147
Just let him heal.

172
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:13,747
I have to go.

173
00:10:21,226 --> 00:10:23,319
How did Thea react
to her new house guest?

174
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:24,714
Fine.

175
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:25,960
That bad, huh?

176
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:28,463
Did she ask how we
made it back from Nanda Parbat alive?

177
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:29,759
Well, I didn't
get into it with her.

178
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:30,927
Well, how about me,
Oliver?

179
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:31,999
Like I said,

180
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,296
Ra's had a change of heart.

181
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,104
Ra's Al Ghul
doesn't have a heart.

182
00:10:35,106 --> 00:10:36,672
Two months ago, he kicked you off
the side of a mountain

183
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:38,440
and put a sword through you.

184
00:10:38,442 --> 00:10:40,672
Now he's giving you Malcolm Merlyn back
all gift wrapped?

185
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:42,944
Diggle, we're back.
We're alive.

186
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:45,480
Let's just be
grateful for that.

187
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:51,323
What's the Chinese
word for ok?

188
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,796
Or, how do you say
ok in Mandarin?

189
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:55,767
"Hao Ba."

190
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,672
Ok, everything
is going to be "hao Ba."

191
00:10:57,674 --> 00:10:59,513
I want to go home!

192
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:01,315
Yeah, I--I know,
buddy,

193
00:11:01,317 --> 00:11:02,947
but home's not
really safe right now.

194
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:05,283
Because those men
tried to hurt us?

195
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:08,354
Yeah. Because
of those men.

196
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:10,153
In fact, Akio,
we shouldn't

197
00:11:10,155 --> 00:11:11,152
even really
be out in open.

198
00:11:11,154 --> 00:11:14,159
Akio!

199
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:27,703
Oliver?

200
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:30,902
Hey, look, you cannot
disappear like that!

201
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:32,510
I thought I saw
my father,

202
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:34,312
but it wasn't him.

203
00:11:34,314 --> 00:11:37,582
Look, I--I--I get it,
I get it, and I'm sorry.

204
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:39,646
We--we can't get separated.

205
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:42,979
The botanical gardens!
The what?

206
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:44,850
Mother and father always
told me to go there

207
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:46,282
if we ever got
separated.

208
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:48,386
Ok...

209
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:50,184
Come on!

210
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:56,822
Well, thank God.

211
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:58,558
You know, just because
I'm furious with you,

212
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,861
that doesn't mean
I want you dead.

213
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:01,660
What about Malcolm?

214
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:03,529
I mean, I know Laurel
wants him dead, I mean, is he?

215
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:05,696
Nope.

216
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:06,863
We got him back.

217
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:08,527
Well, I suppose
congrats,

218
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,398
and why, oh, why,
did you do that, are in order.

219
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,797
Oliver.

220
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,270
Oliver, what are you doing?!

221
00:12:16,272 --> 00:12:17,702
You're free to go.

222
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,514
My father would never trade
my life for yours.

223
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:25,379
And he certainly wouldn't do it for
Malcolm Merlyn's.

224
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:26,515
He didn't.

225
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:27,555
If no bargain
was struck,

226
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:29,788
then how are you
still alive?

227
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,589
Go home, Nyssa.

228
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,966
Ok. Well,

229
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:39,867
I don't understand
anything anymore.

230
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:41,563
Why did Ra's Al Ghul--
it doesn't matter.

231
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:43,370
Let's focus on what does.

232
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:46,232
Somewhere, this is someone
that needs a reminder

233
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:48,935
that we are still
watching over this city.

234
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,381
Well, there is
a robbery in progress

235
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:01,714
at the Kingston
Property depot on Third.

236
00:13:01,716 --> 00:13:03,577
New shipment just arrived.

237
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:05,414
I'm assuming whatever it is,
it's worth a lot of money.

238
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:07,072
Ok. Suit up.

239
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:08,939
Oliver...

240
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:11,600
Suit up.

241
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:14,730
I just want to get
this shipment done.

242
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,982
Excuse me. We're looking
for the Catoca shipment.

243
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:18,486
Maybe you could help?

244
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:24,596
The Catoca shipment.
Where is it?

245
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,236
I don't know!

246
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:30,108
Sorry.

247
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,418
Boss says
check the crates

248
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,313
for a Catoca manifest.

249
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:03,137
Drop it!

250
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:14,992
Look out!

251
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:32,014
You still need
training.

252
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:33,855
When are you going
to stop telling me that?

253
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:35,487
When you no longer
need training.

254
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:37,054
Arsenal.

255
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:40,726
The head guy got away...
With these.

256
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:57,018
Ran into a new player tonight who
dropped some bodies.

257
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,122
I need a name.

258
00:14:59,124 --> 00:15:00,658
One of these four
will give him up.

259
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,360
Yeah.

260
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:05,496
Well, when he does, you can
read about it in the papers.

261
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:09,171
Detective?

262
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:11,173
It's captain now!

263
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:12,677
When were you going
to tell me, huh?

264
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,340
Or were you going to tell me?

265
00:15:16,244 --> 00:15:18,105
You really going
to stand there

266
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:20,513
still pretending like you didn't know
my daughter was dead?

267
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:23,247
Uh, Captain Lance...

268
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:25,182
My whole career,

269
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:27,212
my whole life,
even when I knew nothing,

270
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:28,883
I at least knew
right from wrong.

271
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:30,610
And I knew
vigilantism was wrong.

272
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:33,750
The day we take the law
into our own hands is a day that we--

273
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:36,045
we become outlaws.

274
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:39,316
And that idea--that idea
was precious to me.

275
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:43,050
Almost as precious
as my own daughters.

276
00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:47,856
I threw that all away
the day I threw in with you.

277
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:50,728
You know why?

278
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,192
'Cause I trusted you.

279
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:57,600
But I see the man
under the hood now.

280
00:15:57,602 --> 00:16:02,233
He lies,
and he keeps secrets.

281
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:04,273
All so he doesn't
have to carry around

282
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:06,441
the weight of his decisions.

283
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:10,881
And I'm done with him.

284
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:22,725
What would you say
if I told you

285
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:26,530
I just connected the virtual TCP to
the open source sensor?

286
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:28,393
I would say you only
think you did,

287
00:16:28,395 --> 00:16:30,831
because I've been trying to figure
that out for over two weeks.

288
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,429
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

289
00:16:32,431 --> 00:16:35,798
I have been trying
for at least two full minutes.

290
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,437
Ah! Let me see.

291
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:41,100
Oh, you don't
believe me.

292
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:44,431
Well, no, I'll just, uh,
make sure you did it right.

293
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:45,733
Oh, and if
I'm right?

294
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:47,164
Then I will take you

295
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,867
to the best steak dinner
you've ever had.

296
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:50,138
Hmm.

297
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:53,304
Which, I'd probably do anyway.

298
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:55,641
Well, I hope it's better than
that fusion place you took me to,

299
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:57,641
where I needed this microscope
to find the food.

300
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:02,212
Oliver, hey.
What are you doing here?

301
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:05,442
I mean, it's nice
to see you here.

302
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:07,177
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Palmer.

303
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:08,313
Likewise.

304
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:10,178
And please,
call me Ray.

305
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,451
Ok. Ray.

306
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:14,451
May I speak with Felicity
for a few minutes, please?

307
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:17,958
Uh, absolutely.
Thank you.

308
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:25,132
Should have called.

309
00:17:25,134 --> 00:17:27,468
No. I'm sorry,
I should have told you earlier

310
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,036
when you got
back.

311
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:30,000
You don't owe me anything.

312
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:31,172
That's not true.

313
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:32,602
You're one of my
closest friends.

314
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:36,906
We went up against
a new crew last night.

315
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:38,674
One of them had his
lips sewn shut.

316
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:39,946
Is that
a real thing?

317
00:17:39,948 --> 00:17:41,314
Apparently.

318
00:17:41,316 --> 00:17:44,514
Ugh. If only I had known
I have that option.

319
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:47,682
Ok.

320
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:51,054
Michael Amar?

321
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:52,056
Yeah.

322
00:17:52,073 --> 00:17:53,019
Hmm.

323
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,480
Street name's "Murmur"
because of the whole lip stitch thing.

324
00:17:55,482 --> 00:18:00,258
Practitioners say it focuses
the mind like meditation.

325
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,396
You ok?

326
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:05,702
I handed some of Amar's men
over to Lance.

327
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:08,638
He knows the Arrow
knew about Sara, didn't tell him.

328
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,174
What did Lance say?

329
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:12,510
Some variation
on "Go to hell."

330
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:13,806
Oliver, he just
needs time.

331
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:15,046
No, he's right.

332
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:18,510
I lied to him. For months.

333
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:23,085
Kept something from him,
and he had every right to know.

334
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:25,085
Are you ok?

335
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,452
I mean, besides Lance

336
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:29,491
and the whole
me and Ray thing?

337
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:32,754
I mean, it just seems like there's
something else going on

338
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:34,122
underneath all that.

339
00:18:34,124 --> 00:18:35,562
I'm fine.

340
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:37,427
Thanks for help
with Amar's name.

341
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,538
Oliver's not here.

342
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,408
Actually, I came by to
see how you were doing.

343
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,542
He told you that
Malcolm was here?

344
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,941
Go ahead.

345
00:18:55,943 --> 00:18:59,276
I'm the last person
to stop you from killing him.

346
00:18:59,278 --> 00:19:02,640
My last attempt to do so
didn't exactly work out.

347
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:08,280
That's kind of why
I'm here.

348
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:10,216
I'm worried
about you.

349
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:13,319
Everyone's so interested
in saving my soul these days.

350
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:15,759
Look, no one wants
to see Merlyn dead

351
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:18,158
more than me.

352
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,461
But Oliver was right.

353
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,598
You wanted your own
father killed.

354
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,798
Yeah, and how
messed up is that?

355
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,135
You know, I wish that I never learned
Malcolm was my father.

356
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:34,774
Everything since then
has just...

357
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:44,817
You know,
you're lucky, Laurel.

358
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:47,849
You have a normal father.

359
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:49,552
Someone who really loves you.

360
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:52,054
Yeah, I can't say we're on
the best of terms.

361
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:58,787
You should
probably go.

362
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,862
How much of that
did you hear?

363
00:20:07,864 --> 00:20:10,858
Enough to know
that I am the last person

364
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,593
you wish to see alive.

365
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:16,298
I'm not going
to apologize for what I did.

366
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,033
And I'd do it again.

367
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:21,136
I know.

368
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,302
You asked me
to teach you to be strong.

369
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:28,437
To make sure
you can't be hurt again.

370
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,940
You learned
your lessons well.

371
00:20:30,942 --> 00:20:34,705
I have learned
nothing from you.

372
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:37,808
Do you realize
that I'm so messed up,

373
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,175
I was willing
to die last night?

374
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:43,342
For what you made me do?

375
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:47,045
You know, I didn't
actually think it was possible

376
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:50,284
for me to hurt any worse
than I did when I came to you.

377
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:53,283
You proved to me
I was wrong.

378
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:57,659
So what was it again
that you taught me?

379
00:20:57,661 --> 00:20:59,555
Show me the knife.

380
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:04,695
How did you know?

381
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:08,271
You are my daughter.

382
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:10,734
Do it like I taught
you--one strike to the neck,

383
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,205
it'll be over
quickly.

384
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:14,099
You're sick.

385
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:17,232
I love you, and I
want to do what is best for you.

386
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,039
If that were even close
to being true,

387
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,638
you would have stayed
out of my life.

388
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:35,180
Father.

389
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:36,883
Oh.

390
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:39,082
Your safe return
pleases me, my child.

391
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:40,921
Then extend me the courtesy
of explaining why

392
00:21:40,923 --> 00:21:42,857
Malcolm Merlyn is still alive.

393
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,160
If you're not going
to watch your tongue,

394
00:21:48,162 --> 00:21:50,527
then at least
mind your tone.

395
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:52,495
Why did you release
Al-Sahfer's murderer?

396
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:54,934
As a gift
to Oliver Queen.

397
00:21:54,936 --> 00:21:57,599
An advance for him
becoming my heir.

398
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:01,100
You've selected an outsider
over your own daughter?

399
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:03,370
He survived my sword.

400
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,239
Sara...

401
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:12,510
You're punishing
my love for her.

402
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:17,013
At least do me
the courtesy of admitting it.

403
00:22:17,015 --> 00:22:19,012
You never approved.
I never approved

404
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:21,715
of you allowing
weakness into your life.

405
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:24,178
And even in death,
your devotion to her

406
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,018
pollutes
your judgment.

407
00:23:00,406 --> 00:23:02,380
Target's name
is Michael Amar.

408
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,737
Yeah, got him here.

409
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:05,702
Got out of Iron Heights
two months ago.

410
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,387
Did he escape?

411
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:09,649
No, released. Turns out
he was serving a sentence

412
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:11,259
based on a coerced confession.

413
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:13,395
Cops beat it out of him.

414
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:15,595
He confessed to a crime
he didn't commit?

415
00:23:15,597 --> 00:23:18,026
I might sew
my mouth shut, too.

416
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:20,393
He's not innocent anymore.
What was he after tonight?

417
00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:23,664
His crew made off with a couple
of crates, all containing these--

418
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,400
industrial grade diamonds.
But word on the street

419
00:23:26,402 --> 00:23:28,071
is this shipment was loaded
with high end jewels they didn't take.

420
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,567
Why would he steal
worthless diamonds?

421
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:31,438
That's the million
dollar question.

422
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,638
Actually, street value's
only worth a couple thousand.

423
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,079
We could use
Felicity on this, Oliver.

424
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,575
She's
pre-occupied.

425
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:41,848
I know a couple of fences
from my less socially responsible days.

426
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,352
I could talk to them,
see if I can find out

427
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:46,223
where Amar is trying
to move these diamonds.

428
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,359
That's a good idea.

429
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:02,669
You want to tell me
what's going on now?

430
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,275
Ra's predicted this.

431
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:10,737
He said that the city
would turn against me

432
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:12,672
and I would die alone.

433
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:15,909
And we come back,
and the first thing that happens

434
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:17,709
is Lance is shutting me out,

435
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:19,812
and...

436
00:24:19,814 --> 00:24:22,685
I see Felicity with Palmer.

437
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:25,686
It's like he looked
into my future.

438
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:28,190
Sounds to me like
Ra's is playing with your head.

439
00:24:28,192 --> 00:24:30,359
Question is, why are
you letting him?

440
00:24:30,361 --> 00:24:33,496
He wants me to take his place
in the League of Assassins.

441
00:24:33,498 --> 00:24:36,566
That's why he let us go.

442
00:24:36,568 --> 00:24:38,862
As a sign of good faith.

443
00:24:38,864 --> 00:24:42,135
Is there even a world
where he can imagine you saying yes?

444
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:44,976
He said that I can do more
as the new Ra's

445
00:24:44,978 --> 00:24:49,313
than I could ever do
as Oliver Queen or the Arrow.

446
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:52,680
That I would have
unlimited resources.

447
00:24:52,682 --> 00:24:55,750
That I could make
a difference, not just a dent.

448
00:24:55,752 --> 00:24:58,381
You're not really
considering this.

449
00:24:58,383 --> 00:25:00,788
Just because
Captain Lance is angry

450
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,852
and Felicity
is momentarily unavailable.

451
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:04,955
It's more than that.

452
00:25:04,957 --> 00:25:07,457
I just...

453
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:10,623
John, tell me honestly...

454
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,430
What have we accomplished?

455
00:25:14,432 --> 00:25:17,030
Oliver...

456
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:20,198
All the people that
we put away, John, they got out.

457
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,438
The city is no better off.

458
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,902
The Arrow is not...

459
00:25:24,904 --> 00:25:28,541
Is not making a difference.

460
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:33,877
And if I just
can't be me...

461
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:38,213
And the Arrow
isn't enough...

462
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:39,653
Oliver...

463
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:46,959
Then maybe I should
be Ra's al Ghul.

464
00:25:57,062 --> 00:25:59,637
Is Malcolm still alive?

465
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:02,733
In my head, I've already slit his
throat seven times.

466
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:04,910
Broke his neck twice.

467
00:26:04,912 --> 00:26:07,175
Sorry that I had
to bring him here.

468
00:26:09,578 --> 00:26:14,751
Been trying to remember
who I was before mom died.

469
00:26:14,753 --> 00:26:17,918
Before Malcolm...

470
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,293
And I don't recognize her.

471
00:26:24,895 --> 00:26:27,965
I couldn't even fathom

472
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:31,100
killing someone, and...

473
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:34,299
in the last month,

474
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,866
I've held a gun
to Slade Wilson's head

475
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:40,369
and nearly took
my father's life twice.

476
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:42,777
But you didn't kill
either of them.

477
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,809
You know why I didn't
kill Malcolm?

478
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:49,450
Mom.

479
00:26:52,422 --> 00:26:55,251
I thought what
she'd think about

480
00:26:55,253 --> 00:26:58,627
her daughter becoming
a murderer just like him.

481
00:26:58,629 --> 00:27:00,323
Thea...

482
00:27:00,325 --> 00:27:01,962
You're nothing like him.

483
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:04,866
There's something
broken inside of me

484
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:08,634
just like there's something broken
inside of him.

485
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,199
Nothing can change that.

486
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:16,942
Where are you going?

487
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:19,268
To go buy
my evil dad some soup.

488
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:27,673
One big,
happy family.

489
00:27:27,675 --> 00:27:29,440
What did you do to her?!

490
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:31,238
I encouraged her
to kill me.

491
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,267
My version of being
a supportive father.

492
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:35,908
Yeah, you really are insane.

493
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,242
Perhaps. But I'm
not the only one.

494
00:27:39,244 --> 00:27:42,145
Or do you doubt
that Ra's would release us both

495
00:27:42,147 --> 00:27:45,378
without conditions?

496
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,850
No conditions.

497
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:49,881
An offer.

498
00:27:49,883 --> 00:27:52,286
To take his place.

499
00:27:54,351 --> 00:27:56,988
You don't seem surprised.

500
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,019
I don't put much
stock in augury.

501
00:27:59,021 --> 00:28:01,386
But there is a prophecy.

502
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,953
The man that doesn't
perish at the blade of Ra's Al Ghul

503
00:28:03,955 --> 00:28:07,455
will become
Ra's al Ghul.

504
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,031
Ra's al Ghul doesn't
offer, he orders.

505
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:17,071
Oliver!

506
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:20,605
Don't delude yourself
into thinking you have a choice.

507
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:28,283
Hey, what are
those bamboo things called?

508
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:30,483
Hey, Akio, come on,
all right, it's ok.

509
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:32,123
"Hao Ba."

510
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,891
You need to remember
that you're strong, right?

511
00:28:33,893 --> 00:28:35,027
Just like my sister.

512
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:36,660
You have a sister?
I do!

513
00:28:36,662 --> 00:28:39,995
And I miss her just
as much as you miss your parents.

514
00:28:39,997 --> 00:28:41,866
Why aren't you with her?

515
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:44,401
Well, I told her that I had to hang out
with my good buddy Akio.

516
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:45,832
Really?

517
00:28:45,834 --> 00:28:48,063
Yeah. We used to go
to botanical gardens

518
00:28:48,065 --> 00:28:49,831
just like these
in Starling City,

519
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:52,565
except she didn't
know the...

520
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:55,435
plants as well
as you do.

521
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:57,403
Oliver?

522
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:59,410
What's wrong?

523
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,513
Run!

524
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,749
Hey.

525
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:09,046
Where's Diggle?

526
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,750
He's out with Roy.

527
00:29:10,752 --> 00:29:12,253
They're on their way back.

528
00:29:12,255 --> 00:29:14,388
Thanks for coming.

529
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,890
Where else would I be?

530
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:18,985
It's not rhetorical.
Ray and I may be a something,

531
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:22,120
but that doesn't change
my commitment to what we're doing here.

532
00:29:22,122 --> 00:29:24,294
Good.

533
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,588
What about your commitment?

534
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,692
John might have

535
00:29:27,694 --> 00:29:30,694
told me about your employment
offer from Evil Incorporated.

536
00:29:30,696 --> 00:29:33,270
He also might have told me
that you may be considering it,

537
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:37,172
which is, by the way, insane.

538
00:29:37,174 --> 00:29:39,434
There's a League
of Assassins.

539
00:29:39,436 --> 00:29:41,968
That is not the name
of a nice group.

540
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,703
I've been an assassin.

541
00:29:43,705 --> 00:29:47,773
There is more than
one path to justice.

542
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:50,707
There are a lot of different
ways I can answer that.

543
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:54,041
All varying on the theme
of you're crazy,

544
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,374
but I'm going to go with,

545
00:29:56,376 --> 00:29:59,478
what makes you think that you're
not already on the right path?

546
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,846
Ok. Ok.

547
00:30:01,848 --> 00:30:03,310
'Cause it's been
over two years.

548
00:30:03,312 --> 00:30:05,286
You tell me.

549
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:09,152
What have I really
accomplished?

550
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,792
My mother's dead.

551
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:14,528
Tommy, Sara.

552
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,928
Crime's not down,
and my sister

553
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,632
is in ten different
kinds of pain right now.

554
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:21,736
So you leave.

555
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:23,439
Then what?

556
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:25,103
All the people
you've lost,

557
00:30:25,105 --> 00:30:26,903
all the sacrifices
you've made,

558
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:29,071
it would have been
for nothing.

559
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:34,183
I don't know why
I'm doing this anymore.

560
00:30:34,185 --> 00:30:38,384
I can't answer
that for you.

561
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:42,820
Yes, Captain Lance
is shutting you out,

562
00:30:42,822 --> 00:30:44,188
but I don't believe
you're the Arrow

563
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,251
so that people can
say "thank you."

564
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:48,459
And, yes, you and I
are not together,

565
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:52,459
but that was
your choice.

566
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:54,763
When we thought
you were dead,

567
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:57,604
each one of us
had to figure out

568
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:01,268
why we were
doing all this.

569
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:04,172
Seems like
it's your turn.

570
00:31:04,174 --> 00:31:06,940
Are we
interrupting something?

571
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,845
What do you have?

572
00:31:09,847 --> 00:31:11,750
Just talked to a friend
of mine who used to run

573
00:31:11,752 --> 00:31:13,886
a munitions depot back
when I was in Afghanistan.

574
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:15,160
I think I know why our guy

575
00:31:15,184 --> 00:31:16,455
is so interested
in low grade diamonds.

576
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:18,526
The type of diamonds
Amar and his crew are interested in

577
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,694
is used to make
diamond-tipped bullets.

578
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:22,758
They can go through body
armor like tissue paper.

579
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,630
Ok. So who wears
body armor?

580
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,094
The police.

581
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:27,534
The guys who beat that false
confession out him,

582
00:31:27,536 --> 00:31:28,702
who put him
in prison.

583
00:31:28,704 --> 00:31:31,205
He's going
to get payback.

584
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:33,604
Ok. Roy, suit up.
Dig, I need you to secure

585
00:31:33,606 --> 00:31:35,708
the perimeter of the station.
Felicity--

586
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,804
Call Captain Lance,
I'm already on it.

587
00:31:55,432 --> 00:31:58,198
Hi.

588
00:32:00,566 --> 00:32:02,102
Peace offering.

589
00:32:02,104 --> 00:32:04,071
I already ate.

590
00:32:04,073 --> 00:32:06,576
Right.

591
00:32:06,578 --> 00:32:09,577
You know, it's funny...

592
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:13,312
A friend of mine is having trouble
with her father.

593
00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:16,919
The son of a bitch
is barely human, but you...

594
00:32:18,552 --> 00:32:21,482
You know, history
has taught me

595
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:23,551
that you'll give me
the cold shoulder for a while,

596
00:32:23,553 --> 00:32:27,588
and then you'll move on
to blowing up at me,

597
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,716
and then finally,
you'll let it all out

598
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:32,419
at a dinner that I've dragged
you to after days of pleading,

599
00:32:32,421 --> 00:32:34,660
but my point is,
is just let me have it!

600
00:32:35,469 --> 00:32:37,395
I deserve
every minute of it.

601
00:32:37,397 --> 00:32:40,062
And I am ready
to take it, but...

602
00:32:40,064 --> 00:32:42,134
don't you think
for one second

603
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:43,766
that I am giving up on us.

604
00:32:46,304 --> 00:32:48,773
When you were
a little girl,

605
00:32:48,775 --> 00:32:51,741
you used to wait up for
me when I was on nights.

606
00:32:51,743 --> 00:32:54,077
You couldn't fall asleep until I
walked through that front door.

607
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,844
I remember.
Yeah.

608
00:32:55,846 --> 00:32:58,913
You were always the protector
of this family, of everyone.

609
00:32:58,915 --> 00:33:02,079
Laurel Lance...

610
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:04,716
Always trying
to save the world.

611
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:09,648
You can't save this.

612
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,353
Dad...

613
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:11,986
You don't know
how hard I've tried

614
00:33:11,987 --> 00:33:15,154
to forgive you for lying to me
the way you did?

615
00:33:15,156 --> 00:33:18,259
I'm not proud of it.

616
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:20,131
You're my daughter,
I'll always love you,

617
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,226
but I don't know if I'll ever be able
to forgive you.

618
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:37,884
Kill them all!

619
00:33:57,057 --> 00:33:59,520
Police band is filled with reports
of gunfire at the precinct.

620
00:33:59,521 --> 00:34:01,517
Any luck
getting to Lance?

621
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,221
Still trying.

622
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,912
I'll lay down cover fire,
you haul ass for the exit.

623
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:07,780
I'm not leaving you!

624
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,356
Just because you think
you're some kind

625
00:34:09,357 --> 00:34:10,261
of hero now doesn't mean
I'm not going

626
00:34:10,262 --> 00:34:13,827
to protect my daughter.
Now on my move, you run!

627
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:16,235
Go, go, go!

628
00:34:42,572 --> 00:34:44,339
My father's
back there!

629
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,601
Hey!

630
00:35:57,464 --> 00:35:59,599
What, are you waiting around
for a thank you?

631
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:01,504
That's not why I do this.

632
00:36:16,272 --> 00:36:19,007
Nice work.

633
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:21,382
Not without
a few casualties,

634
00:36:21,384 --> 00:36:24,646
but Amar is in custody.

635
00:36:24,648 --> 00:36:27,085
So that's a no on the whole victory
dance thing, then?

636
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:28,989
You know me.
I don't dance.

637
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:32,956
But I do occasionally
say...thank you.

638
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,220
You're welcome.

639
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:35,827
And you were right.

640
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:39,161
Ah, a "thank you"
and a "you were right."

641
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:41,625
I should really
be recording this.

642
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:45,298
I started all of this
because of my father,

643
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,066
to...right his wrongs.

644
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:51,170
It became

645
00:36:51,172 --> 00:36:53,106
something more.

646
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:56,746
But I never stopped
to think about it

647
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,912
or about why...

648
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:02,509
until you asked me to.

649
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,146
And what was
the answer?

650
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:06,544
Tonight at the precinct,

651
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:09,648
the only thing
that I could think about was...

652
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,680
those police officers,

653
00:37:12,682 --> 00:37:16,688
and how their families
were counting on me,

654
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:20,361
and Roy, and Diggle,

655
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,895
to get them home safe.

656
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:27,374
That's why I'm doing this.

657
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:29,763
So...

658
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:32,432
that means a pass

659
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:35,966
on becoming the most handsome
Demon's Head ever?

660
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:40,467
It means I'm not ready
to give up on what we're doing here.

661
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:42,864
You know, you're
always saying

662
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:46,030
how you just want me
to be happy...

663
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:50,734
You know,
the thing is,

664
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:53,069
as long as you're
in my life, I am.

665
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:03,482
It's Ray.

666
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:06,314
I should probably
take this.

667
00:38:10,727 --> 00:38:11,958
Who are those men?!

668
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,832
I-I don't know.

669
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,201
Then why are we
running away from them?

670
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:21,212
Shado?

671
00:38:26,522 --> 00:38:29,320
Are you all right?

672
00:38:29,322 --> 00:38:32,287
What are you doing here?

673
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:35,525
Looking for you,
actually.

674
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:38,754
I missed your sister.

675
00:38:38,756 --> 00:38:41,824
I suppose I wanted
something to remind me of her.

676
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:43,496
Now's really not the best time.

677
00:38:43,498 --> 00:38:46,600
Are you...
having problems with your father?

678
00:38:46,602 --> 00:38:50,231
I have some
experience in that area.

679
00:38:51,937 --> 00:38:54,166
Do you want
to talk about it?

680
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:55,638
With you?

681
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:03,739
You know what?

682
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:08,144
I could use a reminder
of Sara, too.

683
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:10,143
Dinner's on me.

684
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,383
During the fighting,

685
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:15,518
your technique
was competent?

686
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,550
Why do I feel like that's your idea
of a compliment?

687
00:39:18,552 --> 00:39:21,317
Could certainly
be improved.

688
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:24,922
Is that an offer to teach me?

689
00:39:24,924 --> 00:39:27,592
I have nowhere
else to go.

690
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:38,133
It is not customary
for one to wait so long

691
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:40,502
before accepting
a great honor.

692
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:42,471
I'm not
accepting it.

693
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:44,902
Wing ta Lao wo chey.

694
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:47,110
"The tale
to be told begins thus."

695
00:39:47,112 --> 00:39:50,006
Maseo, this story,
it's over before it begins.

696
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:51,774
You misunderstand.

697
00:39:51,776 --> 00:39:53,813
It does not mean the tale
is yet to unfold.

698
00:39:53,815 --> 00:39:57,979
It means Ra's
has already written it.

699
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,257
The choice has been made.

700
00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:00,983
No.

701
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,652
I will always be grateful
for what you've done for my family.

702
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:11,249
For what you meant to Akio.

703
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:14,552
But if you insist on pursuing this
path of resistance...

704
00:40:14,554 --> 00:40:17,021
There will be consequences.

705
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:18,588
Is that
a threat?

706
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,987
It is the will
of Ra's al Ghul.

707
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:32,200
Yeah, who is it?

708
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:40,210
Hello?

709
00:40:46,816 --> 00:40:50,121
Thea. Are you ok?
What's going on?

710
00:40:50,123 --> 00:40:54,669
I--I don't know what
I'm doing anymore.

711
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:58,304
I don't know
who I am.

712
00:40:58,306 --> 00:41:00,104
Can I just stay
here with you?

713
00:41:00,106 --> 00:41:02,744
Yeah.

714
00:41:25,905 --> 00:41:27,665
Cops believe they've won.

715
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:30,433
But still got what,
how many rounds of those

716
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:32,465
armor-piercing
diamond bullets?

717
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:50,165
You tell everyone
who will listen

718
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:52,502
what you've seen.

719
00:41:53,027 --> 00:41:54,166
Go.

720
