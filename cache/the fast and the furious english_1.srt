1
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,371
Just packed up a real money load,
and it's coming your way.

2
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:06,622
Look for "Rodgers" on the truck's side.
Don't forget my share of the deal.

3
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:57,242
Shit!

4
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:42,038
-Tuna on white, no crust, right?
-I don't know. How is it?

5
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:47,010
Every day, for the last three weeks,
you've come here, asking how the tuna is.

6
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:50,844
Now, it was crappy yesterday.
It was crappy the day before.

7
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,721
And guess what? It hasn't changed.

8
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:56,264
-I'll have the tuna.
-No crust?

9
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:57,436
No crust.

10
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:22,793
Thank you.

11
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:12,231
Talk to me, Jesse.
This ain't working, brother.

12
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,943
It's your fuel map. It's got a nasty hole.

13
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:18,118
-That's why you're unloading in third.
-Told you.

14
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:23,328
I lengthen the injector pulse a millisecond.
Just tune the NOS timer, you'll run nines.

15
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:33,797
What's up with this fool?
Is he sandwich-crazy?

16
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:38,514
-No. He ain't here for the food, dog.
-Chill out. He's slinging parts for Harry.

17
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:42,101
-I know what he's slinging.
-He's trying to get in Mia's pants, dog.

18
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:44,431
-What's up, guys?
-How you doing, Mia?

19
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,683
-How you living, girl?
-Hey!

20
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:49,686
Hey, Dom. You want something to drink?

21
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,830
-He's beautiful.
-I like his haircut.

22
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,582
Vince!

23
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,837
-What?
-Can I get you anything?

24
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,880
You look good.

25
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:20,734
-Thanks a lot, Mia. See you tomorrow.
-Sure.

26
00:07:23,654 --> 00:07:25,611
-Tomorrow?
-I love this part.

27
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,997
Try Fatburger from now on. Get yourself a
Double Cheese with fries for $2.95, faggot.

28
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:38,584
-I like the tuna here.
-Bullshit. No one likes the tuna here.

29
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:40,083
Yeah, well, I do.

30
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:56,140
Jesus Christ, Dom! Would you get out
there? I'm sick of this shit.

31
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:58,560
I'm not kidding, Dom. Get out there!

32
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,442
-What did you put in that sandwich?
-That's funny.

33
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:07,743
-Dom!
-All right.

34
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:29,140
-Hey, man. He was in my face.
-I'm in your face.

35
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:33,692
Relax! Don't push it! You embarrass me!

36
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:37,645
Get over there!

37
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,951
Jesse, give me the wallet.

38
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:47,200
"Brian Earl Spilner."
Sounds like a serial killer name.

39
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,127
-Is that what you are?
-No, man.

40
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:51,170
Don't come around here again.

41
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:55,502
Hey, man. This is bullshit.

42
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:59,556
-You work for Harry, right?
-Yeah. I just started.

43
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:01,309
You were just fired.

44
00:09:14,242 --> 00:09:17,362
Hey, Dominic.
I appreciate what you did, in a big way.

45
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,366
Dominic, I owe you.

46
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:25,836
Brian, you're messing with my business.
When Dominic drives, he's golden.

47
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:30,592
Kids pour in. They want everything he has.
Every performance part. They pay cash!

48
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:33,889
-What did Dominic say?
-You don't want to know.

49
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:37,095
-What did Dominic say?
-He wants you out of here.

50
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:39,643
-He wants me out of here?
-Yes.

51
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,016
-And what did you say to Dom?
-What do you think I said?

52
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,808
I told him, "Good help is hard to find."

53
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:50,022
Relax.

54
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:54,950
I need NOS.

55
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:57,705
-I need NOS.
-No.

56
00:09:57,876 --> 00:10:00,663
My car topped out at 140 miles per hour,
this morning.

57
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:05,168
Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide. I've
seen how you drive. You've a heavy foot.

58
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:09,089
-You'll blow yourself to pieces.
-I need one of these.

59
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:12,717
One of the big ones.
Actually, let's make it two.

60
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:15,386
And, Harry, I need it by tonight.

61
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:30,475
Hold up, hold up.
Look at this snowman right here, man.

62
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:37,659
Sweet ride.
What you running under there, man?

63
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:43,284
-Going to make me find out the hard way?
-Hell, yeah.

64
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,246
You brave. You brave.
They call me Hector.

65
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,667
I got a last name, too,
but I can't pronounce it.

66
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:52,213
-Brian Spilner.
-Typical white-boy name.

67
00:11:52,552 --> 00:11:54,427
Know what I'm saying?

68
00:11:56,724 --> 00:12:01,601
See that over there? That's mine.
My baby. I ain't cutting her loose tonight.

69
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:03,723
-Why not?
-I'm going legit, homey.

70
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:06,485
Trying to get on the NIRA circuit.
Heard about that?

71
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:09,570
-Hell, yeah.
-So, what's up with you, man?

72
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:13,945
-I'm just waiting for Toretto.
-Shit. Better get in line. This yours?

73
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,611
-I'm standing next to it.
-That's funny.

74
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:20,419
You know,
Edwin happens to know a few things.

75
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:24,794
And one of the things Edwin knows is:
It's not how you stand by your car...

76
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,134
...it's how you race your car.
You better learn that.

77
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:37,019
Oh, shit. Here they come. It's on.

78
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:54,206
-Dom.
-Marvin.

79
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:59,501
-Hey, Dom. How you doing?
-Hey, Camille. You been doing yoga?

80
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:06,804
You did? Of course you did. Monica.

81
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:11,677
I smell skanks.

82
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:16,264
Why don't you girls pack it up,
before I leave tread marks on your face?

83
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:17,272
Okay.

84
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:20,196
-Letty, I was just talking.
-Yeah. Whatever.

85
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:23,616
-Okay, Hector.
-Yeah? What's up, man?

86
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:26,870
-Yo. What's up?
-Edwin.

87
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:29,327
-How we doing this tonight?
-One race.

88
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,962
$2,000 buy-in. Winner takes all.
Hector, you're going to hold the cash.

89
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:37,465
-Why Hector?
-Too slow to make away with the money.

90
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:42,597
-Okay. Good luck, guys.
-Hey, wait. Hold up.

91
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:46,966
I don't have any cash.
But I do have the pink slip to my car.

92
00:13:47,437 --> 00:13:51,269
You just can't climb in the ring with Ali,
'cause you think you box.

93
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:54,734
He knows I can box. Check it out.
It's like this.

94
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:58,859
I lose, the winner takes my car.
Clean and clear.

95
00:13:59,284 --> 00:14:02,654
But if I win, I take the cash,
and I take the respect.

96
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:04,321
Respect.

97
00:14:06,668 --> 00:14:09,040
To some people, that's more important.

98
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:12,501
That your car?

99
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:21,133
I see a cool air intake. It's got a NOS
fogger system and a T 4 turbo, Dominic.

100
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:26,269
I see an AIC controller.
It has direct port nitrous injection.

101
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:29,312
Yeah. And a stand-alone
fuel management system.

102
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,397
Not a bad way to spend $10,000.

103
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,869
You see that shit?

104
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:41,032
He's got enough NOS in there
to blow himself up. Period.

105
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,126
-So, what do you say? Am I worthy?
-We don't know yet.

106
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:47,630
But you're in. Let's go.

107
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:50,051
-All right.
-Let's go!

108
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:58,335
-What the hell is going on around here?
-Street's closed, pizza boy.

109
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:01,759
-Find another way home.
-Goddamn street racers.

110
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:06,806
Log on, 22. Code 3. Tension is high.
They've b/ocked the street.

111
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:54,364
Edwin.

112
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:58,862
This is yours, whether you win or lose.

113
00:16:59,745 --> 00:17:02,367
But if you win, you get her, too.

114
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:13,427
You're going to win.

115
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:16,383
I'm going to win.

116
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:03,647
We had a reported homicide.
187, at Barabian Liquors.

117
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:08,116
I've got a 187 in Glendale.
Cops are all over it. We're good to roll.

118
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:10,237
-All right.
-Let's race!

119
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:11,360
Right.

120
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:21,915
Go!

121
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:37,182
Hell, yeah!

122
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:54,878
Damn, that guy's fast.

123
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:05,215
Let's go! Mènage!

124
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:35,045
No! Monica!

125
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:52,280
Shut up!

126
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,506
Well done, baby!

127
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,809
Come on. Come on. Back up.

128
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:03,945
Here's what you won, right here.
There you go.

129
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:06,903
You were racing a bunch of skateboards.
Know what I mean?

130
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:10,998
My sister holds the money. Count it.

131
00:21:14,043 --> 00:21:15,621
And you're my trophy.

132
00:21:18,882 --> 00:21:22,833
-Hey, Monica. What's up, baby?
-What's your problem? You didn't win.

133
00:21:25,807 --> 00:21:27,088
Fuck you then!

134
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:41,689
Was that fun?

135
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,819
Got a problem there, buddy?

136
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:53,795
-What are you smiling about?
-Dude. I almost had you.

137
00:21:56,635 --> 00:21:58,426
You almost had me?

138
00:21:59,096 --> 00:22:01,552
You never had me.
You never had your car.

139
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:08,021
Granny-shifting.
Not double-clutching, like you should.

140
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:13,105
You're lucky that 100-shot of NOS
didn't blow the welds on the intake.

141
00:22:14,364 --> 00:22:18,742
-Almost had me?
-You tell him, Dominic. Get out of here.

142
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,206
Now, me and the mad scientist
got to rip apart the block...

143
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:25,865
...and replace the piston rings you fried.

144
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:35,676
Ask any racer. Any real racer.

145
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:40,893
It don't matter if you win by an inch
or a mile. Winning's winning.

146
00:22:41,187 --> 00:22:42,515
Yeah!

147
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:51,197
A// avai/ab/e units,
we have street-racing a/ong Hawthorne....

148
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,191
Oh, shit! We got cops. Cops!

149
00:22:53,493 --> 00:22:54,738
Go!

150
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:08,258
Cops! Get in the car! Go!

151
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,733
Toretto, stop right there/

152
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:37,562
Toretto/

153
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:53,790
Get in!

154
00:25:40,313 --> 00:25:43,648
You're the last person in the world
I expected to show up.

155
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:48,734
I thought if I got in your good graces,
you might let me keep my car.

156
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:52,325
You are in my good graces,
but you ain't keeping your car.

157
00:25:53,204 --> 00:25:56,205
You drive like you've done this before.
Are you a wheelman?

158
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,663
-No.
-You boost cars?

159
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,247
-No. Never.
-Ever done time?

160
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:05,958
Couple of overnighters. No big deal.

161
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,756
What about the two years
in juvie for boosting cars?

162
00:26:12,726 --> 00:26:14,221
Tucson, right?

163
00:26:14,938 --> 00:26:18,022
I had Jesse run a profile on you,
Brian Earl Spilner.

164
00:26:19,568 --> 00:26:22,736
He'll find anything on the Web.
Anything about anybody.

165
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:24,858
So, why bullshit?

166
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:28,070
So, what about you?

167
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,033
Two years in Lompoc.

168
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:36,878
I'll die before I go back.

169
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:45,005
-Oh, great.
-What?

170
00:26:47,935 --> 00:26:50,307
It's going to be a long-ass night.
That's what.

171
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:55,985
Follow us.

172
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:50,924
I thought we had an agreement.
You stay away. I stay away.

173
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:53,968
Everybody stays happy.

174
00:27:54,095 --> 00:27:56,421
We got lost.
What do you want me to tell you?

175
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:59,433
-Who's "we"?
-My new mechanic.

176
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,638
Brian, meet Johnny Tran.

177
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:04,772
The guy in the snakeskin pants.
That's his cousin. Lance.

178
00:28:04,858 --> 00:28:08,559
So, when are you going to give me a shot
at that Honda 2000 of yours?

179
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:11,062
-This your ride?
-It was. It's his now.

180
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:13,983
No, it's not. I haven't taken delivery.

181
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:19,864
Then, it's nobody's car.
But somebody put in the wrench time.

182
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:26,539
-What do you think, Lance?
-It's an amazing machine.

183
00:28:27,218 --> 00:28:28,677
Yes, indeed.

184
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:32,300
Let's go.

185
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:38,890
I'll see you in the desert next month.
Be ready to have your ass handed to you.

186
00:28:39,148 --> 00:28:43,017
-You'll need more than that crotch rocket.
-I got something for you.

187
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,454
-What the hell was that all about?
-Long story. I'll tell you later.

188
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:02,174
Let's get out of here.

189
00:29:29,582 --> 00:29:30,697
NOS!

190
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,306
-So, what the hell was that all about?
-It's a long story.

191
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,096
Well, we got a 20-mile hike. Humor me.

192
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:52,230
A business deal that went sour.

193
00:29:53,194 --> 00:29:56,278
Plus, I made the mistake
of sleeping with his sister.

194
00:30:22,478 --> 00:30:23,723
Take care.

195
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:30,361
Yo, Spilner.

196
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,987
-You want a beer?
-Yeah, sure.

197
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:36,236
Oh, shit.

198
00:31:00,314 --> 00:31:03,268
We were all there, right? Falling behind.

199
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,815
-With all that nitrous.
-Yeah.

200
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:16,155
Yo, Dom. We were just about to go
looking for you, brother.

201
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,369
Where were you?

202
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:27,713
There were mass cops there. They came in
from every direction. It was orchestrated.

203
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,177
-This your beer?
-Yeah, that's my beer.

204
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:35,760
Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.

205
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,977
You can't detail a car with the cover on.

206
00:31:39,818 --> 00:31:42,689
-Can't even get that right.
-You all right?

207
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:47,737
-Am I all right?
-It was just a question.

208
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:52,779
Yo, Dom.

209
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:57,123
-Why did you bring the buster here?
-'Cause he kept me out of handcuffs!

210
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,213
He didn't just run back to the fort!
The buster brought me back.

211
00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:10,850
You can have any brew you want,
as long as it's a Corona.

212
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:14,144
-Thanks, man.
-That's Vince's. So, enjoy it.

213
00:32:16,152 --> 00:32:17,398
You.

214
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:28,618
-Hey, bro. You got a bathroom?
-Upstairs. First door on the right.

215
00:32:44,852 --> 00:32:48,269
He's got no call being up in here.
You don't know that fool for shit.

216
00:32:48,356 --> 00:32:51,856
-He's right, Dom.
-There was a time when I didn't know you.

217
00:32:52,027 --> 00:32:53,937
That was in the third grade!

218
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:00,659
-Yeah. So, what girls are here?
-You name it. You want mine?

219
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:03,154
-You need to shut the....
-You want two?

220
00:33:03,374 --> 00:33:06,045
-You don't have anything?
-You look a bit tired.

221
00:33:06,128 --> 00:33:08,915
I think you should go upstairs
and give me a massage.

222
00:33:09,006 --> 00:33:12,376
-Look at all our guests.
-How about you give me a massage?

223
00:33:15,722 --> 00:33:17,182
Crazy lady.

224
00:33:24,857 --> 00:33:27,528
You know you owe me
a 10-second car, right?

225
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,439
Oh, shit.

226
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,833
Did you wipe the seat?

227
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:47,458
Jesus Christ! Would you cut this shit?
Come on!

228
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:53,385
-Come on. Let's go get me a drink.
-We were just about to get along.

229
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:04,819
-So, what do you want?
-Anything, as long as it's cold.

230
00:34:06,448 --> 00:34:10,031
You know, my brother likes you.
He usually doesn't like anybody.

231
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:13,370
-He's a complicated guy.
-Yeah? What about you?

232
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:18,911
-I'm simpler.
-You're a shitty liar.

233
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:22,957
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

234
00:34:24,636 --> 00:34:27,307
-But there's a problem.
-What's that?

235
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,596
You need to get some sleep.

236
00:34:30,185 --> 00:34:34,135
And you definitely,
definitely need a shower.

237
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,396
Come on. I'll take you home.

238
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:02,136
Show me your hands.
Very good. Now open the door.

239
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,759
Put your hands on your head.
Behind your head.

240
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,893
Face the front of the vehic/e,
wa/k backwards towards the rear.

241
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:13,476
Take two steps to your right.
Stop right there.

242
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,481
-What did I do?
-Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.

243
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,582
Damn!
Muse, will you take these things off?

244
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:36,594
-Shit. You put them on so tight.
-I like realism.

245
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:39,547
You never know who's watching, Brian.

246
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:47,639
Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer
than the last place you confiscated.

247
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:51,946
Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house
for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

248
00:35:52,114 --> 00:35:55,032
You see, even the cops
are Hollywood in Hollywood.

249
00:35:58,788 --> 00:36:02,122
Okay, here he is,
fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.

250
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:04,534
That was an $80,000 vehicle, Officer.

251
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:06,836
-You told him what happened?
-He knows.

252
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:10,838
-Send the bill to Johnny Tran.
-The kid's giving me attitude?

253
00:36:10,928 --> 00:36:13,680
It doesn't speak well
for police/FBI relations, Tanner.

254
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:17,383
-I walk in the door and the guy's already--
-All right, all right.

255
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:19,683
We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it.

256
00:36:19,771 --> 00:36:23,057
Muse, why don't you make us
four iced cappuccinos, please?

257
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,476
-Come on.
-Regular or decaf, Sarge?

258
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:28,483
Decaf, I think.

259
00:36:28,824 --> 00:36:31,529
Four hijackings in two months,
and we have nothing.

260
00:36:31,618 --> 00:36:34,703
The DVD players and digital cameras
are worth $1.2 million...

261
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:37,576
...which brings the grand total
to $6 million plus.

262
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:40,503
We're in the political crosshairs now, Brian.

263
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:43,082
That's why you're undercover.

264
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:47,124
You want that detective badge fast, kid.
And you want to know something?

265
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,306
The FBI can help,
if you come through for us.

266
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,307
What does the truckdriver say?

267
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:56,929
He gave us the same M.O.:
Three Honda Civics, precision driving...

268
00:36:57,023 --> 00:36:59,977
...the same green neon glow
from under the chassis.

269
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:04,530
Lab says the skidmarks came back
the same: Mashamoto ZX tires.

270
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:07,320
So, we know it's somebody
in the street-racing world.

271
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:11,872
If we don't make this case, the truckers
will take matters into their own hands.

272
00:37:11,957 --> 00:37:13,666
I tell them we're close.

273
00:37:14,877 --> 00:37:16,787
Are you going to make me a liar?

274
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,422
Look, what do we know?

275
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:20,999
We know this world
revolves around Toretto, right?

276
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:24,178
I'm not saying that he's the one
that's popping these trucks...

277
00:37:24,264 --> 00:37:28,594
...but I can guarantee he knows who is.
It's just a matter of time until I win--

278
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:32,635
You want time, buy the magazine.
We don't have time.

279
00:37:34,442 --> 00:37:36,518
Just get me something I can use.

280
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:40,023
Is Harry cooperating?

281
00:37:40,115 --> 00:37:43,698
Like a guy that'll do time
for receiving stolen property if he doesn't.

282
00:37:43,786 --> 00:37:45,910
What kind of vibe
is he getting from Toretto?

283
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:49,118
He's scared of him,
but he doesn't think he's jacking trucks.

284
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:51,582
-He's too controlled for that.
-Wait.

285
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,790
Not that I want to contradict
Harry's fine judge of character...

286
00:37:54,882 --> 00:37:58,418
...but Toretto did hard time
for nearly beating a guy to death.

287
00:37:58,511 --> 00:38:01,633
He's got nitrous oxide in his blood
and a gas tank for a brain.

288
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:03,633
Do not turn your back on him.

289
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,603
Tanner, I'm gonna need another car.

290
00:38:11,152 --> 00:38:13,559
-What about parts and service?
-Hold off on it.

291
00:38:13,654 --> 00:38:15,981
Dom, I don't know what to do with it.

292
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:22,910
All right, what the hell is this?
What do you got there?

293
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:27,076
-This is your car.
-My car?

294
00:38:27,713 --> 00:38:30,668
I said a 10-second car, not a 10-minute car.

295
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:34,591
You could push this across the finish line,
or tow it.

296
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:38,807
You couldn't even tow that
across the finish line.

297
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,758
No faith.

298
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:43,261
I have faith in you,
but this isn't a junkyard.

299
00:38:43,356 --> 00:38:45,599
-This is a garage.
-Pop the hood.

300
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:47,146
-Pop the hood?
-Pop the hood.

301
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,946
-2JZ engine. No shit.
-And what did I tell you?

302
00:38:54,035 --> 00:38:56,788
-I retract my previous statement.
-You know what?

303
00:38:56,872 --> 00:39:01,451
This will decimate all
after you put about $15,000 in it.

304
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:05,293
Or more,
if we have to overnight parts from Japan.

305
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:08,463
-We'll put it on my tab at Harry's.
-Yes!

306
00:39:08,886 --> 00:39:12,670
I gotta get you racing again
so I can make some money off your ass.

307
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:15,929
There's a show down in the desert
called Race Wars.

308
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:18,309
That's where you'll do it.

309
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,023
When you're not working at Harry's,
you're working here.

310
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:26,026
If you can't find the right tool
in this garage, Mr. Arizona...

311
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,611
...you don't belong near a car.

312
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:33,581
He owns you now.

313
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:02,697
Tell me what you think about this.
Koni adjustables.

314
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,740
Gonna save us about 2 pounds.

315
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:09,287
And they're gonna give us
better traction for the hole shot.

316
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:10,619
All right?

317
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:13,536
This is your basic layout of the car.

318
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:17,461
And that's pretty much
what it could look like when it's finished.

319
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:19,593
Red, green.

320
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:23,755
-You should be going to MIT or something.
-Yeah, right.

321
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:27,268
No, I got that.... What's it called?

322
00:40:28,354 --> 00:40:30,513
That attention disorder--

323
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:34,308
-ADD?
-Yes, that shit. Yeah.

324
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:39,361
You know, I was good in algebra
and like math and shit.

325
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:43,951
Everything else I failed.
Dropped out of school.

326
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:47,952
I don't know.
It's just something about engines...

327
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:51,164
...that calms me down, you know.

328
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,486
-I'm outta here.
-Come on, dog.

329
00:41:15,117 --> 00:41:17,787
-Yo, Dom.
-Vince, get over here and give us a hand.

330
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,789
Looks like you got
all the help you need, brother.

331
00:41:34,473 --> 00:41:37,593
-Mia! The chicken's dry.
-All right. I'm coming out already.

332
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:44,436
Here you go.

333
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:47,773
Hey, hold up.

334
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:53,525
Because you were the first to reach in
to get the chicken, you say grace.

335
00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:02,249
-Dear heavenly....
-Spirit.

336
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:05,585
Spirit. Thank you.

337
00:42:06,135 --> 00:42:11,343
Thank you for providing us
with a direct port nitrous injection...

338
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:16,142
...four core intercoolers
and ball-bearing turbos...

339
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:18,805
...and titanium valve springs.

340
00:42:19,568 --> 00:42:21,192
-Thank you.
-Amen.

341
00:42:22,321 --> 00:42:24,279
-Not bad.
-Amen.

342
00:42:24,366 --> 00:42:26,607
He was praying to the car gods, man.

343
00:42:27,953 --> 00:42:29,495
He's not the best.

344
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,739
-What do you want?
-Practice.

345
00:42:31,832 --> 00:42:33,161
Thank you, girl.

346
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,834
Look who it is. "Old Coyotes 'R' Us."

347
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,673
I thought you weren't hungry, pumpkin.

348
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:42,796
-You know, I gotta eat.
-He's always hungry.

349
00:42:42,886 --> 00:42:44,927
All right, sit down.

350
00:42:52,314 --> 00:42:54,224
How you doing, Mia?

351
00:42:57,404 --> 00:42:59,028
Here you go.

352
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:08,249
-Jesse, hand me that chicken.
-Let's eat some grub, man.

353
00:43:08,334 --> 00:43:11,454
-Want some of that chicken?
-What, you rent a movie or something?

354
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,463
Need a hand with anything else?

355
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:24,007
No, I'm good. You can go join the boys
and watch the movie.

356
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:28,184
-The cook doesn't clean where I come from.
-I'd like to go there.

357
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:37,575
-I think we should go out sometime.
-No, I don't date my brother's friends.

358
00:43:38,284 --> 00:43:39,779
That sucks.

359
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:43,204
-I'll have to kick his ass then.
-I'd love to see that one.

360
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:46,577
I would pay to see that one, actually.

361
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:02,228
Wash my car when you get done.

362
00:44:02,313 --> 00:44:05,979
-What was that?
-No, Mia. I'm talking to the punk.

363
00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:09,274
Wear your favorite dress,
'cause when you're done...

364
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:12,649
...I'm putting you on the street
where you belong, cutie.

365
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:19,655
Is this thing broken?
What's wrong with this thing?

366
00:44:20,918 --> 00:44:24,917
What was that Cuban restaurant
you wanted to take me to?

367
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:27,082
The one with the picadillo and--

368
00:44:27,175 --> 00:44:30,960
-With red candles, wooden tables--
-The plantain, food all over the place.

369
00:44:31,055 --> 00:44:32,929
-What it's called?
-Cha Cha Cha.

370
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:34,973
-Yeah, that's it.
-Yeah.

371
00:44:36,145 --> 00:44:38,137
Well, you can take me there.

372
00:44:38,272 --> 00:44:40,894
Friday night at 10:00. Is that good for you?

373
00:44:41,525 --> 00:44:43,566
-Yeah, it's perfect.
-Good.

374
00:44:49,994 --> 00:44:53,909
-There's no popcorn.
-Make your own goddamn popcorn!

375
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:10,506
All right. Now that's valet parking.

376
00:45:14,439 --> 00:45:16,729
-Harry. What's up, dog?
-Nice to see you.

377
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:18,644
Excellent. Come on in, man.

378
00:45:18,736 --> 00:45:21,856
-Check it. It's yours.
-Damn. What do we got here?

379
00:45:22,991 --> 00:45:25,482
-Hired some new help?
-Don't even think about it.

380
00:45:25,577 --> 00:45:28,034
-What's up?
-What's up, Brian? How you feeling?

381
00:45:28,122 --> 00:45:31,040
-Pretty good. What do you need?
-What's up, man?

382
00:45:31,126 --> 00:45:34,661
I need you to hook me up.
Three of everything. I made a list.

383
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:38,256
Why don't you look that over?

384
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:41,718
-When do you need this stuff by?
-Tomorrow, today, now.

385
00:45:42,138 --> 00:45:44,380
-Right.
-White boys work fast, don't they?

386
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:48,973
That's right.

387
00:45:51,858 --> 00:45:55,358
-You said you need three of each?
-Yeah, three of everything.

388
00:45:56,155 --> 00:45:58,824
What do you think about that?
Check this out.

389
00:48:06,975 --> 00:48:08,517
He moans like a cop.

390
00:48:17,821 --> 00:48:21,985
Brian, this is one of those times
you need to be clear about what you say.

391
00:48:22,744 --> 00:48:24,736
Nod if you understand me.

392
00:48:24,829 --> 00:48:26,110
Nod!

393
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:29,369
Sit up.

394
00:48:35,633 --> 00:48:38,303
Tell me what the hell you're doing
down here.

395
00:48:38,595 --> 00:48:41,052
Shit. What I'm doing?

396
00:48:43,643 --> 00:48:45,018
Dom.

397
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:49,977
I owe you a 10-second car.

398
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:54,562
And what this is about,
this is about Race Wars.

399
00:48:57,742 --> 00:49:01,611
I just went in there,
and Hector is gonna be running...

400
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:04,619
...three Honda Civics with Spoon engines.

401
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:07,586
And on top of that,
he just came into Harry's...

402
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:11,918
...and he ordered three T66 turbos,
with NOS...

403
00:49:13,553 --> 00:49:15,629
...and a MoTeC system exhaust.

404
00:49:19,142 --> 00:49:20,851
So, what are you saying?

405
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:26,606
You're gonna check everybody's shit out,
one garage after another?

406
00:49:29,488 --> 00:49:30,947
Yeah.

407
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:37,700
Because, Dom, you know I can't lose again.

408
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:41,084
He's a cop.

409
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:44,536
He's a cop!

410
00:49:47,842 --> 00:49:49,171
You a cop?

411
00:49:55,685 --> 00:49:57,513
Let's go for a little ride.

412
00:50:00,524 --> 00:50:01,900
Walk!

413
00:50:21,298 --> 00:50:23,007
Okay. You stand watch.

414
00:50:53,754 --> 00:50:55,414
Yo, Dominic.

415
00:50:57,174 --> 00:50:58,834
There's no engines.

416
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:02,721
What are they planning on racing with,
hopes and dreams?

417
00:51:02,806 --> 00:51:05,214
I don't know, but they're sneaky as shit...

418
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:08,145
...and they've got enough money
to buy anything.

419
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:14,267
What?

420
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,742
We got a wolf pack.

421
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:28,914
/t's Johnny Tran,
and he's coming your way rea//y fast.

422
00:51:29,379 --> 00:51:32,000
All right, we got company. Spilner.

423
00:51:57,995 --> 00:52:00,285
Come on. Move!

424
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,580
Let me ask you a question, Ted.

425
00:52:04,086 --> 00:52:07,290
-Do you see anything wrong here?
-No.

426
00:52:11,178 --> 00:52:13,585
-We got no engines, do we?
-No.

427
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,961
-Do we?
-No.

428
00:52:18,061 --> 00:52:20,634
A couple of Nissan SR20 motors
will pull a premium...

429
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:23,767
-...one week before Race Wars, huh?
-Yeah, probably.

430
00:52:24,151 --> 00:52:27,152
You're a smart fence, Ted.
Maybe too smart.

431
00:52:28,656 --> 00:52:30,565
What are you feeling, Lance?

432
00:52:32,077 --> 00:52:33,620
40-weight?

433
00:52:34,122 --> 00:52:35,948
50-weight?

434
00:52:36,582 --> 00:52:38,290
A 40-weight sounds nice.

435
00:52:53,894 --> 00:52:55,437
Where are they, Ted?

436
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,432
-Where are they?
-Enough!

437
00:52:57,607 --> 00:53:00,098
-Where are they?
-They're in a warehouse.

438
00:53:00,652 --> 00:53:02,562
They're in a warehouse, man!

439
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,121
Ted.

440
00:53:20,217 --> 00:53:21,877
Kiss my shoes?

441
00:53:34,149 --> 00:53:36,024
Let's go get our engines.

442
00:53:36,903 --> 00:53:39,691
My superiors are flying in from D.C.,
in two days.

443
00:53:39,782 --> 00:53:41,406
I want something to show.

444
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:43,984
We've got a fence
with a lube hose in his mouth...

445
00:53:44,078 --> 00:53:47,697
...automatic weapons,
priors on every one of these Asian punks...

446
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:51,125
...a garage full of DVD players
and generally psychotic behavior.

447
00:53:51,212 --> 00:53:54,581
Tell me why we shouldn't move
on Tran now and figure it out later?

448
00:53:54,674 --> 00:53:56,417
Because all we have is behavior.

449
00:53:56,509 --> 00:53:59,594
Let me get hard evidence,
because what we have now is just--

450
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,673
What we have is probable cause.

451
00:54:01,766 --> 00:54:05,634
And truckers arming themselves for some
good old-fashioned vigilante mayhem.

452
00:54:05,729 --> 00:54:09,810
-Tell us about Hector, Brian.
-Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break.

453
00:54:10,067 --> 00:54:13,651
Hector's still working on the engines,
but the tires don't match.

454
00:54:13,738 --> 00:54:15,529
Will somebody give me a cigarette?

455
00:54:15,615 --> 00:54:17,738
-Get him a cigarette.
-Don't give him one.

456
00:54:17,992 --> 00:54:20,449
-I thought you quit.
-I did. Just give me one.

457
00:54:20,538 --> 00:54:22,281
-Get him a cigarette.
-No!

458
00:54:24,584 --> 00:54:26,208
Tell me about Toretto.

459
00:54:26,461 --> 00:54:29,248
I told you,
I think he's too controlled for this.

460
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:33,967
Going suicidal on semi-trucks? No way.
Maybe Vince. But he's too dumb to do it.

461
00:54:34,345 --> 00:54:38,011
-I think the kid sister's blurring your vision.
-What did you say?

462
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,683
I don't blame you.
I'd get off on her surveillance photos, too.

463
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:45,727
Knock it off!

464
00:54:46,902 --> 00:54:49,440
What? Are you going native on me, Brian?

465
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:56,361
Have you read Toretto's file lately?

466
00:54:56,621 --> 00:54:58,947
-Yeah. I memorized that file.
-Read it again.

467
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:01,449
No, better still, take a look at these.

468
00:55:03,254 --> 00:55:06,623
Remember I told you about the guy
he nearly beat to death?

469
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:10,336
Toretto did this
with a three-quarter-inch torque wrench.

470
00:55:10,846 --> 00:55:12,804
He's a model of self-control.

471
00:55:15,727 --> 00:55:17,435
I need a few more days.

472
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,389
I need a few more days.

473
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,898
Got a TR7 here,
with a ball-bearing upgrade.

474
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:31,151
What it's going to do is,
it's going to spool up really quick.

475
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,820
-I got this set up for 24 psi.
-Got it.

476
00:55:37,336 --> 00:55:39,127
You got big plans tonight?

477
00:55:41,257 --> 00:55:43,415
Yeah. We're going out to dinner.

478
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:47,585
You break her heart, I'll break your neck.

479
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,718
That's not gonna happen.

480
00:55:54,898 --> 00:55:56,725
I want to show you something.

481
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,708
Me and my dad built her.

482
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:15,959
Nine hundred horses of Detroit muscle.

483
00:56:17,257 --> 00:56:18,503
It's a beast.

484
00:56:19,093 --> 00:56:21,964
-You know what she ran in Palmdale?
-No. What?

485
00:56:22,138 --> 00:56:23,597
Nine seconds flat.

486
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,223
-God.
-My dad was driving.
