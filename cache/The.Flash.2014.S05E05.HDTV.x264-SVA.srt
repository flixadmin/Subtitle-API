1
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:01,742
My name is Barry Allen

2
00:00:01,745 --> 00:00:04,000
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:07,219
To the outside world I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist.

4
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:10,062
But secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs

5
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:12,625
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:15,218
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

7
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:17,555
she changed the present,

8
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:20,067
and now our world is
more dangerous than ever,

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,835
and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

10
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:24,971
I am The Flash.

11
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:27,713
Previously on "The Flash"...

12
00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:30,309
Ah!

13
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:31,777
What is that?

14
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:34,492
It's a game my dad and I used to play.

15
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:37,289
It's a letter from my
dad. He's still alive.

16
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:39,676
You put a power dampening chip inside me

17
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,920
to take away my speed.

18
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:42,521
Is that why you've been so cold to me?

19
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:44,156
Why you don't want to
spend any time with me?

20
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:46,192
Mom thinks that she had good reason

21
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:48,361
to suppress my powers in the future.

22
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:50,062
I support her decisions.

23
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:58,337
Let's just call it, Barry.
She's not coming. Again.

24
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:01,507
She's probably just helping with Jenna

25
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:03,175
so Joe and Cecile can sleep in.

26
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:05,344
Every day for the past two weeks?

27
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:07,046
They look really tired.

28
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,083
They do.

29
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:12,890
Tripped alarm at
Central City Art Gallery.

30
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:16,742
- Someone stole a Monet.
- At 10:00 a.m.? That's bold.

31
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:19,578
CCPD's en route, suspect
heading west on Ruger.

32
00:01:51,062 --> 00:01:53,225
The thief just turned on
to Ramirez off of Fifth.

33
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:54,260
Almost there.

34
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:16,351
He's not carrying anything.

35
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:18,043
Because he handed it
off to someone else.

36
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:19,117
- Nora?
- Nora?

37
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,851
- Uh, where's he headed?
- I got him.

38
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:22,387
I can stop someone on a motor cycle.

39
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,281
No, Nora, let Barry help, okay...

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,160
I know you did not just
cut me off, miss thing.

41
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,131
Gotcha.

42
00:02:36,017 --> 00:02:37,850
You okay?

43
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:48,313
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

44
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:50,651
This is why we train,
Nora. Every single day.

45
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,784
Not when you feel like
it, not because you're mad,

46
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:54,620
and why you always
have someone in your ear

47
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:56,255
when you're in the field to help you.

48
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:58,524
- I know that.
- Then why did you turn me off?

49
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:01,060
Because I can't listen to you anymore.

50
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:02,828
It's always the same condescending,

51
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,370
I-know-better-than-you crap.

52
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:06,726
I just want to be me and
you sit behind your desk

53
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,067
and you say "no" every time

54
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,202
and I've been hearing it my
whole life and I'm sick of it.

55
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:11,971
- Your whole life?
- Yes, Mom.

56
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:15,341
Since I can remember,
and you never change.

57
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:22,481
Iris.

58
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:31,824
You know, Nora, I wish
you would try to understand

59
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,064
who your mom is today,

60
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:37,284
and stop seeing her as who
she becomes in the future.

61
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:48,774
- That's for you.
- The hell is this?

62
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:50,709
Well, that's the hours
to apply against my debt.

63
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:52,691
Fruitful hours spent
getting closer to uncovering

64
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:55,867
the identity of your
serial meta-killer, Cicada.

65
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,015
And how's that?

66
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:59,218
Well, I apply a complex
formula... complex for you,

67
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,554
involving the terminal
velocity and the weight

68
00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:03,489
of the S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite
and the velocity of Barry

69
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,658
and Nora traveling when they...

70
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:12,298
Destroy the satellite, right,
allowing me to conclude that...

71
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:15,362
The debris from the satellite,
the satellite shrapnel,

72
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:17,917
and the man who would become our Cicada

73
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,706
would be found within this perimeter.

74
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,570
And that took you how long?

75
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:24,807
Oof, Dr. Snow.

76
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,370
Eighteen hours 'cause I'm
only semi-excellent at algebra.

77
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:30,106
You know this is calculus, right?

78
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:31,643
Guys, look, calculon, algebra,

79
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,885
either way it doesn't tell
us where the shrapnel fell.

80
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,955
Mais non. You have to
scan the entire city

81
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:37,556
to find the exact location.

82
00:04:37,558 --> 00:04:39,758
Okay, so you need Sally
the satellite to find

83
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Sally the satellite
and we need Thomas Snow

84
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:43,062
to point us to Thomas Snow.

85
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:45,598
- You lost him.
- At Thomas Snow.

86
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,933
We've hit a dead end
with regards to my father.

87
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:49,579
I looked through all
of his notes and papers.

88
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,637
There's no more hidden
messages we could use.

89
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,948
A satellite to run DNA
recognition patterns but...

90
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:58,277
I thought losing him when
I was ten was hard, but,

91
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,745
the idea that he's out there

92
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:02,448
and I might not be able to get to him...

93
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,534
Maybe I can help you.

94
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,418
I thought your powers weren't working.

95
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,622
No, not fully, but this I can do.

96
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:26,484
You okay?

97
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:28,721
I saw him.

98
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:30,276
I saw your dad in... in an office

99
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:31,721
sketching something in a notebook.

100
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:33,745
I couldn't quite make out what it was.

101
00:05:33,748 --> 00:05:35,414
Did you see anything else?

102
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:39,370
Um, equations on a chalkboard.

103
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,296
We didn't have a chalkboard
in our home office.

104
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,088
No, but tell us everything that you saw.

105
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,457
What's on the walls, what's on
the desk, what he was wearing.

106
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:46,565
Leave nothing out.

107
00:05:46,568 --> 00:05:49,093
He had an ID. It was,
like, a yellow logo,

108
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:50,663
like a yellow state building.

109
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:53,332
Yellow logo, so, not a state building.

110
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:55,467
A university building.

111
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:58,270
Hudson University.

112
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:00,578
- Professor Stein.
- And did you know him?

113
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:01,774
I knew he admired him,

114
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:03,943
but I didn't realize
that they were friends.

115
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:06,045
Add that to the growing list of secrets.

116
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,614
Let's go drive.

117
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:10,182
Thank you.

118
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:11,684
It's what I do.

119
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:25,292
Natalie, come here. I have a
pre-wedding surprise for you.

120
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:41,380
Flawless asscher cut
diamonds set in platinum.

121
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:43,515
Over 383 karats.

122
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:45,317
My great grandfather
gave this to his wife

123
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,485
on their wedding day.

124
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:48,320
Tomorrow, it's yours.

125
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:50,856
Tomorrow? That's torture.

126
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:15,620
Stop!

127
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:18,177
Mazel Tov.

128
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,944
Can you describe the man that you saw?

129
00:08:38,947 --> 00:08:42,479
I'd barely call him a
man, the way he moved.

130
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,516
And when he looked back at me,

131
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:46,750
it was terrifying.

132
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:49,019
- Could you see his face?
- No.

133
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,921
He was wearing some sort of clown mask.

134
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:52,356
And you're sure the necklace

135
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:53,777
is the only thing that was stolen.

136
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,360
Yes, and it's irreplaceable.

137
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:58,624
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

138
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:05,836
Hey. A nice surprise.

139
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:08,205
Yeah, well, a million dollar
jewelry theft is still news

140
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:09,642
even in Central City, so.

141
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:10,972
So, you're off the metas, huh?

142
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:12,374
Yeah, no, not today.

143
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:14,519
You know, I think I'm just
gonna follow up on this

144
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:15,555
while it's still fresh.

145
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:17,461
- I'll see you tonight, okay?
- Okay, wait. Hang on.

146
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:19,616
I mean, we're working on the same case.

147
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:24,355
Why don't we pool resources,
maybe solve this one together.

148
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:26,223
Yeah, I don't know, Barry, it's just...

149
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:28,692
Come on, grab some Big Belly
on the way to S.T.A.R. Labs.

150
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,661
It'll be like a date.

151
00:09:30,663 --> 00:09:32,489
- All right.
- All right. Come on.

152
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,950
This is the life.

153
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:38,067
Seriously, I could stay here forever.

154
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,769
No worries, no schrap from mom...

155
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:41,171
Wait, wait, wait, what was that?

156
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:43,640
- Schrap.
- Schrap?

157
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:46,110
Schrap. You know, like all
the nagging that mom does.

158
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:48,178
I mean, she acts like she supports me,

159
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,247
but what she really wants is a boring,

160
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:52,816
quiet daughter who just
wants to stay inside all day

161
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:54,218
instead of go out and do anything

162
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,619
that might be the least bit dangerous.

163
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:58,756
Nora, this is the West house.

164
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:01,369
In it, every West is given respect,

165
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:04,294
most especially your mother.

166
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:08,065
I am sure she raised
you as best she could.

167
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,534
She raised me to be afraid of the world.

168
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:12,870
But I'm a hero, you know, like dad.

169
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:14,304
And we have to keep moving

170
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:16,640
until everyone that needs us is safe.

171
00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:19,138
Okay.

172
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:21,007
I'm sorry, what is this for?

173
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,416
When Papa Joe comes back, this table

174
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,582
is going to finally be built.

175
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:29,310
You wanted to keep moving.

176
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:32,403
- Oh, do I have to?
- Yes.

177
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:33,824
All right, I'll make you a deal.

178
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:35,826
For every chore you do

179
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:38,829
I'll tell you one thing Papa
Joe told me about your father

180
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:42,166
that didn't make it into
the precious Flash museum.

181
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:44,146
Oh, Mama Cecile, the museum has

182
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,235
a complete record of all
of Dad's accomplishments.

183
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:48,338
Including the time Barry
ended up in an alternate past

184
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,008
filled with golden
giants called "Grodans"?

185
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,216
Wait, what?

186
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,482
Grodans.

187
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,352
Done. So then what happened?

188
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,755
Not done. Wait for it.

189
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,027
Huh.

190
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,498
Yeah.

191
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:16,887
So, why exactly does Caitlin have a key

192
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,690
to Professor Stein's old office?

193
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:21,370
Clarissa gave me a key. She
didn't realize that Martin

194
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:23,640
and my father knew each other either.

195
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,309
I wonder what he was doing in here.

196
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,891
Well, perhaps Mr. Ramon
could vibe the chalkboard

197
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:29,128
and we could see for ourselves.

198
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,581
What do you think?

199
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,903
What did you see?

200
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,336
Hydrogen chains bonded over and over.

201
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:56,786
Two oxygen at absolute zero.

202
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:58,589
It's like it's making heavy water.

203
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,360
Not heavy water.

204
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:02,862
Ice.

205
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:05,466
Another one of my
father's hidden messages?

206
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:10,254
Ah.

207
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,358
"Khione"?

208
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,263
What kind of a message is "Khione"?

209
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:17,599
A clear one.

210
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:21,317
At least to me. Look, monsieur Ramon,

211
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,867
you said that earlier that
you could see that Dr. Snow,

212
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,770
her father sketching something, right?

213
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:29,439
That sketch that you
could almost make out...

214
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:34,677
Did it look a little
something like this?

215
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:38,282
Good lord, are you a speedster?

216
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:41,251
Speed sketcher. It's a modest talent.

217
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:42,886
My father was drawing me?

218
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:46,156
Not you. Khione.

219
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:48,103
Khione, the Greek goddess.

220
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:53,063
Child of the North Wind,
whose realm was ice and snow.

221
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:55,265
Khione.

222
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:56,800
Killer Frost.

223
00:12:56,802 --> 00:12:58,635
That means that whatever
Thomas was doing,

224
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:00,504
he knew that there were two of you.

225
00:13:00,506 --> 00:13:02,806
Also, it stands to reason
that Thomas was there

226
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:04,942
at the point of
creation of Killer Frost.

227
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:11,480
So, he knew the truth
about Killer Frost?

228
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:15,185
- He knew who I really am?
- Right.

229
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:20,123
- Did I scare him away?
- No, this wasn't your fault.

230
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,626
Look, I don't know why he left,
but it wasn't because of you,

231
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:24,127
and we're gonna prove that.

232
00:13:33,672 --> 00:13:35,339
You okay?

233
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:37,608
Yeah, just lost my
footing there for a second.

234
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,343
- What...
- What did you see?

235
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:41,812
You guys ever hear of Viera Chemicals?

236
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:43,989
Oh, it's an old chem
lab out in the Barrens,

237
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:46,082
but it's been shut down for years.

238
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:48,251
Well, what are we waiting for?

239
00:14:07,673 --> 00:14:09,840
You know, it's been great
seeing you out there again,

240
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:11,708
doing what you love.

241
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:17,927
Yeah, I guess some girls grow
up wanting to be Supergirl.

242
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,434
I always wanted to be Soledad
O'Brien or Christiana Amanpour.

243
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:26,323
So yeah, it's really great to reconnect.

244
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:31,302
That's weird. It says the hair I found

245
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:34,088
is human but it can't pull any DNA.

246
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:36,592
- Maybe run it again?
- Yeah.

247
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:42,339
Come on, Novick.

248
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,205
You wanna improve Gotham City's skyline,

249
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,843
you do it with a building

250
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,479
nobody can take their eyes off of.

251
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:51,548
That's one of mine.

252
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,051
You go with me, I'll
design you a building

253
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:57,654
that makes the Burj Khalifa
look like a strip mall.

254
00:14:57,656 --> 00:15:00,223
Architecture means everything to me.

255
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:01,425
I mean, you tell me.

256
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,694
How many other architects have won

257
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:07,731
the Pritzker Prize three times?

258
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,232
Good choice.

259
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,708
Where did you get this?

260
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,286
By some really weird markings

261
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:21,010
at the bottom of a large gift box

262
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:24,146
that I'm pretty sure was
opened from the inside.

263
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:25,981
Okay, you know you're
opening all of our mail

264
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:27,084
from now on, right?

265
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,208
Somebody called in a bomb
threat at Seaver Architects.

266
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:40,197
- What happened?
- That thing, it did this.

267
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,834
Flash.

268
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,486
That thing destroyed my life's work.

269
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:33,953
So, he squeezed his way

270
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:35,445
through an air conditioning vent?

271
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:38,441
Yeah, he could stretch kinda like Ralph,

272
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:39,539
except he was wearing a...

273
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:40,831
- Clown mask.
- Yup.

274
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,023
Just like the guy that
stole the Winehouse necklace.

275
00:16:44,026 --> 00:16:47,187
Mm-hmm. We got a stretching clown meta.

276
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:49,031
Yeah, that's not creepy at all.

277
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:50,390
Yeah.

278
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:52,192
Did you find any more
of those weird lines?

279
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:54,261
No, and if there's more,
they're buried underneath

280
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,563
tons of rubble, just like
our meta, unless he was able

281
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,064
to stretch out of that one too.

282
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:02,066
Which... I'm sure he was.

283
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:04,104
- The lines.
- What?

284
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,540
Well, I mean, our meta can
stretch and contort, right?

285
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:09,442
What if his fingerprints can too?

286
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:14,247
Got him. Peter Merkel.

287
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:16,283
And he was arrested
for B&E two years ago.

288
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:20,353
Wait, Peter Merkel, the son
of Billionaire Theresa Merkel?

289
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:22,589
Yup.

290
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:24,724
How does someone go from
being a member of high society

291
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,294
to stealing heirlooms
and blowing up buildings?

292
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,262
Maybe we should attend
this gala she's hosting

293
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:30,441
and ask her ourselves.

294
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:32,620
Uh, I don't know,
what if Merkel's there?

295
00:17:32,623 --> 00:17:33,980
So what? We'll come prepared.

296
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:35,445
Some meta handcuffs for me,

297
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:37,909
a taser for you, and we get to dress up.

298
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:38,849
- Barry.
- What?

299
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:41,273
This is a meta investigation;
this is not date night.

300
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,610
I'm just saying, I look
really good in a tux.

301
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,050
When did this happen?

302
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,985
The night your father disappeared.

303
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,486
Oh.

304
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:56,623
Well, well, well. Liquid nitrogen.

305
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,525
That's a potent accelerant, is it not?

306
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,428
Oh, this place it would
have gone up. Whoa.

307
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,797
So, all my father's
work is completely gone?

308
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,966
Well, not necessarily.

309
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:07,703
I mean, think about it.

310
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:09,336
Police listed this fire as accidental,

311
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,098
but they didn't know
about the connection

312
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:12,739
to Caitlin's father, so...

313
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:15,742
Ralph, my father told
me to come find him.

314
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:19,179
Yeah, no, I know that,
but a guy who disappears

315
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,086
on the night of a warehouse
fire and who's hard to find?

316
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:24,483
Well, if you think this
was arson, let me tell you,

317
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:26,419
if her father did this, well,
he would need a lot of help

318
00:18:26,421 --> 00:18:28,888
covering his tracks, right?

319
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:31,591
Yeah. Maybe he got it.

320
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:39,797
Listen, my mom may
not be the best person,

321
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,528
but there's no way she'd be
party to something like this.

322
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:43,692
There's one way to find out.

323
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:44,871
What, you want to
question the mother again?

324
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,539
You already did that, and
what did you get? Nothing.

325
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,441
Well it's a clue. Surely,
we should follow it.

326
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:49,556
You already know that this is still

327
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:51,395
Tannhauser facility,
okay? So you're wrong.

328
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,679
Oh, I'm wrong? I'm wrong?

329
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,146
I'm the one who figured
out Cicada's mask.

330
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:55,196
You couldn't figure that out.

331
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:57,430
You said you wouldn't doubt
me, that was your mistake.

332
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,885
Enough, yeah, enough! Just give me this.

333
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,558
Cisco?

334
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:08,628
Cisco?

335
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:35,522
- You look amazing, by the way.
- Thank you.

336
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:38,257
There's Theresa Merkel. Come on.

337
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,893
Wait. What are we going to say?

338
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:42,325
We can't just ask her if
her son was recently hit

339
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:43,963
by dark matter into shrapnel.

340
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,665
- You'll think of something.
- Me?

341
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:49,636
So sorry.

342
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:52,237
Hi, Mrs. Merkel. I'm Iris West Allen.

343
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,107
Oh, I know who you are.

344
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,109
Don't you usually write about lunatics

345
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,212
and the heroes who catch them?

346
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:00,914
Well, you know, supporting the arts

347
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,734
is a citywide concern.

348
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:05,104
- Hmm.
- I'm Barry Allen.

349
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:08,521
Ah. And you're obviously
not here to make a sizeable

350
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:11,184
donation which means you, my dear,

351
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:12,792
are here on assignment.

352
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:18,631
All right, ask whatever you
like. You have two minutes.

353
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:21,901
Well, it's about your son, Peter.

354
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:23,736
When was the last time that you saw him?

355
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:25,638
That would be two years ago

356
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,408
when he broke into his own house.

357
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,219
I was out of town, and
my staff had him arrested.

358
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:33,788
Do you know where Peter is now?

359
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,781
No, and I don't care.

360
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:38,751
See, I gave him the world.

361
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:41,809
The finest private schools,
his own wing to play in.

362
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:45,358
But he just never appreciated it.

363
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:48,294
Enjoy the party.

364
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:53,265
I feel kinda bad for him now.

365
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:56,140
She's so cold.

366
00:20:56,143 --> 00:20:57,837
Can you imagine what that was like?

367
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:01,875
Hey, you know what?

368
00:21:01,878 --> 00:21:03,592
It's not a date without a dance.

369
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,796
Barry, wait. I mean,
this is work, right?

370
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,934
We just hit a dead end, so,
why don't we just go home?

371
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,538
Hey, hey.

372
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,041
Just one dance, all right?

373
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,773
Okay.

374
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:33,673
You know, we never really
had our first dance.

375
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,877
Yeah, this is really nice.

376
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:02,235
Excuse me for a second.

377
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:16,082
Hey. You okay?

378
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:25,420
She gave her only son
everything that she had

379
00:22:25,423 --> 00:22:28,224
and it wasn't enough.

380
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:30,961
Just like I'm not enough for Nora.

381
00:22:30,964 --> 00:22:34,266
You are nothing like
that woman in there.

382
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,328
You're sure, Barry?

383
00:22:36,331 --> 00:22:38,364
I mean, I love our
daughter with all my heart,

384
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:39,872
but she hates me.

385
00:22:39,874 --> 00:22:42,141
Because I turn my back on her

386
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:45,144
just like Theresa Merkel did to her son.

387
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:48,214
I lie to her about
everything that she is.

388
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:51,918
And I prevent her from living
the life that she deserves.

389
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,957
I'd hate me too. Iris.

390
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,333
You are never going to be
the person that Nora knows

391
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:02,362
from the future.

392
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:04,597
That's the thing.
It's not even up to us.

393
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:08,368
I've already become her

394
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,637
and I didn't even have a choice.

395
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:34,699
While you were unconscious,
I scanned your wounds.

396
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:37,369
There are still trace amounts
of aluminum-beryllium alloy

397
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:38,771
fused within your hands.

398
00:23:38,773 --> 00:23:40,516
It's remnants from Cicada's dagger.

399
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,798
See, this is... this is what I need.

400
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,775
I just need rest.

401
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:45,344
No, Cisco, rest is not
going to fix this, okay?

402
00:23:45,347 --> 00:23:47,789
Every time you vibe or
breach, the dark matter

403
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,337
is going to affect your
central nervous system,

404
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:51,050
causing you more and more pain.

405
00:23:51,052 --> 00:23:54,787
Wait... which you must have
been experiencing all day today.

406
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:56,455
Why didn't you say anything?

407
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:02,126
Because you're my friend
and you needed my help.

408
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:04,596
Okay, but I would never
ask you to hurt yourself.

409
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:06,034
Every time you vibe

410
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:08,081
you are going to have
more and more seizures.

411
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:10,050
Then what am I supposed to do?

412
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,297
I remember when these
powers were a curse.

413
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:26,099
Seeing Thawne kill me over and over.

414
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:29,304
Knowing that darkness.

415
00:24:29,307 --> 00:24:31,240
I didn't want that.

416
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:34,999
I didn't want to be a hero.

417
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:39,238
These powers were a part
of me. I had to learn that.

418
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:43,109
And when I did, they
showed me everything.

419
00:24:43,112 --> 00:24:46,147
I could vibe every clue.

420
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,317
I could breach us
wherever we needed to go.

421
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,420
I could bring my value to the team.

422
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:56,449
If I can't take the pain,
that means Cicada wins.

423
00:24:56,452 --> 00:24:59,019
No. Hey.

424
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:01,856
Listen, I get it, okay?

425
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:05,895
When DeVoe took away Killer
Frost, I was destroyed.

426
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:08,527
But you know what?

427
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:10,929
I'm still here.

428
00:25:10,931 --> 00:25:13,632
And so are you.

429
00:25:13,634 --> 00:25:17,803
Because you are Cisco Ramon.

430
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:19,638
Genius engineer,

431
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,807
prodigy hacker,

432
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,842
and the mechanic who built a cold gun

433
00:25:23,844 --> 00:25:26,845
that could stop a speedster.

434
00:25:28,215 --> 00:25:30,149
And you're my friend.

435
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:33,652
You're my friend who went out
there and hurt himself today.

436
00:25:33,654 --> 00:25:37,289
Just to help me try and find my dad.

437
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:39,958
And that wasn't vibe.

438
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,894
That was Cisco,

439
00:25:41,896 --> 00:25:44,062
and that's the guy I need.

440
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,167
That cold gun was pretty amazing.

441
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:51,417
It was stolen almost immediately...

442
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,887
Oh, immediately.

443
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,557
But yeah, it was pretty great.

444
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,796
You know, this case
will keep until morning.

445
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:09,868
Yeah, I know, it's just
Merkel's still out there.

446
00:26:09,871 --> 00:26:11,656
And the gala was a
dead end and all we know

447
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:14,726
is that he committed two
completely unrelated crimes.

448
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:20,732
I don't know what to
do about Nora, Barry.

449
00:26:22,174 --> 00:26:24,474
Yeah.

450
00:26:24,477 --> 00:26:27,905
Well, look. I mean, you know
I'm on your side with this.

451
00:26:27,908 --> 00:26:29,708
If you dampen her powers in the future,

452
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,076
it's because you care about her.

453
00:26:31,078 --> 00:26:32,544
You're doing it to keep her safe.

454
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:35,047
Yeah. Just because I can protect her

455
00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:37,249
doesn't mean that I'm a good mom.

456
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:44,337
This isn't like what
happened with Francine.

457
00:26:47,944 --> 00:26:50,111
Isn't it?

458
00:26:51,531 --> 00:26:56,434
She left me and my dad kept
it a secret all to protect me.

459
00:26:56,437 --> 00:26:58,604
And when she came
back, I pushed her away.

460
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:03,300
I barely had a chance
to know her before she...

461
00:27:09,216 --> 00:27:12,584
I lost my chance to
connect with my mom and...

462
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:15,454
Now when I get older, Nora
is going to push me away too.

463
00:27:15,456 --> 00:27:17,105
That's not gonna happen.

464
00:27:17,108 --> 00:27:19,708
Well, it sure seems to be
going in that direction.

465
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:21,845
Then choose a different route.

466
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,409
Make a different choice
when you raise Nora.

467
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:27,566
If you don't want to be that
person, don't be that person.

468
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:32,638
It's not that simple, Barry.

469
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
You're not your mom.

470
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:36,547
You're not Iris from the future,

471
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,844
and you don't have to be, ever.

472
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,609
I think you should stop worrying

473
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:48,320
about who you might become

474
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:51,256
and reconnect with who you are, now.

475
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:55,251
Yeah.

476
00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:57,269
Now, let's go home, all right?

477
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,841
Actually, can I just meet you there?

478
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:14,012
I think I have a lead.

479
00:28:15,542 --> 00:28:17,198
Okay.

480
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:25,122
Shut up. Dad did not keep singing.

481
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,925
No way was your father gonna let

482
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:29,516
the middle school production
of "Guys and Dolls"

483
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:31,663
turn out to be a disaster.

484
00:28:31,665 --> 00:28:34,844
Okay, um, one more.

485
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:38,971
So, when your dad was about ten,

486
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:43,041
there was a kid in his
class that lost his folks.

487
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:46,044
Kid stopped smiling, barely spoke.

488
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:48,313
And for some reason, all
of the other kids in school

489
00:28:48,315 --> 00:28:49,982
were being so mean to him.

490
00:28:49,984 --> 00:28:54,853
So, your father had lunch with this boy

491
00:28:54,856 --> 00:28:57,656
every single day

492
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,658
for a whole year.

493
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,028
And when springtime came
and the yearbook came out

494
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,965
your father gave the kid an entire page

495
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:09,334
and the photos of his
science fair project

496
00:29:09,336 --> 00:29:11,269
made him "most likely to succeed."

497
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:15,741
And then the boy finally smiled.

498
00:29:20,047 --> 00:29:23,065
Wait, but dad wasn't in yearbook.

499
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:31,503
That story wasn't about dad, was it?

500
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,829
It was about mom helping dad.

501
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:45,003
Wait, were all those stories
you told me about mom?

502
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:47,062
Nora, you're projecting
all of these feelings

503
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:51,543
that you have about
Iris 30 years from now.

504
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:54,179
You're not getting to
know who she is today.

505
00:29:55,482 --> 00:29:57,573
These stories that I told you,

506
00:29:57,576 --> 00:30:00,662
they're what made me fall
in love with the Wests.

507
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:04,394
Made me realize how
special this family is.

508
00:30:06,226 --> 00:30:07,759
So...

509
00:30:09,096 --> 00:30:13,298
If you liked them, plenty more in here.

510
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:45,917
Hey.

511
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,165
Hey babe, I just spoke with Mrs. Merkel.

512
00:30:48,168 --> 00:30:50,168
I think I know what Peter wants.

513
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:51,690
The Jewelry, the building,

514
00:30:51,693 --> 00:30:54,008
they all meant something
personal to the victim.

515
00:30:54,011 --> 00:30:55,207
He wants to deliver

516
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:58,156
the most painfully
emotional blow possible.

517
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,744
Just like his family did to him.

518
00:30:59,746 --> 00:31:02,614
You... you okay?

519
00:31:02,616 --> 00:31:04,549
Yeah.

520
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:07,519
Yeah, sorry, that MO fits perfectly.

521
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:09,087
Who do you think's his next victim?

522
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:11,156
Ugh!

523
00:31:11,158 --> 00:31:13,158
Barry?

524
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,026
Come and get him.

525
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,569
Guys, Merkel kidnapped Barry.

526
00:31:22,572 --> 00:31:24,238
- What?
- How's that even possible?

527
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:25,706
He's got Barry's meta-cuffs.

528
00:31:25,708 --> 00:31:28,842
- Well, that would do it.
- Who are you calling?

529
00:31:33,382 --> 00:31:34,843
Damn it, Nora pick up.

530
00:31:34,846 --> 00:31:36,966
I'll ping Barry's cell,
see if I can get a location.

531
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:40,921
He's in Eaglesham
apartments on Simone Ave.

532
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:43,207
I don't think he's in the
apartments so much as on them.

533
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,444
Right.

534
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:47,027
Okay, guys. We don't have a
speedster, Cisco can't breach,

535
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,172
and Killer Frost is out of commission.

536
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:50,663
We need to come up with a
plan to rescue Barry now.

537
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:52,433
The extrapolator. We can
reach in and grab him.

538
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:53,390
Great, where is it?

539
00:31:53,393 --> 00:31:55,015
Right.

540
00:31:55,018 --> 00:31:57,252
Uh, about that...

541
00:31:58,376 --> 00:31:59,776
I broke it.

542
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:01,637
How did you break
this? Batting practice?

543
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,749
It's not user friendly.

544
00:32:02,752 --> 00:32:04,343
- You're not user friendly!
- Cisco.

545
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:05,913
It's going to take me at
least an hour to fix it.

546
00:32:05,915 --> 00:32:07,609
- Cisco, we don't have an hour.
- Well, I...

547
00:32:07,611 --> 00:32:09,611
No, but we do have me.

548
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:13,553
Let's go save The Flash.

549
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,624
That was inspiring.

550
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:20,448
- You got a cuff key?
- Thanks.

551
00:32:20,451 --> 00:32:22,096
I'll drive.

552
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:23,597
Actually, I wanna try something.

553
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,199
Saw it in a comic book.

554
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:29,303
Whoo-hoo!

555
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:31,127
Whoo!

556
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,341
Ah, you're choking
me. You're choking me.

557
00:32:39,719 --> 00:32:41,186
Hey, I used to live there.

558
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:43,223
- Ralph.
- Oh, I got it.

559
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:33,309
Police man.

560
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:35,479
Fancy cuffs.

561
00:33:37,107 --> 00:33:39,274
Peter, you don't want to do this.

562
00:33:39,277 --> 00:33:41,210
Look, I know how you got your abilities.

563
00:33:41,213 --> 00:33:43,713
The night of the enlightenment, right?

564
00:33:43,716 --> 00:33:46,846
You were hit by a piece of
the satellite, weren't you?

565
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:48,382
Crushed!

566
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:50,317
Snapped.

567
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,947
Broken.

568
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,322
Okay, well, I know
people who can help you.

569
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,424
People who could stop your suffering.

570
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:06,847
Suffering can't be stopped.

571
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:11,386
Especially hers.

572
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,525
If you touch Iris...

573
00:34:13,528 --> 00:34:16,410
Don't want to hear your pain.

574
00:34:16,412 --> 00:34:18,971
Only your wife's.

575
00:34:21,751 --> 00:34:24,150
Let him go.

576
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:26,140
The wife.

577
00:34:26,143 --> 00:34:29,807
You fire, he dies.

578
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:36,345
Okay.

579
00:34:42,104 --> 00:34:43,937
Okay.

580
00:34:43,939 --> 00:34:46,874
Just don't hurt him.

581
00:34:51,947 --> 00:34:53,213
Hey Caitlin, what's up?

582
00:34:55,985 --> 00:34:58,285
You heard the lady, Raggedy Dandy.

583
00:34:58,287 --> 00:34:59,553
Let him go.

584
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,156
Okay.

585
00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:05,107
Barry!

586
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:21,602
Mom. Holy schrap.

587
00:35:21,605 --> 00:35:24,811
You just threw yourself
off a building to save dad?

588
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:27,885
- Yeah.
- That was beyond schway.

589
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:29,949
- You're crazy.
- I am.

590
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:32,549
- Thank you. I love you.
- I love you.

591
00:35:35,024 --> 00:35:37,224
Oh, my God. Ralph is still up there.

592
00:35:37,226 --> 00:35:39,635
I hope I don't land on my keys!

593
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:40,728
Ah.

594
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:45,828
Uh.

595
00:35:52,408 --> 00:35:55,075
You guys still have those meta-cuffs?

596
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:03,530
Iris West Allen, I know
badassery when I see it

597
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:06,030
and that was raw, unrefined, cage-free,

598
00:36:06,032 --> 00:36:08,232
non-GMO, badassery right there.

599
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,935
- You dove off a building.
- For me.

600
00:36:10,937 --> 00:36:12,570
Yeah, I guess I kinda did.

601
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:14,338
What was going through you mind?

602
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,276
"Uh, please, God, don't
let me drop this key."

603
00:36:18,278 --> 00:36:21,445
I mean, weren't you afraid?
You're not a speedster.

604
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:23,514
No, I'm not.

605
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:28,020
But my husband and my
partner and my best friend is.

606
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:31,265
Well, not to interrupt
this wonderful moment

607
00:36:31,268 --> 00:36:34,358
that I just interrupted,
but, you know, I helped defeat

608
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,193
- that boneless bozo too.
- Mm-hmm.

609
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:40,031
It wasn't so easy. And
that... God, that mask.

610
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:42,233
It's like one of those porcelain dolls

611
00:36:42,236 --> 00:36:46,404
that's gonna kill you while you sleep.

612
00:36:46,406 --> 00:36:50,741
I thought it was more like a ragdoll.

613
00:36:50,743 --> 00:36:53,210
Yeah, that's right. Still got it.

614
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,079
Hold your applause.

615
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:56,314
Guess it's off to Iron Heights

616
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:58,883
for slippery old ragdoll.

617
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:01,218
Oh, wait, you're... you're leaving?

618
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,087
Yeah, um, there's
something I need to do,

619
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:05,556
but I'll be right back. I promise.

620
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:09,360
She looks happy.

621
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:13,331
Yeah, she really does.

622
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:23,441
I do that too.

623
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:24,709
Oh.

624
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,313
I was writing about
what you did tonight.

625
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:30,915
It was awesome.

626
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:33,517
Thanks.

627
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:35,727
I guess it kinda runs in the family.

628
00:37:39,564 --> 00:37:42,665
- Where did you get that?
- Oh.

629
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:50,801
Dad's always adding
to it. It's so silly.

630
00:37:50,803 --> 00:37:54,205
No, it's not. It's your life.

631
00:37:54,207 --> 00:37:58,042
I mean, editor of the
school paper by age 11.

632
00:37:58,044 --> 00:38:01,812
Exposing a corrupt school
teacher at the age of 15.

633
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:04,582
I mean, you never talk about this stuff.

634
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:06,684
In the... the future, I mean.

635
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:10,947
It's, um, one of your off-limits topics.

636
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,117
I'm not allowed to ask about it.

637
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:20,331
Look.

638
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:23,900
Nora.

639
00:38:26,621 --> 00:38:29,321
I am not that person in the future.

640
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,511
And nothing is off limits to me, okay?

641
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:36,838
I'm not gonna sit behind
a desk and say "no."

642
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:39,495
I want you to live your life.

643
00:38:39,498 --> 00:38:41,498
And...

644
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:46,605
I want you to be a part of mine.

645
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:50,243
No secrets, no lies, just...

646
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:52,705
Us being who we are today.

647
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:57,977
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

648
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,043
Did you really stake out the
school bathroom in third grade

649
00:39:07,046 --> 00:39:10,314
to prove that the school
janitor wasn't cleaning it?

650
00:39:10,317 --> 00:39:12,584
I'm gonna kill Cecile.

651
00:39:12,587 --> 00:39:14,119
But, um, yes.

652
00:39:14,122 --> 00:39:16,890
I was a real-life Nancy Drew back then.

653
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:20,064
Wow. That's cool, mum.

654
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,292
Um, is it?

655
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,697
Shirley and I were talking
and while we realize our styles

656
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:28,299
are very different, what we both like...

657
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:29,921
Is a good mystery.

658
00:39:29,924 --> 00:39:31,119
So we put our heads together.

659
00:39:31,122 --> 00:39:32,656
And after some
intellectual hair pulling,

660
00:39:32,658 --> 00:39:35,236
we realized that if
your mom wasn't lying...

661
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,739
And Tannhauser was
still somehow involved...

662
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,827
There's only one sure
place somebody could hide

663
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,682
without anyone knowing about it.

664
00:39:41,685 --> 00:39:44,054
A Tannhauser black ops site.

665
00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:44,975
There you go.

666
00:39:44,978 --> 00:39:46,650
I mean, they've got dozens of them.

667
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:49,253
They were safe houses to test
dangerous pathogens for the CDC

668
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:51,920
but Mom hasn't taken a
government job in years.

669
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:53,923
They'd all be shut down.

670
00:39:53,926 --> 00:39:57,461
Yeah, that's why it's
the best place to hide.

671
00:39:57,463 --> 00:39:59,029
Okay, so how do we find them?

672
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:01,999
Without Sally? Uh,
have you tried Google?

673
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:03,994
Yes. We just use their satellite.

674
00:40:03,997 --> 00:40:06,037
I don't think we can use
someone else's satellite.

675
00:40:07,373 --> 00:40:08,606
Or maybe we can.

676
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:14,879
When DeVoe took over
Sally, he also launched four

677
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:17,348
of his own satellites to
bring about the enlightenment,

678
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:21,485
but now that he's gone maybe
we can work around the...

679
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,754
Multiplexed burst-model channels

680
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:25,723
and the inter-SV handoff.

681
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:37,568
We've got eyes and ears.

682
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,836
We've got eyes and ears!

683
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:40,304
- I knew you could do it.
- Ah!

684
00:40:40,306 --> 00:40:42,273
- Oh, sorry.
- That was dumb.

685
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:47,912
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce you to...

686
00:40:47,914 --> 00:40:54,451
HAL, Robbie, Data, and Colossus.

687
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:57,721
I don't really like those names.

688
00:40:57,723 --> 00:40:59,671
But nonetheless, those can help us

689
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,799
in tracking the shards
from the satellite?

690
00:41:01,802 --> 00:41:04,061
These babies can help with
anything and everything.

691
00:41:04,063 --> 00:41:06,205
Well, once we figure
out which one hit Cicada,

692
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,897
we can figure out how
he got his abilities,

693
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,300
maybe find some kind of a weakness.

694
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:12,136
So, what we are waiting for?

695
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:20,744
Caitlin? Do you know what this means?

696
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:23,747
We can locate your father.

697
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:26,383
Wait, wait. I, uh...

698
00:41:28,314 --> 00:41:29,880
Isn't this what you wanted?

699
00:41:29,883 --> 00:41:31,849
It is, I just...

700
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:39,050
Okay.

701
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:44,060
When you're ready.

702
00:41:44,063 --> 00:41:45,812
Thanks.

703
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:51,367
