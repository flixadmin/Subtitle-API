Pardon us...

00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:16,235

笙ｪ <i>I le tﾄ》ou lalolagi</i> 笙ｪ
Upon our world

Look down...

12
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:45,826
笙ｪ <i>E taunuku te malaga</i> 笙ｪ
The journey has begun

13
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:49,350
笙ｪ <i>Mﾄ］aia o le tﾄ》ou ﾅ考aga.</i> 笙ｪ
At how beautiful our lives are.

14
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:55,644
In the beginning,

15
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:58,063
there was only ocean.

16
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,009
Until the "Mother Island" emerged.

17
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:04,671
Te Fiti.

18
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,435
Her heart held the greatest
power ever known.

19
00:01:09,764 --> 00:01:12,330
It could create life itself!

20
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:16,591
And Te Fiti shared it with the world.

21
00:01:19,523 --> 00:01:23,646
But in time, some began to seek
Te Fiti's heart.

22
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:26,170
They believed if they could possess it,

23
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,432
the great power of
creation would be theirs.

24
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:31,808
And one day...

25
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:35,585
The most daring of them all...

26
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:39,779
voyaged across the vast
ocean to take it.

27
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:45,171
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.

28
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:49,121
He was a warrior ...

29
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:51,876
A trickster!

30
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:57,045
A shape shifter who could change form

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,110
with the power of his magical fish hook.

32
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:06,256
And his name was Maui!

33
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:17,815
But without her heart,

34
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:20,084
Te Fiti began to crumble,

35
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:23,530
giving birth to a terrible darkness.

36
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:43,771
Maui tried to escape,

37
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:47,310
but was confronted by another,
who sought the heart.

38
00:02:50,058 --> 00:02:54,384
Te Ka! A demon of Earth and Fire.

39
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:05,098
Maui was struck from the sky!

40
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:08,265
Never to be seen again.

41
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,381
And his magical fish hook ...

42
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:17,054
and the heart of Te Fiti,
were lost to the sea,

43
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:21,416
where even now,
a thousand years later...

44
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:26,366
Te Ka and the demons of the deep
still hunt for the heart.

45
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:30,756
Hiding in a darkness that
will continue to spread...

46
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,122
Chasing away our fish!

47
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:36,730
Draining the life from island after island!

48
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:38,901
Until every one of us...

49
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,120
is devoured by the blood-thirsty jaws...

50
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:46,058
of inescapable death!

51
00:03:51,345 --> 00:03:52,638
But one day...

52
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:54,788
the heart will be found

53
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:58,172
by someone who would
journey beyond our reef,

54
00:03:58,334 --> 00:03:59,627
find Maui,

55
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:01,850
deliver him across
the great ocean...

56
00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:04,233
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

57
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,074
and save us all.

58
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:08,665
Thank you mother, that's enough.

59
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:09,587
Papa...

60
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:11,776
No one goes outside the reef.

61
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,236
We are safe here!

62
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:16,859
There is no darkness.
There are no monsters.

63
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:21,863
- Monster! Monster! Monster!
- There's no monster... no monsters!

64
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,433
It's the darkness!

65
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,446
No, there is nothing beyond
our reef but storms!

66
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:28,503
- And rough seas!
- I gotta throw up!

67
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:31,490
As long as we stay on our very safe island,

68
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,561
we'll be fine!

69
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:34,046
The legends are true.

70
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:35,898
Someone will have to go!

71
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:36,598
Mother...

72
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,744
Motunui is paradise!

73
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:40,782
Who would want to go anywhere else?

74
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:20,099
Shoo! Shooo!

75
00:05:54,402 --> 00:06:00,469
~ <i>Ou mata e matagi</i> ~
Your eyes so full of wonder

76
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:06,937
~ <i>Ou loto mamaina toa</i> ~
Your heart, an innocent warior

77
00:06:07,237 --> 00:06:12,871
~ <i>Manatu atu</i> ~
My dearest one

78
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:19,671
~ <i>Taku pelepele</i> ~
There's a task for you

79
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:25,772
~ <i>Pa mai to mafanafanaga</i> ~
Let it flow over you

80
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:32,839
~ <i>Saolotoga tenei</i> ~
The freedom you feel

81
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:38,507
~ Manatunatu ~
And your deep thoughts

82
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:44,874
~ <i>Ki tamafine</i> ~
Our young girl

83
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:51,808
~ <i>Maua ai te lumanai</i> ~
Have you come

84
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:58,042
~ <i>Ki tamafine</i> ~
Our young girl

85
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,497
Moana!

86
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:15,410
~ <i>Ou mata e matagi</i> ~
Your eyes so full of wonder

87
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,990
There you are Moana, what are you doing?
You scared me!

88
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:21,448
But I want us to go back.

89
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:22,506
I know, I know...

90
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:24,444
But you don't go out there.

91
00:07:25,222 --> 00:07:26,209
It's dangerous.

92
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:29,742
Moana, come on...

93
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:31,863
Let's go back to the village.

94
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:36,651
You are the next great
chief of our people.

95
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:39,675
And you'll do wonderous
things, my little Minnow.

96
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,109
Oh yes, but first...

97
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:44,128
You must learn where you're meant to be.

98
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:57,440
Moana...

99
00:07:58,364 --> 00:08:00,631
Make way .. Make way.

100
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,684
Moana, it's time you knew.

101
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:06,746
The village of Motunui is all you need.

102
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,849
The dancers are practicing

103
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:11,049
They dance to an ancient song.

104
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:14,433
Who needs a new song?
This old one's all we need

105
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,487
This tradition is our mission.

106
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:18,917
And Moana there's so much to do.

107
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:23,028
Don't trip on the taro root.
That's all you need.

108
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:24,982
We share everything we make.

109
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:27,267
We joke and we weave our baskets.

110
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:29,817
The fishermen come back from the sea.

111
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:33,088
- I wanna see.
- Don't walk away.

112
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,483
Moana stay on the ground now.

113
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:39,466
Our people will need a
chief and there you are...

114
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:41,159
There comes a day.

115
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,477
When you're gonna look around.

116
00:08:43,683 --> 00:08:47,698
And realize happiness
is where you are.

117
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:49,395
Consider the coconut!

118
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:51,865
Consider it's tree...

119
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:53,348
We use each part of the coconut.

120
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,561
That's all we need.

121
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,983
We make our nets from the fibers.

122
00:08:58,012 --> 00:08:59,871
The water is sweet inside.

123
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,930
We use the leaves
to build fires.

124
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,734
We cook up the meat inside.

125
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:05,718
Consider the coconuts!

126
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,141
The trunks and the leaves!

127
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:10,594
The island gives us what we need.

128
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:13,718
- And no one leaves.
- That's right we stay.

129
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:16,158
We're safe and we're well provided.

130
00:09:16,283 --> 00:09:18,110
And when we look to the future...

131
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,267
There you are.

132
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:21,973
You'll be okay.

133
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,316
In time you'll learn just as I did.

134
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:29,588
You must find happiness right
where you are!

135
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,643
I like to dance with the water.

136
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,707
The undertow and the waves.

137
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:40,631
The water is mischievous, ha!

138
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:42,660
I like how it misbehaves.

139
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:45,121
The village may think I'm crazy.

140
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:46,929
Or say that I drift too far.

141
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:52,111
But once you know what you like.
Well, there you are.

142
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:55,558
You are your father's daughter.

143
00:09:56,106 --> 00:09:57,741
Stubbornness and pride.

144
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,002
Mind what he says, but remember.

145
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,078
You may hear a voice inside..

146
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:07,463
Dad!

147
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:09,516
I was only looking at the boats.

148
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:11,261
I wasn't gonna get on them.

149
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:15,856
Come on.

150
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:17,957
There's something I
need to show you.

151
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:23,976
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

152
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,579
This is a sacred place,

153
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:28,501
a place of Chiefs.

154
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:30,485
There will come a time

155
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:33,462
when you will stand on
this peak and place...

156
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:35,685
a stone on this mountain.

157
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:37,018
Like I did.

158
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,594
Like my father did.

159
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,300
And his father and every chief
that has ever been.

160
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:44,659
And on that day...

161
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,062
when you add your stone,

162
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,647
you will raise this whole
island higher.

163
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:53,636
You are the future of
our people, Moana.

164
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:55,932
And they are not out there.

165
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,884
They are right here.

166
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:02,570
It's time to be who they need you to be.

167
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:06,784
- We make our nets from the fibers.
- We weave our nets from the fibers

168
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:08,730
- The water is sweet inside.
- The real taste of tree's inside.

169
00:11:08,754 --> 00:11:10,722
- We use the leaves to build fires.
- We sing these songs in our choirs.

170
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:12,784
- And cook up the meat inside.
- We have mouths to feed inside.

171
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:15,089
- The village believe in us.
- That's right!

172
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,092
The village believe!

173
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:19,373
The island gives us what we need.

174
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:22,799
And no one leaves!
So here I'll stay.

175
00:11:23,206 --> 00:11:25,009
My home, my people beside me.

176
00:11:25,225 --> 00:11:27,071
And when I think of tomorrow.

177
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:29,310
There we are.

178
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:30,869
I'll lead the way.

179
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:33,212
I'll have my people to guide me.

180
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:35,355
We'll build our future together.

181
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:37,330
Where we are.

182
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:39,275
'Cause every path leads you back to...

183
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,510
Where you are.

184
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:45,089
- You can find happiness right...
- Where you are

185
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:48,674
Where you are....

186
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:55,729
Every storm, this roof leaks
no matter how many fronds I add.

187
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,480
Fixed!

188
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:57,961
Knot the fronds!

189
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:02,044
Wind shifted the post.

190
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:04,631
That's good pork!

191
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:08,736
Oh, I mean...

192
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:09,620
No, I wasn't ...

193
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:12,512
What? They're calling me! So I gotta...

194
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:13,578
Bye!

195
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:17,997
You're doing great.

196
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:19,300
Is it done yet?

197
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:22,724
So close.

198
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:39,330
I'm curious about that chicken.

199
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:40,646
Eating the rock!

200
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:43,960
I think he seems to lack the
basic intelligence required for

201
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:45,756
pretty much everything.

202
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,432
Should we maybe just...

203
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,750
Cook him?

204
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:52,749
Sometimes our strengths
lie beneath the surface.

205
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:55,749
Far beneath...

206
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:57,274
in some cases.

207
00:12:57,482 --> 00:13:00,482
But I'm sure there's more to
Hei-hei than meets the eye!

208
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,960
It's the harvest.

209
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:12,045
This morning I was
husking the coconuts and ...

210
00:13:19,103 --> 00:13:19,681
Well...

211
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,154
We should clear the diseased trees.

212
00:13:22,597 --> 00:13:24,712
And we will start a new grove

213
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:26,289
There!

214
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,873
Thanks, Moana.

215
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:31,743
She's doing great!

216
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,596
This suits you.

217
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:38,459
Chief!

218
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,358
There's something you need to see.

219
00:13:42,362 --> 00:13:43,907
Our traps in the east lagoon.

220
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:45,893
They're pulling out less and less fish.

221
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:49,023
Then we'll rotate
the fishing grounds.

222
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:51,098
We have. There's no fish.

223
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:54,777
Then we'll fish the far side of the island.

224
00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:55,595
We tried.

225
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,346
The windward side?

226
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,545
And the leeward side.

227
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,854
The shallows, the channel.

228
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,732
We've tried the whole lagoon!

229
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,005
They're just... gone.

230
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:06,524
Well, have you tried using
a different bait?

231
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,154
I don't think it's the bait.

232
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,495
I will talk to the council.

233
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:17,873
- I'm sure we ca...
- What if...

234
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:19,484
We fished beyond the reef!

235
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:23,260
No one goes beyond the reef.

236
00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:26,059
I know! But if there are no fish in the lagoon...

237
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,814
- Moana!
- And there's a whole ocean...

238
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,432
We have one rule!

239
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:31,128
An old rule when there were fish!

240
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,843
A rule that keeps us safe!

241
00:14:32,868 --> 00:14:34,881
- But dad...
- Instead of endangering our people

242
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,741
So you can run right back to the water!

243
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,744
Every time, I think
you're past this.

244
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,146
No one goes beyond the reef!

245
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:00,464
Well, it's not like you said it in
front of your dad

246
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:03,004
Standing on a boat.

247
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,209
I didn't say go beyond the reef

248
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:08,324
because I want to be on the ocean.

249
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:09,898
But you still do.

250
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:14,216
- He's hard on you, because...
- Because he doesn't get me.

251
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:16,707
Because he was you.

252
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:19,356
Drawn to the ocean.

253
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,074
Down by the shore.

254
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:23,578
He took a canoe, Moana.

255
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:25,761
He crossed the reef.

256
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:28,861
And found an unforgiving sea.

257
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:31,389
Waves like mountains.

258
00:15:32,337 --> 00:15:34,824
His best friend begged
to be on that boat.

259
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:37,218
Your dad couldn't save him.

260
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:42,487
He's hoping he can save you.

261
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:47,883
Sometimes, who we wish we were,

262
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,244
what we wish we could do...

263
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:54,117
It's just not meant to be.

264
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:12,790
I've been staring at
the edge of the water.

265
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:18,892
Long as I can remember,
never really knowing why

266
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:24,682
I wish I could be the perfect daughter

267
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:30,578
But I come back to the water,
no matter how hard I try

268
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:35,245
Every turn I take,
every trail I track

269
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:38,110
Every path I make,
every road leads back

270
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:41,021
To the place I know where I cannot go

271
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:43,506
Where I long to be

272
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:46,024
See the line where the
sky meets the sea?

273
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:48,727
It calls me

274
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:54,985
And no one knows
How far it goes

275
00:16:55,478 --> 00:17:00,129
If the wind in my sail on
the sea stays behind me

276
00:17:00,226 --> 00:17:03,378
One day I値l know

277
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:07,801
If I go there痴 just no
telling how far I値l go

278
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:13,898
I know everybody on this island
seems so happy, on this island

279
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,190
Everything is by design

280
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:25,145
I know everybody on this island
has a role, on this island

281
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:27,920
So maybe I can roll with mine

282
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:32,610
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong

283
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:35,277
I値l be satisfied if I play along

284
00:17:35,518 --> 00:17:38,212
But the voice inside sings a different song

285
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:41,021
What is wrong with me?

286
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:49,104
See the light as it shines on the sea?
It痴 blinding

287
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:55,037
But no one knows
How deep it goes

288
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:57,437
And it seems like it痴 calling out to me

289
00:17:57,521 --> 00:18:03,186
So come find me
And let me know

290
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,693
What痴 beyond that line,
will I cross that line?

291
00:18:06,912 --> 00:18:11,895
See the line where the sky
meets the sea? It calls me

292
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:18,011
And no one knows
How far it goes

293
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:22,982
If the wind in my sail on
the sea stays behind me

294
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:32,731
One day I値l know
How far I値l go

295
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:40,497
Okay, Pua.

296
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,089
I can do this.

297
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:46,165
There's more fish
beyond the reef.

298
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:49,610
There's more beyond the reef.

299
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,351
Not so bad!

300
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,630
Pua!

301
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:03,034
Whatever just happened,

302
00:20:03,922 --> 00:20:04,987
blame it on the pig!

303
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,060
Grandma!

304
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,162
Are you gonna tell dad.

305
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:14,371
I'm his mom.

306
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:16,786
I don't have to tell him anything.

307
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:21,290
He was right.

308
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,875
About going out there.

309
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:29,464
It's time to put my stone on the mountain.

310
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:32,786
Okay!

311
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:34,878
Well, then head on back.

312
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:37,587
Put that stone up there.

313
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,529
Why aren't you trying to talk me out of it?

314
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,378
You said that's what you wanted.

315
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:48,810
It is.

316
00:20:52,977 --> 00:20:54,196
When I die.

317
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:58,212
I'm going to come back as one of these.

318
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:01,454
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

319
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,655
Why are you acting weird?

320
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,923
I'm the village crazy lady.

321
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,406
That's my job.

322
00:21:08,211 --> 00:21:09,722
If there's something you
want to tell me.

323
00:21:09,774 --> 00:21:10,824
Just tell me.

324
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:14,607
Is there something you
want to tell me?

325
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:18,047
Is there something you want to hear?

326
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:26,185
You've been told all our people stories.

327
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:27,953
But one.

328
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:30,893
What is this place?

329
00:21:31,046 --> 00:21:35,574
Do you really think our
ancestors stayed within the reef?

330
00:21:47,213 --> 00:21:48,420
What's in there?

331
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:50,015
The answer,

332
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,340
to the question you
keep asking yourself.

333
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,329
Who are you meant to be.

334
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:00,969
Go inside.

335
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,967
Bang the drum,

336
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:05,362
and find out.

337
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:15,625
Bang the drum.

338
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:11,173
<i>Tatou o Tagata Folau</i>
(We read the wind and the sky)

339
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:12,915
<i>E vala窶兮uina.</i>
(When the sun is high)

340
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:16,491
<i>E le Atua o le sami tele</i>
(We sail the length of the seas)

341
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:17,889
<i>E o mai.</i>
(On the ocean breeze)

342
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:20,974
<i>La ava'e le lu'itau e lelei.</i>
(At night we name every star)

343
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:25,509
<i>Tapenapena.</i>
(We know where we are)

344
00:24:27,922 --> 00:24:29,971
<i>Aue, Aue.</i>

345
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,090
<i>Nuku i mua.</i>
(We set a course to find)

346
00:24:32,777 --> 00:24:37,313
<i>Te manulele e tataki iei.</i>
(A brand new island everywere we roam)

347
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:39,677
<i>Aue, Aue.</i>

348
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,360
<i>Te fenua te malie.</i>
(We keep our island in our mind)

349
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,960
<i>Nae ko hakilia</i>
(And when it's time to find home)

350
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
<i>Kainga e</i>
(We know the way)

351
00:24:47,516 --> 00:24:50,565
We read the wind and the sky.

352
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:52,134
When the sun is high.

353
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:56,952
We sail the length of the seas on
the ocean breeze.

354
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:02,461
At night we name every star.
We know where we are.

355
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:04,732
We know who we are.

356
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:06,981
Who we are.

357
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,450
Aue, Aue...

358
00:25:09,548 --> 00:25:11,583
We set a course to find.

359
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:16,684
A brand new island everywhere we roam.

360
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:18,704
Aue, Aue....

361
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:21,510
We keep our island in our mind.

362
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,969
And when it's time to find home.

363
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:26,675
We know the way.

364
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:27,953
Aue, Aue....

365
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:31,081
We are explorers
reading every sign.

366
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:34,226
We tell the stories of our elders.

367
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:37,619
In a never ending chain.

368
00:25:38,551 --> 00:25:41,074
Te fenua, te malie.

369
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:50,523
Nae ko hakilia.
We know the way!

370
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,137
We were voyagers.

371
00:25:55,523 --> 00:26:04,057
We were voyagers!

372
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:05,022
Why'd we stop?

373
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:07,651
Maui!

374
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,761
When he stole from the Mother Island.

375
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:12,319
Darkness fell.

376
00:26:12,841 --> 00:26:14,242
Te Ka awoke.

377
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,837
Monsters lurked and boats
stopped coming back.

378
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:21,508
To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs

379
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:22,666
Forbid voyaging.

380
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:26,086
And now we have forgotten
who we are.

381
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:30,468
And the darkness has continued to spread.

382
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:33,184
Chasing away our fish.

383
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,027
Draining the life

384
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:38,784
From island after island.

385
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,586
Our island

386
00:26:44,255 --> 00:26:46,336
But one day

387
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:49,420
Someone will journey beyond our reef.

388
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:50,729
Find Maui.

389
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,842
Deliver him across the great ocean.

390
00:26:54,902 --> 00:26:58,597
To restore the heart of Te Fiti.

391
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,712
I was there that day.

392
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:05,617
The ocean chose you!

393
00:27:14,904 --> 00:27:17,036
I thought it was a dream.

394
00:27:23,148 --> 00:27:24,021
Nope!

395
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:29,258
Our ancestors believed, Maui lies there.

396
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:30,856
At the bottom of his hook.

397
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:34,478
Follow it, and you will find him.

398
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,255
But...

399
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:37,581
Why would it choose me?

400
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:41,250
I don't even know how
to make it past the reef.

401
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:43,650
But I know who does.

402
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,915
The crops are turning black!

403
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:55,967
What about the fish?

404
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:57,514
- This is happening all over the island.
- Please. please.

405
00:27:57,531 --> 00:27:58,635
- Settle down!
- What are you going to do?

406
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,706
We will dig new fields.

407
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,866
- We will find a way to...
- We can stop the darkness!

408
00:28:02,206 --> 00:28:03,398
Save our island!

409
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:05,042
There's a cavern of boats!

410
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:06,787
Huge canoes!

411
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:08,777
We can take them, find Maui

412
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:10,234
Make him restore
the heart.

413
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:12,104
We were voyagers.

414
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,737
We can voyage again!

415
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,028
You told me to help our people.

416
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:21,179
This is how we help our people!

417
00:28:22,063 --> 00:28:22,994
Dad?

418
00:28:23,014 --> 00:28:24,048
What are you doing?

419
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,753
I should've burned those
boats a long time ago!

420
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:27,666
No! Don't!

421
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:29,119
We have to find Maui.

422
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:30,542
We have to restore the heart.

423
00:28:30,718 --> 00:28:31,933
There is no heart!

424
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:34,229
This...this is just a rock!

425
00:28:34,552 --> 00:28:35,028
No!

426
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:48,856
Chief!

427
00:28:49,486 --> 00:28:50,461
It's your mother!

428
00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:01,553
Mother.

429
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:19,180
What can be done?

430
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:26,970
Go.

431
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:28,183
Grandma.

432
00:29:31,695 --> 00:29:32,369
Go.

433
00:29:33,248 --> 00:29:34,047
Not now.

434
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:35,357
I can't.

435
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:36,933
You must!

436
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,160
The ocean chose you!

437
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,887
- Follow the fish hook.
- Grandma.

438
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,458
And when you find Maui.

439
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,162
You grab him by the ear!

440
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:49,504
You say...

441
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:53,042
I am Moana of Motunui!

442
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:55,746
You will board my boat!

443
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,846
Sail across the sea!

444
00:29:58,593 --> 00:30:01,728
And restore the heart of Te Fiti!

445
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,502
I... I can't leave you.

446
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:11,884
There is no way you could go,
that I won't be with you.

447
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:25,871
Go!

448
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:43,607
There's a line where the sky meet the sea.
And it calls me.

449
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:46,500
But no one knows.

450
00:30:46,731 --> 00:30:49,735
How far it goes.

451
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:55,046
All time wondering where
I need to be is behind me.

452
00:30:55,157 --> 00:30:58,157
I'm on my own

453
00:30:58,438 --> 00:31:01,661
Towards unknown!

454
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,842
Every turn I take.
Every trail I track.

455
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,570
It's a choise I make.
Now I can't turn back.

456
00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:09,139
From a great unknown.

457
00:31:09,156 --> 00:31:13,754
Where I go alone.
Where I long to be.

458
00:31:22,602 --> 00:31:27,685
See her light of the night.
in the sea, she calls me.

459
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:30,408
And yes, I know.

460
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,857
That I can go.

461
00:31:34,043 --> 00:31:39,075
There's a moon in the sky and the
wind is behind me.

462
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:41,686
So now I'll know.

463
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:48,780
How far I'll go!

464
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:07,441
I am Moana Motunui.

465
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:08,923
You will board my boat.

466
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,641
Sail across the sea!

467
00:32:10,963 --> 00:32:13,038
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.

468
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,557
I am Moana.

469
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:19,998
Of Motu... nui.

470
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,076
Hei-hei?!

471
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:56,687
It's okay.

472
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:58,219
You're alright.

473
00:32:58,595 --> 00:32:59,616
See?

474
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,613
There we go.

475
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:03,563
Nice water.

476
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,012
The ocean is a friend of mine.

477
00:33:08,466 --> 00:33:10,466
Hei-hei?

478
00:33:10,796 --> 00:33:12,796
Hei-hei!

479
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:28,781
Stay!

480
00:33:33,896 --> 00:33:34,378
Okay.

481
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:35,579
Next stop.

482
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:36,739
Maui.

483
00:33:45,006 --> 00:33:47,506
I am Moana of Motunui.

484
00:33:47,897 --> 00:33:50,254
You will board my boat.

485
00:33:51,393 --> 00:33:54,263
Sail across the sea.

486
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:56,820
And restore the heart of Te Fiti.

487
00:33:57,888 --> 00:34:02,025
I am Moana... of .. Mo..tu....

488
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:03,992
Board my boat!

489
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:07,925
Oh, no!

490
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,093
No ... no... no...no!

491
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:16,620
No!

492
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:29,576
Ocean?

493
00:34:30,296 --> 00:34:33,296
Can I get a little help?

494
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:37,222
No... no.

495
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:39,650
Please.

496
00:34:40,421 --> 00:34:41,164
Come on!

497
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:53,607
Help me!

498
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:54,992
Please!

499
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:41,335
What?!

500
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,728
I said help me!

501
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:46,044
And wrecking my boat?!

502
00:35:46,487 --> 00:35:47,973
Not helping!

503
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:52,319
Fish pee in you... all day!

504
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:53,565
So...

505
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:09,051
Maui?

506
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:16,951
Maui!

507
00:36:20,777 --> 00:36:23,249
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea

508
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:25,455
I am Moana of Motunui!

509
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,927
You will board my boat!

510
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:27,410
No!

511
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:29,218
You will board my boat!

512
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:29,728
Yeah!

513
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,001
Hi, I'm Moana of Motunui.

514
00:36:32,285 --> 00:36:35,474
- You will board my...
- Boat!

515
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:37,092
A boat!

516
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:40,650
The Gods have given me a...

517
00:36:54,343 --> 00:36:54,859
Maui

518
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:56,081
Shape shifter.

519
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,162
Demigod of the wind and sea.

520
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:00,509
- I am Moana of Mo...
- Hero of Men.

521
00:37:00,645 --> 00:37:01,386
Wha..What?

522
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,093
It's actually Maui, shape shifter.

523
00:37:03,178 --> 00:37:04,538
Demigod of the wind and sea!

524
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:05,784
Hero of Men.

525
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:08,606
I interupted. From the top.
Hero of Men.

526
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:09,068
Go!

527
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,397
- I am Mo...
- Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry.

528
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:14,457
And women.

529
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,747
Men and women. Both! All!

530
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:18,673
Not a guy-girl thing.

531
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,690
You know? Maui
is a hero to all!

532
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:21,495
You're doing great.

533
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:22,581
What?

534
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,194
- No! I'm here to ...
- Of course, of course.

535
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:26,448
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

536
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:28,885
Maui always has time
for his fans.

537
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:32,714
When you use a bird to write with

538
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,752
It's called "tweeting".

539
00:37:38,628 --> 00:37:41,375
I know, not every day, you get a
chance to meet your hero.

540
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:44,584
You are not my hero!

541
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:47,412
And I'm not here so you
can sign my oar!

542
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:49,690
I'm here because you stole
the heart of Te Fiti!

543
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:52,090
And you will board my boat.

544
00:37:52,765 --> 00:37:55,180
Sail across the sea and put it back!

545
00:37:57,307 --> 00:37:58,307
Yeah.

546
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,396
It almost sounded like you
don't like me.

547
00:38:00,464 --> 00:38:02,886
Which is impossible
because I got stuck here

548
00:38:03,085 --> 00:38:05,018
for a thousand years,
trying to get the heart...

549
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,760
as a gift for you, mortals...

550
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:10,201
so you could have the power
to create life itself!

551
00:38:10,563 --> 00:38:13,330
Yeah, so what I believe
you're trying to say.

552
00:38:13,902 --> 00:38:15,586
- Is thank you.
- Thank you?

553
00:38:15,608 --> 00:38:17,509
- You're welcome.
- What? No, no, no.

554
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,012
I .. I didn't ...
I wasn't ...

555
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:21,728
- Why would I ever say... I mean...
- Okay, okay, okay...

556
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:24,341
I see what's happening, yeah.

557
00:38:25,574 --> 00:38:27,949
You're face to face with
greatness and it's strange.

558
00:38:28,165 --> 00:38:30,607
You don't even know
how you feel.

559
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:32,087
It's adorable!

560
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:35,144
Well, it's nice to see that humans
never change.

561
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:38,717
Open your eyes let's begin.

562
00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:41,659
Yes, it's really me, It's Maui.
Breathe it in.

563
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:45,892
I know it's a lot the hair, the bod!

564
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:48,805
When you're staring at a Demigod

565
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:51,083
What can I say?

566
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,271
Except you're welcome.

567
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:56,444
For the tides, the sun, the sky.

568
00:38:56,784 --> 00:39:00,361
Hey, it's okay. It is okay.
You're welcome.

569
00:39:01,063 --> 00:39:03,795
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy, Hey!

570
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:07,089
Hey, what has two thumbs
and pulled up the sky.

571
00:39:07,282 --> 00:39:10,149
When you were waddling yay high.
This guy!

572
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,281
When the nights got cold.

573
00:39:12,322 --> 00:39:14,989
Who stole you fire from down below?

574
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:16,678
You're looking at him, yo!

575
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:21,180
Oh, also I lasso'd the sun.

576
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,201
You're welcome.

577
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:24,800
To stretch your days and bring you fun.

578
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:28,490
Also I harnessed the breeze.

579
00:39:28,544 --> 00:39:31,720
You're welcome, to fill your sails
and shake your trees.

580
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:35,766
So what can I say except
You're welcome.

581
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:38,965
For the islands I pulled from the sea.

582
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:42,864
There's no need to pray, it's okay.
You're welcome.

583
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,207
I guess it's just my way of being me.

584
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:48,407
You're welcome.

585
00:39:48,538 --> 00:39:50,216
You're welcome.

586
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:52,502
Well, come to think of it.

587
00:39:52,746 --> 00:39:54,568
Kid, honestly I can go on and on.

588
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,390
I can explain every natural phenomenon.

589
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:57,936
The tide, the grass,  the ground.

590
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,738
Oh... that was Maui just messing around.

591
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,501
I killed an eel, I
buried its guts.

592
00:40:01,556 --> 00:40:03,251
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts.

593
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,237
What's the lesson?

594
00:40:04,259 --> 00:40:05,230
What is the takeaway.

595
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:06,993
Don't mess with Maui when he's
on the breakaway.

596
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,646
And the tapestry here in my skin.

597
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:10,267
Is a map of the victories I win.

598
00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:12,233
Look where I've been, I
make everything happen.

599
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:14,205
Look at that mean mini Maui just
tikitty tappin'

600
00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:21,954
Well anyway, let me say,
You're welcome

601
00:40:22,356 --> 00:40:24,981
For the wonderful world you know.

602
00:40:25,545 --> 00:40:28,969
Hey, it's okay... it's okay.
You're welcome

603
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:32,091
Well, come to think of
it, I gotta go.

604
00:40:32,693 --> 00:40:36,337
Hey, it's your day to say
You're welcome.

605
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:39,266
Cause I'm gonna need that boat.

606
00:40:39,594 --> 00:40:43,453
I'm sailing away... away.
You're welcome.

607
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,493
Cause Maui can do
everything but float.

608
00:40:47,298 --> 00:40:48,749
You're welcome.

609
00:40:49,124 --> 00:40:50,978
You're welcome.

610
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,046
And thank you!

611
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:56,244
Hey, let me out!

612
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,686
You lying, slimy, son of a...

613
00:41:00,516 --> 00:41:02,409
You're welcome.

614
00:41:11,043 --> 00:41:11,588
No!

615
00:41:11,848 --> 00:41:13,679
I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

616
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:14,654
I'm gonna get my hook.

617
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:16,952
You have yours. And I'm not Maui
without mine.

618
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:20,373
Okay, talk to the back.

619
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:26,732
Boat snack!

620
00:41:53,256 --> 00:41:57,156
Good riddance you filthy pile of pebbles!

621
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:58,187
Oh, no, no, no.

622
00:41:58,385 --> 00:41:59,603
Don't look at me like that.

623
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:01,750
It's a beautiful cave, she's gonna love it.

624
00:42:02,759 --> 00:42:04,335
And I'm going to love you.

625
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,047
In my belly.

626
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,610
Now let's fatten you up, drumstick!

627
00:42:31,803 --> 00:42:33,477
I could watch that all day.

628
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:35,779
Okay, enjoy the island!

629
00:42:36,068 --> 00:42:37,865
- Maui, out!
- No!

630
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,676
Stop!

631
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,711
Hey! You have to put
back the heart!

632
00:42:57,623 --> 00:42:59,335
Did not see that coming.

633
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:04,289
I am Moana of Motunui.

634
00:43:04,555 --> 00:43:05,757
This is my canoe.

635
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,914
And you will journey to...

636
00:43:10,912 --> 00:43:12,556
Alright, get over it.
We gotta move.

637
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,090
And she's back.

638
00:43:16,112 --> 00:43:18,890
I am Moana of Motunu...

639
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,065
- It was Moana, right?
- Yes.

640
00:43:26,399 --> 00:43:28,810
And you will restore the heart.

641
00:43:40,128 --> 00:43:42,128
Alright, I'm out.

642
00:43:46,588 --> 00:43:47,671
Oh, come on!

643
00:43:48,707 --> 00:43:50,210
What is your problem?

644
00:43:51,693 --> 00:43:54,879
- Are you afraid of it?
- No.

645
00:43:55,213 --> 00:43:57,511
No. I'm not afraid...

646
00:44:00,822 --> 00:44:03,214
Stay out of it or you're
sleeping in my armpit.

647
00:44:03,401 --> 00:44:05,686
You stop it.
That is not a heart.

648
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,931
It is a curse. The second I took it

649
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:09,777
I got blasted out of the sky

650
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,809
and I lost my hook!

651
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:12,391
Get it away from me.

652
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,213
Get this away?

653
00:44:14,302 --> 00:44:16,410
I'm a Demigod, okay?

654
00:44:16,435 --> 00:44:18,012
Stop that!
I will smite you!

655
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:19,576
You wannna get "smote"?

656
00:44:20,129 --> 00:44:21,829
"Smoten"?

657
00:44:21,874 --> 00:44:24,593
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life.

658
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,492
It's a homing beacon of death.

659
00:44:26,634 --> 00:44:28,958
If you don't put it away, bad things
are gonna come for it.

660
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:31,243
Come for this? The heart?

661
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:33,366
You mean this heart right here!

662
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:35,033
Come and get it!

663
00:44:35,055 --> 00:44:36,395
You are gonna get us killed.

664
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,611
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti.

665
00:44:38,765 --> 00:44:39,967
So you can put it back.

666
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:40,772
Thank you.

667
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:42,239
You're welcome.

668
00:44:47,495 --> 00:44:48,822
Kakamora.

669
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:49,857
Kaka... what?

670
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,532
Murdering little pirates.

671
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:54,639
Wonder what they're here for?

672
00:44:59,857 --> 00:45:02,000
They're kind of cute.

673
00:45:19,747 --> 00:45:22,495
Ocean do something, help us!

674
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:25,006
The ocean doesn't help you.
You help yourself!

675
00:45:25,466 --> 00:45:27,466
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

676
00:45:28,674 --> 00:45:29,966
You can't sail?!

677
00:45:30,131 --> 00:45:31,387
I...

678
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,020
I am self taught?

679
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:46,916
Can't you shape shift
or something?!

680
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:47,823
Do you see my hook?

681
00:45:47,993 --> 00:45:49,841
No magic hook, no magic powers.

682
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:17,485
Their boat is turning into more boats!

683
00:46:37,163 --> 00:46:39,277
Yup! I just did that.

684
00:46:45,243 --> 00:46:46,451
No, no, no, no!

685
00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:49,549
Hei-hei!

686
00:47:02,665 --> 00:47:04,899
Maui! They took the heart!

687
00:47:07,568 --> 00:47:08,368
That's a chicken.

688
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:09,717
The heart is in the...

689
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:12,156
We have to get him back!

690
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,251
Maui!

691
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:34,532
There! Right there!

692
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:37,095
You're turning?!
What are you doing?!

693
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:38,525
Escaping.

694
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:41,415
- The heart!
- Forget it, you'll never get it back.

695
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,686
Beside, we got a better one.

696
00:47:44,205 --> 00:47:44,676
Hey!

697
00:47:45,186 --> 00:47:46,575
What do I gonna steer with?!

698
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,913
They're just gonna kill you!

699
00:47:53,187 --> 00:47:54,060
Coconuts.

700
00:48:37,388 --> 00:48:38,433
Got it!

701
00:48:42,571 --> 00:48:43,042
Hey!

702
00:48:59,071 --> 00:48:59,578
Yeah!

703
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,083
We did it!

704
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:05,679
Congratulations, on not being dead, curly.

705
00:49:05,877 --> 00:49:06,688
You surprise me.

706
00:49:07,674 --> 00:49:09,658
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

707
00:49:11,013 --> 00:49:12,062
You wanna get to Te Fiti.

708
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,432
You gotta go through
a whole ocean of bad.

709
00:49:14,523 --> 00:49:15,761
Not to mention Te Ka.

710
00:49:17,173 --> 00:49:18,212
Lava monster?

711
00:49:19,155 --> 00:49:20,618
Ever defeat a lava monster?

712
00:49:21,394 --> 00:49:22,394
No.

713
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:24,925
Have you?

714
00:49:31,033 --> 00:49:34,633
I'm not going on a
suicide mission with some mortal.

715
00:49:35,023 --> 00:49:37,200
You can't restore the heart
without me.

716
00:49:37,744 --> 00:49:39,111
And me says no.

717
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:42,564
I'm getting my hook.

718
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,092
End of discussion.

719
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:52,721
You'd be a hero.

720
00:49:55,233 --> 00:49:57,376
That's what you're all about, right?

721
00:49:57,772 --> 00:50:00,683
Little girl, I am a hero.

722
00:50:00,882 --> 00:50:03,068
Maybe you were but now...

723
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:06,453
Now you're just the guy who
stole the heart of Te Fiti.

724
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:08,591
The guy who cursed the world!

725
00:50:10,602 --> 00:50:11,979
You're no one's hero.

726
00:50:12,682 --> 00:50:14,682
No one?

727
00:50:23,184 --> 00:50:25,747
But, put this back...

728
00:50:26,376 --> 00:50:27,776
save the world...

729
00:50:28,178 --> 00:50:30,333
You'd be everyone's hero.

730
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:38,821
Maui! Maui! Maui!

731
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:40,378
You're so amazing!

732
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:42,158
We'd never make it without my hook.

733
00:50:42,764 --> 00:50:43,837
Not pass Te Ka.

734
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,766
Then we get your hook.

735
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:47,020
We get your hook, take out Te Ka.

736
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:47,986
Restore the heart.

737
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:51,024
Unless you don't wanna be

738
00:50:51,608 --> 00:50:57,839
Maui, Demigod of the Wind and
Sea, Hero to all?

739
00:51:01,832 --> 00:51:03,158
First, we get my hook.

740
00:51:03,635 --> 00:51:04,848
Then save the world.

741
00:51:05,534 --> 00:51:06,124
Deal?

742
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:07,278
Deal.

743
00:51:12,121 --> 00:51:12,824
Worth a shot.

744
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:15,808
Okay, we go east.

745
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:17,950
To the lair of Tamatoa.

746
00:51:19,741 --> 00:51:23,114
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom feeder.

747
00:51:36,128 --> 00:51:37,128
Teach me to sail.

748
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:43,000
My job is to deliver
Maui across the great ocean.

749
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,156
I should...

750
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:47,451
I should be sailing.

751
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,916
It's called Wayfinding, Princess.

752
00:51:50,342 --> 00:51:52,297
And it's not just sails and knots.

753
00:51:52,361 --> 00:51:55,228
It's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

754
00:51:55,301 --> 00:51:56,463
Knowing where you are.

755
00:51:57,104 --> 00:51:58,799
By knowing where you've been.

756
00:51:59,138 --> 00:52:01,632
Okay, first,
I'm not a princess.

757
00:52:02,006 --> 00:52:03,327
I'm the daughter of the chief.

758
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:04,449
- Same difference.
- No.

759
00:52:04,466 --> 00:52:07,112
If you wear a dress, and you have an
animal sidekick.

760
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:08,560
You're a Princess.

761
00:52:08,784 --> 00:52:10,017
You're not a wayfinder.

762
00:52:10,176 --> 00:52:11,627
You will never be a wayfinder.

763
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:13,412
You will never be a way...

764
00:52:18,833 --> 00:52:19,533
Really?

765
00:52:19,605 --> 00:52:21,188
Blow dart in my butt cheek.

766
00:52:26,379 --> 00:52:29,488
You are a bad person.

767
00:52:29,505 --> 00:52:30,945
If you can talk, you can teach.

768
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,280
Wayfinding.

769
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,119
Lesson one. Hit it!

770
00:52:37,924 --> 00:52:38,927
Pull the sheet.

771
00:52:39,795 --> 00:52:40,849
Not the sheet.

772
00:52:41,504 --> 00:52:42,009
No.

773
00:52:42,587 --> 00:52:42,927
Nope!

774
00:52:43,715 --> 00:52:44,186
Nope!

775
00:52:44,991 --> 00:52:45,428
No.

776
00:52:46,885 --> 00:52:48,123
Tried that one already.

777
00:52:51,932 --> 00:52:53,615
You're measuring the stars.

778
00:52:53,701 --> 00:52:55,589
Not giving the sky a high five.

779
00:52:57,098 --> 00:52:59,695
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

780
00:53:01,934 --> 00:53:02,934
It's cold.

781
00:53:03,562 --> 00:53:05,370
Wait, it's getting warmer.

782
00:53:07,327 --> 00:53:08,750
That is disgusting!

783
00:53:09,135 --> 00:53:10,138
What is wrong with you?!

784
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:27,906
We're here?

785
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,225
See? Told you I could do it!

786
00:53:39,872 --> 00:53:40,881
Motunui.

787
00:53:42,338 --> 00:53:43,387
I'm home?

788
00:53:47,531 --> 00:53:48,336
Moana!

789
00:53:48,568 --> 00:53:49,152
Dad?

790
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,427
Moana!

791
00:53:52,045 --> 00:53:52,589
Mom?

792
00:53:54,534 --> 00:53:55,169
Help!

793
00:53:57,533 --> 00:53:58,299
No!

794
00:53:58,899 --> 00:53:59,710
Moana!

795
00:54:03,043 --> 00:54:04,143
Enjoy your beauty rest?

796
00:54:04,914 --> 00:54:07,349
You know, a real wayfinder, never sleeps.

797
00:54:07,841 --> 00:54:10,067
So they actually get where they need to go.

798
00:54:11,094 --> 00:54:12,194
Muscle up buttercup!

799
00:54:13,165 --> 00:54:15,165
We're here.

800
00:54:16,074 --> 00:54:17,985
You sure this guy's gonna have your hook?

801
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:20,748
Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.

802
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,062
He's a scavenger.

803
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,477
Collects stuff, things that makes
him look cool.

804
00:54:26,386 --> 00:54:27,389
And for Tamatoa?

805
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:30,823
Trust me, my hook
is the coolest collectible.

806
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:33,862
And he lives up there?

807
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,204
Oh, no, no, no...

808
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:38,674
That's just the entrance

809
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,154
To a Lalotai.

810
00:54:41,517 --> 00:54:42,214
Lalotai?

811
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:44,107
Realm of Monsters?!

812
00:54:45,326 --> 00:54:47,186
We're going to the Realm of Monsters?

813
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:48,082
We?

814
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:48,858
No.

815
00:54:49,071 --> 00:54:49,530
Me.

816
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:52,528
You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.

817
00:54:55,192 --> 00:54:57,192
That's what I'm talking about,
give me some!

818
00:54:58,026 --> 00:55:00,537
Come on, that was a good one,
how do you not get it?

819
00:55:00,566 --> 00:55:02,690
I called her a chicken, there's
a chicken on the boat.

820
00:55:02,944 --> 00:55:05,631
I know she's human! But that's not the...
You know what? Forget it.

821
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:07,449
Forget it! I'm not explaining it to you.

822
00:55:07,687 --> 00:55:09,377
'Cause then it's not funny.

823
00:55:23,456 --> 00:55:23,893
So...

824
00:55:24,145 --> 00:55:25,222
Daughter of the chief.

825
00:55:25,528 --> 00:55:27,047
I thought you stayed in the village.

826
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,041
You know, kissing babies and things.

827
00:55:30,044 --> 00:55:32,126
Hey, I'm just trying to understand

828
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:34,757
why your people decided to send...

829
00:55:34,774 --> 00:55:35,960
How do I phrase this?

830
00:55:36,116 --> 00:55:36,816
You!

831
00:55:36,824 --> 00:55:37,539
My people...

832
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:41,235
Didn't send me.
The ocean did.

833
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,884
The ocean? Makes sense!
You're what? Eight?

834
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:45,685
Can't sail?

835
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:46,915
Obvious choice.

836
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:48,959
It chose me.

837
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:50,663
For a reason.

838
00:55:50,963 --> 00:55:52,460
If the ocean's so smart

839
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:55,206
why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

840
00:55:55,949 --> 00:55:57,029
Or bring me my hook?

841
00:55:57,856 --> 00:56:00,067
The ocean's straight up pooky dooks!

842
00:56:01,094 --> 00:56:03,098
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

843
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:05,391
You're the chosen one.

844
00:56:21,572 --> 00:56:23,959
The ocean chose you for a reason.

845
00:56:25,118 --> 00:56:27,335
If you start singing, I'm gonna throw up.

846
00:56:28,417 --> 00:56:30,577
So, not seeing an entrance.

847
00:56:30,696 --> 00:56:35,000
Yes, because it only
appears after a human sacrifice.

848
00:56:36,805 --> 00:56:38,272
Kidding!

849
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,161
So serious!

850
00:57:03,244 --> 00:57:06,522
Don't worry. It's a lot farther
down than it looks.

851
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:16,067
I am still falling!

852
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,140
You can do this.

853
00:57:20,376 --> 00:57:21,376
Go!

854
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,645
And he sticks the landing.

855
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:47,848
What?

856
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:49,537
Dumb-dumb, she's not even here.

857
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:52,310
No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of mon...

858
00:57:57,792 --> 00:57:58,461
Well....

859
00:57:58,654 --> 00:57:59,655
She's dead.

860
00:58:00,366 --> 00:58:02,175
Okay, let's get my hook.

861
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,187
Maui's fish hook.

862
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,520
Yeah!

863
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:08,246
Sorry!

864
00:59:08,727 --> 00:59:10,180
I thought you were a monster, but...

865
00:59:10,191 --> 00:59:11,937
I found your hook! And you're right...

866
00:59:11,954 --> 00:59:14,287
- This Tamatoa guy really likes his treasure.
- Stay!

867
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:15,755
What? No!

868
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,271
- I... I'm the one who found...
- Listen...

869
00:59:17,274 --> 00:59:18,684
For a thousand years...

870
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:21,296
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky,

871
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:24,086
getting my hook,
and being awesome again.

872
00:59:24,233 --> 00:59:26,630
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal,

873
00:59:26,654 --> 00:59:27,663
who has no business

874
00:59:27,681 --> 00:59:30,073
inside of a monster's cave except...

875
00:59:32,386 --> 00:59:33,408
Except...

876
00:59:33,941 --> 00:59:34,941
Maybe as bait.

877
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:36,576
Huh?

878
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:40,256
Wow! The shiny, glittery cave.

879
00:59:40,472 --> 00:59:41,861
And just like me,

880
00:59:42,048 --> 00:59:44,702
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

881
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:46,204
Sparkle, sparkle

882
00:59:46,618 --> 00:59:48,259
- Sparkle.
- You're not selling it.

883
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,572
This is stupid! I'm just gonna
walk up and get it.

884
00:59:50,612 --> 00:59:52,463
You go up there,
he will kill you.

885
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:53,664
Just stick to the plan.

886
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,441
Oh, when he shows up,
keep him distracted.

887
00:59:57,656 --> 00:59:59,127
Make him talk about himself.

888
00:59:59,152 --> 01:00:01,458
He loves bragging about
how great he is!

889
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:03,531
You two must get along swell!

890
01:00:03,737 --> 01:00:06,137
No. Not since I ripped off his leg.

891
01:00:06,158 --> 01:00:07,691
You ripped off his le...

892
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:09,186
Maui?

893
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:20,686
What have we here?

894
01:00:21,366 --> 01:00:24,048
It's a sparkly, shiny.

895
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:25,443
Wait a minute...

896
01:00:27,213 --> 01:00:28,307
It's a human!

897
01:00:28,421 --> 01:00:30,053
What are you doing down here?

898
01:00:30,078 --> 01:00:33,292
In the realm of the mons...
Just pick an eye, babe.

899
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,866
I can't... I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying

900
01:00:35,895 --> 01:00:37,811
if you keep...
Yep, pick one, pick one!

901
01:00:38,621 --> 01:00:40,991
You're a funny looking
little thing, aren't you?

902
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:42,476
Don't! That's my grandma's.

903
01:00:42,504 --> 01:00:44,808
"That's my grandma's"
I ate my grandma!

904
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:47,705
And it took a week 'cause
she was absolutely humongous.

905
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:48,907
Why are you here?

906
01:00:50,379 --> 01:00:51,280
'Cause you're amazing!

907
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:56,159
And we mortals, have heard of
the tale of the crab.

908
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,447
Who became a legend!

909
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:59,652
And I just had to know...

910
01:00:59,669 --> 01:01:03,788
How you being so crab...

911
01:01:04,478 --> 01:01:05,454
-oulous?

912
01:01:06,236 --> 01:01:10,314
Are you just trying to get me to
talk about myself?

913
01:01:11,355 --> 01:01:12,959
Because if you are...

914
01:01:13,356 --> 01:01:15,402
I will gladly do so.

915
01:01:16,412 --> 01:01:17,937
In song form!

916
01:01:20,461 --> 01:01:23,666
Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam.

917
01:01:23,953 --> 01:01:26,427
I was a drab little crab once..

918
01:01:27,089 --> 01:01:30,163
Now I know, I can be
happy as a clam.

919
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:32,833
Because I'm beautiful, baby.

920
01:01:33,696 --> 01:01:36,871
Did your granny say listen to your heart.

921
01:01:37,091 --> 01:01:39,664
Be who you are on the inside.

922
01:01:40,118 --> 01:01:43,158
I need three words to tear her
argument apart.

923
01:01:43,525 --> 01:01:44,786
Your granny lied.

924
01:01:44,837 --> 01:01:49,684
I'd rather be shiny like a treasure
from a sunken pirate wreck.

925
01:01:50,196 --> 01:01:53,592
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny.

926
01:01:53,657 --> 01:01:56,341
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck.

927
01:01:56,815 --> 01:01:59,156
Just a sec, don't you know?

928
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:03,095
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters

929
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:07,704
Beginners. Oh, and here they
come, come, come.

930
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:10,034
To the brightest thing that glitters.

931
01:02:10,256 --> 01:02:13,475
Mmm, fish dinners.
I just love free food.

932
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,622
And you look like seafood

933
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,764
- No!
- Hey! Crab cake.

934
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:24,841
I'm back!

935
01:02:26,607 --> 01:02:28,722
It's Maui time!

936
01:02:31,336 --> 01:02:32,651
What do you say, little buddy.

937
01:02:33,706 --> 01:02:35,301
Giant hawk? Coming up!

938
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:48,834
Well, well, well....

939
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:52,229
Little Maui's having trouble with his look.

940
01:02:52,728 --> 01:02:55,025
You little semi-demi-mini-god.

941
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:59,332
Ouch! What a terrible performance.
Get the hook! Get it?

942
01:02:59,357 --> 01:03:02,388
You don't swing it like you used to, man.

943
01:03:02,582 --> 01:03:05,816
Yet I have to give you credit for my start.

944
01:03:05,842 --> 01:03:08,418
And your tattoos on the outside.

945
01:03:09,022 --> 01:03:12,103
For just like you I made
myself a work of art.

946
01:03:12,423 --> 01:03:14,148
I'll never hide, I can't.

947
01:03:14,171 --> 01:03:18,989
I'm too shiny! Watch me dazzle like
a diamond in the rough.

948
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:22,271
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny.

949
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,079
Send your armies but
they'll never be enough.

950
01:03:25,283 --> 01:03:28,079
My shell's too tough, Maui man.

951
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:29,788
You could try, try, try...

952
01:03:29,832 --> 01:03:32,243
But you can't expect a demigod.

953
01:03:32,447 --> 01:03:33,586
To beat a decapod.

954
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:34,564
Look it up!

955
01:03:34,659 --> 01:03:38,537
You will die, die, die.
Now it's time for me to take apart.

956
01:03:39,002 --> 01:03:40,300
Your aching heart.

957
01:03:40,827 --> 01:03:45,820
Far from the ones who abandoned you.

958
01:03:45,832 --> 01:03:50,161
Chasing the love of these humans.

959
01:03:50,392 --> 01:03:53,456
Who made you feel wanted.

960
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:56,052
You try to be tough.

961
01:03:56,494 --> 01:04:00,274
But your armour's just not hard enough.

962
01:04:00,544 --> 01:04:05,074
Maui! Now it's time to kick your hiney.

963
01:04:05,094 --> 01:04:08,200
Ever seen someone so shiny?

964
01:04:08,484 --> 01:04:11,148
Soak it in cause it's
the last you'll ever see.

965
01:04:11,613 --> 01:04:14,891
C'est la vie mon ami, I'm so shiny!

966
01:04:15,033 --> 01:04:17,971
Now I'll eat you so prepare
your final plea.

967
01:04:18,236 --> 01:04:19,431
Just for me.

968
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:23,490
You'll never be quite as shiny

969
01:04:23,515 --> 01:04:29,437
You wish you were nice and shiny

970
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,333
Hey!

971
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:33,731
I got something shiny for you.

972
01:04:35,978 --> 01:04:38,082
The heart of Te Fiti.

973
01:04:38,478 --> 01:04:40,833
You can't run from me.

974
01:04:40,925 --> 01:04:41,617
Oh, you can?

975
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:43,215
You keep surprising me.

976
01:04:45,325 --> 01:04:48,159
There's only so far you can get on
these two little legs.

977
01:04:52,548 --> 01:04:54,151
The power of creation!

978
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:55,802
For a crustacean!

979
01:04:56,242 --> 01:04:58,047
Where is it?
Where is it?

980
01:04:58,540 --> 01:04:59,560
We gotta go!

981
01:05:00,346 --> 01:05:01,740
Well, what about the heart.

982
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:02,951
He can have it.

983
01:05:03,135 --> 01:05:04,365
I've got a better one.

984
01:05:05,775 --> 01:05:08,082
Yes, I have the ...
Wait a minute.

985
01:05:08,598 --> 01:05:10,224
I see she's taken a barnacle

986
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:12,819
And she's covered it in
bioluminescent algae.

987
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:14,310
As a diversion.

988
01:05:17,153 --> 01:05:18,605
Come back here!

989
01:05:24,818 --> 01:05:26,286
Hey! Hey!

990
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:28,004
Did you like the song?

991
01:05:36,273 --> 01:05:37,287
We're alive!

992
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,268
We're alive!

993
01:05:40,884 --> 01:05:41,923
Listen

994
01:05:42,012 --> 01:05:44,909
I appreciate what you did down there.

995
01:05:45,091 --> 01:05:46,209
Took guts.

996
01:05:46,624 --> 01:05:48,206
But... I'm sorry.

997
01:05:48,603 --> 01:05:52,106
I'm tryin' to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

998
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:54,690
- No, no, no way!
- Really?

999
01:05:54,894 --> 01:05:56,447
'Cause you're looking at
me like I have a ...

1000
01:05:59,727 --> 01:06:00,617
Shark head.

1001
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,313
- Do you have a shark head? 'Cause I ...
- Look ...

1002
01:06:04,505 --> 01:06:05,616
The point is ...

1003
01:06:06,206 --> 01:06:11,077
For a little girl, child thing, whatever
who had no business being down there.

1004
01:06:11,938 --> 01:06:13,066
You did me a solid.

1005
01:06:13,854 --> 01:06:15,158
But you also almost died.

1006
01:06:15,736 --> 01:06:17,661
And I couldn't even beat
the dumb crab!

1007
01:06:18,006 --> 01:06:19,781
So chances of beating Te Ka...

1008
01:06:20,481 --> 01:06:21,481
Bupkiss.

1009
01:06:21,867 --> 01:06:23,373
We're never making it to Te Fiti.

1010
01:06:23,636 --> 01:06:24,775
This mission is cursed.

1011
01:06:25,141 --> 01:06:26,944
It's not cursed.

1012
01:06:27,363 --> 01:06:30,704
- Shark head.
- It is not cursed!

1013
01:06:45,269 --> 01:06:46,269
Cursed.

1014
01:06:50,391 --> 01:06:54,218
What can I say, except
we're dead soon.

1015
01:06:54,638 --> 01:06:56,219
We're dead soon.

1016
01:06:57,307 --> 01:06:59,226
Can you at least try?

1017
01:07:01,547 --> 01:07:03,254
Giant hawk.

1018
01:07:06,349 --> 01:07:09,323
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.
We're dead soon.

1019
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,279
Alright, breaktime's over.

1020
01:07:11,586 --> 01:07:12,884
- Get up!
- Why?

1021
01:07:13,122 --> 01:07:14,528
You're gonna give me a speech

1022
01:07:15,002 --> 01:07:18,925
Tell me I could beat Te Ka
'cause I'm "Maui"?

1023
01:07:20,633 --> 01:07:21,710
Take a hike, tiny.

1024
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,037
How do you get your tattoo's?

1025
01:07:30,552 --> 01:07:32,842
They show up when I earn them.

1026
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,218
How'd you earn that one?

1027
01:07:35,353 --> 01:07:36,735
What's that for?

1028
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:39,816
That's a man's discovery of Nanya.

1029
01:07:40,329 --> 01:07:41,367
What's Nanya?

1030
01:07:41,426 --> 01:07:42,430
None ya business.

1031
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:45,596
I'll just keep asking.

1032
01:07:48,187 --> 01:07:49,521
What's it for?

1033
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,460
You need to stop doing that.

1034
01:07:56,266 --> 01:07:58,272
- Back off!
- Just tell me what it is?!

1035
01:07:58,295 --> 01:07:59,576
I said back off.

1036
01:07:59,978 --> 01:08:01,362
Is it why your hook's not working?

1037
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:18,779
You don't wanna talk.

1038
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,460
Don't talk.

1039
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,675
You wanna throw me off the boat.

1040
01:08:23,163 --> 01:08:24,361
Throw me off.

1041
01:08:24,988 --> 01:08:27,758
You wanna tell me, I don't
know what I'm doing?

1042
01:08:28,903 --> 01:08:29,918
I know I don't.

1043
01:08:31,381 --> 01:08:34,440
I have no idea why
the ocean chose me.

1044
01:08:34,951 --> 01:08:35,952
You're right.

1045
01:08:37,136 --> 01:08:40,709
But my island is dying.

1046
01:08:41,837 --> 01:08:44,133
So I am here.

1047
01:08:45,805 --> 01:08:47,582
It's just me and you.

1048
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,816
And I want to help.

1049
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:55,081
But I can't  if you don't let me.

1050
01:09:00,721 --> 01:09:03,028
I wasn't born a demigod.

1051
01:09:03,829 --> 01:09:05,161
I had human parents.

1052
01:09:06,646 --> 01:09:07,850
They...

1053
01:09:08,517 --> 01:09:09,612
They took one look and...

1054
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,996
and decided they
did not want me.

1055
01:09:15,408 --> 01:09:16,916
They threw me into the sea.

1056
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:20,430
Like I was nothing.

1057
01:09:22,642 --> 01:09:25,340
Somehow I was found by the Gods.

1058
01:09:26,111 --> 01:09:27,262
They gave me the hook.

1059
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:31,122
They made me... Maui.

1060
01:09:32,828 --> 01:09:35,119
And back to the humans I went.

1061
01:09:36,018 --> 01:09:39,265
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts!

1062
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:42,184
Anything they could ever want.

1063
01:09:43,883 --> 01:09:45,272
You took the heart for them.

1064
01:09:46,967 --> 01:09:49,247
You did everything for them.

1065
01:09:50,528 --> 01:09:51,735
So they'd loved you.

1066
01:09:52,852 --> 01:09:55,527
It was never enough.

1067
01:10:04,262 --> 01:10:07,017
Maybe the Gods found
you for a reason.

1068
01:10:07,652 --> 01:10:10,277
Maybe the ocean brought you to them.

1069
01:10:11,076 --> 01:10:14,296
Because it saw someone who is
worthy of being saved.

1070
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:19,196
But the Gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1071
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:21,961
You are.

1072
01:10:31,409 --> 01:10:32,957
Okay, okay.

1073
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:36,810
I... I love you too, buddy.

1074
01:11:42,846 --> 01:11:43,853
Yeah!

1075
01:12:07,807 --> 01:12:09,780
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1076
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:00,667
- What?
- I figured it out

1077
01:13:01,153 --> 01:13:05,042
You know the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands.

1078
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:08,242
'Cause your ancestors would sail our seas.
Find them!

1079
01:13:09,461 --> 01:13:11,801
All those new lands, new villages...

1080
01:13:12,816 --> 01:13:14,596
It was the water that connected them all.

1081
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:17,052
And if I were the ocean

1082
01:13:17,573 --> 01:13:19,297
I think I'd be looking for a...

1083
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:21,480
curly haired, non-princess,

1084
01:13:22,377 --> 01:13:23,807
to start that again.

1085
01:13:24,395 --> 01:13:26,788
That is literaly the nicest thing

1086
01:13:26,799 --> 01:13:28,630
you've ever said to me.

1087
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,410
Probably should've saved it for Te Fiti.

1088
01:13:33,466 --> 01:13:34,966
I did.

1089
01:13:37,437 --> 01:13:39,138
Moana of Motunui.

1090
01:13:39,569 --> 01:13:40,702
I believe,

1091
01:13:40,764 --> 01:13:42,896
you have officially delivered Maui

1092
01:13:43,009 --> 01:13:44,921
across the great sea.

1093
01:13:46,591 --> 01:13:49,407
Moana!  Moana!  Moana!

1094
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:51,466
You're so amazing!

1095
01:13:53,051 --> 01:13:54,051
It's time.

1096
01:14:12,377 --> 01:14:13,629
Go, save the world.

1097
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,340
Maui!

1098
01:15:13,379 --> 01:15:14,382
What... What are you doing?

1099
01:15:14,393 --> 01:15:15,884
Finding you a better way in!

1100
01:15:18,044 --> 01:15:19,948
- We won't make it!
- Yes, we will!

1101
01:15:19,988 --> 01:15:21,026
- Turn around!
- No!

1102
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:22,590
- Moana, stop!
- No!

1103
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:52,709
Are you okay?

1104
01:15:54,836 --> 01:15:55,836
Maui?

1105
01:16:03,594 --> 01:16:04,872
I told you to turn back.

1106
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:09,265
I thought we could make it.

1107
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:10,930
We?

1108
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:14,320
I thought I could make it.

1109
01:16:16,508 --> 01:16:17,508
We can fix it!

1110
01:16:17,609 --> 01:16:19,281
It was made by the Gods.

1111
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,435
You can't fix it!

1112
01:16:22,285 --> 01:16:23,699
Next time we'll be more careful.

1113
01:16:24,498 --> 01:16:26,301
Te Ka was stuck on the barrier islands.

1114
01:16:26,709 --> 01:16:27,709
It's lava!

1115
01:16:27,718 --> 01:16:28,861
It can't go in the water.

1116
01:16:29,287 --> 01:16:30,287
We can find a way around.

1117
01:16:31,357 --> 01:16:32,357
I'm not going back.

1118
01:16:33,744 --> 01:16:36,412
What... We still have to restore the heart.

1119
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:37,522
My hook is cracked.

1120
01:16:37,772 --> 01:16:39,603
One more hit and it's over.

1121
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,872
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1122
01:16:41,901 --> 01:16:43,953
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1123
01:16:43,975 --> 01:16:45,145
That's not true.

1124
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:47,426
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1125
01:16:57,371 --> 01:17:01,025
We're only here because you
stole the heart in the first place.

1126
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,290
No, we're here because
the ocean told you

1127
01:17:05,312 --> 01:17:07,037
You're special and
you believed it,

1128
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:11,488
I am Moana of Motunui.

1129
01:17:11,771 --> 01:17:13,827
- You will board my boat.
- Goodbye, Moana.

1130
01:17:13,884 --> 01:17:16,438
- Sail across the sea,
- I'm not killing myself

1131
01:17:16,447 --> 01:17:18,047
so you can prove you're
something you're not!

1132
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:19,781
and restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1133
01:17:20,012 --> 01:17:21,673
The Ocean chose me!

1134
01:17:23,332 --> 01:17:24,332
They chose wrong.

1135
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:35,816
Maui!

1136
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:52,226
Why did you bring me here?

1137
01:17:58,095 --> 01:17:59,892
I'm not the right person.

1138
01:18:02,576 --> 01:18:04,991
You have to choose someone else.

1139
01:18:08,133 --> 01:18:10,050
Choose someone else!

1140
01:18:11,493 --> 01:18:12,508
Please!

1141
01:18:48,941 --> 01:18:51,423
You're a long ways past the reef.

1142
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,415
Grandma?

1143
01:18:55,715 --> 01:18:58,207
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1144
01:18:59,306 --> 01:19:00,306
Grandma!

1145
01:19:05,542 --> 01:19:07,049
I tried, grandma.

1146
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:08,850
I...

1147
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,750
I couldn't do it.

1148
01:19:12,112 --> 01:19:13,580
It's not your fault.

1149
01:19:14,826 --> 01:19:17,915
I never should've put so much
on your shoulders.

1150
01:19:19,213 --> 01:19:21,354
If you are ready to go home,

1151
01:19:22,816 --> 01:19:24,219
I will be with you.

1152
01:19:41,465 --> 01:19:42,803
Why do you hesitate?

1153
01:19:44,374 --> 01:19:45,374
I don't know.

1154
01:19:49,671 --> 01:19:51,961
I know a girl from an island.

1155
01:19:52,999 --> 01:19:55,483
She stands apart from the crowd.

1156
01:19:56,192 --> 01:19:58,701
She loves the sea and her people.

1157
01:19:59,387 --> 01:20:01,936
She makes her whole family proud.

1158
01:20:02,911 --> 01:20:05,892
Sometimes the world seems against you.

1159
01:20:06,379 --> 01:20:08,998
The journey may leave a scar.

1160
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:11,489
But scars can
heal and reveal

1161
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:14,356
just where you are.

1162
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,509
The people you love will change you.

1163
01:20:19,195 --> 01:20:21,742
The things you have learned will guide you.

1164
01:20:22,269 --> 01:20:25,099
And nothing on earth
can silence

1165
01:20:25,711 --> 01:20:28,642
the quiet voice still inside you.

1166
01:20:29,084 --> 01:20:32,012
And when that voice starts to whisper

1167
01:20:32,638 --> 01:20:35,022
Moana you've come so far.

1168
01:20:36,076 --> 01:20:37,512
Moana listen.

1169
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:42,944
Do you know who you are?

1170
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:45,900
Who am I?

1171
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:51,630
I am a girl who loves my island.

1172
01:20:51,953 --> 01:20:54,824
I'm the girl who loves the sea.

1173
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:58,798
It calls me...

1174
01:21:01,376 --> 01:21:03,984
I am the daughter of the village chief.

1175
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:07,850
We are descended from voyagers,

1176
01:21:07,945 --> 01:21:10,576
who found their way across the world.

1177
01:21:10,774 --> 01:21:13,376
They call me...

1178
01:21:14,515 --> 01:21:17,001
I've delivered us to where we are.

1179
01:21:17,713 --> 01:21:20,103
I have journeyed farther.

1180
01:21:20,885 --> 01:21:26,639
I am everything I've learned and more.
Still it calls me.

1181
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:29,736
And the call isn't out there at all,

1182
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:32,758
it's inside me.

1183
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:39,641
It's like the tide always
falling and rising.

1184
01:21:40,078 --> 01:21:42,447
I will carry you here in my heart.

1185
01:21:42,533 --> 01:21:45,582
You remind me.

1186
01:21:45,938 --> 01:21:48,799
That come what may.

1187
01:21:48,942 --> 01:21:51,964
I know the way!

1188
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:56,533
I AM MOANA!

1189
01:22:32,383 --> 01:22:34,588
I am Moana of Motunui.

1190
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:39,379
Aboard my boat, I will
sail across the sea,

1191
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:42,539
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

1192
01:23:19,178 --> 01:23:21,088
Te Ka can't follow us into the water.

1193
01:23:21,876 --> 01:23:23,876
We make it pass the barrier islands.

1194
01:23:24,276 --> 01:23:26,076
We make it to Te Fiti.

1195
01:23:26,161 --> 01:23:27,961
None of which you understand.

1196
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,560
Because you are a chicken.

1197
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:36,937
No!

1198
01:24:38,035 --> 01:24:38,835
Hei-hei!

1199
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:40,426
No, no, no, no, no!

1200
01:24:42,047 --> 01:24:42,906
Nice work!

1201
01:24:52,976 --> 01:24:53,815
Te Fiti!

1202
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:20,008
Maui!

1203
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:25,776
You came back.

1204
01:25:29,737 --> 01:25:30,737
But your hook.

1205
01:25:31,234 --> 01:25:32,773
One more hit, and ...

1206
01:25:33,544 --> 01:25:35,131
Te Ka's gotta catch me first.

1207
01:25:38,115 --> 01:25:39,589
I got your back, chosen one.

1208
01:25:40,717 --> 01:25:41,726
Go, save the world.

1209
01:25:42,134 --> 01:25:42,644
Maui.

1210
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:44,415
Thank you.

1211
01:25:45,589 --> 01:25:46,439
You're welcome.

1212
01:26:20,559 --> 01:26:21,427
Hey... Te Ka!

1213
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:23,874
Shark head.

1214
01:26:36,663 --> 01:26:37,592
Moana!

1215
01:26:47,688 --> 01:26:49,496
Get the heart to the spiral!

1216
01:27:28,086 --> 01:27:28,789
Te Fiti.

1217
01:27:30,282 --> 01:27:31,189
It's gone.

1218
01:27:44,432 --> 01:27:46,275
TE KA!!

1219
01:28:21,995 --> 01:28:23,168
Let her come to me.

1220
01:28:46,525 --> 01:28:50,670
I have crossed the horizon
to find you.

1221
01:28:57,083 --> 01:28:59,708
I know your name.

1222
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:08,230
They have stolen the heart from inside you.

1223
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:14,957
But this does not define you.

1224
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:22,305
This is not who you are.

1225
01:29:24,335 --> 01:29:29,912
You know who you are...

1226
01:29:36,378 --> 01:29:38,468
Who you truly are.

1227
01:30:02,299 --> 01:30:03,389
Te Fiti.

1228
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:35,627
The chicken lives.

1229
01:30:37,884 --> 01:30:39,591
I'm sorry about your hook.

1230
01:30:40,243 --> 01:30:44,948
Well, hook, no hook,
I'm Maui.

1231
01:31:04,305 --> 01:31:05,850
Te Fiti!

1232
01:31:08,534 --> 01:31:09,534
How you been?

1233
01:31:12,355 --> 01:31:15,365
Look, what I did was wrong.

1234
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:17,896
I have no excuse.

1235
01:31:19,194 --> 01:31:20,194
I'm sorry.

1236
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:32,084
You know, it'd be rude
to refuse a gift from a Goddess.

1237
01:31:37,785 --> 01:31:38,585
Thank you.

1238
01:31:38,665 --> 01:31:41,179
Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated.

1239
01:32:31,247 --> 01:32:32,347
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1240
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:34,052
You could come with us, you know.

1241
01:32:34,641 --> 01:32:38,063
My people are going to need a
master wayfinder.

1242
01:32:39,911 --> 01:32:41,031
They already have one.

1243
01:33:00,036 --> 01:33:01,341
See you out there, Maui.

1244
01:33:02,084 --> 01:33:04,164
See you out there, Moana...

1245
01:33:57,756 --> 01:33:58,930
Mom! Dad!

1246
01:33:59,202 --> 01:34:00,256
Moana!

1247
01:34:08,626 --> 01:34:12,889
I may have gone a little ways past
the reef.

1248
01:34:14,521 --> 01:34:15,706
It suits you.

1249
01:34:16,262 --> 01:34:17,995
- She's back!
- Moana!

1250
01:34:18,598 --> 01:34:19,598
Pua!

1251
01:34:22,253 --> 01:34:23,253
Moana!

1252
01:35:13,607 --> 01:35:15,926
Aue, Aue

1253
01:35:15,977 --> 01:35:18,035
We set a course to find...

1254
01:35:18,349 --> 01:35:22,924
A brand new island everywhere we roam.

1255
01:35:23,112 --> 01:35:24,960
Aue, Aue

1256
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,537
We keep our island in our mind.

1257
01:35:27,873 --> 01:35:32,703
And when it's time to find home,
We know the way

1258
01:35:32,731 --> 01:35:37,265
Aue, Aue
We are explorers reading every sign.

1259
01:35:37,307 --> 01:35:42,198
We tell the stories of our elders
in a never ending chain.

1260
01:35:42,266 --> 01:35:44,166
Aue, Aue

1261
01:35:44,210 --> 01:35:49,096
Te Fenua, te Malie.
Nae ko hakilia.

1262
01:35:49,351 --> 01:35:54,656
We know the way....

1263
01:45:48,756 --> 01:45:52,550
Shiny, I'm so shiny.

1264
01:45:53,382 --> 01:45:57,202
Didn't help me though did it?
Still upside down here.

1265
01:45:57,627 --> 01:45:59,351
Just need a little push.

1266
01:46:01,812 --> 01:46:04,633
Can we be real?
If my name was Sebastian,

1267
01:46:04,741 --> 01:46:08,011
and I had a cool Jamaican accent,
you'd totally help me.

1268
01:46:08,049 --> 01:46:09,682
You would.
You know you would.
