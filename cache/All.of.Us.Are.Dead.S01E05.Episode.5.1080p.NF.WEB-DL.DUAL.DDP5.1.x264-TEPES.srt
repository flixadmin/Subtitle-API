1
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,952
Stay back, stay back.

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,662
Stay away!

3
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,372
No way we're going to heaven now.

4
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,125
We're alive, so this is heaven.

7
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,083
I heard that in some countries,

8
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,627
they mourn adults
more than they do with children.

9
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,672
And in others,
children more than adults.

10
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,926
Which do you think our country is?

11
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,764
What do you mean?

12
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,644
When kids die, you lose hope but...

13
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,730
when adults die, you lose their wisdom.

14
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,958
Hope and wisdom.

15
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,275
Which do we value more?

16
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,738
Hmm?

17
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,888
They've been flying
all over the place since yesterday.

18
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,111
They would have already saved us
if they really wanted to.

19
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,255
But even if they do come to save us,
we won't get out first.

20
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,551
We're just not important enough for that.

21
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,349
We're students. That's it.

22
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,775
<i>We're coming in.</i>

23
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,278
<i>Set to control, steady.
Prepare for landing.</i>

24
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,738
<i>Okay, roger.</i>

25
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,618
<i>Landing pad is clear.
We're touching down.</i>

<i>We have everyone on board.
Heading to the quarantine camp now.</i>

28
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,483
<i>Around 11:00 a.m.
this morning,</i>

29
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,028
<i>the government announced
the declaration of martial law</i>

30
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,280
<i>in an effort to control
the crisis in Hyosan.</i>

31
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,492
<i>Starting sometime yesterday afternoon,
a strange epidemic began to spread,</i>

32
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,636
which lead to an evacuation order

33
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,388
- and a city-wide lockdown.
- <i>And a city-wide lockdown.</i>

34
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:28,625
It's the first time in 41 years
that martial law has been declared.

35
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,936
<i>Last time was
the Democratization Movement</i>

36
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,795
<i>on May 18th, 1980.</i>

37
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,549
<i>I repeat. Martial law has been declared
in order to control the Hyosan...</i>

38
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,260
<i>The sense of panic
caused by the Hyosan epidemic</i>

39
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,554
<i>has sent markets into a death spiral.</i>

40
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,682
<i>Sidecar investments were activated
for both KOSPI and KOSDAQ</i>

41
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,744
<i>which came as volatile
market respondent to Covid-19...</i>

42
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,604
No refugees from Hyosan!
We don't want them!

43
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,649
We don't want them!
We don't want them!

44
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,736
No refugees. Go back!
Go back where you came from.

45
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,406
<i>We are the Lord's people
who receives salvation.</i>

46
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,325
People will die as people,

47
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,286
and demons are going to perish
as all demons must.

48
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,621
Amen.

49
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,456
Get away!

50
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,874
Look out!

51
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,629
You're killing us.

52
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,547
Go home!

53
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,092
Come on, Zuki. It's okay, okay. Thank you.

54
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,636
- Why won't you let us in?
- Get the hell of me.

55
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,307
Send them back. Go home!

56
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,060
Please. You have to help us!

57
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,398
REMOVE THE GOVERNMENT!

58
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,484
<i>Our Lord Jesus Christ</i>

59
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,196
will not ask whether you are his son
or the son of the Devil.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,322
<i>No. He won't.</i>

61
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,158
EVERYONE WILL DIE!

62
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,996
<i>A person
who does not act righteously.</i>

63
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,165
<i>A person who does not love
their brothers and sisters...</i>

64
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,084
REMOVE THE GOVERNMENT!

65
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,086
...that is not one of God's people.

66
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,170
Amen!

67
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,755
Amen!

68
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,177
We're so gonna break a million views.

69
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,561
<i>A false rumor recently surfaced</i>

70
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,188
<i>claiming that Hyosan epidemic
has spread to Seoul,</i>

71
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,151
<i>as a result, the number of people

SUBWAY ZOMBIE PERFORMANCE
APOLOGY VIDEO

79
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,594
We have to expand
martial law to control the media.

80
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:49,390
There are rumors that radiation
from US nuclear bombs created the zombies.

81
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,519
That the heads of Korea's
top 30 corporations fled the country.

82
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,438
Most of the media are spreading fake news

83
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,232
and sharing it online
without verifying sources.

84
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,026
It's contributing to all the chaos.

85
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,236
The government
should not control the media.

86
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,073
The people themselves
should control the media.

87
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,909
And our citizens
have enough power to do that.

88
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,911
No expansion in martial law.

89
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,216
Let's focus on containment

90
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,248
and rescuing the uninfected.

91
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,375
Those are our priorities.

92
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,104
- Su-hyeok.
- Hey, Bare-su.

93
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,005
Are you okay?

94
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,006
Where's the phone?

95
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,132
And Cheong-san?

96
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,352
Su-hyeok.

97
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,397
Where is he?

98
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,071
We got separated in the teacher's office.

99
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,949
I'm sure he'll be fine.

100
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,202
Are you serious? Oh, shit!

101
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,038
I'm sorry...

102
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,791
for coming back alone.

103
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,597
Come here.

104
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,516
Come here.

105
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,614
Were you bit? You were bit, right?

106
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,949
No, I...

107
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,719
Cut it out.

108
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,596
Give me the fucking phone.

109
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,399
You killed the principal.
You're a murderer.

110
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,088
You made me kill him. You shit.

111
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,603
- You wanted proof I wasn't a coward.
- You're insane.

112
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,131
Get off me.

113
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,352
Should I save you?

114
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,784
What do you say?

115
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,692
Beg for your life. Come on.

116
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,151
Screw you.

117
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,322
Damn it.

118
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,740
Shit! Help me!

119
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,409
Cheong-san!

120
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,577
Cheong-san!

121
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,745
Fuck!

122
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,456
Oh, please!

123
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,724
I'll kill you.

124
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,184
I will kill you.

125
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,145
Fuck you.

126
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,228
I'll...

127
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,315
I'll kill you.

128
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,204
Whoa!

129
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,971
Shit.

130
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,557
None of them are normal. All infected.

131
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,768
Hey! He's coming!

132
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,728
Oh, Shit. Shoot, shoot!

133
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,729
Oh, shit.

134
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,818
We're gonna die
before we ever find your brother.

135
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,575
Let's go, okay?

136
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,670
Oh, shit.

137
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,673
Oh, seriously...

138
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,741
Shit.

139
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,539
I told you we should just
stay put, didn't I?

140
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,685
How are we gonna find your brother
in the middle of all this?

141
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,395
And it was just as crazy
to have come with her.

142
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,503
- I told you...
- Hey. Hey!

143
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,897
- What?
- There's a computer.

144
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,214
Oh, yeah. Turn it on.

00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,546
in the interest of operational efficiency,

165
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,233
<i>all cell phone services...</i>

166
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,968
<i>...landlines, internet services,</i>

167
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,237
- <i>and all communication originating...</i>
- Why it isn't working?

168
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,806
- <i>...in Hyosan will be terminated...</i>
- Huh?

169
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,099
What's wrong?

170
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,393
...from this point on.

171
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,444
That's so weird.
The internet cable's plugged in.

172
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,130
- I'm trying to refresh it.
- Hey, get the phone over there.

173
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,154
Okay.

174
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,622
Shit. Fucking assholes.

175
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,750
They cut off the phones and internet.

176
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,419
We at Martial Law Command,

177
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,879
and its advisory council,
are doing our best

178
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,506
to suppress the continuous spread.

179
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:52,302
<i>Moreover,
we are focusing all of our resources</i>

180
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,389
<i>to rescue the people
who are currently trapped.</i>

181
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,977
<i>If you live in Hyosan,
and you're watching this now,</i>

182
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,898
<i>please try to stay hopeful and wait
in your location to be rescued.</i>

183
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,275
NO SIGNAL

184
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,277
OCTOBER 21, THURSDAY

185
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,209
WATER FLOW DETECTOR

186
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,843
What do we do?
On-jo and Cheong-san are really close.

187
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,137
They're going out.

188
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,098
But On-jo told me they're not.

189
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,475
I'm telling you they are.

190
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,727
They're always together.

191
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,147
Really?

192
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,358
NAM ON-JO

193
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,734
Poor On-jo.

194
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,085
I'm sure Cheong-san is fine.

195
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,338
You know how fast he is.

196
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,092
I don't know why he never listens.

197
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,679
Ever since we were kids,
he's just never listened to me.

198
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,685
I told him not to go,
but, of course, he did.

199
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,979
I'm sorry.

200
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,607
I should've brought him back here.

201
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,948
Where do you think...

202
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,202
he is now?

203
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,915
I'm pretty sure
he's in a safe hiding spot.

204
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:42,639
Joon-yeong. Didn't you mention
that your science club made a drone?

205
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,143
Yeah. You want to look
for Cheong-san with it?

206
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,605
- Could we?
- Well, yeah. But it's in the science lab.

207
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,898
We can go get it.

208
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,401
How would we get it?
It's crawling with zombies out there.

209
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,404
That.

210
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,910
You want me
to climb up on that?

211
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,204
But there are zombies
in the science lab too.

212
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,749
There weren't any
in the supply room. Right?

213
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,042
That's true, but...

214
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,130
We have to find Cheong-san.

215
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,759
There's no one else besides us
to start looking

216
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,302
and rescue people.

217
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,559
Yeah.

218
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,478
It would be good if we had the drone.

219
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,689
We can find Cheong-san and then
we can see how things are outside.

220
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,735
We might even be able to send
an emergency message and ask for help.

221
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,780
Sure, that would be really great.

222
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,575
But who's gonna go?

223
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,785
I wanna go.

224
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,330
I took a fire rescue class,
and I've climbed ropes before.

225
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,707
No, I'll go.

226
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,336
You already went out there.

227
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,089
You can't keep
putting yourself in danger.

228
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,383
The drone isn't finished yet,

229
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,218
we need to find
a few more parts to run it.

230
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,553
Do you know what to get?

231
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,060
Then I have to go anyway, I guess.

232
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,980
I'll go with On-jo.

233
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,106
No way.

234
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,987
I'm actually going this time
so stand back.

235
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,113
But you can't.

236
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,365
He can't.

237
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,075
The rope won't hold you.

238
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:29,288
It was fine when I came down.
But it'll snap if I climb up, right?

239
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,832
- Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. It'll snap.

240
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,292
Right. Good boy.

241
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,752
Joon-yeong, come with me.

242
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,296
Mm.

243
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:41,967
It's too dangerous.

244
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:43,968
I'll go.

245
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,562
Thank you.

246
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,356
But I don't want you...

247
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,943
to be put in danger anymore.

248
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,612
I'm going.

249
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,581
I'm going.

250
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,477
Be careful, On-jo.

251
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,315
Be safe. We'll be watching, okay?

252
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,789
Do you think...

253
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,215
it's really safe out there?

254
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,424
I'm sure it is.

255
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,888
Like you said,
there are soldiers and cops, right?

256
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,312
I wanna go to my dad's factory
and my mom's <i>sundae </i>place.

257
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,273
Whatever.

258
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,567
You hate the smell
of leather and <i>sundae</i> anyway.

259
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,362
Yeah, I do.

260
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,781
I just want my mom's <i>sundae </i>soup.

261
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,996
So you finally grew up?
You should have said that earlier.

262
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,417
Now, it's too late.

263
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,093
Hey. Hey, look.

264
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,804
I bet there's a key in there, right?

265
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,516
I don't think so.

266
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,021
Shouldn't we just hide somewhere safe
and wait to be rescued?

267
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,189
Hey.

268
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,316
He said the solution
is on his laptop at the school.

269
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,652
We have to hurry and notify
Fire and Disasters HQ.

270
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,656
The people who have important information
need to survive, am I right?

271
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,700
So doesn't our survival come first?

272
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,678
Why do you keep acting
better than everyone

273
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,288
like some elite leader of society?
You're from Seoul University?

274
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,458
- Yeah.
- Huh? Wait?

275
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,270
You really went there? Serious?

276
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,088
Well, I haven't graduated yet.
I'm going back.

277
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,381
Oh, grad school?

278
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,550
- No. I'm a sophomore.
- What?

279
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,053
Your exams? You retake?

280
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,471
Uh, few times. Yeah.

281
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,682
I went after high school.

282
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,604
Oh, wow. I guess you must really
had your nose to the crime stuff, huh?

283
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,480
Your face says it all.

284
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,235
Hey. Apparently, you're smart,
so I'm gonna say this once.

285
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,237
Be quiet and follow me.

286
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,281
Wait.

287
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:53,742
Shit!

288
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,370
Whoa!

289
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,043
Shut the door. Shut the door!

290
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,757
Why won't it start?

291
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,302
Hurry up!

292
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,553
Please spare me!

293
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,199
Come on. This way.

294
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,224
Wait.

295
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,268
Let's go! Here.

296
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,353
Hurry!

297
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:25,148
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEW BUSINESS

298
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,276
Oh, my God.

299
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,070
It's a zombie, sir.

300
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,822
There's a zombie in here.

301
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,790
- In there?
- Yeah.

302
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,250
Shit!

303
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:55,136
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

304
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,430
It's all right. Come on.

305
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,849
Sure?

306
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,144
She's tied up. it's okay.

307
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,483
A student should be in school.
Why is she in a chicken place?

308
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:09,943
And why she tied...

309
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,027
Oh, my gosh!

310
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,863
What? What? What?

311
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,115
Right there. There.

312
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,202
What? What is that?

313
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,916
Oh, shit.

314
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,172
Is... is it okay?

315
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,383
Is, is the baby a zombie?

316
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,471
No. It's alive.

317
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,179
Why don't you go check the fridge
for some milk or something?

318
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,747
Why? Are you thirsty?

319
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,666
It's for the baby.

320
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,962
We need to feed this baby somehow.
It's very dehydrated.

321
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,965
What if there's no milk?

322
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,551
Can you just check first?

323
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,678
Check the fridge,
and if there's no milk, come back,

324
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,097
and we cross that bridge
when we come to it, okay?

325
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,891
Uh, yeah. You're right. Yeah.

326
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,270
- If there's no milk, maybe I should bring?
- Just check first. Can you do that?

327
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,106
Check. Damn it.

328
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,947
What do we do now?

329
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:44,371
What else can we do? Back to HQ.

330
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,290
What about that?

331
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,460
It's hard enough with just us.

332
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,003
Are you gonna bring it along?

333
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:09,896
Oh, careful.

334
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,399
The drone and the bag are right there.

335
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,697
Okay. Where was it?

336
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,450
Where is the battery?

337
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,011
I can't stop thinking
about this one thing.

338
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,930
What?

339
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:52,313
If eventually everyone in the world
but us ends up turning in too?

340
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,190
No way.

341
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,652
But if that were true?

342
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,280
Nah.

343
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,366
Then we'd be the minority.

344
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,579
And all minorities
have a way of going extinct.

345
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,792
We're not the minority.

346
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,129
But what if that actually happens?

347
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,466
You think you could make it through this?

348
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,054
I don't know.

349
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,017
But I don't wanna be a zombie.

350
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,436
You don't recognize anyone.

351
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,228
And...

352
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,317
I won't even recognize you.

353
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,162
In case I do get bitten,
I have a favor to ask.

354
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,872
No.

355
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:53,874
Don't get bit.

356
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,420
- If by chance...
- No.

357
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,714
Don't get bit. You can't.

358
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,899
Don't even think about dying.

359
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,305
THIS DOOR DOES NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE

360
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,890
Shit.

361
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,785
- Eat up, I-sak.
- Thanks.

362
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,830
On-jo. Which do you like better?

363
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:17,292
- Mm, they're both good.
- Is that right?

364
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,219
Is it better like this?

365
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,430
Or like this?

366
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,857
Why?

367
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,593
Fuck this.

368
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,364
MUSIC ROOM

369
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:36,913
INSTRUMENT STORAGE

370
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,162
Hey, be careful.

371
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,964
Take your time. Take your time.

372
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,050
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

373
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:03,314
HELP, WE'RE IN THE BROADCASTING ROOM
IN HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

374
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,032
Does it work?

375
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,450
Is it working?

376
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,618
I think it will.

377
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,584
Ooh.

378
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,760
Holy crap.

379
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,595
That thing's crazy fast.

380
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,348
I'll take it outside
after I find Cheong-san.

381
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,892
If I find any rescuers out there,
I'll land in front of them.

382
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,144
Okay. Okay, okay.

383
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,898
Wait a second.

384
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,401
They say when people know
their situation is hopeless,

385
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,446
that's when they despair.

386
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,659
Sweet saying.

387
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,744
But what does that mean?

388
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,711
Even if everyone in the world
but us turned into zombies,

389
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,881
we can't fall in to despair.

390
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,675
Ahh. So that's what that means?

391
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,470
Nam-ra.

392
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,598
It's best to make a plan
and try to stick to it,

393
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,185
but we're not all top students,
and we can't be as smart as you.

394
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,022
Being logical isn't part of human nature.

395
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,940
In a crisis, it's better to be logical.

396
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,609
We need hope more than logic.

397
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,029
Don't you think that's best right now?

398
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,950
Hey. I think...

399
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,953
flying the drone
is what we need right now.

400
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,458
- Okay. Try it.
- Here goes.

401
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,335
Mm.

402
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,776
Oh, no.

403
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,820
Everyone's zombie.

404
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,788
I shouldn't even bother studying.

405
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,705
Shit.

406
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,290
I can't take my CSAT anyway.

407
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,544
Shit. I'll never studying again
as long as I live.

408
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,421
Can you please be serious
for once in your life?

409
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,298
I'm dead serious right now.

410
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,302
What are you gonna do?
Keep looking for your brother?

411
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,807
The archery center has an emergency phone.

412
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,017
It automatically connects
to emergency services.

413
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,269
- Really?
- Yeah.

414
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,789
We got a hotline installed a while ago
because of some injuries.

415
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,858
And if it doesn't connect?
All the phones and internet are dead.

416
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,025
It doesn't matter.

417
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,404
That's where all the arrows are anyway.

418
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,656
I have less than 20 left.

419
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,033
We'll need more
if we wanna leave the school alive.

420
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,119
- I think, uh...
- Okay, let's go.

421
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,997
Go to the archery center
so we can get your arrows.

422
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,250
Then we should probably go home
or maybe go to a supermarket.

423
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,502
You know. In most zombie movies,

424
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,672
the ones that go to supermarkets
always manage to survive in the end.

425
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,133
And they have cigs.

426
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,342
I think that we...

427
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,546
The dumpsters
are right under these windows.

428
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,639
I think it's better to jump
than use the stairs.

429
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,226
Yeah. Let's jump.

430
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,230
Falling from the third floor is way better
than falling your exams, right?

431
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,940
Hey, let me get a word in!

432
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:33,941
Hey, Min-jae.

433
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,235
Go down first and shoot any
that come running.

434
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,653
Okay.

435
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,977
Then you two go down
and help him out as much as you can.

436
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,842
I'll cover you out in the hallway
and bring up the rear.

437
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,866
Mm.

438
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,161
What do you wanna say?

439
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,121
Uh, I think we should just stay here.

440
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,041
The adults will rescue us.

441
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,335
If you wanna stay, be my guest.

442
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,046
But I don't trust adults.

443
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,095
Ahh, shit. She's just so my type.

444
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,348
I'm too scared to stay here alone.

445
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,265
Hurry up.

446
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,757
Look out! Behind you!

447
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,967
Move.

448
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,977
Oh, shit. Why are we so high up?

449
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,481
- Jump already.
- All right, I'm going.

450
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,653
Shit.

451
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,047
No one in the infirmary.

452
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,466
Joon-yeong, go somewhere else.

453
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,139
Wait. Hold on. Stop right there.

454
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,266
Is that an arrow?

455
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,767
- Where?
- This.

456
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,103
You're right. It is.

457
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,604
Why? What?

458
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,649
My older sister.

459
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,111
She had a competition today.

460
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,049
Where the hell did Cheong-san go?

461
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,297
It's Cheong-san!

462
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,216
- What room is that?
- Cheong-san!

463
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,342
He... He can't hear you.

464
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,344
Be quiet.

465
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,679
- Hey, Cheong-san!
- He can't hear you.

466
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,763
On-jo, it's okay.

467
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,350
Cheong-san is alive!

468
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,976
Cheong-san is alive!

469
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,650
Ah...

470
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,448
What's he doing? Where's he going?

471
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,892
Look this way! Over here!

472
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,952
Where are you going, you stupid moron?

473
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,161
He can't hear you, Dae-su!

474
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,331
Be quiet, will you?
You're so damn loud.

475
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,582
My bad. My bad.

476
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,729
Didn't you say the battery was low?

477
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,673
Yeah. I couldn't charge it,
so it's almost dead.

478
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,925
Now that we know for sure
where Cheong-san is,

479
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,760
let's go look somewhere else.

480
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,720
You wanted to check outside
and ask for help?

481
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,682
On-jo, is that okay?

482
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,352
Mm-hmm. Now that we know he's alive.

483
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,061
Okay. Here it goes.

484
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,697
<i>Whoa.</i>

485
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,574
It's totally Zombieland out there.

486
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,494
I think we should look
outside of the school grounds.

487
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,205
Let's take it outside.

488
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,665
Okay.

489
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,263
Wait a minute.

490
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,265
What is it?

491
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,642
Wait a sec.

492
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,726
Just... wait.

493
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,818
What?

494
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,240
Wha, what's wrong, Ji-min?

495
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,950
Wait a minute.

496
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,330
I-I can't...

497
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,334
What? What is it?

498
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,839
This...

499
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,761
That's my dad's car.

500
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,014
Which one?

501
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,600
The white one? The black one?

502
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,186
It's this truck.

503
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,605
It's my dad's car.

504
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,068
Don't worry.

505
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,780
I'm sure there are lots of cars like that.

506
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,408
Hang on. I'll check.

507
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,191
Ji-min.

508
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,558
11:47 AM
ABANDONED PRISON IN THE SUBURB OF HYOSAN

509
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:06,185
<i>Attention, citizens of Hyosan.</i>

510
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,603
<i>Please proceed calmly...</i>

511
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,939
- Where are we going? Where are we going?
- <i>...to the first quarantine.</i>

512
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,359
- Do you see us...
- Don't you!

513
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,276
- Hey!
- We're not animals!

514
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,212
- We've been waiting here for hours!
- <i>Please cooperate</i>

515
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,697
<i>with the tests to determine
whether or not you are infected...</i>

516
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:23,786
<i>...will be returned to you
at the later stage.</i>

517
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,121
<i>I repeat.</i>

518
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:31,877
<i>Please proceed calmly
to the first quarantine checkpoint...</i>

519
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,047
<i>and surrender your personal belongings.</i>

520
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:40,177
<i>This is for your safety,
and the safety of those around you.</i>

521
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,098
<i>We appreciate your continuous cooperation.</i>

522
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,474
EXAMINATION ROOM

523
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,562
Thank you for your service.
Where's the control room?

524
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,193
As per Martial Law,

525
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,987
you have to quarantine
until you are examined.

526
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,448
Why in the world
would she have to quarantine now?

527
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,884
She just came back from a battlefield...

528
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,827
- It's okay. That's enough.
- Unbelievable.

529
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,538
So, where is the control room?

530
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,665
You have to be examined first.

531
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,917
I'm not refusing to be examined.

532
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,919
Please follow the protocols.

533
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:17,339
Hyosan Fire Station.
Rescue Team One, Captain Nam So-ju.

534
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,692
I was responsible for them
from mobilization until rescue.

535
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:20,717
Enough!

536
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,053
Does it sound like
I'm asking your opinion?

537
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,825
- Take them to the exam room.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,607
What is this place?

539
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,492
This isn't an examination room.

540
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,179
There are lots
of people in line for exams,

541
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,121
you have to wait your turn.

542
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:52,324
Then you should've explained the situation
and asked her to wait somewhere else

543
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,584
and then escorted her.

544
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,377
What the hell is wrong with you?

545
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,397
There are plenty
of other people outside

546
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,090
who are sitting on mats
on a concrete floor.

547
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,759
We're trying to make you
as comfortable as possible

548
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,136
because you're an assemblywoman.

549
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,099
The wait time
for an examination is 12 to 72 hours.

550
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,059
Wait a minute.

551
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,979
My daughter is at her school right now.

552
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,523
It may be too late if we keep waiting.

553
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,984
Please request a rescue.

554
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,820
We're doing the best we can.

555
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
Wait here for now.

556
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,923
Oh, shit.

557
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,592
Did I die?

558
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,805
Am I dead?

559
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:51,785
Hey.

560
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,046
Aren't, aren't you gonna eat me,
you zombie bastards?

561
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,552
I gave them serotonin injections
for a week,

562
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,596
but it had no effect whatsoever.

563
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,765
The moment an antivirus enters the body,

564
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,602
the virus mutates
and stops attacking its target.

565
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:20,439
<i>The only explanation
is that the cells learn and evolve.</i>

566
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,110
If this virus...

567
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,947
manages to learn human consciousness...

568
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,794
...a new species of humankind could be born.

569
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:53,722
Cheong-san, you son of a bitch!

570
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,308
I'll kill you.

571
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,900
What the fuck?

572
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,864
That means...

573
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:58,495
ONE HEART

574
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,746
...I'm God.

575
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,673
Hey, Cheong-san!

576
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:11,998
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
