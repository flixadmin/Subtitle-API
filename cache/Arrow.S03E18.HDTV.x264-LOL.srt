1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,355
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,512 --> 00:00:04,360
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:04,362 --> 00:00:05,859
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:07,800
to save my city.

5
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:09,805
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:12,346
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:12,348 --> 00:00:15,653
To the rest of Starling City,
I am someone else.

8
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:19,079
I am something else.

9
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,586
Previously, on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:22,464
I want you to take my place.

11
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:25,042
I want you to become
the next Ra's al Ghul.

12
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:28,790
Maseo...

13
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:30,563
My master sees
something in you.

14
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:34,144
Don't let your recalcitrance
take any more lives.

15
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:36,849
Oliver...

16
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:38,525
Oliver, we have
to stop this guy

17
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:40,932
before he puts arrows
in any more criminals.

18
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:43,578
Or before he starts
putting them in innocent people.

19
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,974
Captain, I think you're letting
your personal feelings

20
00:00:44,998 --> 00:00:47,026
towards the Arrow
cloud your judgment.

21
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:49,896
Maybe I'm seeing things more clearly
than I have for the last few years.

22
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:52,267
Alright, enough, both of you!
I am tired--

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,606
This is Captain Lance.
City hall, shots fired.

24
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:05,451
Suspect on the move,
I need ESU

25
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:07,688
and an ambulance, now!

26
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,426
Are you ok?!

27
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,594
I'm fine!

28
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:18,851

30
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:25,853
We have
confirmation that Mayor Castle

31
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:27,990
was pronounced dead
at the scene.

32
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:30,463
Palmer Technologies CEO
Ray Palmer

33
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,633
was taken to Starling
General Hospital

34
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:35,002
where he is listed
in critical condition.

35
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:37,434
I tried to call Felicity earlier,
she's not answering her phone.

36
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:40,706
SCPD Captain Quentin Lance
was present for the attack,

37
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,242
and had this to say
on the incident--

38
00:01:43,244 --> 00:01:45,946
I just requested a first degree murder
warrant for the Arrow.

39
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:49,177
And reinstated the anti-vigilante
task force with

40
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:51,649
shoot to kill orders if necessary.
Excuse me.

41
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:55,122
Why would the Arrow
suddenly decide to assassinate the mayor?

42
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:57,924
I don't know. But I should
have trusted my first instinct,

43
00:01:57,926 --> 00:02:00,829
that this man is a killer
and a criminal.

44
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:03,766
If I had, Mayor Castle
might still be alive.

45
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:05,735
He could be right.

46
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:07,575
Oliver, don't even start
to think like that.

47
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,504
We have to deal
with the problem that's at hand.

48
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:12,240
The murders are being
orchestrated by one of Ra's lieutenants.

49
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:14,049
Maseo Yamashiro.

50
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,345
Ok, you sound like
you know him.

51
00:02:15,347 --> 00:02:17,513
I thought I did,
a lifetime ago.

52
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:18,585
The man's a stranger
to me now.

53
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:19,753
Oliver, the question is,

54
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:21,217
where do we find
this stranger now?

55
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,921
I know someone
who can help with that.

56
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,501
Who are those men?!

57
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:29,838
I--I don't know.

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,439
Then why are we
running away from them?

59
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:37,544
Shado?

60
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:41,385
What?

61
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:43,480
How did you know
my sister?

62
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:45,816
Your--um, your sister?

63
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:48,825
My twin. How do you know Shado?
Oliver...

64
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:50,225
It's a long story.
My--my friend and I

65
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:52,194
are in a little bit
of trouble,

66
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:54,865
and, uh, we were wondering
if you could help us get off the streets.

67
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:56,799
What's going on?

68
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,495
It's also a long story!

69
00:02:58,497 --> 00:03:00,735
Can you help us?

70
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:03,903
Ok, listen up.
The suspect is armed and dangerous.

71
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:05,639
No warning shots!

72
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:07,671
Whatever happened to innocent
until proven guilty?

73
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:10,144
He was on that rooftop,
Laurel, I saw it with my own eyes.

74
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:11,289
He's being framed.

75
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:12,448
By a "copycat."

76
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:13,782
Which wouldn't be happening if
he wasn't dressed up

77
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:15,749
like Robin Hood in
the first place.

78
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:17,445
That's not fair!
You don't understand

79
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,818
what's happening here
and I need you to trust me.

80
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,745
I used to.

81
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:26,750
Who is he?

82
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:28,150
Just tell me his
name, or I'll--

83
00:03:28,152 --> 00:03:30,686
What, Dad?
You'll charge me as an accessory?

84
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,189
I'll do what
needs to be done,

85
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:33,292
'cause this has to end.

86
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:35,491
And it has
to end tonight.

87
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:45,860
I am the biggest idiot
in the world

88
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,628
for breaking up with you.

89
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:52,632
Remember the last
time we did this?

90
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:54,995
We were going to
run away together.

91
00:03:57,827 --> 00:04:00,097
Why don't we?

92
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:02,496
Roy.

93
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:07,163
Things are just complicated with
Oliver right now.

94
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:10,001
Ra's al Ghul complicated?

95
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,302
Oh, my God.

96
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,633
In the wake
of the attacks,

97
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,469
Captain Lance has issued
an arrest warrant

98
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,002
for the vigilante
known as the Arrow,

99
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:29,101
as the largest manhunt
in the city's history is now underway.

100
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:32,162
Captain Lance confirmed that
arrest warrants have also been issued

101
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:34,999
for each of the Arrow's
accomplices.

102
00:04:36,465 --> 00:04:38,267
Ray?

103
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,966
Hey.

104
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:43,533
Hi.

105
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:44,867
How are you?

106
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,799
Well, you're here,
so I'm great.

107
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:53,795
Mr. Palmer,
how are you feeling?

108
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:56,162
You have a not so good
look on your face.

109
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:57,967
You see his face?

110
00:04:57,969 --> 00:04:59,797
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
During the surgery

111
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,362
to remove the arrow,
you developed a thrombus.

112
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:03,896
A blood clot.

113
00:05:03,898 --> 00:05:07,300
If left untreated,
it could cause an ischemic stroke.

114
00:05:07,302 --> 00:05:08,564
Well, then maybe
we should treat it.

115
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:10,099
It's not that simple.

116
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,162
Your injuries have
left you very weak.

117
00:05:12,164 --> 00:05:15,464
A craniotomy could end up
doing more harm than good.

118
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,703
And by harm,
you mean...

119
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:19,837
Brain damage, at best.

120
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,268
At worst...

121
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:27,138
So we are saying
basically that

122
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,410
if we have the surgery
now, I could die,

123
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,281
and...if I wait and the clot moves,
I could die.

124
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:35,849
What if I told you

125
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:38,115
that I invented a bunch
of teeny tiny robots

126
00:05:38,117 --> 00:05:40,324
that were capable of
entering my bloodstream,

127
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:42,927
traveling to the clot,
and shrinking it,

128
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:45,369
all without
damaging my brain

129
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:47,098
or any other organ
in my body?

130
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,571
I'd say you need a psych eval.

131
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:50,677
Ok.

132
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:53,343
But after,
we go to my lab,

133
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:55,815
get the nano-tech,
inject it in me,

134
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:58,455
and publish the results in the
"New England Journal of Medicine."

135
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:01,520
Ah, I'm sorry, but that's
simply not possible.

136
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:03,858
Uh, I invented the tech,
it's possible.

137
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,423
Starling General has a very

138
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:08,121
strict policy against
experimental procedures.

139
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,039
Wait, there is a procedure that
could save his life,

140
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,871
and you're saying
you won't perform it?

141
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,078
I'm saying I can't perform it.

142
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,213
The hospital won't permit
the use of an experimental

143
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:20,380
or untested technology.

144
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:23,483
How do you know
your invention won't kill you?

145
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:25,512
I don't.

146
00:06:25,514 --> 00:06:26,711
It's a risk.

147
00:06:26,713 --> 00:06:28,045
I'm very sorry,

148
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:31,378
but there's really
nothing I can do.

149
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:39,045
We'll figure something out.

150
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:49,594
Ray Palmer.

151
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:51,522
Even in a hospital bed,

152
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,425
you're the most
handsome man I've ever seen.

153
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:56,498
Can you give us
a minute?

154
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,265
Hi.
Ohh.

155
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,065
Mom!

156
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,399
I heard what happened,
so I caught the first flight out of Vegas!

157
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:12,601
So tell me,
what did the doctor say?

158
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:15,945
Absolutely
nothing good.

159
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:17,409
Ok, ok.

160
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:18,745
Hey.

161
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:19,914
What?

162
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,989
At least you finally
have a boyfriend.

163
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:25,927
Mom!

164
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:32,102
How did you know
I was still in Starling?

165
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:37,279
Laurel.

166
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,375
I need your help,
Nyssa.

167
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:43,247
Maseo--
is also in Starling.

168
00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:46,287
He's the one behind the murders
the Arrow is suspected of.

169
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,959
Sarab does my father's bidding
in an effort to force you

170
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:51,791
to do the same and take
his rightful place as his heir.

171
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:53,527
And do you feel betrayed
by that decision?

172
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:58,966
Not so much that I'd betray him
in turn by helping you.

173
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:01,132
People are dying,
Nyssa!

174
00:08:01,134 --> 00:08:04,131
And what makes you think
that's any concern of mine?

175
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:06,465
Sara.

176
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:11,638
What would she
want you to do?

177
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:22,018
I have Maseo's location.

178
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,018
A building called
Magnuson Plaza.

179
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,754
Yeah.

180
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,290
The company that
owns that building

181
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,955
went belly up
a few months back.

182
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,931
Apparently the League
has been using it as a safe house

183
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,163
and staging ground
for its attacks.

184
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:34,531
How'd you find this out?

185
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,530
I am daughter of the Demon.

186
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:39,434
Your primary concern
should be the League.

187
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,538
You can place Maseo
in the same cage you put me in,

188
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,336
but my father has
an army at his command.

189
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:45,167
One step at a time.
Oliver...

190
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:47,303
We're going to have
to spread out

191
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:48,942
if we're going to cover
that entire building.

192
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:51,044
Dig, I want you on over watch.
Copy that.

193
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:53,243
What about her?

194
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:55,811
Don't confuse my inclination
to provide you information

195
00:08:55,813 --> 00:08:58,146
with a willingness to take up arms
against the League.

196
00:08:58,148 --> 00:08:59,545
We appreciate
what you've done.

197
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:01,983
We'll take it from here.

198
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,619
Let's do this.

199
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,488
We scoped out every floor,
nothing.

200
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,360
Same with
the parking garage.

201
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:20,992
Diggle!

202
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,528
North side is clear.

203
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,031
You think Nyssa played us?

204
00:09:27,496 --> 00:09:29,398
Hang on,
I got movement.

205
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,500
Upper level,
southwest corner.

206
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,182
Clearly I chose well

207
00:10:13,184 --> 00:10:15,212
selecting you as my heir.

208
00:10:17,214 --> 00:10:20,548
Killing me will only win you
the mantle you reject.

209
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,852
It'll stop you.

210
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,284
I have legions who live

211
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:25,420
only to see my will done.

212
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:26,956
No, boy.

213
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,228
You have but two choices--

214
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,428
you either ascend
to the calling of Ra's al Ghul

215
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,766
or you will spend the rest
of your days in a cage.

216
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,008
You're not going
to take me prisoner.

217
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,872
No, I'm not.

218
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,910
This is
the Starling City police.

219
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,910
Put your weapons down
and your hands up.

220
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:50,446
You are all under arrest.

221
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:12,979
Hold your fire,
hold your fire!

222
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:24,984
Lock down this entire area,
three block radius.

223
00:11:26,554 --> 00:11:28,551
- Diggle!
- I got eyes on.

224
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:30,223
The blue is everywhere.

225
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:34,658
The warehouse is on the west
side of the block.

226
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,185
You get there,
you're in the clear.

227
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:37,961
Go, move. Four more
headed your way.

228
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,728
You got to move, move,
move, move, move!

229
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:53,865
Go for the door.
I'll draw their fire.

230
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:54,969
We're not
separating!

231
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:56,065
They don't want you,

232
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,199
they want me. Now go.

233
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,224
Cooper, Jones,
box 'em in on 43rd.

234
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:20,289
I got two masks in a warehouse,
West Side of 43rd.

235
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:30,335
He's headed toward
the east exit!

236
00:12:37,312 --> 00:12:39,735
This way, take him!

237
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,839
Laurel!

238
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:54,677
What are you
going to do?

239
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,277
Are you going to shoot
your own daughter?

240
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,243
No. But I'm definitely
thinking about arresting you.

241
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,209
Maybe a night in jail
will bring you to your senses.

242
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:02,943
Daddy, please.
Please don't do this.

243
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,315
Leave her alone.

244
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:14,984
Nyssa!
Don't hurt him.

245
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:17,047
Laurel...what are you doing?

246
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:18,719
We must go.

247
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,258
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,090
Sweetie...

249
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:30,269
Did Arsenal
and Canary get away?

250
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:32,903
Diggle!

251
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:35,373
Diggle!

252
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:46,611
Get back!
Freeze!

253
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:52,973
Get in!

254
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,279
If we get to the tunnel
on 8th, we're good.

255
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:05,763
Clear those squad cars.

256
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:07,351
On it.

257
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:42,289
Hey.

258
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,026
Oh! Oh, thank God,
I've been so worried.

259
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:47,056
It's ok. I'm ok.

260
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,386
Where's Roy?

261
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:53,222
He's still
out there.

262
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:54,916
It's like the whole city has
lost their minds!

263
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:56,683
It's not the whole city.

264
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:59,783
It's just one man.

265
00:14:59,785 --> 00:15:00,635
Yep?

266
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,086
Hello, Captain.

267
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:04,155
I got three men
in the hospital because of you.

268
00:15:04,157 --> 00:15:06,523
I understand that
you feel betrayed,

269
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,858
but you can't be
so angry as to think

270
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,857
that I'm just running around
taking aim at innocent people.

271
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:13,424
I don't think
anything, I know.

272
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:15,495
I know this madness
has to end.

273
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,094
Now, you don't want any
more people getting hurt,

274
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:18,829
you turn yourself in.

275
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:22,563
Yeah,
that's what I thought.

276
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:25,066
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:26,770
He's in a lot of pain.

278
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,001
I thought that
if we stopped Maseo,

279
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:32,801
we'd stop the killings,
but Nyssa was right.

280
00:15:32,803 --> 00:15:35,809
This extends way beyond him.

281
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,841
Oh, Roy!

282
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:41,312
I'm ok. I got clear
somewhere on Hudson.

283
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:44,214
I had to shoot
a few officers,

284
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:47,013
but they're just
flesh wounds.

285
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,355
I've underestimated Ra's,

286
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:55,554
and now we're all
paying the price.

287
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,322
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,392
What are you talking about?

289
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:01,822
Ra's is after us
because of Malcolm.

290
00:16:03,391 --> 00:16:06,024
What don't I know?

291
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,456
You haven't told me
your names. I'm Mei.

292
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,958
I'm Akio,
and this is--

293
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,029
Tommy.

294
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:23,028
So, Tommy,

295
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,994
who are you and your little
friend running from?

296
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:27,595
It's...complicated.

297
00:16:27,597 --> 00:16:29,331
But, Mei,
the truth is that

298
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,530
I don't know why this person has
sent men after us,

299
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,505
but she did.

300
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:39,038
Is that your father?

301
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,470
His name is Yao Fei.

302
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:42,204
And how do you know
my sister?

303
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:50,110
Oh, uh, medical school.

304
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:52,877
She never mentioned
any American friends.

305
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,876
You are American,
aren't you?

306
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:57,212
I dropped out--
of the medical school,

307
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:59,579
not of America.

308
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:03,048
So when was the last time
you saw my sister?

309
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,353
It's been a while.

310
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,527
For me, too.

311
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:19,362
Shado and my father
disappeared three years ago now.

312
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:23,390
Police think they were kidnapped,
but no ransom came.

313
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:26,225
I'm so sorry.

314
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:30,925
The police told me
they must be dead.

315
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:34,921
If they were, at least
I'd have some closure.

316
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:39,190
But each time the phone rings,
someone knocks at the door,

317
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,126
or when I meet someone
who knew them...

318
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,025
I can't imagine.

319
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,821
You must be tired.

320
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:51,162
Not tired, dirty.
I need a shower.

321
00:17:51,164 --> 00:17:54,255
My bedroom's through that door.
There are fresh towels.

322
00:17:54,257 --> 00:17:56,158
You're sure?

323
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,094
Yeah.

324
00:17:58,096 --> 00:18:00,534
I'll entertain
your friend.

325
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:05,237
Thank you.

326
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,261
Listen, I'm a cop,
not a psychologist,

327
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:24,792
but in my experiences,
killers don't discriminate

328
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:27,662
between guilty and innocent.
They kill because

329
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:30,061
they view themselves
as being above the law,

330
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:32,492
and the Arrow
is no different.

331
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:35,329
He is a criminal.
And I promise you,

332
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:37,491
we will find him
and hold him accountable.

333
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,011
Ohh.

334
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,363
You ok?

335
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:41,424
Mm-hmm.

336
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:42,925
Thanks for getting this.

337
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:45,826
I ran into
Dr. Lockhart in the cafeteria.

338
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:47,856
I thought maybe,
I don't know...

339
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,023
I could talk him into giving Ray
those nano-thingies.

340
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,495
Nano-tech.
He wouldn't even look at me.

341
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:53,694
Have you seen
this dress? Hello!

342
00:18:53,696 --> 00:18:54,861
Mom.

343
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:57,501
The man's an idiot.

344
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,099
I guess...

345
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:02,033
You're just going to
have to be the one

346
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:04,462
to inject those teeny
tiny robot things into Ray yourself.

347
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:07,395
Great plan,
except I'm not a doctor.

348
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,234
Even Ray said
that they can kill him.

349
00:19:09,236 --> 00:19:11,569
I'm not going to be the one
to risk his life, I'm not.

350
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,472
His life
is already at risk.

351
00:19:13,474 --> 00:19:15,367
What you're saying
is that you don't want to be the one

352
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:18,173
to take the chance.

353
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,700
If your father
were here...

354
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:21,205
He would be arrested.

355
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:23,772
Probably.

356
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:26,548
But right before that,
he would tell you that sometimes,

357
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,811
we got to take
a chance,

358
00:19:28,813 --> 00:19:31,946
particularly for the people
we care about.

359
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:39,185
I don't give a damn about budgets.
This is a manhunt!

360
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:41,258
Now approve the extra personnel
and the overtime,

361
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,026
and you do it now!

362
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,019
I apologize
for the coarse treatment.

363
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:17,083
I didn't think I'd get you to speak
to me of your own accord.

364
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:21,429
You're him.

365
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:24,998
Ra's al Ghul.
It's an honor to meet you.

366
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,029
Sara spoke with such love
about her father.

367
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:30,332
Don't say
my daughter's name.

368
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:34,369
If she'd never met you,
she'd still be alive now.

369
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:37,040
If Sara had not
met my daughter,

370
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:38,273
she would have
starved to death

371
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:39,977
on the shores
of Lian Yu.

372
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:42,809
She was never on Lian Yu.

373
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:45,848
You suffer
false perception.

374
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,112
One of many,
I'm afraid.

375
00:20:53,456 --> 00:20:54,988
Listen, what do you want?

376
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,925
To help the city
as your daughter did.

377
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:01,326
You hunt for the man
they call the Arrow.

378
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:02,998
Yeah.

379
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,293
What, you going
to help me find him?

380
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:08,336
You'll be able to
find him easily...

381
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:11,811
Once I tell you
his name.

382
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:15,846
And why would I believe
just any name that you'd throw at me?

383
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:18,655
Well, because with
this revelation,

384
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:22,162
everything
will become clear.

385
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:25,532
And you will realize

386
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,996
the man you've
been looking for

387
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:30,172
has been right in front of you
the entire time.

388
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:33,204
The same man who lied,

389
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:36,508
telling you he wasn't
with Sara on Lian Yu.

390
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:43,179
Oliver Queen
is the Arrow.

391
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,901
We need to talk.

392
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,463
Aren't you getting tired
of these little chats?

393
00:21:56,464 --> 00:21:57,830
Because I know am.

394
00:21:57,832 --> 00:22:00,135
Then let's cut through
all the crap.

395
00:22:00,137 --> 00:22:02,272
You don't think the Arrow's
behind these murders.

396
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:04,744
You're just pissed off because he
kept Sara's death a secret from you.

397
00:22:04,746 --> 00:22:06,744
That is not why.

398
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:09,312
That is not why!

399
00:22:09,314 --> 00:22:12,110
I mean,
maybe at first.

400
00:22:12,112 --> 00:22:14,746
Yeah. But then
I realized,

401
00:22:14,748 --> 00:22:17,813
he is the reason
Sara got killed.

402
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:19,180
Dad, that is ridiculous.

403
00:22:19,182 --> 00:22:21,040
No. You, Harper, Sara,

404
00:22:21,042 --> 00:22:23,037
the freak in Central
City, the Huntress;

405
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,572
I got a new guy
flying around the city.

406
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:27,339
All these masks?
They started with him.

407
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:30,442
And Sara died only
because she was part of it all, too.

408
00:22:30,444 --> 00:22:33,378
You have no idea
why Sara was killed.

409
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:37,786
She ended up
in the League of Assassins

410
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:40,260
'cause she was
marooned on Lian Yu.

411
00:22:40,262 --> 00:22:43,028
'Cause she got
in that boat with Queen.

412
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,996
So what?

413
00:22:44,998 --> 00:22:46,565
Now Oliver's to blame?

414
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:49,471
Oliver, the Arrow,
either way, same guy.

415
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:06,965
On some level,
I think I always knew.

416
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:10,070
When I thought he was doing
good, it didn't matter to me.

417
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,714
You know, when
that boat went down

418
00:23:14,716 --> 00:23:16,586
and we--we thought
Sara was dead,

419
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:20,022
I blamed Queen.

420
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:23,961
And it's funny
how things come full circle, right?

421
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:30,237
Well, I got
things to do.

422
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:33,943
Calling him?

423
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,785
It's too late; I've got officers
headed to his home,

424
00:23:35,787 --> 00:23:38,618
his sister's club,
everywhere.

425
00:23:41,726 --> 00:23:43,093
Oh, for what it's worth,

426
00:23:43,095 --> 00:23:45,062
I'm thinking of starting
a reality TV show,

427
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:48,336
so maybe I already
have brain damage.

428
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:52,074
Don't joke, Mr. Palmer.
The next few hours are critical.

429
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:54,884
I'm going to want to keep you
under close observation.

430
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:56,002
Oww!

431
00:23:56,026 --> 00:23:57,023
Mom?

432
00:23:57,024 --> 00:23:58,920
No, no, no,
it's nothing. Ohh!

433
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:00,656
I think my back
is spasming!

434
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:02,856
Oh! Oh. Ooh.

435
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,624
Gosh, you're so strong.

436
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:07,464
Ow! Oh, my God,
I think I--

437
00:24:07,466 --> 00:24:09,096
I think I'm going to faint.

438
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:10,663
Maybe we should
get you on a gurney.

439
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:13,334
Yeah! Yeah,
let's get me on a gurney.

440
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:14,502
Ow.

441
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:17,806
Oh! I'm sorry. Ow!

442
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,447
Is your mom
going to be ok?

443
00:24:21,449 --> 00:24:23,246
Oh...

444
00:24:23,248 --> 00:24:25,982
I think she'll make
a miraculous recovery

445
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:26,708
in about five minutes.

446
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:27,814
Ok.

447
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:29,947
Just like you.

448
00:24:29,949 --> 00:24:31,818
Is that
my nano-tech?

449
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,381
Assuming the organizational
system in your lab is accurate.

450
00:24:35,383 --> 00:24:38,114
Uh, I--are you sure
you want to do this?

451
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:39,145
Aren't you?

452
00:24:39,147 --> 00:24:42,047
Yeah. I mean,
my alternatives

453
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:43,782
are brain damage
or death.

454
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:46,916
But if the hospital finds out,
you could go to jail.

455
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:55,025
I'll take my chances.

456
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,024
Ahh.

457
00:24:57,026 --> 00:24:58,992
Ok.

458
00:24:58,994 --> 00:25:00,594
All right.

459
00:25:00,596 --> 00:25:02,696
How do we feel?

460
00:25:02,698 --> 00:25:05,694
Uh, normal?
But I wasn't expecting any side--

461
00:25:05,696 --> 00:25:08,598
Ray? Ray!

462
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,502
Ray, Ray, hey!

463
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:14,005
Hi.

464
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:16,601
Ok, well...

465
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:19,734
Maybe there are
some side effects.

466
00:25:21,143 --> 00:25:23,171
I can't
believe this is happening.

467
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:24,804
The line forms behind me.

468
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:27,342
The city-wide
manhunt for the Arrow

469
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:29,079
continues this evening
as Captain Lance

470
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:31,384
has made capturing this
dangerous vigilante

471
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:33,585
the SCPD's top priority.

472
00:25:33,587 --> 00:25:35,690
I'm sure those cops
that were chasing you are fine.

473
00:25:35,692 --> 00:25:37,689
I shot them
with arrows, Thea.

474
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:40,698
When it was happening,
there was a part of me that...

475
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,994
that felt relieved.

476
00:25:42,996 --> 00:25:44,267
Relieved?

477
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:46,101
That I'd finally
be going to jail.

478
00:25:46,103 --> 00:25:49,313
And I'd get what I deserved.

479
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,345
Roy, listen to me.

480
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:54,515
The only thing that you deserve
is to be happy.

481
00:25:54,517 --> 00:25:58,325
Now you've got to find a way
to forgive yourself.

482
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:01,864
What happened with that cop last year,
it's not your fault.

483
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:04,708
She's right.

484
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,509
Sorry that you had
to go through this, Roy.

485
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:10,047
I gave you that mask...

486
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:12,923
so you could help the police,

487
00:26:12,925 --> 00:26:14,892
not run from them.

488
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:17,358
Then what's
going to happen?

489
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,640
Oh, no.

490
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:20,970
Run!

491
00:26:20,971 --> 00:26:24,471
This is the SCPD!
Put your hands in the air.

492
00:26:24,473 --> 00:26:26,367
Freeze!

493
00:26:33,046 --> 00:26:35,809
Thank you for the shower.

494
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:38,376
You ok?

495
00:26:38,378 --> 00:26:40,847
I saw the tattoo
on your back.

496
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,111
Why have you been
lying to me?

497
00:26:42,113 --> 00:26:43,782
Mei...
I need to know

498
00:26:43,784 --> 00:26:45,266
what happened
to my family.

499
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:46,676
I don't know.

500
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,736
Another lie.
You knew my sister.

501
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,591
You and her were
more than just friends.

502
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:51,964
Just believe me when I tell you

503
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:54,252
that the less you know about me,
the safer you're going to be.

504
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:56,417
Fine, maybe you'll
be more honest with the police!

505
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:59,047
I understand you're upset;
Please don't call the police.

506
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,350
I already did.
They'll be here any minute.

507
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:03,621
Akio, we have to go.

508
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:05,115
What's wrong?

509
00:27:06,484 --> 00:27:08,184
Get down!

510
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:13,116
Why are the police shooting?!

511
00:27:13,118 --> 00:27:15,283
Because they're not
the police!

512
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:16,786
I did it.

513
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:19,152
Ah! I am so proud of you.

514
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:22,317
I am so proud--your father
would be proud of you.

515
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,123
You know, he's not exactly
a role model, but...

516
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,323
Oh, Miss Smoak,
just the person I wanted to see.

517
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:29,489
Do you know
what these are?

518
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:31,759
They're Mr. Palmer's
latest MRI.

519
00:27:31,761 --> 00:27:34,427
The clot in his
brain is gone.

520
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:35,491
Really?

521
00:27:35,493 --> 00:27:37,960
Not moved,
not smaller. Gone.

522
00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:40,860
He's going to make
a full recovery.

523
00:27:40,862 --> 00:27:42,226
You wouldn't happen
to know anything

524
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:44,424
about this unprecedented
medical development,

525
00:27:44,426 --> 00:27:46,032
would you?

526
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:47,087
Huh?

527
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:49,187
Are you accusing
my daughter of something?

528
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,322
'Cause I work a table
at Caesar's that's frequented

529
00:27:50,324 --> 00:27:52,592
by no less than 3 lawyers.

530
00:27:52,594 --> 00:27:55,820
Thank you. Thank you, please.
Thank you all for coming.

531
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:58,123
We've had a breakthrough

532
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:01,091
in our investigation of the vigilante
known as the Arrow.

533
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,499
The district attorney's office
has just issued an arrest warrant

534
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:09,168
for the person responsible
for these acts of violence--

535
00:28:10,498 --> 00:28:12,000
Oliver Queen.

536
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:15,273
I had nowhere else to go.

537
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:16,937
It's ok.

538
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:20,279
Lyla took Sara
to her mother's.

539
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,679
Lance knows.

540
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,511
The whole city knows, Oliver.

541
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:26,511
Mr. Queen should be
considered armed

542
00:28:26,513 --> 00:28:29,688
and highly dangerous.
But make no mistake--

543
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,152
he will be found
and brought to justice.

544
00:28:39,114 --> 00:28:43,458
A stunning development, as Oliver Queen
has been outed as the Arrow.

545
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:46,611
The accusation comes
as a particular surprise,

546
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:49,274
considering that Queen
was exonerated of being

547
00:28:49,298 --> 00:28:50,378
the Arrow only 2 years ago.

548
00:28:50,392 --> 00:28:51,895
News lady's right.

549
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,200
You put this genie back in
the bottle before, Oliver.

550
00:28:54,202 --> 00:28:56,137
Last time I had it
all worked out.

551
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:59,838
Getting arrested
was my plan.

552
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,901
This time it's
Ra's al Ghul's.

553
00:29:11,674 --> 00:29:14,346
How's Ray?
So much better than you right now.

554
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:16,817
Please tell me you have
a brilliant plan.

555
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:18,650
I don't even have
a regular plan.

556
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:20,086
What about Dig going out
as the Arrow?

557
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:21,388
You said that worked last time.

558
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:24,321
Yeah, but this time Lance
won't rest until Oliver's in custody.

559
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:27,528
You have to leave.
You have to get out of town.

560
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:31,232
My father's posted men at every
bus station, train station, and airport.

561
00:29:31,234 --> 00:29:34,662
Also...he's frozen
Thea's assets.

562
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:37,068
He's not giving you
anything you can use to run.

563
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:42,466
I can't believe
this is happening.

564
00:29:42,468 --> 00:29:44,970
Do you think Ra's
planned this the entire time?

565
00:29:44,972 --> 00:29:47,873
He's using this city
as a weapon.

566
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,239
It's my city.

567
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:55,338
Where you going, Oliver?

568
00:29:56,874 --> 00:30:00,270
Only place I can go.

569
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:05,033
Akio, you ok?!

570
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:05,815
I'm ok.

571
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:06,293
Ok.

572
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:07,447
What's happening?!

573
00:30:07,448 --> 00:30:08,619
Is the front door
the only way in and out?

574
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:09,352
Yes.

575
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:11,751
I want you to get low,
I want you to take Akio to the bedroom.

576
00:30:11,753 --> 00:30:14,224
Mei, they're coming
to kill you, too.

577
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:16,224
Go, go, come on!

578
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,598
Akio?!

579
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,936
Akio?

580
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,746
We followed them.
They work for Amanda Waller.

581
00:31:06,651 --> 00:31:09,320
Who is she?

582
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,636
How are you
feeling?

583
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:23,741
For a guy who
just avoided death

584
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:26,138
and/or brain damage,
pretty good.

585
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,241
Good.

586
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:29,872
Are you ok?

587
00:31:29,874 --> 00:31:31,807
It's, uh,

588
00:31:31,809 --> 00:31:33,742
it's a long story.

589
00:31:33,744 --> 00:31:36,711
I'm just glad that
you're all right.

590
00:31:37,582 --> 00:31:38,447
Thanks to you.

591
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:41,949
Oh, I think your nano-tech deserves
some of the credit.

592
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:45,883
All I did was stick
something in you.

593
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:47,955
Do you think there will ever
come a time

594
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:50,386
when everything I say isn't
some weird double entendre?

595
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:53,322
I hope not. It's one
of your more charming traits.

596
00:31:53,324 --> 00:31:55,797
That, and the fact that you had
the courage to throw caution to the wind

597
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:59,634
and save my life are just two
of the many reasons that I love you.

598
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:02,464
Wow.

599
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:07,637
That's a really
nice thing to hear.

600
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:09,038
Especially after,
you know, everything

601
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,405
that's been
going on with you

602
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:12,437
with the blood clot,
nano-tech, and the...

603
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,821
nearly dying.

604
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:14,260
Yeah.

605
00:32:14,342 --> 00:32:17,548
Speaking of, you must be starving
after all that drama.

606
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,518
I'm going to go find
a hospital nurse

607
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,515
and get you some of that
hospital Jell-o.

608
00:32:30,152 --> 00:32:33,020
Oh, my God,
what just happened?

609
00:32:33,022 --> 00:32:34,155
Nothing.

610
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:37,019
Felicity...
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

611
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,523
You look the way you did when you
were seven years old

612
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,394
and stole your father's electronics
collection to make a super computer.

613
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:44,697
Oh, my God.

614
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:46,632
Did you and Ray
just do it in this hospital?

615
00:32:46,634 --> 00:32:48,400
Did you just have hospital sex?!
No! Oh!

616
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:49,600
I've always wanted to have
hospital sex!

617
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:51,400
Way TMI! Gross!

618
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:52,600
What?

619
00:32:52,602 --> 00:32:54,503
He told me he loved me.

620
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,639
Ohh.

621
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,934
And you didn't
say it back?

622
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:06,709
What is wrong
with me?

623
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:08,317
He's brilliant.

624
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,286
He knows the plot
to every "Doctor Who" episode.

625
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,550
All 34 seasons.

626
00:33:11,552 --> 00:33:13,053
He looks like
a Disney prince.

627
00:33:13,055 --> 00:33:14,716
I mean, he's...

628
00:33:14,718 --> 00:33:17,651
practically
the perfect man.

629
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:21,824
You don't love Ray...

630
00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:24,826
because you're in love
with Oliver.

631
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:27,067
You don't
even know Oliver.

632
00:33:27,069 --> 00:33:29,132
You met him for
like ten seconds.

633
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,603
I knew it in five.

634
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:33,467
Honey, you lit up
like Christmas

635
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,037
when he walked in the room.

636
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,781
But he's...
terminally unavailable.

637
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,477
And that was before.

638
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,212
You haven't been
watching the news.

639
00:33:44,214 --> 00:33:45,988
No, no, no, I don't
watch the news, it depresses me.

640
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,884
But here's what doesn't--
my daughter

641
00:33:47,886 --> 00:33:50,587
has two men
who are both amazing,

642
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:52,787
which just means...

643
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:55,362
She has to make a choice.

644
00:33:57,091 --> 00:34:00,592
I want pictures of Queen
distributed through every officer, ok?

645
00:34:00,594 --> 00:34:04,199
No, a current one,one with the scruff
he's always wearing.

646
00:34:10,906 --> 00:34:14,974
Captain Lance...

647
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:16,646
I'm here to turn myself in.

648
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:18,478
Cuff him.

649
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,807
Ok, I was able to get you
ten minutes with Oliver,

650
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,239
but let's make it five,
all right?

651
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:39,672
It would not look good
if any of these reporters

652
00:34:39,674 --> 00:34:41,744
caught wind of you
meeting with him.

653
00:34:47,054 --> 00:34:50,461
Him, and the three of you?

654
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:53,926
Makes sense.

655
00:35:06,283 --> 00:35:07,809
You shouldn't
be here.

656
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:09,577
Oliver, neither
should you.

657
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:12,720
What were you thinking?
Were you thinking?!

658
00:35:12,722 --> 00:35:14,247
I was thinking
clearly.

659
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:16,888
I asked Laurel to make a deal--
I turn myself in

660
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:19,561
and all of you
receive full immunity.

661
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:22,097
No, Oliver.
You are out of your mind

662
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:23,626
if you think we're just
going to stand here

663
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:25,563
and let you take the fall
for all of us.

664
00:35:25,565 --> 00:35:27,204
I started
all of this.

665
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:29,004
It's my fault to take,

666
00:35:29,006 --> 00:35:31,838
and this is the best
way to save lives,

667
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,911
including yours.

668
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:36,816
So stop worrying.
I've been through

669
00:35:36,818 --> 00:35:39,652
far worse than prison.
This is insane.

670
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:41,893
How could we live with ourselves
if we let you do this?

671
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:44,493
Roy, I'm just going
to need you to!

672
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:48,164
The only move that
Ra's has left me

673
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:51,667
is telling
the truth.

674
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:54,203
You have no idea

675
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:57,202
how powerful
the truth can be.

676
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:58,968
Oliver, this is
the wrong move!

677
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,806
John...

678
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:04,837
You followed me
this far.

679
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,908
All of you have followed me
this far,

680
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,843
but I need you

681
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:13,713
to follow me just
a little further.

682
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:19,548
Until it's over.

683
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:31,385
Hey.
Hey.

684
00:36:31,387 --> 00:36:32,880
The bodies are taken care of.

685
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:34,552
We should go.

686
00:36:34,554 --> 00:36:36,320
Just give us
a minute.

687
00:36:40,423 --> 00:36:42,723
I'm sorry
about this.

688
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:46,857
They tried to kill us.

689
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,961
They weren't
the cops.

690
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:51,026
They must have
intercepted the call.

691
00:36:51,028 --> 00:36:53,026
They were after you
and the boy?

692
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:55,898
You knew my sister;
Is there any chance--

693
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,939
Hey. This...

694
00:37:00,142 --> 00:37:02,971
This had nothing
to do with Shado.

695
00:37:04,076 --> 00:37:06,841
You have no idea
what it's like

696
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:09,846
to live like this.

697
00:37:09,848 --> 00:37:13,843
Looking for any kind of answer.

698
00:37:15,645 --> 00:37:18,482
You were right that
I knew your sister.

699
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,387
I loved her.

700
00:37:26,156 --> 00:37:29,761
I knew
your father, too.

701
00:37:29,763 --> 00:37:32,826
And your family...

702
00:37:32,828 --> 00:37:36,731
they saved my life
more than once.

703
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:38,667
I don't understand.

704
00:37:38,669 --> 00:37:40,708
The people that
are after me...

705
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:47,709
They'll kill anyone who knows
too much about who I am.

706
00:37:47,711 --> 00:37:49,412
But Shado and my father--

707
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:52,019
They...

708
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:55,881
They're gone.

709
00:37:57,019 --> 00:38:00,423
I'm so sorry.

710
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:07,555
Thank you for telling me.

711
00:38:07,557 --> 00:38:09,891
For three years now,

712
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:12,964
all I've wanted
is to know the truth.

713
00:38:12,966 --> 00:38:17,096
You have no idea how
powerful the truth can be.

714
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:30,430
We shouldn't stay here.

715
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:32,533
Thank you.

716
00:38:38,037 --> 00:38:39,939
This isn't fair.

717
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:42,240
This isn't right.

718
00:38:42,242 --> 00:38:44,344
All Oliver has ever done
was protect people.

719
00:38:44,346 --> 00:38:46,439
Help people.

720
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:48,246
We can't stay here.

721
00:38:48,248 --> 00:38:50,982
This place
isn't secure anymore.

722
00:38:50,984 --> 00:38:52,582
And then what?

723
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:54,414
We just bug out
and allow this to happen?

724
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,054
Enjoy our new immunity?

725
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:58,790
Roy, I don't know!
I have no idea.

726
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:01,492
If I did, you'd be
listening to it right now.

727
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:03,092
If any one of us were in there
and Oliver was here,

728
00:39:03,094 --> 00:39:05,124
he would think of something.

729
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:08,124
And it wouldn't matter
what the consequences were.

730
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,536
Lian Yu.

731
00:39:28,537 --> 00:39:30,774
What about it?

732
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:34,508
This, uh, Ra's character,

733
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,782
he told me that Sara

734
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:39,783
made it to
the island with you.

735
00:39:39,784 --> 00:39:42,517
You didn't feel like
sharing that with me? Huh?

736
00:39:42,518 --> 00:39:44,284
I mean, I'm only her father.

737
00:39:44,922 --> 00:39:46,917
Well, I was.

738
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,652
When did you decide that you knew
what was best for my family?

739
00:39:51,654 --> 00:39:53,788
I love your family.

740
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,830
You got the right
to remain silent. Take it!

741
00:39:59,502 --> 00:40:01,763
Just ask me what
you want to know.

742
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:06,699
What do I want to know?

743
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:09,306
Well, was it worth it?

744
00:40:09,308 --> 00:40:12,878
All that pain and misery
you brought back from that island?

745
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:16,622
Merlyn, Slade Wilson?

746
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:19,464
Wouldn't it be better
if you just died there?

747
00:40:19,466 --> 00:40:21,864
The reason I came back
was to try and save

748
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:23,904
the people
of this city.

749
00:40:23,906 --> 00:40:27,809
I hate to break it to you,
but saving people isn't your specialty.

750
00:40:27,811 --> 00:40:29,641
Tommy.

751
00:40:29,643 --> 00:40:31,777
Hilton.

752
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,776
Your mother.

753
00:40:33,778 --> 00:40:35,513
My daughter.

754
00:40:35,515 --> 00:40:38,153
And now you're set
on killing Laurel, too.

755
00:40:38,155 --> 00:40:41,817
I didn't want her
to be involved in this.

756
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:44,230
I didn't want anyone to be
involved in this.

757
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:46,100
But you involved me.

758
00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:48,203
You spent a year making me
look like a fool.

759
00:40:48,205 --> 00:40:50,699
You spent a year
making me your accomplice.

760
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:53,034
You have any idea
what you've done, huh?

761
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:54,369
What you've done to all of us,

762
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:56,976
to the people you claim
to care so much about?

763
00:40:56,978 --> 00:40:59,343
You've made us criminals!

764
00:40:59,345 --> 00:41:02,742
You've made us
liars and victims.

765
00:41:02,744 --> 00:41:06,980
You, Mr. Queen,
are not a hero.

766
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:09,483
You're a villain.

767
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:11,284
But you know that,
don't you?

768
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:15,989
What the hell
are your people doing?

769
00:41:15,991 --> 00:41:17,694
I told them
to stand down.

770
00:41:17,696 --> 00:41:19,261
Well, I guess your word carries
as much weight with them

771
00:41:19,263 --> 00:41:21,324
as it does with me.

772
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,429
Get down on the ground!

773
00:41:26,872 --> 00:41:28,470
Get down on the ground!

774
00:41:28,472 --> 00:41:31,638
You've got
the wrong guy.

775
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,479
Oliver Queen
isn't the Arrow.

776
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,961
I am.

777
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:05,582
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

778
00:42:22,713 --> 00:42:24,231
Greg!
Move you head.
