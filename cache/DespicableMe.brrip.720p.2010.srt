1
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,341
Excuse me, sir,
is there a commode?

2
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,976
Justin!

3
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,150
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.

4
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,446
Justin, you get
back here right now!

5
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:04,863
No, stop!.

6
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,370
No, no! Stop him!
Go back! Don't climb!

7
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,163
Wait, wait.

8
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,340
Hold on.
Easy, little boy.

9
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,961
Okay, stop, child!
Stop right there. No!

10
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,223
No, no, no! Oh!
There he goes.

11
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:35,898
Justin!

12
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,363
I've got him!
I've got him!

13
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,756
Outrage in Egypt tonight
as it was discovered

14
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,633
that the Great
Pyramid of Giza had been stolen

15
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,557
and replaced by
a giant inflatable replica.

16
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,806
there is panic throughout the globe
as countries and citizens

17
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,939
try to protect
their beloved landmarks.

18
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,017
Law enforcement
still has no leads,

19
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,524
Ieaving everyone to wonder,
which of the world's villains

20
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,105
is responsible
for this heinous crime?

21
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,236
And where will
he strike next?

22
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,580
I'm having a bad, bad day

23
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,707
It's about time
that I get my way

24
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,380
Steamrolling whatever I see

25
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,713
Freeze ray! Freeze ray!
Freeze ray!

26
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,920
I'm having a bad, bad day

27
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,052
If you take it personal,
that's okay

28
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,759
Watch, this is so fun to see

29
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,478
Despicable me

30
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,504
Morning, Gru!

31
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,916
How you doing?

32
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,047
Hello, Fred.

33
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,005
FYI, your dog
has been leaving

34
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,181
Iittle bombs
all over my yard,

35
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,599
and I don't
appreciate it.

36
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,302
Sorry.
You know dogs.

37
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,058
They go wherever
they want to go.

38
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,889
Unless they're dead.

39
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,602
I'm joking!

40
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,606
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.

41
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,151
Oh, okay.
Uh... Yeah.

42
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,163
Steamrolling whatever I see

43
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,494
Despicable me

44
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,331
I'm having a bad, bad day

45
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,083
If you take it personal,
that's okay

46
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,089
Despicable me

47
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,511
You've got to be
pulling on my leg!

48
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,932
Hello!

49
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,435
Cookies for sale.

50
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,781
Go away.
I'm not home.

51
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,616
Yes, you are.
I heard you.

52
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,496
No, you didn't. This

53
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,539
is a recording.

54
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,708
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.

55
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,505
Watch this.
Leave a message, beep.

56
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,090
Goodbye,
recorded message.

57
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,011
Agnes,
come on.

58
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,511
Huh?

59
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,774
Kyle!

60
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:46,854
Bad dog! No!
No, no. Sit. My muffin.

61
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,108
Gru!

62
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,694
Ah, Dr. Nefario.

63
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,450
I know how you
must be feeling.

64
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,995
I, too, have encountered
great disappointment,

65
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:00,500
but in my eyes,
you will always be one of the greats.

66
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,627
What? What happened?

67
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,124
It's all over the news!

68
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,251
Some fella just
stole a pyramid.

69
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,585
they're saying he makes
all other villains look

70
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,878
Iame.

71
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,307
Assemble the minions!

72
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,753
Minions, assemble!.

73
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,254
Okay. Okay.

74
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,337
Throo...

75
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,433
Hey!

76
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,517
Looking good, Kevin!
How is the family? Good?

77
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,852
All right.

78
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,939
That's my Billy boy!
What up, Larry?

79
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,987
Hello, everybody!

80
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,943
Yeah, all right!

81
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,371
Simmer down.
Simmer down!

82
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,369
Thank you, okay.

83
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,327
Now, I realize that
you guys probably heard

84
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,211
about this other villain
who stole the pyramids.

85
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,585
Apparently,
it's a big deal.

86
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,089
People are calling it
the crime of the century and stuff like that.

87
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,344
But am I upset?
No, I am not!

88
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,259
A little,

89
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:26,312
but we have had
a pretty good year ourselves,

90
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,232
and you guys are
all right in my book.

91
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,643
No, no raises!.

92
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,901
You're not going
to get any raises.

93
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,399
What did we do?

94
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:43,490
Well, we stole
the Times Square JumboTron!

95
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,206
Nice!

96
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,791
Huh?

97
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,914
That's how I roll.

98
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,002
Yeah, you all like
watching football on that, huh?

99
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,208
But that's not all.

100
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,591
We stole
the Statue of Liberty,

101
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,682
the small one
from Las Vegas.

102
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,847
And I won't even mention
the Eiffel Tower! Also Vegas.

103
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,729
Okay, I wasn't going to
tell you about this yet,

104
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,530
but I have been working
on something very big!

105
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,777
Something that will
blow this pyramid thing out of the water!

106
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:26,706
And thanks to the efforts
of my good friend Dr. Nefario...

107
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,120
Thank you!

108
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,917
Oh, there he is.

109
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,494
He's styling.

110
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,457
Now, we have located
a shrink ray

111
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:40,171
in a secret lab,
and once we take this shrink ray,

112
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,636
we will have the capability

113
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,719
to pull off the true
crime of the century.

114
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,893
We are going to steal...

115
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:57,858
Wait, wait! I haven't
told you what it is yet.

116
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,233
Hey.

117
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,444
Dave, listen up, please.

118
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,498
Next, we are going to steal,

119
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,921
pause for effect,

120
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,669
the moon!

121
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,971
And once the moon is mine,

122
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,767
the world will give me
whatever I want to get it back!

123
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:33,190
And I will be
the greatest villain of all time!

124
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,695
That's what
I'm talking about.

125
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,070
Yes?

126
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,953
Hello, Gru? I've been
crunching some numbers,

127
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,203
and I really don't see
how we can afford this.

128
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,126
It can't be done.
I'm not a miracle worker.

129
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,169
Hey, chillax.

130
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:58,919
I'll just get another loan
from the bank. They love me!

131
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,273
Edith, stop it!

132
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,477
What? I'm just walking.

133
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,374
Hi, Miss Hattie.
We're back.

134
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,746
Hello, girls!

135
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,673
Anybody come to adopt us
while we were out?

136
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,630
Mmm. Let me think.

137
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,177
No!.

138
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,510
Edith! What did you
put on my desk?

139
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,557
A mud pie.

140
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:58,233
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.
You know that, don't you?

141
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,775
Yeah, I know.

142
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,851
Good.

143
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,314
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?

144
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,444
Sort of.

145
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:10,779
We sold 43 mini-mints,
30 choco-swirlies, and 18 coco-nutties.

146
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,870
Okay.

147
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:19,121
Well, you say that like
it's a great sale day.

148
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,376
Look at my face!

149
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,709
Do you still think
it's a great sale day?

150
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,629
Eighteen coco-nutties.

151
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:32,721
I think we can do a little
better than that, don't you?

152
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,598
Yeah.

153
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:39,058
We wouldn't want to spend
the weekend in the Box of Shame, would we? No.

154
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,645
No, Miss Hattie.

155
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,446
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.

156
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,740
Hi, Penny.
Hi, Penny.

157
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,987
Hi, guys.

158
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,166
Hello, Mom. Sorry,
I meant to call, but...

159
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,787
I just wanted to
congratulate you on stealing the pyramid.

160
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,248
that was you,
wasn't it?.

161
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:07,757
Or was it a villain
who's actually successful?

162
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,006
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something

163
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,887
that's very, very big,
very important.

164
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,012
When you hear about it,
you're going to be very proud.

165
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,774
Good luck with that.
Okay, I'm out of here.

166
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,178
Gru to see Mr. Perkins.

167
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,676
Yes, please have a seat.

168
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,066
that's one
small step for man,

169
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,316
one giant leap for mankind.

170
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,198
Ma, someday I'm going
to go to the moon.

171
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,163
I'm afraid
you're too late, Son.

172
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,912
NASA isn't sending
the monkeys anymore.

173
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,713
Hey.

174
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:23,354
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.

175
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,435
It's a mathematical term,

176
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,024
a quantity represented
by an arrow, with both direction and magnitude.

177
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,030
Vector! That's me,

178
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:45,369
'cause I'm committing
crimes with both direction and magnitude.

179
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,124
Oh, yeah!

180
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,839
Check out
my new weapon.

181
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,168
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!

182
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,378
Fires live piranhas.
Ever seen one before?

183
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,054
No, you haven't.
I invented it.

184
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,302
Do you want
a demonstration?

185
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,347
Oh! Shoot!
So difficult, sometimes,

186
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,520
to get the piranha
back inside of my...

187
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,098
Mr. Gru,
Mr. Perkins will see you now.

188
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,270
So, all I need

189
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,354
is money from the bank
to build a rocket.

190
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,440
And then, the moon is ours.
Wow!

191
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,192
Well, very nice
presentation.

192
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,528
I'd like to see
this shrink ray.

193
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,330
Absolutely! Will do.

194
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,782
Soon as I have it.

195
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,792
You don't have it?

196
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,372
And yet you have
the audacity to ask the bank for money?

197
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,129
Apparently.

198
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,554
Do you have any idea of the capital that this bank
has invested in you, Gru?

199
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,219
With far too few of your sinister plots
actually turning a profit.

200
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,898
How can I put it?
Let's say this apple is you.

201
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,976
If we don't start
getting our money back...

202
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,484
Get the picture?

203
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,493
Look, Gru, the point is,
there are a lot of new villains out there,

204
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,617
younger than you,
hungrier than you,

205
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,744
younger than you.

206
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,076
Like that young fellow
out there named Vector.

207
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,831
He just stole a pyramid!

208
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,425
I've got it.
I've got it.

209
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,430
Um... So, as far as getting
money for the rocket...

210
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,508
Get the shrink ray,
then we'll talk.

211
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,186
Suckers!

212
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,946
Suckers!

213
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,158
Ah-ha! We got it!

214
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,330
What?

215
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,212
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!

216
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:22,960
No, no, no!

217
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:27,677
You!

218
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,389
Now, maybe you'll think twice before you
freeze someone's head!

219
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,314
So long, Gru!

220
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,643
Quick!
We can't let him get away!

221
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,828
Up ahead!
Up ahead!

222
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,289
Fire! Fire, now!

223
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,332
Oops, you missed me!

224
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,464
Come to papa!

225
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,024
Take that.

226
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,362
How adorable.

227
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,485
Got you
in our sights!

228
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,488
Like taking candy
from a...

229
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,568
What?

230
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,697
Ha! Hey, Gru!

231
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,909
Try this on for size!

232
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,086
That's weird.
What is going...

233
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,044
This is claustrophobic!

234
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,842
No, no, no!

235
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,101
Too small!
This is too small for me!

236
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,230
I hate that guy!

237
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,031
...and please
watch over us,

238
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,081
and bless that we'll have
a good night's sleep.

239
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,659
And bless that
while we're sleeping,

240
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,166
no bugs will
crawl into our ears

241
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,589
and lay eggs
in our brains.

242
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,542
Great. Thanks for
that image, Edith.

243
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,921
And please bless
that someone will adopt us soon,

244
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,927
and that the mommy
and daddy will be nice

245
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,929
and have a pet unicorn.

246
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,560
Amen.

247
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:38,433
Amen.
Amen.

248
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,525
Unicorns, I love them
Unicorns, I love them

249
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,358
Uni, uni, unicorns
I love them

250
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,073
Uni, unicorns,
I could pet one

251
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,538
If they were really real

252
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,705
And they are

253
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,375
So, I bought one
so I could pet it

254
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,663
Now it loves me
Now I love it

255
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,748
La, la, la, la, la

256
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,825
Don't you...
What the...

257
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,531
Oh, good luck,
little girls!

258
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,909
Whoa! Cool.

259
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:07,041
Hi! We're orphans from Miss Hattie's
Home for Girls.

260
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:09,087
I don't care.
Beat it! Come on!

261
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,416
We're selling cookies
so, you know, we can have a better future.

262
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,344
Ooh! Wait, wait!
Do you have coco-nutties?. Yeah.

263
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,610
Light bulb.

264
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,039
Dr. Nefario!
Huh?.

265
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,368
I'm going to need
a dozen tiny robots disguised as cookies!

266
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,419
What?.
Cookie robots!

267
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,918
Who is this?.
Oh, forget it.

268
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,344
Well, it appears you have
cleared our background check,

269
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,634
Dr. Gru.

270
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,060
Oh! And I see you
have made a list

271
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,894
of some of your
personal achievements.

272
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,820
Thank you for that.
I love reading.

273
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,039
And I see you have been given
the Medal of Honor

274
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,242
and a knighthood.

275
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,121
Me, me, me.
Me, me, me.

276
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,205
KeVin?

277
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,259
You had your own
cooking show

278
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:41,305
and you can hold
your breath for 30 seconds?

279
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,097
It's not that
impressiVe.

280
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,174
Uh...

281
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,560
Idiot!

282
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,394
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

283
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,728
What in the name of...
What?

284
00:26:56,907 --> 00:27:00,115
Well, here's the dealio.

285
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:05,117
Things have been
so lonely since my wife,

286
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,454
Debbie, passed on.

287
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,708
It's like
my heart is a tooth,

288
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:18,209
and it's got a cavity
that can only be filled with children.

289
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,797
I'm sorry.

290
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:27,389
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?

291
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,262
Do I look like
I speak Spanish?

292
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,689
You have a face
como un burro.

293
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,150
Oh!

294
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,732
Well, thank you!

295
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,908
Anyway, can we proceed
with this adoption?

296
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,580
So, so excited!

297
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,869
Please tell Margo,
Edith and Agnes to come to the lobby.

298
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,631
I bet the mom
is beautiful!

299
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,835
I bet the daddy's
eyes sparkle.

300
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,762
I bet their house is
made of Gummi Bears.

301
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,011
I'm just saying
it'd be nice.

302
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:11,349
Aw! My caterpillar never
turned into a butterfly.

303
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,976
That's a Cheeto.

304
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,101
Oh!

305
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:19,770
Well, Debbie was
a very lucky woman.

306
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,524
Who's Debbie?

307
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,450
Your wife.

308
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,027
Oh! Hi, girls!

309
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,877
Girls, I want you
to meet Mr. Gru.

310
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,294
He's going to adopt you.

311
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,970
And he's a dentist!

312
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,641
Yeah!

313
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,265
Um...

314
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:57,726
Hi. I'm Margo.
This is Edith.

315
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,106
And that's Agnes.

316
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,153
I got your leg,
I got your leg!

317
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,324
Okay, that is enough,
little girl.

318
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,742
Let go of my leg.
Come on. You can do it. Higher!

319
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,115
Higher!  Just release
your grip. Wow!

320
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,578
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?

321
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,625
Some nonstick spray?

322
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,497
Crowbar?

323
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,254
Okay, girls, let's go.

324
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,318
Ah-ha!

325
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,529
Oh, yeah!

326
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,905
Pretty impressive!

327
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,165
What are you looking at?

328
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,538
Boo-ya!

329
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,706
You got shrunk,
tiny mouthwash!

330
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,377
Take that!

331
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,842
You done been shrunk!

332
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,345
Yello?

333
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,218
I got the shrink ray,
all right.

334
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,885
No, I'm not
playing with it.

335
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,346
Gru?

336
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,106
Don't make me laugh! No.

337
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,147
P.S., he is not
getting the moon,

338
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,275
and P.P.S., by the time
I'm done with him,

339
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,898
he's gonna be
begging for mercy.

340
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,235
Okay, bye.

341
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:37,287
Aw! Look at you,
a little tiny toilet for a little tiny baby...

342
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,577
Curse you, tiny toilet!

343
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,300
Okay, here we are.

344
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,923
Home sweet home.

345
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,300
So, this is, like,
your house?

346
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,388
Wait a sec...

347
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,222
You're the guy who pretended he was
a recorded message!

348
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,307
No, that was
someone else.

349
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,158
Can I hold your hand?

350
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,947
Uh, no.

351
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,422
When we got adopted
by a bald guy,

352
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:33,130
I thought this'd be
more like Annie.

353
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,352
No, hey!

354
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,610
Kyle, these are not treats.
These are guests.

355
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,316
Girls,
this is Kyle, my

356
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,447
dog.

357
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,371
Ooh! Fluffy doggy!

358
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,954
What kind of dog
is that?

359
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,664
He is a...
I don't know.

360
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,760
Do you really think that this is an appropriate
place for little kids?

361
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,925
'Cause it's not.

362
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,348
No! No!
Stay away from there!

363
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,017
It's fragile.

364
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:25,023
Well, I suppose
the plan will work with two.

365
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,897
Hey!
It's dark in here.

366
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,148
It poked a hole
in my juice box.

367
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,363
As you can see,

368
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,950
I have provided everything
a child might need.

369
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:45,827
All right.

370
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:49,415
Uh... Okay.
As I was saying... Hey!

371
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,670
Somebody broke that.

372
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:55,800
Okay, okay.
Clearly, we need to set some rules.

373
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,722
Rule number one.

374
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,346
You will not
touch anything.

375
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,302
Uh-huh.
What about the floor?

376
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,767
Yes, you may
touch the floor.

377
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,223
What about the air?

378
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,400
Yes, you may
touch the air!

379
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,522
What about this?

380
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,655
Where did you get that?
Found it.

381
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:18,486
Okay. Rule number two.
You will not bother me while I'm working.

382
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,491
Rule number three.

383
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:25,042
You will not cry or whine
or laugh or giggle

384
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,744
or sneeze
or burp or fart!

385
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:32,757
So, no, no, no
annoying sounds. All right?

386
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,675
Does this count
as annoying?

387
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,593
Very!

388
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,685
I will see you
in six hours.

389
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:50,688
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

390
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:55,690
We're gonna be
really happy here. Right? Agnes?

391
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,324
Mmm?

392
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,266
Uh, question.
What are these?

393
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:32,651
A dozen boogie robots!
Boogie!

394
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,728
Look at this. Watch me!.

395
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,322
Cookie robots.
I said cookie robots.

396
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,495
Why are you so old?

397
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,575
Okay. I'm on it.

398
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:50,835
Hello?

399
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,761
TV!.

400
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,615
What is that?

401
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,916
Wow!
Look at that!

402
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,459
That is cool!

403
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,582
Come on!

404
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,376
I don't think
he's a dentist.

405
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,017
We've been working
on this for a while.

406
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,895
It's a anti-gravity serum.

407
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,984
I meant to close that.
He'll be all right, I'm sure.

408
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,615
Do the effects wear off?

409
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,161
Uh, so far,

410
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,239
no. No, they don't.

411
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:13,877
And here, of course,
is the new weapon you ordered.

412
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,505
No, no.

413
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:22,461
I said "dart gun,"
not... Okay.

414
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,840
Oh, yes.
'Cause I was wondering

415
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,516
under what circumstances
would we use this?

416
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,059
But, anyway.

417
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,604
What I really wanted
to show you was this.

418
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,480
Now those are
cookie robots!

419
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,859
La, la, la, la
I love unicorns

420
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:49,617
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!

421
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,290
We got bored.
What is this place?

422
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,205
Can I drink this?

423
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,752
Do you want to explode?

424
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,372
Gru!

425
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,458
Get back
in the kitchen!

426
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,669
Will you play with us?
No.

427
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,304
Why?
Because I'm busy.

428
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,927
Doing what?

429
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,302
Um...

430
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,975
Okay, okay,
you got me.

431
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,804
The dentist thing
is more of a hobby.

432
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,811
In real life,
I am a spy.

433
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,435
And it is top secret,
and you may not tell anybody,

434
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,646
because if you do...
What does this do?

435
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,025
Hey!
Oops.

436
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,952
My unicorn!

437
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,905
You have to fix it.

438
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,912
Fix it?
Look, it has been disintegrated.

439
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,335
By definition,
it cannot be fixed.

440
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,751
That's freaking me out.
What is she doing?

441
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:48,054
She's gonna hold her breath
until she gets a new one.

442
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,675
It is just a toy.
Now stop it!

443
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,222
Okay, okay!
I'll fix it!

444
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,606
Tim! Mark! Phil!

445
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,486
This is very important.

446
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:07,111
You have to get
the little girl a new unicorn toy.

447
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,157
Eh?

448
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,031
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!

449
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,293
Go, and hurry!

450
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,585
What are those?

451
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,835
They are my cousins.

452
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,212
Jerry! Stuart!

453
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,296
Watch them, and keep them
away from me, please.

454
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,940
Wow!

455
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,255
Ooh!

456
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,310
Oh!

457
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:27,612
Hmm...

458
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,135
It was your cousin's idea.

459
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,633
What?

460
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,551
Okay, bedtime.

461
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,977
Aw!

462
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,558
Aw!
Aw!

463
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,268
Not you two!

464
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:09,571
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.

465
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,278
Just so you know,

466
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,200
you're never
gonna be my dad.

467
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:18,030
Hmm. I think
I can liVe with that.

468
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,540
Are these beds
made out of bombs?

469
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,250
Yes, but they are
very old and highly unlikely to blow up.

470
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,166
But try not to
toss and turn.

471
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,420
Cool.

472
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,509
Will you read us a bedtime story?
No.

473
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,682
But we can't go to sleep
without a bedtime story.

474
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,387
Well, then it's going
to be a long night for you, isn't it?

475
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,808
So, good night, sleep tight, and don't
let the bed bugs bite.

476
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:49,815
Because there are literally
thousands of them.

477
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,028
And there's probably
something in your closet.

478
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,781
He's just kidding, Agnes.

479
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,930
It's beautiful.

480
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,798
Girls, let's go.

481
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,718
Time to deliver the cookies!

482
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:59,343
Mmm. Okay. But first,
we're going to dance class.

483
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,346
Actually, we're going to have to skip
the dance class today.

484
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,268
Actually, we can't

485
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,971
skip the dance
class today.

486
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,022
We have a big recital
coming up.

487
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,941
We're doing an excerpt
from Swan Lake.

488
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,360
Yeah, Swan Lake!

489
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,187
That's fantastic.
Wonderful.

490
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:18,400
But we're going to
deliver cookies! Come on!

491
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,569
No.

492
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,492
No?

493
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,825
We're not going to deliver cookies
until we do dance class.

494
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,034
Really?

495
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:31,838
Well, I am not driving you
to dance class.

496
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:37,294
So if you want to go,
you are going to have to walk yourselves.

497
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,634
What are you doing?

498
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,515
Walking to dance class.

499
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,562
Ya? Okay, fine.

500
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:52,483
You just keep walking,
because I'm really not driving you!

501
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,776
Okay.

502
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,772
You're going to suffer
the wrath of Gru!

503
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,233
Seriously,
I'm going to count to three!

504
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,284
And you had better
be in this car!

505
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:06,034
Here we go! One! Two!

506
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:09,709
...three,
four and five.

507
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:12,663
And lift, and stretch.

508
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,373
And one, and two...

509
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,584
Here you go.
What is it?

510
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,216
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?

511
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,922
Of course,
of course.

512
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,100
I have pins and needles
that I'm sitting on.

513
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,848
Pinky promise?

514
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:32,523
Oh, yes.
My pinky promises.

515
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:50,370
All right. Our first customer
is a man named Vector.

516
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,201
But he's a V.

517
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,287
You know, we're supposed
to start with the A's.

518
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,293
Then we go to the B's.
Then we...

519
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,796
Yes, yes!
I went to kindergarten.

520
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,298
I know how
the alphabet works!

521
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,553
I was just thinking

522
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,387
that it might be nice to
deliver Mr. Vector's first.

523
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,142
That is all.

524
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,894
Almost over.
It's almost over.

525
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:24,275
Girls, welcome back to the fortress
of Vector-tude!

526
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,737
Do you have
my cookies for me?

527
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,417
Four boxes of mini-mints,
two toffee totes,

528
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:42,218
two caramel clumpies
and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.

529
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,889
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else
order that many cookies.

530
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,010
Not likely.

531
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,183
Name one person
who ordered more cookies than me.

532
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:50,973
That'll be $52.

533
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:52,849
Right.

534
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,113
Seven, eight, nine...

535
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,572
Tic Tacs! Where was I?

536
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,870
Seven, eight, nine...

537
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,743
Why are you
wearing pajamas?

538
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:16,123
These aren't pajamas!
This is a warm-up suit.

539
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,179
What are you
warming up for? Stuff.

540
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,263
What sort of stuff?

541
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,771
Super-cool stuff
you wouldn't understand.

542
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,271
Like sleeping?

543
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:43,275
They are not pajamas!

544
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,335
Here you go, 52 big ones.

545
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,896
Bye!

546
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,194
Come on!

547
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,100
What the...

548
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,601
Quiet down, fish!

549
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:49,651
Down, boy!

550
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,715
Ah-ha!

551
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:16,140
We did it!
Come on, girls, let's go!

552
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,109
But what about the other people
who ordered cookies?

553
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,903
Life is full of
disappointments

554
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,732
for some people.

555
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:38,988
Don't do that!

556
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,120
Super Silly Fun Land!
Can we go? Please?

557
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:43,580
No.

558
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:46,162
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!

559
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,292
Don't care.

560
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,498
Please?
Please?

561
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,253
We'll never ask
for anything else, ever again!

562
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,380
Pretty please?
Please?

563
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,476
Come on!
Come on!

564
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,183
Light bulb.

565
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,899
Come on!

566
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,948
Goodbye, have fun.

567
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,909
Sorry, dude.
They can't ride without an adult.

568
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,365
What?

569
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,301
Oh, my gosh!

570
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,804
Look at that
fluffy unicorn!

571
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,850
He's so fluffy,
I'm gonna die!

572
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:29,352
You've gotta let
us play for it!

573
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,183
No, no, no.

574
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,563
Come on!

575
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,651
How much for
the fluffy unicorn?

576
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,733
Well, it is not
for sale.

577
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,739
But all you gotta do
to win it

578
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,822
is knock down that
little spaceship there.

579
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,824
It's easy!

580
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,459
Yay!

581
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,642
Again!

582
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,813
Wait! Come on.
One more time!

583
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,063
Just one more.

584
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,520
I accidentally
closed my eyes.

585
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,871
I hit it!
I hit it! That was cool.

586
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,757
Aw!

587
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,212
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What was that?

588
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:45,057
She hit that.
I saw that with my own eyes.

589
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:47,886
Hey, buddy,
let me explain something to you.

590
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,221
You see that
little tin spaceship?

591
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:52,477
You see how
it's not knocked over?

592
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:55,435
Do you know what
that means, professor?

593
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:59,021
It means you don't
get the unicorn!

594
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,107
Oh! Uh-oh!

595
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,032
Somebody's got
a frowny face.

596
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,532
Boo! Better luck
next time!

597
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,498
Okay, my turn.

598
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,436
Knocked over!

599
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:40,567
It's so fluffy!

600
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:41,647
Yeah!

601
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,408
That was awesome!

602
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,156
You blew up
the whole thing!

603
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,612
Let's go.
Let's try another game!

604
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,085
Gru, do you mind
if I have a quick word?

605
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,083
Okay, girls, go play.

606
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,930
I got the shrink ray!

607
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,772
Cotton candy!

608
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:20,690
We have 12 days
until the moon is in optimum position.

609
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,942
We can't afford
any distractions!

610
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:25,942
Get me Perkins.

611
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:33,286
Ah-ha!

612
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,077
Sorry to bother you,
Mr. Perkins,

613
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:40,164
but I figured that you
would want to see this!

614
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,083
What?

615
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,971
Well done, Gru.

616
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,055
Rather impressive.

617
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:00,143
Now, the rest
of the plan is simple.

618
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:04,564
I fly to the moon.
I shrink the moon.

619
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:08,367
I grab the moon.
I sit on the toilet.

620
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,069
What?

621
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,246
Sorry. Sorry!

622
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,449
Could you excuse me
for just one second?.

623
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:16,954
I told you not
to touch my things.

624
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:20,082
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.

625
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,835
Hey, can we
order pizza?

626
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,836
Pizza?
You just had lunch.

627
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,087
Not now, for dinner.

628
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,760
Dinner?

629
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:29,634
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!

630
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,556
Oh! Can we get
stuffed crust?

631
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,017
Stuffed crust!
Stuffed crust!

632
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,685
I'll stuff you
all in the crust!

633
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,101
You're funny!

634
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:41,935
Just don't come out
of that room again!

635
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:43,523
All right.

636
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,815
Sorry about that.
Where were we?.

637
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,491
You were sitting
on the toilet.

638
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:54,117
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.
It was a little attempt at humor.

639
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,041
I know how much
you like to laugh

640
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:03,339
inside.
Now, I was saying...

641
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,840
You don't seem
terribly focused, Gru.

642
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,263
Believe me,
I am completely focused.

643
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,427
Hello! Whoa!
What?

644
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:14,634
That guy is huge!

645
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,138
Are we on TV?
What are those?. Children?.

646
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,063
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!

647
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,485
No, no, no!

648
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,652
Freeze ray!

649
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,321
Mr. Gru?.

650
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,411
Okay.

651
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:37,156
As I was saying...

652
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:41,085
No need to continue.
I've seen quite enough.

653
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,331
But my plan...

654
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,502
Is a great plan.

655
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:46,798
I love everything about your plan,
except for one thing.

656
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,009
You.

657
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:55,850
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me
landing on the moon!

658
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:02,978
Look, Mom, I made
a prototype of the rocket out of macaroni!

659
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,568
Look, Mom,
I made a real rocket

660
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,988
based on the
macaroni prototype!

661
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,993
I don't understand.

662
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,624
Let's face reality, Gru.

663
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:30,460
You've been at this
for far too long with far too little success.

664
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:34,888
We're gonna put our faith,
our money, into a...

665
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,341
Well, a younger villain.

666
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,892
But I...

667
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:41,095
It's over. Goodbye, Gru.

668
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:06,830
Now, I know there have been
some rumors going around

669
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:10,212
that the bank is
no longer funding us.

670
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,881
Well, I am here to put
those rumors to rest.

671
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,927
They are true.

672
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,804
Uh-oh!

673
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,102
In terms of money,

674
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,434
we have no money.

675
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,107
So how will we
get to the moon?

676
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,110
The answer is clear.

677
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,779
We won't.

678
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,113
We are doomed.

679
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,955
Now would probably
be a good time

680
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,953
to look for other
employment options.

681
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:46,959
I know.

682
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:52,292
I have fired up my resume
as I suggest that all of you do, as well.

683
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,884
What is it?

684
00:57:56,807 --> 00:58:00,095
Can't you see that
I am in the middle of a pep talk?

685
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,121
Yes!

686
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,128
Yes, we will build
our own rocket

687
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:38,299
using this and whatever
else we can find!

688
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,383
Grab everything!
Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!

689
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,759
Who needs the bank?

690
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,595
Let's go. Let's go!

691
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,859
Mom!
What are you doing here?

692
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,783
And here he is
in the bathtub.

693
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,160
Oh! Look at his
little buns.

694
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,956
Mom.

695
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,453
Not cool.

696
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:55,001
And here, he's all dressed up
in his Sunday best.

697
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,290
He looks like a girl!

698
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:01,128
Yes, he does.
An ugly girl!

699
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:25,535
You're funny!

700
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,010
Yes! Mine's shaped
like a dead guy!

701
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:02,652
Mr. Perkins,
your son is here.

702
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,573
Send him in.

703
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,406
Hey, Dad.

704
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,658
You wanted to see me?

705
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,159
Yes, I did, Victor.

706
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:12,741
I am not Victor anymore.

707
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:16,294
Victor was my nerd name.
Now I am Vector!

708
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,712
Sit down!

709
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,754
Do you know where
the shrink ray is?

710
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:24,135
Duh! Back at my place.

711
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:27,055
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place? Oh, that's cool.

712
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:31,431
I guess Gru must just have one
that looks exactly like it!

713
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,274
Oh! What the...
Those girls sold me cookies!

714
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:41,312
Do you have any idea
how lucrative this moon heist could be?

715
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,192
I give you the opportunity
of a lifetime,

716
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:44,944
and you just blow it!

717
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,485
No, I didn't.

718
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,615
Oh, really?

719
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,539
You just wait until Gru sees
my latest weapon.

720
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,663
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!

721
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,751
There's a squid on my face!

722
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:03,629
Don't worry.

723
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,962
The moon is as good as ours.

724
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,299
Come on now,
it's bedtime.

725
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:14,010
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.

726
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,555
You did not!

727
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:20,734
Put on your PJs.
Hold still. Okay, seriously! Seriously!

728
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,607
This is beddie-bye time,
right now.

729
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,313
I'm not kidding around.
I mean it!

730
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,739
But we're not tired!

731
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,111
Well, I am tired.

732
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,444
Will you read us
a bedtime story?

733
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:35,699
No.

734
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,034
Pretty please!

735
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,916
The physical appearance
of the "please" makes no difference.

736
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:43,089
It is still no,
so go to sleep.

737
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,292
But we can't.
We're all hyper!

738
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:49,926
And without a bedtime story,
we'll just keep getting up and bugging you.

739
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,096
All night long.

740
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,516
Fine.

741
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:58,555
All right, all right.
Sleepy Kittens.

742
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,356
Sleepy Kittens?.

743
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,187
What are these?
Puppets.

744
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,940
You use them when
you tell the story.

745
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,575
Okay, let's get
this over with.

746
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,948
"Three little kittens
loved to play,

747
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,284
"they had fun
in the sun all day.

748
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:21,711
"Then their mother
came out and said,

749
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,789
"'Time for kittens
to go to bed."'

750
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:27,796
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?

751
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,172
Keep reading!

752
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,384
Come on!
All right, all right, all right.

753
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,133
"Three little kittens
started to bawl,

754
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,594
"'Mommy, we're not
tired at all.'

755
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:40,226
"Their mother smiled
and said with a purr,

756
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,980
"'Fine, but at least
you should brush your fur."'

757
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,231
Now you brush the fur.

758
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,655
This is literature?

759
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:53,031
A 2-year-old could
have written this. All right.

760
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,572
"Three little kittens
with fur all brushed

761
01:03:56,666 --> 01:04:00,079
"said, 'We can't sleep,
we feel too rushed!'

762
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,253
"Their mother replied,
with a voice like silk,

763
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,207
"'Fine, but at least
you should drink your milk."'

764
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,667
Now make them
drink the milk.

765
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:16,850
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.

766
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:20,269
"Three little kittens,
with milk all gone,

767
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:23,315
"rubbed their eyes
and started to yawn.

768
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,566
"'We can't sleep,
we can't even try.'

769
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,493
"Then their mother
sang a lullaby.

770
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:38,993
"'Good night kittens,
close your eyes.

771
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,325
"Sleep in peace
until you rise.

772
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,083
"'Though while you sleep,
we are apart,

773
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:49,963
"'your mommy loves you
with all her heart."'

774
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,305
The end.
Okay, good night.

775
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,049
Wait!

776
01:04:58,353 --> 01:04:59,559
What?

777
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:01,386
What about
good night kisses?

778
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:07,226
No, no. There will be
no kissing or hugging or kissing.

779
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,738
He is not gonna
kiss us good night, Agnes.

780
01:05:13,368 --> 01:05:15,404
I like him. He's nice.

781
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:16,826
But scary.

782
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:19,366
Like Santa!

783
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:42,101
Only 48 hours
till the launch, and all systems are go.

784
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,018
Uh... About that,

785
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:50,769
I was thinking that maybe we could move
the date of the heist.

786
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,355
Please tell me this
is not as a result

787
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:56,442
of the girls'
dance recital, is it?

788
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,777
No, no, no!

789
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:01,909
The recital?
Don't... That's stupid!

790
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:06,876
I just think it's kind of weird
to do it on a Saturday.

791
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:12,583
I was thinking, maybe a heist is
a Tuesday thing, right?

792
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,921
Gru, you and I have been
working on this for years.

793
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,051
It's everything
we've dreamed of.

794
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:21,053
Your chance to make history,

795
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:24,352
become the man
who stole the moon!

796
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:28,273
But these girls are becoming
a major distraction!

797
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:29,690
They need to go.

798
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:34,442
If you don't do
something about it, then I will.

799
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,732
I understand.

800
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:41,744
Good.

801
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,078
Butt.

802
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,503
Butt.

803
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:04,221
Butt.

804
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:09,848
All right. Now, when we put
our cups together,

805
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,559
we will make
the "clink" sound with our mouths.

806
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:13,860
Ready? Edith?

807
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:14,936
Clink.
Clink.

808
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,067
There we go.
And now we drink.

809
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:18,860
And Agnes?

810
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:19,907
Clink.
Clink.

811
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:21,404
Very good!

812
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,195
Excuse me, girls.

813
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,030
Come on!

814
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:29,583
Don't worry, I'll be back.
Keep clinking.

815
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,289
Clink, clink.
Clink, clink.

816
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,580
Oh!

817
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,540
Miss Hattie,
what are you doing here?

818
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,671
I'm here for the girls.
I received a call

819
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,548
that you wanted
to return them.

820
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:46,384
And also, I did purchase
a Spanish dictionary.

821
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:50,976
I didn't like
what you said.

822
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:52,474
But...

823
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:57,478
Oh!

824
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,365
I will get the girls ready.

825
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,711
Don't let her
take us, Mr. Gru!

826
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:16,831
Tell her you wanna keep us.

827
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:18,917
All right, girls.
Come on, let's go.

828
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,503
Goodbye, Mr. Gru.
Thanks for everything.

829
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:39,696
I did it
for your own good.

830
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:43,157
Come on,
let's go get that moon.

831
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,076
Right.

832
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:03,772
What is this for?

833
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:06,691
The recital?

834
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:10,074
I am the greatest
criminal mind of the century.

835
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:14,248
I don't go to little girls'
dance recitals!

836
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:40,024
Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.

837
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:45,105
And we are good to go
in t minus 10 seconds.

838
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,614
ten, nine, eight, seven,

839
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:51,785
six...

840
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:19,097
Oh, yeah!

841
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:23,605
Nice work, Doctor.
All systems go.

842
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,110
Boo-ya!

843
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,956
My flight suit.

844
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,875
Oh, yeah!
Once again, the mighty...

845
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,022
Whoa!

846
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:07,622
Ah-ha!

847
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,423
I've got it!

848
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:16,639
I've got the moon!

849
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,231
I can make it!

850
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,614
Wait a minute!

851
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:42,824
Kevin!

852
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,499
Come on, come on!

853
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,387
He's still not here.

854
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:59,887
Why would he come?
He gave us up.

855
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,467
But he pinky promised!

856
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:04,304
Girls, girls, places!

857
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:07,231
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.

858
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,684
Can we just wait
a few more minutes?

859
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,944
All right. But just
a few more minutes.

860
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:18,117
He's not coming, guys.

861
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,576
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?

862
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,458
Quick, we have to
warn him, and fast!

863
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,449
Okay, okay.
There's the library.

864
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:09,206
That's Third Street.
The dance studio...

865
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:10,752
There! There!
There it is!

866
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,622
Sorry, buddy.
Show's over.

867
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:52,578
Over?

868
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,034
Vector, open up!

869
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,289
First give me the moon.
then we'll talk.

870
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,095
Mr. Gru!

871
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,350
Zip it, Happy Meal.

872
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,931
Now, the girls.

873
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:58,395
Actually, I think I'll hold on to them
a little while longer.

874
01:16:58,489 --> 01:16:59,524
No!

875
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:02,277
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!

876
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,449
Listen close,
you little punk.

877
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:07,904
When I get in there,
you are in for a world of pain!

878
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,039
I'm really scared!

879
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,336
He is gonna
kick your butt.

880
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,503
What?
He punched my shark!

881
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,357
Ha! There he is!

882
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:33,531
Hang on, Gru.

883
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:40,166
Oh, no!

884
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:44,499
Ow?

885
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,307
Vector has the girls. Go!

886
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,976
What happened to the ship?
It's big again!

887
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,809
Not as big as the moon
is going to be! What?

888
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,768
The larger the mass
of an object,

889
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:05,946
the quicker the effects
of the shrink ray wear off!

890
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:08,991
I call it
the Nefario Principle.

891
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:10,989
I just came up
with it now, actually.

892
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,286
Oh, no!

893
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:20,669
Did you see that?

894
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:23,460
Vector! Help!
Vector!

895
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:24,756
Over here!
Hey!

896
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:26,504
What are you girls
doing back there?

897
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:27,630
The moon!

898
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:42,642
Ouch!

899
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:44,814
Watch out!

900
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:50,445
Get as close in
as you can.

901
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:52,572
You got it.

902
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:10,009
Mr. Gru, up here!

903
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:11,132
Mr. Gru!

904
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:13,259
Okay, girls! Girls!

905
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,012
You're going to
have to jump. ump?

906
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:18,059
Are you insane?

907
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:19,557
Don't worry,
I will catch you.

908
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:21,892
You gave us back!

909
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:26,148
I know, I know.
And it is the worst mistake I ever made.

910
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:28,650
But you have to
jump now.

911
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,323
It'll be okay.

912
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,325
Okay, girls.

913
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:40,908
Jump now!

914
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:48,210
Margo,
I will catch you.

915
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:51,923
And I will never
let you go again.

916
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,514
Not so fast!
No!

917
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,190
Let me go

918
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,944
Margo!

919
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:11,481
Whoa!

920
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:17,953
I'm coming, Margo.
Hang on!

921
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,392
I got you.

922
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:07,662
No!

923
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:26,097
Oh, poop.

924
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,023
This time, good triumphs,

925
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:30,442
and the moon
has been returned

926
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:32,440
to its rightful
place in the sky.

927
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:37,241
But once again, law enforcement is baffled,
leaving everyone to wonder,

928
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,113
who is this mysterious hero?

929
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,160
And what will he do next?

930
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:43,447
Okay, girls.
Time for bed.

931
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:45,407
Come on!
We want a story.

932
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,288
Three sleepy kittens!

933
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:51,622
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was accidentally
destroyed maliciously.

934
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:56,259
Tonight we are going
to read a new book.

935
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:58,507
This one is called

936
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:02,308
One Big Unicorn by...
Who wrote this?

937
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:06,808
Oh! Me! I wrote it.
Look, it's a puppet book!

938
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:09,314
Here, watch this.

939
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:11,896
That's the horn!

940
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:18,407
This is gonna be
the best book ever!

941
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,860
Not to pat myself
on the back,

942
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:23,286
but, yes,
it probably will be.

943
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:24,453
Here we go.

944
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:27,499
"One big unicorn,
strong and free

945
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:30,328
"thought he was happy
as he could be.

946
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:35,131
"Then three little
kittens came around

947
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:39,178
"and turned his
whole life upside down."

948
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,004
Hey, that one
looks like me!

949
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:43,215
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!

950
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:47,098
Any relation to persons living or dead
is completely coincidental.

951
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:53,017
"They made him laugh.

952
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:56,194
"They made him cry.

953
01:23:57,574 --> 01:24:00,031
"He never should
have said goodbye.

954
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:05,408
"And now he knows
he could never part

955
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:08,115
"from those
three little kittens

956
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:11,539
"that changed his heart.

957
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,712
"The end."

958
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:16,131
Okay, all right.
Good night.

959
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,064
I love you.

960
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,324
I love you, too.

961
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:54,502
No, no!

962
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:57,832
All right.

963
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,304
Didn't I get you already?

964
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:40,798
They're very good!

965
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:43,844
I'm so proud of you, Son.

966
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,888
You've turned out to be
a great parent!

967
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,550
Just like me.

968
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:52,344
Maybe even better.

969
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,381
No, I'm fine.
Go ahead.

970
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:24,592
No, no, no!

971
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:05,815
Hey, Carl! Hey.

972
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:06,895
Hmm?

973
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,198
No, no, no.

974
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,492
Me, me, me.

975
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:14,785
John?
