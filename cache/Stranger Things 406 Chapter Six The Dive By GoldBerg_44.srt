Explanation one,

55
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,490
an invisible boogeyman
from another dimension

56

Explanation two,

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,620
Dr. Brenner's special little pet
has gone rogue again

59
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,670
and he and his lackeys

60

are now seeking to cover it up.

61

Perhaps in the hopes
of selling their pet to the Soviets.

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,150
And I asked him what's different,
and he said...

457
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,940
he said he had figured it out.

458
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,570
He had found his strength
in a memory from his past.

459
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,870
Something that made him sad.

460
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,660
But also angry.

he... he came to practice with a black eye.

He was supposed to be here for the break,

555
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,790
and then he backed out at the last minute
for some vague, mumbly Jonathan reason.

And, to be honest, I'm not that surprised

557
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,290
because I've been
feeling him pulling away.

558
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,130

if it's because we're 2,000 miles away

559
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,550
or if he met someone new or what.

00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,340
And now I can't find out why

561
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,630
because apparently he's blown up
his family's house phone or something.

562
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,510
So, yeah, if... if the mention of his name
caused a slight muscle spasm on my face,

563
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,310
that's... probably why.

Last night, I saw things,
things I can't explain.

Things the police don't wanna believe.

I don't wanna believe myself.

But I know what I saw. I know.

618
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,960

We've all heard how satanic cults

like some... some disease.

And Eddie Munson

623
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,980
is the leader of one of these cults.

624
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
A cult that operates here in Hawkins.

All those unexplained deaths
over the years.

Some people say our town is cursed.
They just don't know why.

That's bullshit!

Last night, I became overcome
with this feeling of... of hopelessness.

643
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,950
Then I remembered Romans 12:21.

644
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,870
"Do not be overcome by evil."

645

"But overcome evil with good."

And God knows there's good in this town.

So much good. It's in this room!

No, it's not just a video game.

680
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,860
- Why have I never heard of it?
- Because it's top secret.

- Yeah, right. It's for the promotion.

682
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,750

the secret location receive a...

00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,930
- It was a metaphor.
- A bullet should work on him, right?

764
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,370
I say we chop his head off.

765
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,670
All of the above,
but we can't do any of that

766
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:28,210
- 'til we find a way into the Upside Down.
- We need El to get her powers back.

767
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,550
Everything was way easier.
We had this girl. She had superpowers.

768
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,050
Superpowers. Yeah, you mentioned her.

I was right.

775
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,490
Skull Rock was north.

776
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,700
- Seriously? You're serious?
- Mm-hmm.

777
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,450
- This is Skull Rock. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

778
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,870
You're totally, absolutely,
100% wrong. Right now.

779
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,950
Yes.

780
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,250
And no.

781
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,420
Oh my God.

782
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,250
This worked correctly
when we left the Wheelers'.

783
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,460
Correct when we got in the car on Curly.

784
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,510
But it started to slip
the further east we went.

785
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:16,090
Now it's way off.

786
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,680
When I was leading us here,
I wasn't wrong.

787
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,720
The compass was.

788
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,890
So you're using faulty equipment.
You're still wrong.

789
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,890
Except it isn't faulty.

790
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,230
Lucas, remember what can affect a compass?

791
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,770
- An electromagnetic field.
- Yep.

792
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,780
Sorry. I must've skipped that class.

793
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,700
In the presence
of a stronger electromagnetic field,

794
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,570
the needle will deflect
towards that power.

795
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,160
So either there's some
super big magnet around here, or...

796
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
There's a gate.

797
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,750
But we're nowhere near the lab.

798
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:48,250
But what if, somehow,
there's another gate?

799
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,000
A gate that we don't know about.

800
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,300
It'd have to be smaller.
Way less powerful.

801
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,010
- Snack-size gate.
- How? Why?

802
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:58,050
No idea. All I know is that something
is causing this disturbance,

803
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,890
and the last time we've seen
anything like it, it was a gate.

804
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,770
And I hope it is
because then we'd have a way to Vecna.

805
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:06,140
And a shot at freeing Max from this curse.

We can't just go hike in the woods.

808

This little steel capsule might be the key
to saving both Max and Eddie.
