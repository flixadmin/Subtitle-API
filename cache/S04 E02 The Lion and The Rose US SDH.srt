Tansy! Tansy!

- Ramsay: Tansy!

( laughing )

8
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,222
Ramsay:
Tansy!

9
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,474
- ( screams )
- There you are.

10
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,351
( barking )

11
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,811
( screaming )

12
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,188
I can't see her, Ramsay.

13
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,692
( panting )

14
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,235
Tansy!

15
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,572
( whimpering )

16
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,867
If you make it out
of the woods, you win!

17
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,536
Run, Tansy, run!

18
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,455
( screams )

19
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,375
( whimpering )

20
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,711
( panting, crying )

21
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,672
- Ramsay:<i> Tansy.</i>
<i>- Woman: Where is she?</i>

22
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:56,384
- Ramsay:<i> Tansy,</i>
<i>Tansy, Tansy!</i>
<i>- ( barking )</i>

23
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,722
( whimpering )

00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,938
( screams )

25
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,528
( crying )

26
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,324
Good girls.
Down, girls.

27
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,075
Down.

28
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,161
Well done.
You, too.

29
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:26,039
- I only wounded her.
- You brought her down.
That's what matters.

30
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,958
A fine shot.
Wasn't it, Reek?

31
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,002
A fine shot, master.
My lady.

32
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,338
Please, my lord.
It hurts.

33
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,924
Oh, sweet.
Don't cry.

34
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,509
It will be over soon.

35
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,180
She thinks
she's pretty.

36
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,848
Let me put one
through her face.

37
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,350
We have to reward
the hounds, love.

38
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,143
They did all
the hard work.

39
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,812
Why? I did
whatever you asked.

40
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,522
But you made Myranda
feel jealous.

41
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,359
- Me jealous of her?
-<i> My lord, please.</i>

42
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,737
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

43
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,864
- ( crying )
- ( dogs snarling, barking )

44
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,908
Rip her!
Rip her!

45
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,118
- Rip her!
-<i> ( Tansy screaming )</i>

46
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,621
<i>( tearing )</i>

47
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,998
Not so pretty now.

48
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,347
Tyrion:
<i>Your new hand, it's nicer</i>
<i>than the old one.</i>

49
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,807
Wouldn't you agree, Pod?

50
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,809
Is it solid gold?

51
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,979
Gilded steel.
You're not eating.

52
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,647
Why is no one eating?

53
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,525
My wife wastes away
and my brother
starves himself.

54
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,568
- I'm not hungry.
- You lost a hand,

55
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,989
not a stomach.
Try the boar.

56
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,492
Cersei can't get enough
of it since one killed
Robert for her.

57
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,871
A toast.

58
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,999
To the proud
Lannister children.

59
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,502
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

60
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,087
- Oh!
- I'll clean it up.

61
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,339
No, I'll do it.
Leave us.

62
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,594
It's only wine.

63
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,522
I can't fight anymore.

64
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,483
What about your left?

65
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,112
I can hold a sword,
but all my instincts
are wrong.

66
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,197
How can I
protect the king

67
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,824
when I can hardly
wipe my own ass?

68
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,493
You're the Lord
Commander now.
Command.

69
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,371
Let others
do the fighting.

70
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,624
When was the last time
Father used a sword?

71
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,376
I'm not Father.
I'm the Kingslayer.

72
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,628
When people find out
I can't slay a pigeon...

73
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:41,090
Train, then.
Learn to fight with
your other hand.

74
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,385
With whom? You?
Men talk.

75
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,263
Soon as someone
discovers I can't fight,
he'll tell everyone.

76
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,727
You need a proper,
discreet swordsman.

77
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,564
As it happens,
I have just the one.

78
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,201
My brother tells me
you can keep your
mouth shut.

79
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,203
Unusual talent
for a sellsword.

80
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,497
He tells me
you shit gold

81
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,333
just like your father.

82
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,376
Is this place safe?

83
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,756
There's this knight,
Leygood,

84
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,383
- got thunderbolts
on his shield.
- Uh-huh.

85
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,844
Right here is where
I fuck his wife.

86
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,138
She's a screamer,
that one.

87
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,141
If they don't hear her,
they won't hear us.

88
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,229
( whistles )
I've never seen
Valyrian steel before.

89
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,731
She's a beauty.
The problem is,

90
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,149
if you fight with
an edged blade,

91
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,152
I'll have to.

92
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,779
And if I fight with
an edged blade,

93
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,239
I'll have no one
left to pay me.

94
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,699
( blade clatters )

95
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,494
I haven't used a sparring
sword since I was nine.

96
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,875
Ah!

97
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,212
Bold warrior you are,
attacking a man when
his guard's down.

98
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,840
Best time
to attack a man.

99
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,845
Mind yourself.

100
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,722
- If I still
had my right hand...
- Plan on growing it back?

101
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,948
Come on, then.

102
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,211
Man:
<i>Open the gates!</i>

103
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,132
<i>Riders coming in!</i>

104
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,053
( horse whinnies )

105
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,567
Man:
<i>Let's get these</i>
<i>horses seen to!</i>

106
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,905
Father.
Welcome home.

107
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,366
Walda, this is
Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

108
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,453
A pleasure, Mother.

109
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,038
Hello.

110
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,873
Roose:
<i>See that the horses are fed,</i>
<i>watered, and rubbed down.</i>

111
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,668
And take Lady Walda
to her chambers.

112
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,213
This way, my lady.

113
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,340
Where is your prize?

114
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,258
With the hounds.

115
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,803
I'll have a look at him.

116
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,144
I hear you took a hand
from the Kingslayer.

117
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,064
Word travels.
How he screamed.

118
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,775
- You would have loved it.
- ( laughs )

119
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,953
Father.

120
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,129
What did you
do to him?

121
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:12,176
I trained him.
He was a slow learner,
but he learned.

122
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,636
You flayed him.

123
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,888
Peeled a few bits.

124
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,015
Removed a few others.

125
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,603
This was Balon Greyjoy's
son and heir.

126
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,189
We've been flaying
our enemies for 1,000 years.

127
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,358
The flayed man
is on our banners.

128
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:29,151
My banners,
not yours.

129
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,445
You're not a Bolton.
You're a Snow.

130
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,868
Tywin Lannister has given
me the North.

131
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,288
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

132
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,123
As long as the ironborn
hold Moat Cailin,

133
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,417
<i>our armies are trapped</i>
<i>south of the Neck.</i>

134
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,920
Theon was
a valuable hostage,
not your plaything.

135
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,340
I wanted to trade him
for Moat Cailin.

136
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,967
I already asked.

137
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,554
Lord Greyjoy refused.
Savages have no--

138
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,682
You sent terms
to Balon Greyjoy
without my consent?

139
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,976
You made me acting
Lord of the Dreadfort.

140
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,436
I acted.

141
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,402
I had to smuggle myself
into my own lands

142
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,779
thanks to the Greyjoys.

143
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,781
I needed Theon.

144
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,700
I needed him whole.

145
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,162
Theon was our enemy.

146
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,080
But Reek,

147
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,084
Reek will never
betray us.

148
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,046
I placed far too much
trust in you.

149
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,350
Reek, how could you
let me stand before
my father unshaven?

150
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:46,020
-<i> It's disrespectful.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, my lord.</i>

151
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,441
Give him the razor.

152
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,660
If I'm not a Bolton,
Father, what does it matter?

153
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,087
Go on, Reek.

154
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,839
<i>A nice close shave.</i>

155
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,238
Reek, tell Father

156
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,408
where are Bran
and Rickon Stark?

157
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,535
I don't know,
my lord.

158
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,078
You murdered them

159
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:48,249
and displayed their corpses
at Winterfell.

160
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,460
Ramsay:<i> Reek,</i>

161
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,921
did you murder
the Stark boys?

162
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,090
No, my lord.

163
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,466
Just two farm boys.

164
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,553
Ramsay:
<i>And crisped them</i>
<i>so no one would know.</i>

165
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,431
Theon:
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

166
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,476
The Starks have always
ruled the North.

167
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,104
If Bran and Rickon
are alive,

168
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,857
the country will rally
to their side

169
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,109
now that
Robb Stark is gone.

170
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,156
<i>Oh, that's right, Reek.</i>

171
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,617
Robb Stark is dead.

172
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,162
<i>Sorry.</i>

173
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,581
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a brother to you.</i>

174
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,792
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

175
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,714
How do you feel
about that?

176
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,438
- You ready for a hunt?
- Always.

177
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,691
Find those boys
and I'll give you 1,000 acres
and a holdfast.

178
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,735
Your pet rat
have any thoughts

179
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,279
on which way they went
after Winterfell?

180
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,575
Jon Snow is at
Castle Black.

181
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,870
Who the fuck
is Jon Snow?

182
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,121
Their bastard brother.

183
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,457
He could be
sheltering them.

184
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,167
He may know
where they are.

185
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,172
Even if he doesn't,
he's half Stark himself.

186
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,673
Could be a threat.

187
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,759
You want to prove
yourself a Bolton?

188
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:25,638
Gather whatever
men you can and ride
for Moat Cailin.

189
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,932
Bring this creature
of yours.

190
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,352
Maybe he'll be
of some use.

191
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,731
Take the Moat
for the family,

192
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,274
for<i> our</i> family,

193
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,944
and I'll reconsider
your position.

194
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,283
Lord Varys.
Breakfasting
with the king?

195
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,870
I'm afraid foreigners
aren't welcome at such
exclusive affairs.

196
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,665
- Oh, to be foreign.
- Ahem.

197
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,833
Shae has been noticed.

198
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,293
Sansa's maid
saw you with her.

199
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,878
She already told
your sister.

200
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,130
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

201
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,551
So I'm guilty
of being seen with
my own wife's handmaiden.

202
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,344
My father will ask you
if there's anything more

203
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,887
and you'll tell him
some clever lie.

204
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,764
No, I will not.

205
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:12,059
How long do you imagine
your father and sister
would let me live

206
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,395
if they suspected
me of lying?

207
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,730
I have no pet sellsword
to protect me.

208
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,732
No legendary brother
to avenge me.

209
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,443
<i>Only little birds</i>
<i>who whisper in my ear.</i>

210
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,195
Forgive me
if I don't weep for you.

211
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,198
No one weeps
for spiders or whores.

212
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,577
I have friends across
the sea who could help her.

213
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,911
She won't leave.

214
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,288
I've told her this is
a dangerous place

215
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,081
so many times,
she no longer believes it.

216
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,042
Your father has promised
to hang the next whore
he finds you with.

217
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,879
Have you ever known
your father to make
an idle threat?

218
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,801
From House Tyrell
and the people
of the Reach,

219
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:50,222
Your Grace, it is
my honor to present you
with this wedding cup.

220
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,640
May you
and my daughter Margaery

221
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,727
drink deep
and live long.

222
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,021
A handsome goblet,
my lord.

223
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,815
Or shall I call
you Father?

224
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,610
I shall be honored,
Your Grace.

225
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,119
She's the whore
I told you about.

226
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:15,581
The dark-haired one.

227
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,917
Have her brought
to the Tower of the Hand
before the wedding.

228
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,471
A book?

229
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,806
"The Lives of Four Kings."
Grand Maester Kaeth's history

230
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,100
of the reigns of
Daeron the Young Dragon,

231
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:39,980
Baelor the Blessed,
Aegon the Unworthy,
and Daeron the Good.

232
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,774
A book every king
should read.

233
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,743
Now that the war is won,

234
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,996
we should all find
time for wisdom.

235
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,333
Thank you, Uncle.

236
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,971
One of only two Valyrian
steel swords in the capital,

237
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,142
Your Grace, freshly
forged in your honor.

238
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,368
Careful, Your Grace.
Nothing cuts like
Valyrian steel.

239
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,829
So they say.

240
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,798
( panting )

241
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,050
Such a great sword
should have a name.

242
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,886
- What shall I call her?
- Man:<i> Stormbringer.</i>

243
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,055
- Man #2:<i> Terminus.</i>
<i>- Man #3: Widow's Wail.</i>

244
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,891
- Man #4:<i> Wolfsbane.</i>
<i>- Widow's Wail. I like that.</i>

245
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,893
( chuckles )

246
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,104
Every time I use it,
it'll be like cutting off

247
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,189
Ned Stark's head
all over again.

248
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,213
<i>( door opens )</i>

249
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,261
Don't.

250
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,348
You want me on the desk?

251
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:44,021
-<i> What's wrong, my lion?</i>
<i>- Don't call me that.</i>

252
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,607
What should I call you?

253
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,693
I'm afraid our friendship
can't continue.

254
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,278
Our friendship?

255
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,072
There's a ship waiting in
the harbor bound for Pentos.

256
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,949
What?

257
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,451
You'll have your own
cabin, of course,

258
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:02,039
and across the Narrow Sea
a house, servants.

259
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,792
What is this?

260
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,835
I'm a married man.

261
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,755
My wife has
suffered a great deal,
as you well know.

262
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,133
<i>I don't want her</i>
<i>to suffer anymore</i>
<i>on my account.</i>

263
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,178
I need to uphold my vows.

264
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,805
She doesn't want you.

265
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,933
-<i> I need to do right by her.</i>
<i>- You don't want her.</i>

266
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,726
By our children.

267
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,271
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid.

268
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,316
You are. You are afraid of
your father and your sister.

269
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,319
- You're going to run
from them all your life?
- I need you to leave.

270
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,364
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm not going to run.

271
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,574
- Shae.
- We will fight
them together.

272
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,244
It's like you said,
I am yours and you are mine.

273
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,538
You're a whore!

274
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,584
Sansa is fit to bear
my children and you are not.

275
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,962
I can't be in love
with a whore.

276
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,507
I can't have children
with a whore.

277
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,883
How many men
have you been with?

278
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,886
500? 5,000?

279
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,853
How many whores
have you been with?

280
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,021
I have enjoyed my time
with all of them

281
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,274
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

282
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,901
But now that time
is over.

283
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,740
<i>( Shae crying )</i>

284
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,879
You'll have a comfortable
life in Pentos.

285
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,717
Bronn will escort you
to your ship.

286
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,653
<i>( door closes )</i>

287
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,411
-<i> ( woman screaming )</i>
<i>- Melisandre: Hear us now.</i>

288
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,997
Accept these tokens
of our faith, my lord,

289
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,082
and lead us
from the darkness.

290
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,751
( crying )

291
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,086
Sire, I served you well.

292
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,632
<i>( crowd chanting )</i>
<i>Lord of Light,</i>
<i>show us the way...</i>

293
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,094
Selyse, you're my sister!

294
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,554
Yours are the stars
that guide us.

295
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,972
Tell him!
Tell him!

296
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,058
Melisandre:
<i>Lord of Light, protect us,</i>

297
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,935
for the night is dark
and full of terrors.

298
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,520
( screaming )

299
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,616
Did you see?
Their souls.

300
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,328
It was their souls.

301
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,665
Our lord took them.
Did you see?

302
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,257
Lord Florent was
your brother by law.

303
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,385
He was an infidel.

304
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,971
He worshipped the gods
of his fathers

305
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,223
and their fathers
before him.

306
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,809
They were the gods
of your fathers, too.

307
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,353
I ordered him to tear
down his idols.

308
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,604
He disobeyed.

309
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,481
How many ships did he
bring to your cause?

310
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,732
How many men?

311
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,193
A good deal
more than you.

312
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,238
Did you see,
Ser Davos?

313
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,739
They're with
our lord now.

314
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,158
Their sins
all burned away.
Did you see?

315
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,036
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, my queen.

316
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,217
( sniffs )

317
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,094
Meat's off.

318
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,806
Our larders
are almost empty.

319
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,808
Serve fish, then.
We're on an island.

320
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,435
You hate fish.

321
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,354
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

322
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,066
When Storm's End
was under siege
and I was starving,

323
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:04,614
<i>Stannis boiled soup</i>
<i>for me from books.</i>

324
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,993
The binding glue
is made from horses.

325
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,080
One morning,
he shot two seagulls
on the beach.

326
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:19,588
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

327
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,340
- Do you remember?
- Of course I remember.

328
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,471
Have you ever known
true hunger, my lady?

329
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,723
<i>It's all I knew</i>
<i>when I was a child.</i>

330
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,059
Until you found
the Lord of Light?

331
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,686
Until he found me.

332
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,862
I fear for
our daughter's soul.

333
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,074
<i>Every mother should fear</i>
<i>for her child's soul.</i>

334
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,409
- She's a stubborn
little beast.
- She's a child.

335
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,411
You barely know her.

336
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,372
You think she's sweet
because she smiles
when you visit.

337
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,583
She's sullen and stubborn
and sinful.

338
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,920
Why else would
the Lord of Light have
seen fit to mark her face?

339
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,338
She needs the rod.

340
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:05,217
She's my daughter.
You will not strike her.

341
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,053
As you command.

342
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,015
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

343
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,396
<i>( knocks )</i>

344
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,275
Come in.

345
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,613
Were you sleeping,
Princess?

346
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,453
Did you watch the ceremony
on the beach?

347
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,956
I heard it.

348
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,499
And it frightened you?

349
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,334
Ser Axel was my uncle.

350
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,128
<i>He was always</i>
<i>kind to me.</i>

351
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,130
They're in a better
place now, Princess.

352
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,133
<i>The fire cleansed them</i>
<i>of the sins of the world.</i>

353
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,551
But they screamed.

354
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,594
Women scream
when they give birth.

355
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,389
Afterward they are
filled with joy.

356
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,015
Afterward they aren't
ash and bone.

357
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,852
You have so many
questions, don't you?

358
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,187
<i>So did I</i>
<i>when I was a child.</i>

359
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,481
I was much like you.

360
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,525
Only I wasn't a princess.

361
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,152
And you didn't have this.

362
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,736
No.

363
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,197
But I suffered in other ways,
sweet girl, believe me.

364
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,284
What do you know
of the gods?

365
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,203
I read
"The Seven-Pointed Star."

366
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,248
Lies and fables.

367
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,167
Septons speak
of seven gods.

368
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,668
There are but two--

369
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,129
a god of light
and love and joy

370
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,799
and a god of darkness,
evil, and fear.

371
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,302
Eternally at war.

372
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:34,890
There are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

373
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:38,643
There's only one hell,
Princess.

374
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,688
The one we live in now.

375
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,733
<i>( heavy breathing )</i>

376
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,551
<i>( growls )</i>

377
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,808
-<i> Hodor.</i>
<i>- ( breathing heavily )</i>

378
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,980
Why did you wake me?

379
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,273
You've been gone
for hours.

380
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,902
I was hungry.

381
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,071
We're all hungry.

382
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,239
I was just eating.

383
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,741
Summer was eating.

384
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,577
Your body can't live on
the food your wolf consumes.

385
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,206
<i>Spending too much time</i>
<i>in Summer's skin</i>
<i>is dangerous.</i>

386
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,668
You're not
a direwolf, Bran.

387
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,464
Must be glorious, though.

388
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,260
To run, to leap,
to hunt.

389
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,180
To be whole.

390
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,516
<i>I know that's tempting,</i>

391
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,142
but if you're trapped
in Summer for too long,

392
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,270
you'll forget what it was
to be human.

393
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,609
You'd forget us, Bran.

394
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,528
You'd forget your mother
and father.

395
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,655
You'd forget your brothers
and sisters.

396
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,407
You'd forget Winterfell.

397
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,200
You'd forget you.

398
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:21,663
And if we lose you,
we lose everything.

399
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,419
<i>( wind blowing )</i>

400
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,013
<i>( wolf barks )</i>

401
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:56,114
Hodor, take me
to the tree.

402
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,152
( caws )

403
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,081

405
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,088
Voice:

406
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,844
- Cersei:<i> He saw us.</i>
<i>- ( screaming )</i>

407
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:03,390
<i>( dragon roaring )</i>

408
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,724
Voice:
<i>North.</i>

409
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,851
( gasps )

410
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,903
I know where
we have to go.

411
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,739
<i>( bells tolling )</i>

412
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,494
Let it be known
that Margaery of House Tyrell

413
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,748
<i>and Joffrey of the Houses</i>
<i>Lannister and Baratheon</i>

414
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:15,795
are one heart, one flesh,
one soul.

415
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,088
<i>Cursed be he</i>

416
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,633
<i>who would seek</i>
<i>to tear them asunder.</i>

417
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,973
With this kiss,
I pledge my love.

418
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,062
( applause )

419
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,788
We have a new queen.

420
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,709
Better her than you.

421
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,015
- Bit much, wouldn't you say?
- It feels proportionate.

422
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:12,310
- Proportionate to what?
- The expected extravagance.

423
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,687
People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

424
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,314
tend not to have it
for long.

425
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,526
You ought to try
enjoying something
before you die.

426
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,152
You might find
it suits you.

427
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,739
Not now, Mace.
Lord Tywin and I
are speaking.

428
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:27,367
Anyway, I don't know what
you're complaining about.

429
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,743
I'm paying my share.

430
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:31,037
Shall we stick golden roses
in half the meat pies

431
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,664
to commemorate
your generosity?

432
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,209
No, your heartfelt
thank-you is its
own reward.

433
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,379
I would imagine
I'd be hearing it
again before long.

434
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,297
Wars are rather expensive.

435
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,342
"The Iron Bank
will have its due."

436
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:47,220
How they love
to remind everyone.

437
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,973
Almost as much as you
Lannisters with your debts.

438
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,933
I'm not worried about
the Iron Bank.

439
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,395
We both know
you're smarter than that.

440
00:30:55,478 --> 00:31:01,067
Come, Tywin, let us
celebrate young love.

441
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,445
-<i> ( music playing )</i>
<i>- ( people laughing, chatting )</i>

442
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,246
All taken care of.

443
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,541
- You saw her board the ship?
- Aye, she's on it.

444
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,334
You saw the ship
sail away?

445
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,504
No one knows she's there
but you, me, and Varys.

446
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,256
How do you know?

447
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,758
Because if someone follows
me without an invitation,

448
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,760
I'm the last person
they ever follow.

449
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,887
There's someone
following you?

450
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,141
She's gone.

451
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,476
I know you don't
want to believe it,
but she is.

452
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,063
Now, go drink till it
feels like you did
the right thing.

453
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,155
Hello.

454
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,991
- Hello.
- Not you.

455
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,967
You look
exquisite, child.

456
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,304
The wind has been
at you, though.

457
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,474
I haven't had
the opportunity
to tell you

458
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,268
how sorry I was to hear
about your brother.

459
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,147
War is war,
but killing a man
at a wedding,

460
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,482
horrid.

461
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,817
What sort of monster
would do such a thing?

462
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,321
As if men need more
reasons to fear marriage.

463
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,822
My lady.
My lady.

464
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,992
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.

465
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,827
Perhaps if
your pauper husband

466
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,163
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

467
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,625
he might be able to afford
to bring you to Highgarden
for a visit.

468
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,920
Now that peace has come
and all is right
with the world,

469
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,963
it would do you good
to see some of it.

470
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,008
You must excuse me.
It's time I ate

471
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,135
some of this food
I paid for.

472
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,642
♪ A coat of gold ♪

473
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,186
♪ Or a coat of red ♪

474
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:06,192
<i>♪ A lion</i>

476
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,030
Very good. Very good.
Off you go.

- ( coins clatter )
- ( crowd laughs )

478
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,258
My love, why don't we
make the announcement?

479
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:32,552
( taps goblet )

480
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,221
Everyone.

481
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:39,183
The queen would like
to say a few words.

482
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,603
( applause )

483
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,859
We are so fortunate

484
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,902
to enjoy this marvelous
food and drink.

485
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,405
Not all among us
are so lucky.

486
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:56,492
To thank the gods
for bringing the recent
war to a just end,

487
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,620
King Joffrey has decreed
that the leftovers

488
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,666
from our feast be given
to the poorest in his city.

489
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,003
- ( applause )
-<i> ( music playing )</i>

490
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,805
You're an example
to us all.

491
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,656
Ser Jaime,
I'm very sorry.

492
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,742
Ser Loras,
it's quite all right.

493
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,288
Your sister looks
very beautiful.

494
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,623
Loras:
<i>As does yours.</i>

495
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,460
So, looking forward
to your wedding?

496
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,128
Yes, very much.

497
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,798
Our fathers are both
rather keen on the prospect.

498
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,132
They certainly are.

499
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,634
Perhaps they should
get married.

500
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,803
( laughs )

501
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,138
If you were
to marry Cersei,

502
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,807
she'd murder you
in your sleep.

503
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,685
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

504
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,813
she'd murder him, too,

505
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,481
long before he drew
his first breath.

506
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,651
Luckily for you,
none of this will happen

507
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,445
because you'll never
marry her.

508
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,951
And neither will you.

509
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,341
Your Grace.
My king.

510
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,510
- My queen.
- Lady Brienne.

511
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,637
So good of you to come.

512
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,264
I'm no lady,
Your Grace.

513
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,516
Did you just bow?

514
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,101
Apologies, Your Grace.

515
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,644
I never did master
the curtsy.

516
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,938
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

517
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,191
That's not true, my love.
Brienne had nothing
to do with it.

518
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,943
A shame.

519
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,697
I'd knight
the man that put an end
to that deviant's life.

520
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,532
I just wanted
to congratulate you both

521
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,867
and wish you good fortune.

522
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,578
The country has been
at war too long.

523
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,830
I hope your reign
is long and peaceful.

524
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,582
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

525
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,084
I hope we see
more of you.

526
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,927
Lady Brienne.

527
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,221
You're Lord Selwyn
Tarth's daughter.

528
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,433
That makes you a lady
whether you want
to be or not.

529
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,976
As you say, Your Grace.

530
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,436
I owe you my gratitude.

531
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,897
You returned my brother
safely to King's Landing.

532
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,152
In truth, he rescued me,
Your Grace.

533
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,738
More than once.

534
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,032
Did he?

535
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,034
Haven't heard
that story before.

536
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:47,038
Not such a fascinating
story, I'm afraid.

537
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,165
I'm sure you have many
fascinating stories.

538
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:53,419
Sworn to Renly Baratheon.
Sworn to Catelyn Stark.
And now my brother.

539
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:57,089
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next

540
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,926
serving whichever lord
or lady you fancy.

541
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,054
I don't serve
your brother, Your Grace.

542
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,389
But you love him.

543
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,607
Your Grace.

544
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,788
No, no, come to my chambers
and I will examine
you personally.

545
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,165
- She'll do no such thing.
- Oh, Your Grace.

546
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,459
Yes, well, this young
lady sought my advice--

547
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,127
You should see Qyburn.
He's quite good.

548
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,130
- Your Grace.
- Qyburn? Deplorable man.

549
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,925
Brought shame
on the Citadel with his
repugnant experiments.

550
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,260
More repugnant than
your gnarled fingers
on that girl's thighs?

551
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,638
Your Grace,
I am a man of learning.

552
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:49,308
My little brother had you
sent to the Black Cells
when you annoyed him.

553
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,560
What do you think
I could do to you
if you annoyed me?

554
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,521
I never meant
to annoy anyone.

555
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,440
But you are.
You annoy me right now.

556
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,609
Every breath you draw
in my presence annoys me.

557
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,944
So here's what I want
you to do.

558
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,487
I want you to leave
my presence.

559
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,822
Leave this wedding
right now.

560
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,865
Go to the kitchens
and instruct them

561
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,160
that all the leftovers
from the feast will be
brought to the kennels.

562
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,496
Your Grace,
Queen Margaery--

563
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,665
The<i> queen</i> is telling you

564
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,002
the leftovers
will feed the dogs

565
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,421
or you will.

566
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,066
A gold dragon to whoever
knocks my fool's hat off.

567
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,570
( crowd laughing )

568
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,872
You're in rather
a good mood.

569
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,291
- I suppose I am.
- I won't ask why.

570
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,711
- Small pleasures.
- Your Grace. Lord Tywin.

571
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,046
Prince Oberyn.

572
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,589
I don't believe you
have met Ellaria.

573
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,299
This is the Lord Hand
Tywin Lannister

574
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,593
and Cersei Lannister
the Queen Regent.

575
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,554
I suppose it is
former Queen Regent now.

576
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:11,807
Lord Hand
and Lady Cersei,

577
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:16,062
- Ellaria Sand.
- My lord. My lady.

578
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,563
Charmed.

579
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,107
Can't say I've ever
met a Sand before.

580
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,362
We are everywhere in Dorne.

581
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,573
I have 10,000 brothers
and sisters.

582
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,117
Bastards are born
of passion, aren't they?

583
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,494
We don't despise them
in Dorne.

584
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,828
No?
How tolerant of you.

585
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,789
I expect it is a relief,
Lady Cersei,

586
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,583
giving up your regal
responsibilities.

587
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,669
Wearing the crown for so
many years must have left
your neck a bit crooked.

588
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,630
I suppose you'll never
know, Prince Oberyn.

589
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,715
It's a shame
your older brother couldn't
attend the wedding.

590
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,134
Please give him
our regards.

591
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,803
With any luck,
the gout will abate

592
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,679
with time and he will
be able to walk again.

593
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,598
They call it
the rich man's disease.

594
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,933
A wonder
you don't have it.

595
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,684
Noblemen in my part
of the country

596
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,813
don't enjoy the same lifestyle
as our counterparts in Dorne.

597
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,606
People everywhere
have their differences.

598
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,901
In some places the highborn
frown upon those of low birth.

599
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,530
In other places
the rape and murder
of women and children

600
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,657
is considered distasteful.

601
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,745
What a fortunate
thing for you,
former Queen Regent,

602
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,747
that your daughter
Myrcella has been sent

603
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,208
to live in the latter
sort of place.

604
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,336
<i>( taps goblet )</i>

605
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:26,382
Everyone, silence!
Clear the floor.

606
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:32,304
There's been too much
amusement here today.

607
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:36,976
A royal wedding
is not an amusement.

608
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,185
A royal wedding
is history.

609
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,856
The time has come
for all of us

610
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,650
to contemplate
our history.

611
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,111
My lords...

612
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,323
my ladies...

613
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,535
I give you

614
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,954
- King Joffrey...
- ( shouting )

615
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,498
<i>...Renly, Stannis,</i>

616
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,960
<i>Robb Stark,</i>
<i>Balon Greyjoy.</i>

617
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,380
The War of the Five Kings.

618
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:09,049
<i>( applause, laughter )</i>

619
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,928
I'm the rightful king.

620
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,140
- King in the North!
- Yes!

621
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,105
-<i> Traitor. You're a traitor.</i>
<i>- ( laughing )</i>

622
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,400
<i>For the Seven Kingdoms!</i>

623
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,031
Let the war begin.

624
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,450
- ( laughing )
- ( howls )

625
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,077
Renly, you're no king.

626
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,456
Away, degenerate.
Away. Away.

627
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,917
Ooh, careful.
( squeals )

628
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,753
- Go on.
- I want you to
be my prince.

629
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,923
( laughing )

630
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,054
Stannis!

631
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,556
Who's got the gold
now, Stark?

632
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,060
I am the rightful king.
Challenge me, ruffian.

633
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,978
- Take that.
- I'm drowning.
I'm drowning.

634
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,522
I am the King
in the North!

635
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,737
Not wildfire!

636
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,616
- ( laughing )
- ( crying )

637
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:21,830
Pay each of them 20 gold
when this is done.

638
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,749
Podrick:
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

639
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,126
We'll have to find another
way to thank the king.

640
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,341
Charge!

641
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,598
Ready, again.

642
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,104
I am the King
in the North!

643
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,607
- Charge!
- Charge!

644
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,442
- Yes!
-<i> ( crowd cheers )</i>

645
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:54,071
-<i> Your head!</i>

( laughing )

649
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,899
Fine gentlemen.

650
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,402
( applause )

651
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,367
Well fought.
Well fought.

652
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,622
Here you are.
Champion's purse.

653
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:50,044
Though you're not
the champion yet, are you?

654
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:54,840
A true champion defeats
all the challengers.

655
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,216
Surely there are
others out there

656
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,262
who still dare
to challenge my reign.

657
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,847
Uncle.

658
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:05,017
How about you?
I'm sure they have
a spare costume.

659
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,478
<i>( crowd laughs )</i>

660
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,026
One taste of combat was
enough for me, Your Grace.

661
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,528
I would like to keep
what remains of my face.

662
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,614
<i>I think you</i>
<i>should fight him.</i>

663
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,115
This was but
a poor imitation

664
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,034
of your own bravery
on the field of battle.

665
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,410
I speak
as a firsthand witness.

666
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,789
<i>Climb down from</i>
<i>the high table</i>

667
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,540
<i>with your new</i>
<i>Valyrian sword</i>

668
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:33,087
and show everyone how
a true king wins his throne.

669
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,588
<i>Be careful, though.</i>

670
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,549
This one is clearly
mad with lust.

671
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:41,553
It would be a tragedy
for the king to lose
his virtue

672
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,722
hours before
his wedding night.

673
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,725
<i>( light laughter )</i>

674
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,213
A fine vintage.

675
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,924
Shame that it spilled.

676
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,008
It did not spill.

677
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,261
My love,
come back to me.

678
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,138
It's time for
my father's toast.

679
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,889
( applause )

680
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,017
Well, how does he expect me
to toast without wine?

681
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:35,232
Uncle, you can be
my cupbearer

682
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,609
seeing as you're
too cowardly to fight.

683
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,945
Your Grace does me
a great honor.

684
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:43,407
It's not meant
as an honor.

685
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,356
Bring me my goblet.

686
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,256
What good is an empty cup?

687
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,926
Fill it.

688
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,107
Kneel.

689
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,862
Kneel before your king.

690
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,118
Kneel.

691
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,503
