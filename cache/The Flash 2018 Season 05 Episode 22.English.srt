1
00:00:01,032 --> 00:00:02,417
<i>Previously on The Flash...</i>

2
00:00:02,497 --> 00:00:04,150
You're no longer you.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,412
You're a part of a negative force.

4
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:09,132
Thawne's Speed Force is fueled
by negative emotions.

5
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:10,031
What do you do?

6
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,572
Trust me, you wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

7
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:14,343
You're not super satisfied
with your secret identity.

8
00:00:14,423 --> 00:00:16,442
Are you saying I don't want to be Vibe?

9
00:00:16,522 --> 00:00:19,959
There won't be any future for any metas
if we don't get rid of that dagger.

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,005
If anything's gonna destroy that dagger,
it's this Mirror Gun.

11
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:23,929
It works.

12
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:26,429
Follow my instructions
and we'll defeat Cicada,

13
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:28,774
destroy her dagger, and save your father.

14
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:30,844
Thawne is manipulating her.

15
00:00:30,924 --> 00:00:33,253
He's on death row,
how is he manipulating her?

16
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,693
Something doesn't add up.

17
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:36,825
The dagger is Thawne's plan.

18
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:39,105
Don't shoot it!

19
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:44,757
I always wanted to be a hero,

20
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,803
to use my extraordinary
abilities to help people.

21
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:50,619
That's why I came here.

22
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:54,112
To meet my family, to stop Cicada,

23
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:56,681
help fix the Flash's legacy,

24
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:59,402
and save him from disappearing
in the future.

25
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:02,792
I believed I could do the impossible,

26
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:05,441
but I never imagined
it would turn out like this.

27
00:01:16,648 --> 00:01:18,460
No, no! What's he doing?

28
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,423
Cicada...

29
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:35,071
Thawne, dagger.

30
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:46,281
How's Ralph?

31
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:47,526
I've never seen anything like it.

32
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:48,623
I can't quite figure it out.

33
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:50,518
His cells are kinetically inverted.

34
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:52,067
It's like they're the reverse
of themselves.

35
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:54,868
Should've spent more time trying
to figure out how this thing works.

36
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,447
I just don't understand why he would
jump in front of that blast.

37
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:58,659
I mean, why would he do that?

38
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,968
That's the question, isn't it?

39
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:02,216
That's the question.

40
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:06,785
In other news, Cicada deuce is still MIA.

41
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:08,017
All right, we should get to CCPD,

42
00:02:08,097 --> 00:02:10,043
see if we can find anything
that could help us track her.

43
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:15,903
What?

44
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:18,111
I'm supposed to meet up
with Kamilla later.

45
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:19,951
I thought things were going really well
for you two.

46
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:21,097
They are.

47
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:25,659
I just haven't told her
about my vibratory alter ego yet.

48
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,628
Cisco, if you're serious
about being with her,

49
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,294
you have to tell her the truth.

50
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:33,213
I know.

51
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:35,938
All the metas that we couldn't cure,

52
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:39,950
we got safely evacuated and they're
waiting at a protected holding facility.

53
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,616
Nice work, both of you.

54
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,048
Well the work's not done yet.

55
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:44,556
I mean, the metas are safe for now,

56
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:47,286
but Cicada's still out there,
so the people are still in danger.

57
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:48,710
Fill me in on the details.

58
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,556
I'm ready for this nightmare to end.

59
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:52,713
It should've been over already.

60
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:56,582
Nora, look, I'm sure Ralph
had a good reason.

61
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:57,547
Until we figure out what it is,

62
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:59,511
we just gotta concentrate
on this, all right?

63
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:04,534
Wait a second.

64
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:08,173
What is that?

65
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,518
Looks like wood.

66
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:12,562
From what?

67
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:14,092
I mean the floor is marble,

68
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:15,063
furniture's untouched,

69
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:16,953
and the skylight's made
of glass and metal.

70
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:19,049
Well if it didn't come
from Cicada's point of entry...

71
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:20,851
She must've brought it
from somewhere else.

72
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:23,885
What do we do now?

73
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:26,323
You know what to do.

74
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:28,960
Hit them when they least expect it.

75
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:31,333
When they least expect it.

76
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,557
The Time Sphere.

77
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:37,209
If I repair it,

78
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:41,724
I can bring the last of the virus back
to the night of the Particle Accelerator.

79
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,118
When meta-humans first appeared
in Central City.

80
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:48,533
And the Flash becomes a hero to stop me.

81
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:53,272
Destroy the meta-humans
before they destroy the world.

82
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:56,847
They'll be born only to die.

83
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:01,470
Definitely some kind of wood fragment.

84
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,835
And you think those will lead us
to where Cicada's hiding?

85
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:05,253
We can find out.

86
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,639
We can cross-reference this,

87
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,628
see what kind of wood it is,
then see where we end up.

88
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:12,831
Is there any progress on Ralph?

89
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,250
No, he's still unconscious,

90
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,390
and I can't figure out a way
to reverse his cells.

91
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,780
So I guess that means
we still don't know...

92
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,770
...why he jumped in front
of that Mirror Gun, do we?

93
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,852
We do.

94
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:23,482
We do.

95
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:26,231
Because Dibny solved
the greatest mystery of all.

96
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:28,974
The Flash legacy, how to stop Cicada,

97
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:30,849
repentance for his past sins.

98
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:33,948
All the reasons Eobard Thawne
was helping you.

99
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:35,950
And stopping dad
from disappearing in the future.

100
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,113
Disappearing in the future is part of it?

101
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:40,360
But this has nothing to do
with your father.

102
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,297
The real reason that Thawne
wishes to defeat Cicada...

103
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:46,607
...and destroy Cicada's dagger...

104
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,694
...is because this dagger...

105
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,670
...is the only thing keeping
the Reverse-Flash in prison.

106
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:01,371
Guess this is it.

107
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:03,884
Looks like it, doesn't it?

108
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:12,953
I almost forgot.

109
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:19,206
I contacted the Flash Museum,
had them send something over for today.

110
00:05:19,844 --> 00:05:23,469
I thought it should be buried for good
along with you.

111
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:31,500
Consider it a parting gift.

112
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:44,721
Destroying Cicada's dagger in the past
will save Thawne from dying in the future?

113
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:45,813
That's right.

114
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:49,727
Cicada's dagger has been dampening
Thawne's powers all this time.

115
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,762
So if we get rid of the dagger now,
it disappears in the future?

116
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:55,204
And Thawne gets out of Iron Heights.

117
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:56,898
A reverse time hack.

118
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:59,272
Everything you said about Thawne is true.

119
00:05:59,352 --> 00:06:01,637
The only person he ever helps is himself.

120
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:03,116
Nora, this is not your fault.

121
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,488
Yes, it is.

122
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:14,817
Now the question we have to ask
do we stop Cicada or do we stop Thawne?

123
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:19,054
No, we're not gonna let thousands
of meta-humans die, now or in the future.

124
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:20,162
We find Cicada.

125
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:22,180
We destroy the dagger once and for all.

126
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:29,045
You gotta get out of here.

127
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,484
No, we gotta wait for the results...

128
00:06:31,564 --> 00:06:33,092
We can handle it until you get back.

129
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:34,256
Go see Kamilla.

130
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,028
How do you choose?

131
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,312
That's more of a question
for Iris than for me.

132
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,254
Hey.

133
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:53,616
Hey.

134
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:57,966
She seems to be happy with my photos.

135
00:06:58,046 --> 00:07:00,248
I was kinda hoping she'd
send me over to CCPD...

136
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:02,689
...to take photos of the meta-humans
when they were getting that cure.

137
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:05,673
Can you imagine being there
when that Cicada guy attacked?

138
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:08,520
Cicada woman, actually.

139
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:11,286
A woman?

140
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:17,315
Her name's Grace Gibbons.

141
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:19,813
Her uncle was the first Cicada.

142
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:23,535
She killed him after he took
the meta-human cure.

143
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:27,262
The cure that I made.

144
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:29,346
The cure you made?

145
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:35,227
You're serious.

146
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:39,076
That's the scientific project
you've been working on?

147
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:40,901
At STAR Labs.

148
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:44,983
You never told me your lab was STAR Labs.

149
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:47,743
There's a lot I haven't told you.

150
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:50,259
What is that supposed to mean?

151
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,115
You're Vibe.

152
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:19,853
Look, Kamilla,

153
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:25,264
I've seen firsthand how hard it is
to have two lives like this.

154
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:27,444
And I tried to separate you from that,

155
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,747
but I don't want to keep this
from you anymore.

156
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,693
I can't keep lying to you like this.

157
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:34,740
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:39,039
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:41,845
Cisco, wait.

160
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:45,981
I totally get it.

161
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:48,243
I've read a lot of comic books.

162
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:52,211
I know all the tropes that go
with revealing secret identities.

163
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:54,421
But in real life,

164
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,808
I would never expect you to tell
me something like this right away.

165
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:03,195
You're amazing, you know that?

166
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,895
Cisco, this isn't about me.

167
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:07,004
It's about you.

168
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,823
If being Vibe is a part
of the life you want,

169
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:12,656
I would never get in the way of that.

170
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:18,491
You know you really are a lot like me.

171
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,914
Trusting.

172
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:23,157
And you always blame yourself
when things go wrong.

173
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,436
How do I fix this?

174
00:09:25,516 --> 00:09:27,465
I don't know if you can, Nora.

175
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:32,434
You made a mistake, you know?

176
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:34,865
A big mistake.

177
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,182
Sometimes in life, all we can do
is just live with the consequences.

178
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:44,850
So what you have to ask yourself
is what kind of hero are you gonna be?

179
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:48,745
One who takes a do-over
after every mistake,

180
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:52,511
or one who lives with it
and moves forward?

181
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,612
Nothing?

182
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:14,929
Nope, I still cannot figure out
how to reset his cells back to normal.

183
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:17,207
-He's till Humpty Dumpty'd, huh?
-Yep.

184
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:20,079
He hasn't been this much of a mess
since he first got his powers.

185
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:21,517
Since...

186
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:25,585
And what did you do to help him then?

187
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:27,588
We introduced a stabilizing enzyme...

188
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,098
...that reset his body back to its
original form using vulcanization...

189
00:10:31,178 --> 00:10:32,165
...and muscle memory.

190
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,659
Muscle memory.

191
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:37,018
Well then it appears all
that we need to do is wake him up.

192
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:38,513
How would you suggest we do that?

193
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:39,649
Simple.

194
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,703
We blast him.

195
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,049
We blast him?

196
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:46,932
If you blast him, the vibrational jolt,

197
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:50,016
it will be more than enough
to kick-start his consciousness.

198
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:51,055
I'm sure of it.

199
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:53,710
Can't we just play some Gaga
and hope he wakes up?

200
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,876
Gaga is not the solution to everything.

201
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,187
You have to blast him.
Allez, young Ralph Macchio, please.

202
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,051
Be careful. This could get a little ugly.

203
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:03,585
Okay.

204
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:05,684
Sorry, deuce.

205
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,639
WrestleMania!

206
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:19,977
Voila!

207
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:20,986
Good as new.

208
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:23,323
Blasted why you happen what?

209
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:25,603
Blasted why you happen what?

210
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:26,924
Except for the language skills.

211
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:29,723
Those will return, probably.

212
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,299
Everybody going, where is?

213
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,606
Everybody going where...every...

214
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:37,606
What is it?

215
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:40,187
It's the wood particles you guys found.
"Swish ash."

216
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:43,147
Part of the flowering ash trees
indigenous to Europe,

217
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:47,738
but also make up our biggest wood
space not 12 miles from Central City.

218
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:48,679
Kolins Woods.

219
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,878
That's where Cicada almost killed me.

220
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,048
That's also one of the largest
wooded parks in the country.

221
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,214
We need a better plan.

222
00:11:53,294 --> 00:11:54,392
I've got one...

223
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,727
...that can stop Cicada and Thawne.

224
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:03,434
Out to sniff?

225
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,042
So really we're using her Cecile?

226
00:12:05,122 --> 00:12:09,341
Well, she is a highly sensitive empath
and Cicada emanates hate.

227
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:13,709
DA Cecile Horton will serve
as our early warning detection system.

228
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:16,426
If we're lucky,
Cicada won't see what's coming.

229
00:12:16,506 --> 00:12:18,619
Then once we find Cicada to entrap her,

230
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:20,833
we give Young Grace the choice
to take the cure.

231
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:22,783
And hopefully,
when she's no longer a meta...

232
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:24,122
That bitch will cease to exist.

233
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,854
That way we can stop her
without destroying the dagger...

234
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:28,516
...and Thawne never goes free.

235
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:30,678
Now all you have to do is help Grace
make the right choice.

236
00:12:30,758 --> 00:12:31,591
What do I say?

237
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:33,374
Whatever's in your heart.

238
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:34,526
She'll listen.

239
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:36,003
What a bunch of sentimental crap.

240
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,969
You two sound like a frigging
Hallmark movie.

241
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,253
I hear you, sister.

242
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,057
I think we're close.

243
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:42,156
You good?

244
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,128
Oh, yeah, jeez, sorry.

245
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,255
This way.

246
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:49,009
Here we go.

247
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:51,582
The Sphere is ready.

248
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,573
We can leave.

249
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:03,375
Guys, we found her.

250
00:13:03,455 --> 00:13:04,453
Get ready.

251
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:14,033
I'm actually glad you found me
before we left.

252
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:16,267
Now I can end your lives twice today.

253
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:17,580
Not on my watch.

254
00:13:25,274 --> 00:13:26,170
We got her.

255
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,273
Nora, you're up.

256
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:30,203
If you can connect to Grace as an adult,
you can connect with her as a child.

257
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:32,083
You just have to tap into her anger.

258
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:34,556
You can do this.

259
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:55,750
You shouldn't have come back here, Nora.

260
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,939
I had to, Grace,

261
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:59,234
because a lot of people
are gonna die unless you help me.

262
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:03,142
If I can help it,
you'll be the first to die.

263
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:09,232
The force field's integrity
just went down to 86 percent.

264
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:12,919
Grace, I know you think your uncle
wanted all metas dead,

265
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,116
but he was a meta.

266
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:17,160
That's why he took the cure
and why he wants you to have it too.

267
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,396
You're a meta, just like your uncle.

268
00:14:19,476 --> 00:14:21,162
No, I'm not! Take it back!

269
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:28,248
Seventy percent... Fifty-two...

270
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:30,739
Don't listen to her, Gracie.

271
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:34,623
This hate, it's consuming you.
Turning you into a monster.

272
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:36,625
And what's worse, you're all alone.

273
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:38,390
Uncle Orlin wouldn't leave me.

274
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,793
He had no choice.

275
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:42,100
Take the cure just like your uncle did.

276
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,654
No!

277
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,865
Forty percent.

278
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:00,574
Nora's gotta convince Grace now.

279
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:03,904
Metas killed your parents, Gracie.

280
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:06,233
They all deserve to die.

281
00:15:06,313 --> 00:15:07,654
Don't believe him, Grace.

282
00:15:07,734 --> 00:15:08,974
This is just in your mind.

283
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:10,168
She's right, Gracie.

284
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:11,743
It's why you created him.

285
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,113
He's the man who took care of you.

286
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:18,737
Nineteen percent.

287
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,497
I know a part of you knows
that this is wrong.

288
00:15:20,577 --> 00:15:23,334
But the other dark part of you
is out there in the real world...

289
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:24,624
...killing innocent people.

290
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,510
You can make a choice to stop it.

291
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:29,152
-How?
-Wake up and take the cure.

292
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,491
-Shut up.
-You can do this, Gracie.

293
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:33,810
Get ready.

294
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:39,759
-Grace.
-Gracie.

295
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,717
-Grace.
-Grace.

296
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:41,796
-Grace.
-Grace.

297
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:42,781
Grace!

298
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,364
Okay, I don't want people to die.

299
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:52,715
I'll take the cure.

300
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,058
Thank you.

301
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:09,436
Here she comes!

302
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:11,782
Okay?

303
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:22,539
<i>Did it work? Guys, what's happening?</i>

304
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:35,778
Joe, no!

305
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:55,598
Now I'll finish what I started.

306
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,710
-It didn't work.
-That shard in her head...

307
00:16:58,753 --> 00:16:59,812
I's still part of the dagger.

308
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:02,280
Its dark energy
is enough to counteract the cure.

309
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,190
If we want to cure Grace,
we must destroy that dagger.

310
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:10,504
No, no, no!

311
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:11,613
No, no, no!

312
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:13,605
Nora!

313
00:17:18,343 --> 00:17:20,861
You took my family away from me, Flash.

314
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:24,780
Now watch me take yours.

315
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,010
No!

316
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,048
<i>Barry!</i>

317
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,746
Just in time.

318
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:47,908
Gentlemen...

319
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:51,137
...I hate to inform you, but...

320
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:54,749
...you're all dead.

321
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:10,051
Thawne...

322
00:19:10,614 --> 00:19:11,821
I...

323
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,280
I can help you.

324
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,902
Isn't this ironic?

325
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:22,246
Time to repent.

326
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:33,096
Consider this...

327
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:35,396
...a parting gift.

328
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:19,595
Just...in...

329
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:25,413
Well, well...

330
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:30,839
It appears as if someone has figured out
how to reverse time.

331
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,739
Clever girl.

332
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,416
We figured out everything.

333
00:20:35,496 --> 00:20:36,507
Oh, really?

334
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,813
What have you figured out?

335
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:41,668
We figured out why you sent Nora back.

336
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:45,370
Why you had her punch DeVoe's satellite.

337
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:47,979
To create a Cicada we could stop.

338
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:49,038
Right?

339
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:51,296
A dagger we could destroy.

340
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:54,983
It was the dagger that was keeping you
in prison all along, wasn't it?

341
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:56,064
That's right.

342
00:20:56,144 --> 00:20:57,543
Fifteen years.

343
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:02,730
The second time I've been stuck somewhere
against my will for 15 years.

344
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,809
Boring.

345
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,742
Except for your visits, of course.

346
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:09,403
You're leaving out
the most delightful part.

347
00:21:10,247 --> 00:21:12,465
How you both helped me escape.

348
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,735
-We helped you?
-That's right.

349
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,036
When you traveled to the Time Vault.
Remember that?

350
00:21:17,116 --> 00:21:20,713
<i>Oh, we need help trying to figure out
how to drain dark energy...</i>

351
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,709
<i>...from the "one who got away."</i>

352
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:23,924
Cicada!

353
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:25,897
<i>Remember that?</i>

354
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,462
When you blurted that out
in the middle of the Time Vault?

355
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:33,824
So that years later, when I ended up
with Cicada's dagger strapped to my chest,

356
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:35,581
I knew exactly what I had to do.

357
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,485
Get Nora Allen to trust me. Easy.

358
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:42,145
Just like when I got you to trust me.

359
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:45,234
And then everything
starts falling into place.

360
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:46,730
Why?

361
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,752
Because I am the only speedster...

362
00:21:49,832 --> 00:21:52,638
...that knows how
to manipulate the timeline...

363
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:55,958
...to get what I want!

364
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:58,640
Orchestrate the changes that I need.

365
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,840
Some of which...

366
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:02,401
...are happening right now.

367
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:04,284
To ensure one thing...

368
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:06,967
That I go...

369
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:08,742
...free.

370
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:11,192
We don't need a dagger to stop you.

371
00:22:11,272 --> 00:22:12,313
Well then...

372
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:17,077
...let's just see
how much your father taught you.

373
00:22:52,494 --> 00:22:54,984
I guess you're not as good a teacher
as I am.

374
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,394
You can't save him, Nora.

375
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,715
No matter what you do,

376
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:04,191
no matter what you try,
the Flash will always vanish.

377
00:23:04,923 --> 00:23:07,278
That is his legacy.

378
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,744
Isn't this nice?

379
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:44,140
Team Flash...

380
00:23:44,593 --> 00:23:46,244
...back together again...

381
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:48,943
...with a new guy.

382
00:23:49,023 --> 00:23:50,085
Ralph Dibny.

383
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,718
Welcome. You should be dead.

384
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,299
Yeah, I guess we have that in common.

385
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:57,675
We'll take care of that in a moment.

386
00:23:57,755 --> 00:24:00,207
Iris, always a pleasure.

387
00:24:00,925 --> 00:24:02,056
Frost...

388
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:05,812
Cisco...

389
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,931
It warms my heart to see you again.

390
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:10,945
I want to apologize for...

391
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:13,495
But had I not done that...

392
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,677
...you never would've had the means
to become extraordinary.

393
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:19,913
I don't need powers for that.

394
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,702
Now!

395
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:10,790
It's not my father's legacy
that's gonna disappear, Thawne.

396
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,304
-It's yours!
-Nora!

397
00:25:14,202 --> 00:25:16,555
So close, Little Runner.

398
00:25:17,356 --> 00:25:19,543
It was never going to work anyway.

399
00:25:22,524 --> 00:25:24,645
-Mom? Dad?
-Nora, no...

400
00:25:25,355 --> 00:25:27,887
-No, no.
-Mom, what's happening?

401
00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:32,120
-A new timeline is setting in.
-What?

402
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,273
A new timeline...

403
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:36,898
...that you created
when you destroyed the dagger!

404
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:39,118
I'm sorry, Little Runner...

405
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,006
...for trading you in like this.

406
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:44,773
But I had to be sure that I could go free.

407
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:49,636
You can still save her, Barry.

408
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,103
There's still time.
You can still save her.

409
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,210
How?

410
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:55,544
The Negative Speed Force.

411
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,127
She has to go there.

412
00:25:57,207 --> 00:26:00,834
It's the only place immune
to timeline changes.

413
00:26:00,914 --> 00:26:02,230
But you have to go now.

414
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:04,738
You have to go, Barry!

415
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,199
Or we lose her forever.

416
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,470
That's right.

417
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,341
I've grown fond of her too.

418
00:26:12,453 --> 00:26:13,562
In many ways.

419
00:26:15,024 --> 00:26:17,458
She's shown me
what it's like to have a daughter.

420
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:22,208
See you in our next crisis.

421
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,920
-I can't do this.
-Yes, you can! Yes, you can!

422
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,868
-You have to, all right?
-No!

423
00:26:50,948 --> 00:26:52,152
Just hold on a little longer.

424
00:26:52,232 --> 00:26:54,564
-No, Dad, I can't!
-Nora!

425
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:56,924
I can't!

426
00:27:00,378 --> 00:27:01,898
-Nora, what are we doing?
-It's too late.

427
00:27:01,978 --> 00:27:03,079
No, it's not. We gotta go back.

428
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:03,916
Dad, no.

429
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,264
-Barry, you have to take her back.
-I know, I know.

430
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:07,272
-Mom, Mom.
-You have to go back.

431
00:27:07,352 --> 00:27:08,897
-Nora, you have to go back now.
-Mom.

432
00:27:08,977 --> 00:27:10,017
No!

433
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:11,536
Look...

434
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:14,204
If I go back in...

435
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,308
...the Negative Speed Force
will be a part of me forever.

436
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:18,492
No, we'll get it out of you, Nora.

437
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:19,907
We can get it out, we can save you.

438
00:27:19,987 --> 00:27:21,884
-Please, I promise.
-Mom, you can't.

439
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,639
Mom, you can't.

440
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:26,869
None of you can.

441
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:29,526
It's making me like Thawne.

442
00:27:30,826 --> 00:27:32,625
Full of anger and hate.

443
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:34,591
I don't want that to be my legacy.

444
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,516
-This is all on me.
-No.

445
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:37,920
All of it.

446
00:27:38,546 --> 00:27:39,496
My mistake.

447
00:27:39,918 --> 00:27:41,346
And I'm not gonna make another one.

448
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:46,033
Sometimes all you can do
is live with the consequences.

449
00:27:47,952 --> 00:27:48,912
Nora...

450
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:51,952
Oh, my God.

451
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:53,670
It's okay.

452
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,240
<i>It's okay.</i>

453
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:57,524
It's okay.

454
00:27:59,956 --> 00:28:00,943
We love you.

455
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,539
Thank you for everything.

456
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:13,403
No... No, God...

457
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:16,826
No.

458
00:28:35,438 --> 00:28:36,558
We're so sorry.

459
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:44,169
We have to believe
that we'll see her again.

460
00:28:46,013 --> 00:28:47,013
We will.

461
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:53,608
Nora...

462
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:56,184
...made sure
that we didn't lose everything tonight.

463
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:58,418
She saved every meta in the city.

464
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:00,483
And she gave Grace a new future.

465
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:02,086
Gave all of us, right?

466
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,962
Especially me.
Without Nora, I never would've met...

467
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,873
...the love of my life, Renee.

468
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:09,053
And you wouldn't
have stopped your 38th Cicada.

469
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:11,697
Or your 39th.

470
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Right.

471
00:29:15,517 --> 00:29:16,645
It's been quite a journey.

472
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:20,701
Pleasure.

473
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:23,258
An honor, Flash.

474
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:25,533
We never could've solved
this mystery without you.

475
00:29:26,274 --> 00:29:27,435
Well, don't be too sure.

476
00:29:28,522 --> 00:29:31,215
You already have a master detective
in your midst.

477
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:34,676
Congratulations, Adult Giraffe.

478
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:41,187
Well done, Sherloque.

479
00:29:41,996 --> 00:29:42,956
Sherlock.

480
00:29:46,623 --> 00:29:47,733
Well, all right then.

481
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:48,893
Without further ado.

482
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:55,967
<i>Mes amis.</i>

483
00:29:57,608 --> 00:29:58,648
Good luck, Team Flash.

484
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:09,317
-It's Singh.
-Yeah, he...

485
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:11,038
He wants us to meet him at CCPD...

486
00:30:11,914 --> 00:30:12,794
...and bring Barry.

487
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:16,778
Yeah, go.

488
00:30:17,373 --> 00:30:18,539
I kinda wanna be alone anyway.

489
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:06,618
Is everything okay?

490
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:11,739
What Thawne said...

491
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:15,642
I don't want that.

492
00:31:17,295 --> 00:31:19,773
I don't want the extraordinary thing...

493
00:31:19,853 --> 00:31:22,721
...about my life to be my powers.

494
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:25,016
No one feels that way.

495
00:31:25,857 --> 00:31:26,712
<i>Here's the thing.</i>

496
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:28,884
I do.

497
00:31:36,205 --> 00:31:37,881
All these years I thought that...

498
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,333
...Vibe...

499
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:42,857
...was the person I was supposed to be.

500
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,960
I think it's time Cisco
finally got his turn.

501
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:52,013
So what does that mean?

502
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:01,057
It means I want to take the cure.

503
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,464
-If you do this...
-There's no going back.

504
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,240
I know.

505
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,479
Killer Frost and I
are really gonna miss Vibe.

506
00:32:36,052 --> 00:32:36,885
Me too.

507
00:33:01,864 --> 00:33:02,697
How do you feel?

508
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:06,734
Scared.

509
00:33:10,475 --> 00:33:11,395
But I'm hopeful.

510
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,349
Before I forget...

511
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,499
...I left you something in the workshop.

512
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:22,728
Just, you know...

513
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,482
...my way of saying...

514
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,102
...thank you.

515
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:27,888
For what?

516
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:29,602
Being a great friend.

517
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:53,015
Well, Grace Gibbons is currently scheduled
to meet with our county counselor.

518
00:33:53,095 --> 00:33:55,855
And as soon as possible, we'll get her in
with a good foster family.

519
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:58,461
Look, I won't keep you long,

520
00:33:58,541 --> 00:34:01,549
but I just wanted to thank you
for being at the forefront with Cicada.

521
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,061
Just doing our job, sir.

522
00:34:03,486 --> 00:34:06,661
Well, you went way beyond
"just doing your job".

523
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:10,498
And I know you did it because of how much
you care for the people of this city...

524
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:14,349
...which is how I know I can leave it
in your capable hands.

525
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:16,457
What do you mean, leave it?

526
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:18,492
The mayor's offered me the job...

527
00:34:19,716 --> 00:34:20,854
...as the new chief of police.

528
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:23,469
What?

529
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,800
-Dave.
-David.

530
00:34:24,868 --> 00:34:26,576
-Congratulations.
-That's great.

531
00:34:26,656 --> 00:34:27,696
Thank you, thanks.

532
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:31,630
Of course that leaves me responsible
for finding my own replacement.

533
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:33,285
And...

534
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,482
...I would like that to be you, Joe.

535
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:38,640
Re...

536
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:39,804
Replace you?

537
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:42,486
As... As captain?

538
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:44,306
Captain Joe West.

539
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,933
Oh, I like the sound of that.

540
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:47,541
And don't worry.

541
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:50,117
If things get dicey,
as they tend to around here,

542
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,440
you'll have plenty of help.

543
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:54,143
Isn't that right, Flash?

544
00:34:56,576 --> 00:34:58,300
-No, I'm not...
-Oh come on, Barry.

545
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,133
I'm a detective too.

546
00:35:02,093 --> 00:35:02,926
Sir.

547
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:10,094
-Congratulations.
-I'll do my best.

548
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:22,602
Hey.

549
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:36,826
Now I know what my dad meant
when he said...

550
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:38,319
...being a parent
is like wearing your heart...

551
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:39,695
...on the outside of your body.

552
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:41,591
Yeah.

553
00:35:43,594 --> 00:35:44,474
Thawne got away.

554
00:35:45,548 --> 00:35:46,468
Again.

555
00:35:47,952 --> 00:35:48,845
Nora's...

556
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:50,632
...gone.

557
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,420
Should feel like a loss but...

558
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:57,965
...I also...

559
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,129
-...feel...
-Pride?

560
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,050
Pride, yeah.

561
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:06,297
She did good.

562
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:09,747
Yeah.

563
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,272
She was the best of both of us.

564
00:36:15,558 --> 00:36:17,647
She was my legacy all along.

565
00:36:19,252 --> 00:36:20,085
And us...

566
00:36:20,753 --> 00:36:21,587
...together...

567
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,486
...as a family,
that's how I want to be remembered.

568
00:36:25,957 --> 00:36:26,858
As a good man...

569
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:29,892
...a loving husband...

570
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:34,060
...and a supportive father.

571
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:37,662
You're already all of those things.

572
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,153
Nora felt that way too.

573
00:36:55,264 --> 00:36:56,344
<i>Time language.</i>

574
00:36:57,835 --> 00:36:59,835
No matter what changes
with the timeline...

575
00:37:01,492 --> 00:37:02,732
...that'll never change.

576
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:04,864
<i>I know.</i>

577
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,310
<i>We'll always have this to remember her.</i>

578
00:37:28,785 --> 00:37:29,714
Hi, Mom and Dad.

579
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:34,084
If you're watching this,
it means that something went wrong.

580
00:37:35,459 --> 00:37:36,660
But I don't want you guys to be sad.

581
00:37:37,863 --> 00:37:38,743
<i>I'm not.</i>

582
00:37:39,914 --> 00:37:42,272
I always wanted to be a hero...

583
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,920
...to use my extraordinary abilities
to help people.

584
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:47,825
That's why I came here...

585
00:37:48,363 --> 00:37:49,455
...to meet my family...

586
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:50,921
...stop Cicada...

587
00:37:51,462 --> 00:37:53,106
...help fix the Flash's legacy...

588
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:56,198
...and save him from disappearing
in the future.

589
00:37:57,845 --> 00:38:00,479
I believed I could do the impossible...

590
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:03,753
...but I never imagined
it would turn out like this.

591
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:06,543
I'm glad it did.

592
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:11,660
I wouldn't change anything
about my time with you...

593
00:38:12,611 --> 00:38:14,565
...my sweet parents...

594
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:18,061
...the most important people to me
in the world.

595
00:38:21,204 --> 00:38:24,764
<i>I wish I could be there to celebrate
every new chapter...</i>

596
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,780
<i>...to witness every success.</i>

597
00:38:33,322 --> 00:38:34,266
<i>Just know...</i>

598
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,949
<i>...that no matter where I go in my life...</i>

599
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,840
<i>...you'll always be my side.</i>

600
00:38:46,697 --> 00:38:47,675
<i>Because of you...</i>

601
00:38:48,387 --> 00:38:51,395
<i>...I know I will never, ever,
truly be alone...</i>

602
00:38:54,143 --> 00:38:58,183
<i>...and I will feel your love
and support like a warm hug...</i>

603
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:00,231
<i>...comforting me...</i>

604
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,792
<i>...wishing me to be the best person
I can be.</i>

605
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:10,136
Thank you for everything.

606
00:39:12,061 --> 00:39:13,532
For making me a hero...

607
00:39:15,557 --> 00:39:17,997
...and for loving me
even if I wasn't perfect.

608
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:21,597
Please remember that I love you both...

609
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:23,797
...and I always will...

610
00:39:25,107 --> 00:39:26,867
...no matter what the future brings.
