My initial approach was far too narrow.

283
00:27:14,628 --> 00:27:17,096
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville Prison...

284
00:27:17,264 --> 00:27:20,665
he suggested I widen my gaze
and, at minimum, I have done just that.

In fact, I may well have reconciled
thousands of years of theological disparity.

But that's for another time.

287
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:32,839
Blackwood's method is based on
a ritualistic mystical system...

288
00:27:33,013 --> 00:27:36,312
that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.

To fully understand the system,
to get inside it...

00:27:39,753 --> 00:27:43,280
I reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt...

with a few enhancements of my own.

My journey took me somewhat further down
the rabbit hole than I had intended...

293
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:55,025
and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail,
I have emerged enlightened.

and the head of a man.

300
00:28:14,688 --> 00:28:17,623
In Sir Thomas's secret chamber,
I found the bone of an ox...

are coded references to this system.

308

Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood has killed 3 men...

309
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:47,042
each committed at a location
that has a connection with the temple...

310
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:48,586
therefore the system.

Reordan, the ginger midget,

We found his body here.

more elaborate preparations...

You had it broken before your burial,

Very clever of Reordan
to find a paralytic...

that was activated by the combination
of copper and water...

515
00:46:30,182 --> 00:46:33,515
and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

The death of Standish
was a real mystery...

until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

520
00:46:52,438 --> 00:46:54,872
An odorless, tasteless flammable liquid...

yet it burned
with an unusual pinkish hue.

Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

Ingenious.
