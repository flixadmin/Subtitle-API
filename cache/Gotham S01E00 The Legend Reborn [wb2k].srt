1
00:00:02,458 --> 00:00:04,759
Listen, kid.
You seem like a nice guy,

2
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:06,894
but this is not a city
or a job for nice guys.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,299
"Gotham's" a show very much
about the origin stories

4
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:14,335
of some of the great super
villains of the DC mythology.

5
00:00:14,403 --> 00:00:16,471
So you see a young Catwoman,

6
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,005
you see a young Poison Ivy,

7
00:00:18,073 --> 00:00:21,043
a young Penguin, Riddler,
possibly the Joker.

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,145
You see all of these legendary characters,

9
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:25,945
but you're seeing them
at a point in their lives

10
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:28,229
which has not really been explored before.

11
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:29,564
Part of this fun is that

12
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:30,565
we don't want to just
regurgitate a comic book.

13
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:31,999
We need to elevate it.

14
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,435
We need to make it something
it's never been before

15
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:36,137
while still staying true to the DNA.

16
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:37,738
It really pays due homage

17
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:40,641
to everything anyone knows
about Gotham in the past

18
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,243
and gets crazier and crazier.

19
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:50,712

20
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:52,857
The idea for this show

21
00:00:52,924 --> 00:00:57,008
came from trying to find a fresh
way into the D.C. mythology,

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,158
and it seemed like the perfect place

23
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,126
to start was the city of Gotham.

24
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,929
What the show looks at
is why a town like that

25
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,697
will eventually need a
vigilante to help them.

26
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:08,366
What makes a town so crazy,

27
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:10,634
what makes a town so out of control

28
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:12,971
that villains begin to wear costumes?

29
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:15,606
The basic premise of the
series is a "what if?" Really.

30
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:19,477
It's what if James Gordon
was the rookie detective

31
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:23,014
that investigated the death
of Bruce Wayne's parents?

32
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:26,250
And once you make that connection

33
00:01:26,318 --> 00:01:28,152
between those two iconic characters,

34
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,153
the story kind of rolls on from there.

35
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:31,888
So, you meet this young detective

36
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:34,157
who is out to uncover
corruption and do the right thing

37
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:35,459
in a city that doesn't

38
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:37,094
necessarily want you to do the right thing

39
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:38,528
or need you to do the right thing.

40
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:39,997
When we start the series,

41
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:42,232
James is more or less
straight out of the military.

42
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,502
Has not been in Gotham in a decade or more.

43
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:47,004
He left when he was a kid.

44
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:49,239
He's a little bit of a fish out of water.

45
00:01:49,307 --> 00:01:51,841
He doesn't exactly know
what's going on in Gotham,

46
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,176
and he's figuring it out moment to moment.

47
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:56,578
Everybody down!

48
00:01:58,415 --> 00:02:00,949
Hold your fire! I got this!

49
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:03,952
He'll make mistakes, he'll
trust the wrong people,

50
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:06,088
follow his heart, and at times

51
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:09,225
that will lead him into
dangerous situations.

52
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:12,861
As an actor, that's a very
relatable place to start.

53
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:15,697
Ben McKenzie is perfect
for the role of Gordon

54
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:19,167
because he has a kind of
natural integrity and strength...

55
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:21,069
an old-fashioned set of values

56
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:23,705
that really shines through his performance.

57
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:25,607
Sir, look at me.

58
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:26,975
Not at them, look at me.

59
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:28,944
My name's Jim.

60
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:30,178
Jim Gordon.

61
00:02:30,246 --> 00:02:32,881
This is one of the iconic figures

62
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:35,316
in comic-book law enforcement.

63
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:39,119
It's daunting to play
him, to be honest with you.

64
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:40,621
It's a little bit scary.

65
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:43,057
And yet it's thrilling.

66
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:46,427
In this telling of the Gotham story,

67
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:48,362
James Gordon is partnered
with Harvey bullock.

68
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,364
Harvey bullock's
a detective in the comics.

69
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:52,066
He's never been realized in live action,

70
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:54,201
and donal logue is the first
person to ever play him,

71
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:55,937
and he's absolutely perfect for the role.

72
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:57,371
What the hell are you doing?

73
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,672
We had the drop on him.

74
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,207
Yeah, well, he's dropped, isn't he?

75
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,242
You could've gotten hurt. Rookie mistake.

76
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,244
Somebody takes a cop's gun, you shoot him.

77
00:03:04,312 --> 00:03:05,779
That's basic.

78
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:09,483
He's been around Gotham for
just years and years and years,

79
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:11,685
and so, in order to survive in this city

80
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:14,921
he's had to kind of develop
his own brand of morality.

81
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:15,789
Hey!

82
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:17,857
Huh?

83
00:03:17,925 --> 00:03:18,525
How you doing?

84
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:24,163
James' relationship with
Harvey bullock is very complex.

85
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:28,468
Harvey's been whittled down to
expect very little of the city.

86
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:31,170
The case is closed. Forget about it.

87
00:03:31,238 --> 00:03:32,871
Even if the real killers
are still out there?

88
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:34,640
Yes.

89
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,009
This is very perilous
stuff you're messing with.

90
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:40,213
He's introducing Gordon to Gotham,

91
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,016
and Gotham is nothing like
Gordon's ever seen before.

92
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:45,750
When I started work on the show

93
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:47,952
and started digging into the origin stories

94
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,254
of these great villains,

95
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:51,156
one of the things I realized was

96
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:54,392
there really is not a lot
known about the early history.

97
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,861
We've never really seen
where the penguin comes from

98
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,330
or why he does what he does,

99
00:03:58,397 --> 00:04:00,132
or the Riddler, or even Catwoman.

100
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,933
Who were the super villains in this city

101
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,335
and how did they become that way?

102
00:04:03,402 --> 00:04:04,836
Maybe they were just like me and you.

103
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:06,871
Why on earth would that real person

104
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:08,706
turn into this crazy psychopath?

105
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,175
These quintessential characters

106
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:12,543
that we've all grown up with,

107
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:14,178
you finally get to see and understand

108
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:16,247
how they ended up where they ended up.

109
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:18,182
Anyone ever tell you when you walk,

110
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,883
you look just like a penguin?

111
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:21,418
No. Nobody's ever told me that.

112
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:25,289
I love origin stories.
I love origin stories.

113
00:04:25,357 --> 00:04:29,059
Being able to see how
these wonderful characters

114
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,961
that we've all grown up with started

115
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:34,197
is so interesting and so much fun.

116
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:34,797
Boy?

117
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:37,267
Sorry.

118
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:39,869
<i>If you let this hair
go frizzy, you will be.</i>

119
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:41,604
The great thing about
Jada Pinkett's character,

120
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:42,972
Fish Mooney,

121
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,840
is that it's created
completely for this show.

122
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:46,676
It's a brand-new character.

123
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:49,045
Fish Mooney is an up and comer

124
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:52,181
in the criminal world of Gotham,

125
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:55,685
and she has a mind to take over Gotham,

126
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:57,787
<i>so we'll see how that goes.</i>

127
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:01,891
There used to be some discipline.

128
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,493
Falcone is getting old and soft.

129
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:06,395
It's time.

130
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:08,898
<i>Somebody has to take over.
It might as well be me.</i>

131
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:12,568
She has a kind of ferocity
that's natural to her...

132
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:16,872
a sharpness and an intelligence
and a way of looking at people

133
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,675
that is both seductive and devouring.

134
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:22,077
You don't get a lot of opportunity

135
00:05:22,144 --> 00:05:25,013
to have a playground for your shadow.

136
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:27,949
That is what makes this character so fun.

137
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:29,117
Harvey.

138
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:30,118
Fish.

139
00:05:30,186 --> 00:05:32,087
Jada Pinkett Smith is creating

140
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:33,422
a brand-new character

141
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:35,457
in this beautifully nuanced

142
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:38,059
and complicated and sexy and dark way.

143
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,294
Who's the friend?

144
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:40,962
Detective James Gordon, ma'am.

145
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,530
Hmm.

146
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:44,766
Well, aren't you a cool glass of milk?

147
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:47,635
The first time that
fish meets James Gordon,

148
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:49,704
she knows right away he's a problem,

149
00:05:49,772 --> 00:05:52,774
and so there's this
very interesting tension

150
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:54,408
between the two of them.

151
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:57,045
You have a little danger in your eye.

152
00:05:57,113 --> 00:05:59,114
I wonder what you plan to do with that.

153
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,548
You'll have to wait and see.

154
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:02,250
I hate surprises.

155
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:05,787
From episode to episode,

156
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:07,288
we'll be introducing characters

157
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:09,356
that are sort of legends in this universe,

158
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:11,258
so you really have to tune in each week

159
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:12,926
to watch who's gonna show up next.

160
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,361
We might meet a character

161
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:16,396
who we think is the nicest
character in the world,

162
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:18,331
and they turn out to be the worst villain

163
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,900
in all of Gotham city or vice versa.

164
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,368
You know, we might meet somebody

165
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:22,970
that's completely corrupted,
and by the end of this,

166
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:24,471
but they're one of the most heroic people,

167
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:25,639
and you can never tell in Gotham.

168
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:27,040
It changes people.

169
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:38,005
The acting was fine,
the music was lovely.

170
00:06:38,073 --> 00:06:39,807
I agree with that. It was kinda lame.

171
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,576
There's no such word as "kinda."
It was totally lame.

172
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:45,346
- You two are so judgment...
- Give me your money!

173
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:46,747
Stay calm, Bruce.

174
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:55,956
I think one of the things

175
00:06:56,023 --> 00:06:57,691
that's interesting about "Gotham"

176
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,293
is you're taking the same
scene that you've seen before

177
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:02,996
that starts off the movies
with the murder of the waynes,

178
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:06,165
but instead of jumping forward
to when Bruce is now a man,

179
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,434
and he takes on the cape and the mask,

180
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:10,402
instead, you stay in the present.

181
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,771
It begins with the
murder of Bruce Wayne's parents,

182
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,373
finding these bodies in an alley,

183
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,441
and then saying, "where
do we go from here?"

184
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,277
The ramifications are deep and wide.

185
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:20,512
It's interesting
to watch a young Bruce

186
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,647
and a young Jim Gordon connect so early on.

187
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:24,884
It's something we've
never really seen before,

188
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:26,952
and that will be explored in "Gotham."

189
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,554
I promise you, I will
find the man who did this.

190
00:07:29,622 --> 00:07:31,590
He's also making a promise to himself.

191
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:33,492
"I will navigate my way through this

192
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,794
and I will do it honorably
and with dignity."

193
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:38,129
I think audiences always seem to gravitate

194
00:07:38,197 --> 00:07:40,532
towards characters with
incredible integrity.

195
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,269
One of the most interesting
things about James Gordon

196
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:47,672
is really in his
relationship with Bruce Wayne.

197
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,308
The cool thing about the show
is it's all the psychology

198
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:52,143
that goes on behind Bruce Wayne's mind

199
00:07:52,211 --> 00:07:53,845
to become this awesome character,

200
00:07:53,913 --> 00:07:56,647
to become this vigilante
that fights crime for Gotham.

201
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:58,482
Why were you up on the roof?

202
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,951
I'm learning to conquer fear.

203
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:01,585
Fear doesn't need conquering.

204
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:02,954
Fear tells you where the edge is.

205
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:04,488
Fear is a good thing.

206
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:06,124
And you think I haven't
told him that, do you?

207
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:09,860
Bruce Wayne's relationship
with Alfred is very unique.

208
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:11,829
Even though Alfred is his subordinate,

209
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:15,499
he has to help guide him
into manhood carefully

210
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,001
because he does work for him,

211
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,003
and not only that, but he
has such respect for him.

212
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:22,940
It's really a story of a young boy

213
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,542
willing himself to become a superhero.

214
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:26,676
How does he do that?

215
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:28,545
He's not really sure why he's doing that,

216
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:29,980
but he is compelled to do it.

217
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:32,416
I'm going to find out who
killed your parents, and why.

218
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:34,084
I'm glad he's still alive.

219
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:35,552
I want to see him again.

220
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:38,188
When we begin the series,
Gotham city is struggling.

221
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,057
It's in the midst of a crime wave.

222
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:41,524
It's battling corruption.

223
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:44,694
The Waynes were very important
people in Gotham city,

224
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:46,895
so their death creates a power vacuum

225
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:48,931
that is filled by various people

226
00:08:48,999 --> 00:08:52,435
with rather less philanthropic
notions of how to run Gotham.

227
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:54,203
With the murder of the Waynes,

228
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,737
they were like the mama, papa bear

229
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:57,039
that kept everything together,

230
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:58,975
and now Gotham is in danger

231
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:02,478
of falling into this abyss
of pure chaotic anarchy.

232
00:09:02,545 --> 00:09:04,880
Citizens of Gotham, we will not,

233
00:09:04,948 --> 00:09:07,649
we cannot let these
killers and these robbers

234
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:09,918
and these rapists and these thugs win.

235
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:11,152
Not on my watch.

236
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,855
There's a lot of tension throughout Gotham.

237
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:16,224
You've got tension between the
Falcone family and the maronis.

238
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:19,060
You got tension between
fish Mooney and the cops.

239
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:21,763
You've got tension between
the Major Crimes Unit

240
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:24,232
and the Homicide Division
in the Gotham P.D.

241
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,634
Well, well, well,

242
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:28,604
if it isn't Montoya and
Allen, Major Crimes Unit.

243
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:29,705
Any leads?

244
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:31,338
Just getting started.

245
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:32,573
I'll be straight.

246
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:34,375
You want us to take it off your hands?

247
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:36,544
Come on, bullock. You know
you're scared of this case.

248
00:09:36,612 --> 00:09:38,546
There's tension kind of all across the city

249
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:40,515
and between every
character that's involved.

250
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:42,650
Gotham is on a knife edge.

251
00:09:42,718 --> 00:09:45,152
What do you suppose bringing down city hall

252
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,955
and the police force will
do, even if you could?

253
00:09:48,023 --> 00:09:50,758
The Falcone crime family runs the city.

254
00:09:50,826 --> 00:09:52,894
They have relationships with everyone

255
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:55,329
from law enforcement to the judicial branch

256
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:57,765
to the mayor's office and all the way down.

257
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,901
It's a world in which
everyone is on the take,

258
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:04,871
and the only man who can kind
of break that downward spiral

259
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,941
is the last good man
in Gotham, James Gordon.

260
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,677
I made a promise to Bruce
Wayne, and I can't deliver.

261
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:12,712
But you will. Maybe I'm out of my depth.

262
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,349
Hey.

263
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:18,352
I very much doubt you're out of your depth.

264
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,421
James and Barbara have a natural

265
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:22,989
sort of emotional and sexual chemistry.

266
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:26,459
Seemingly everything is
going very, very well.

267
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,661
She's a beautiful woman
with a lot of means.

268
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,229
Her father is very wealthy.

269
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,798
He's one of the members
of Gotham high society.

270
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,934
But Barbara's hiding things from James,

271
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,869
including secrets about her past.

272
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:40,039
James Gordon is not a good
guy. You deserve better.

273
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:43,242
James Gordon is the most
honest man I've ever met.

274
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,010
You sure you know what he's capable of?

275
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,379
Yes, thank you. I know him.

276
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:49,882
Does he know you like I know you?

277
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,385
Their relationship gets
compromised very quickly

278
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:54,987
when Renee Montoya accuses
James of being corrupt

279
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,122
and creates a rift in their relationship

280
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,592
that will only widen as
the series goes forward.

281
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,627
B., I know when you're lying.

282
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,195
Gotham is a corrupt place.

283
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,664
It's a place where you can't trust anyone.

284
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,032
You can't trust the mayor,

285
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,801
you can't trust the police force.

286
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,669
Gotham law enforcement

287
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:14,073
is pretty much under the thumb
of the underworld right now,

288
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:19,010
<i>which is basically run by
Falcone at this point in time.</i>

289
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,280
That might change. I'm working hard at it.

290
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,416
There is a split in the underworld

291
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:27,952
between the Maroni family
and the Falcone family,

292
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,555
so a character like Penguin, for instance,

293
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,791
is able to come in and play
both sides against each other.

294
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,494
Why snitch on your own boss?

295
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,648
I confess that...

296
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:40,328
that poor orphan boy pricked my conscience.

297
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:42,054
I've done my civic duty.

298
00:11:42,122 --> 00:11:44,422
Good day to you both.

299
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,193
Oswald starts off as a
grunt for Fish Mooney,

300
00:11:48,261 --> 00:11:51,796
and when Bruce Wayne's
parents are murdered,

301
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:55,733
he sees that as an
opportunity to make his move,

302
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:59,337
to finally become someone
of power and of status.

303
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:01,806
He's learned to play good people

304
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:04,643
off of bad people off of good people.

305
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,843
It's fascinating.

306
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:08,379
It was Gilzean. He's the snitch.

307
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:11,182
No.

308
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:13,584
Gilzean is loyal.
So am I.

309
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:16,520
I would open a vein right here
and now if you asked me to.

310
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:18,556
Go on, then.

311
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:20,157
Open one.

312
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:22,959
I think Robin Lord Taylor's
portrayal of Penguin

313
00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:27,198
is going to be a real revelation to people
because what he's doing is not

314
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:30,267
just playing sort of a
villainous, evil mastermind,

315
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,102
but he's sort of sympathetic.

316
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,637
He's sort of likeable in his sad, pathetic,

317
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:36,006
sort of henchman way.

318
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:38,775
Falcone is losing his grip,
and his rivals are hungry.

319
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,577
I-I can see it coming.

320
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:43,213
I'm clever that way, and I can help you.

321
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,614
Shut up!

322
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:46,549
I think that these characters

323
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:49,219
explore different aspects of humanity.

324
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:51,287
You have the Gordon character

325
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:54,357
who is, you know, I
call him the white night.

326
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:55,992
And then you have Bullock,

327
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,095
who's kind of walking that line,

328
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:01,163
that gray area of what is
right and what is wrong.

329
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:05,435
And then you just have your just
straight out psychotic villains

330
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:07,203
like myself and Penguin.

331
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:18,949
Gotham in this series is more vibrant

332
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:22,119
and crowded and archaic
than people will be expecting

333
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:24,755
if they're used to the
Gotham of the movies.

334
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:27,423
We talked about a city out of control,

335
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,526
and our fantasy of 1970s New York

336
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:31,961
in the films of Sidney
Lumet and William Friedkin...

337
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:34,997
graffiti everywhere, cops
everywhere, corruption.

338
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,900
New York in the '70s just
kept getting worse and worse

339
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:39,369
and crazier and crazier.

340
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:41,971
That's the Gotham that
we're looking at today.

341
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,939
We're not saying that the show

342
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,575
takes place at any particular time.

343
00:13:45,643 --> 00:13:47,777
We're trying to make it sort
of a little bit timeless.

344
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:49,311
You sort of see these cars,

345
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,513
and you imagine a chase
scene from "Bullitt"

346
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,049
or from "French connection."

347
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:55,051
And yet, at the same
time, it's present day.

348
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:56,552
You know, there are cellphones.

349
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:58,888
It's of our world, but
it's still beyond our world.

350
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:01,724
The audience has
an image of Gotham already,

351
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,759
so we want to make them feel at home,

352
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:06,028
but we also want to take a fresh approach.

353
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,396
We do a lot of research.

354
00:14:07,463 --> 00:14:08,863
We look at the comic books,

355
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,299
we look at films together.

356
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:11,567
Things like "Blade Runner,"

357
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,202
some of the classic film noir stuff,

358
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,737
just because they're beautifully
designed and they're dark.

359
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:17,972
And out of that come my sketches,

360
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,140
my models,

361
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:21,176
and eventually my working drawings

362
00:14:21,244 --> 00:14:24,279
that get developed into
actual sets or locations

363
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:25,413
that we choose

364
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,748
because they fit within the framework

365
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:30,284
of that world that
we're now, at that point,

366
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:31,952
describing to each other.

367
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,388
I think what I'm most
excited for viewers to see

368
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,823
is the police precinct set.

369
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,225
It's very rich and layered,

370
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,159
and I think that's a very exciting set.

371
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:40,894
It's sometimes a long road

372
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:43,431
from initial conception to completion.

373
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:45,932
That happened today with our main set...

374
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:47,267
the precinct set.

375
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,969
We started on that about 10 weeks ago,

376
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:52,471
and here today, the lights come on

377
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:55,374
and the smoke rolls in and it looks great.

378
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:58,076
The biggest challenge is
really the amount of work to do

379
00:14:58,144 --> 00:14:59,345
in the time we're given.

380
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:00,579
It's a two-story set.

381
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:02,281
There's a lot of rigging involved

382
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:03,815
when you get above one story,

383
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:06,084
so there's a little more
engineering going on.

384
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:07,786
We're also shooting on rooftops.

385
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:11,022
That is a certain amount of
engineering and safety involved,

386
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,323
as well as the look.

387
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:15,159
Gotham, to a degree, really is New York,

388
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:18,796
and New York is Gotham, so
we had to shoot in New York.

389
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:20,331
And the energy of the city,

390
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,533
I think it's feeding into the production.

391
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:24,769
I think it's feeding into our show.

392
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:26,638
The scenes play out very gritty

393
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:28,439
and very real on the rooftops.

394
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:29,907
Stop!

395
00:15:29,975 --> 00:15:32,509
I can't imagine shooting
the show anywhere else.

396
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:34,645
The vibrancy of New York City street life

397
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:36,313
infuses everything that we do,

398
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:39,082
and you really feel it when
you're out on the streets.

399
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,786
I think the alley fight is gonna
be one of my favorites on this.

400
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:43,787
Ben did a great job.

401
00:15:43,854 --> 00:15:45,322
He picks things up really quick.

402
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,856
He's a great athlete,

403
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:49,092
and I'm just looking forward
to seeing the final product.

404
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,560
Now, it may be 20 degrees

405
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:52,462
and it may be raining and sleeting,

406
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,165
and wind may be almost
literally knocking you over,

407
00:15:55,232 --> 00:15:57,267
but that's the kind
of in-your-face world

408
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:58,768
that we're portraying onscreen,

409
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:00,937
so we want to take
advantage of New York City

410
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:02,438
and everything it has to offer,

411
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:03,773
and then we want to enjoy

412
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,809
being inside a
temperature-controlled studio,

413
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:07,210
as well.

414
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,947
Danny Cannon loves to
shoot as much as possible,

415
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:12,648
as we call it, in camera.

416
00:16:12,716 --> 00:16:14,884
It's for real, so visual effects

417
00:16:14,952 --> 00:16:18,053
we're using to extend
the world that we create.

418
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:20,055
Visual effects should
always be invisible.

419
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:21,457
Emotionally, they take a lot away

420
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:23,492
because people know what
they're watching isn't real.

421
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,495
One of the things I insisted on
at the beginning of this project

422
00:16:26,563 --> 00:16:28,331
was to do our own helicopter shoot

423
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:30,399
so that we could create the city of Gotham

424
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:32,435
from something that I shot specifically.

425
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:34,437
Visual effects then really helped me

426
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:35,903
by putting foreground in

427
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:38,640
so it looked like I was
coming in between things.

428
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,875
We don't want it to
look like New York City,

429
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:43,277
so what we're doing is
we're taking those aerials

430
00:16:43,346 --> 00:16:45,980
and we're adding elements to
make it feel like it's Gotham,

431
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,415
so we're adding Gothic spires,

432
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:49,116
some art deco buildings,

433
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:50,618
and we're adding a great
deal of atmosphere to them.

434
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:54,556
The pilot episode opens

435
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:57,624
with a young girl on the rooftop

436
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:00,928
of a building in downtown Gotham.

437
00:17:00,996 --> 00:17:03,764
We built parts of that roof... gargoyles,

438
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:07,668
things that are fantasy...
that probably wouldn't be there.

439
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:10,504
It would be extended by visual effects

440
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,074
to create the rest of Gotham around it.

441
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:15,343
A common misperception among people

442
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,945
is that special effects is visual effects.

443
00:17:18,013 --> 00:17:20,781
Visual effects is anything
you treat visually.

444
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:23,484
Special effects is anything
that's done on set practically.

445
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:27,521
Some of the effects we have
every day are some rain effects,

446
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,357
a lot of smoke and
atmosphere and some gunfire,

447
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,193
some gun squibs, hits, sparks, water.

448
00:17:34,996 --> 00:17:37,097
We actually had a barge on the water

449
00:17:37,164 --> 00:17:39,832
with a little mini bag
to catch the stunt double,

450
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,967
and then now we're gonna be over here

451
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:43,603
doing that underwater scene.

452
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,106
I have to match the
color of the river water,

453
00:17:47,173 --> 00:17:49,776
so I'm getting crystal
clear pool water delivered,

454
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:52,978
and I have to make this clear water murky,

455
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:54,547
<i>but not too murky.</i>

456
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,282
They set up the tank,
we set up our green screen,

457
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:58,703
and it looks great.
We've got some temp versions of it

458
00:17:58,704 --> 00:17:59,785
already, and it worked really well.

459
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:06,038
C.G. and special effects are used
just to help us tell the story.

460
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:07,807
We're shooting in New York,

461
00:18:07,874 --> 00:18:10,609
so we have the beauty
and grandeur of New York

462
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:15,114
as an integral part of the show,
and we just turn that notch up to 11.

463
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:17,783
It doesn't look like
we're just in another city.

464
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:18,984
It feels like Gotham.

465
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:20,652
There's a slight twist to it all.

466
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,287
The reality's, like, heightened.

467
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:23,822
There's a timelessness to it

468
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:26,224
that Bruno and Danny created
that's really magical.

469
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:34,521
The great thing about Gotham

470
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:37,357
is it encompasses so many different worlds.

471
00:18:37,424 --> 00:18:39,526
So the tone is both fun and dark.

472
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:41,093
It's sexy but dangerous.

473
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,695
It's brutal but sensual.

474
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:45,665
It's a world of craziness
and a world of beauty,

475
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:48,168
and the show encapsulates all of that.

476
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:52,272
Gotham has always been a city
with the dial turned up to 11.

477
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,173
Every city's got its dark side.

478
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,474
That's what Gotham is,

479
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,009
and we're gonna explore it

480
00:18:57,077 --> 00:18:59,478
through the eyes of detective Jim Gordon,

481
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:02,648
who becomes a legend in the
Gotham city police department.

482
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:04,583
But this is when he just starts out,

483
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:06,152
before he realizes the nature

484
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:08,654
and the weight of the
adversary he's up against.

485
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:12,892
Watching Gotham just tip
ever so slightly over the edge

486
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:15,894
into absolute chaos will be
a really fascinating journey.

487
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,195
You've killed people before.

488
00:19:17,262 --> 00:19:18,697
That was war.

489
00:19:18,764 --> 00:19:20,331
This is war! We're at war!

490
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:22,633
Sometimes in war, you got to do
a bad thing to do good, right?

491
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:25,269
The series is gonna mix the elements

492
00:19:25,337 --> 00:19:26,738
of a police procedural

493
00:19:26,806 --> 00:19:29,107
with a much more serialized narrative

494
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:31,843
about the creation of
the great DC villains.

495
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:33,611
It's not just about the cops,

496
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,180
it's not just about Jim Gordon,

497
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:36,814
but about the madness that springs

498
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:38,282
from this horrible crime.

499
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,651
People are starting to
lose faith in law and order.

500
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:43,020
Criminals are starting to run the streets.

501
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:45,889
The craziness and the kind
of theatrical projection

502
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:47,891
that villains have in the DC world

503
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,160
are just starting to show their faces.

504
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:53,497
I love the mythology of characters,

505
00:19:53,565 --> 00:19:58,202
and so, to be able to see
how Penguin and the Riddler

506
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:01,171
and all these characters got their start

507
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:03,006
is just really exciting.

508
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:05,442
We're trying to find the balance

509
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:09,312
between the fantastic
world of the comic books

510
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,750
along with the actual real human pathos.

511
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:15,619
However dark and scary the
world might be right now,

512
00:20:15,686 --> 00:20:17,420
there will be light.

513
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:20,323
As you continue to peel back the layers,

514
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:22,559
there's so much mystery there.

515
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:25,194
You can never be sure who's
a friend and who's an enemy.

516
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:27,497
There's romance, there's action,

517
00:20:27,565 --> 00:20:30,267
there's kind of battle
between good and evil.

518
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:31,735
Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

519
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:36,439
It's not a comic-book world. 
It's a mythic world.

520
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:37,774
It's a dramatic world

521
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:40,143
full of adventure and
sex and violence and fun.

522
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,678
How you doing?

523
00:20:41,746 --> 00:20:43,044
I been better.

524
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:46,982
There's a war coming... a terrible war.

525
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:48,550
There... there will be chaos.

526
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:50,653
Rivers of blood in the streets.

527
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,757
