I'd say that's good news.

Closer to Stormfront. Mark her, please.

[Mother's Milk]
It wasn't us. We were cautious.

327

We swapped cars, no toll roads...

[Billy] It's not you.

329
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,896
It's me.
He must've tracked me from Becca's.

[Judy] Billy, what's this all about?

331
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,358
It's complicated.

332
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,569
Becca's not with me.

333
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,489
You couldn't get her out?

334

She didn't want out.

I'll explain everything.

But right now we're in a bit of trouble.

337

I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.

338
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,673
Okay, maybe...

339
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,135
Maybe we can make a run for it,
just get to the car.

Nah, he moves faster than a car.

But if he wants to kill us,

342

This is the fire department.

A natural gas leak has been reported.
Everyone, out of your homes.

I repeat, a gas leak has been reported.

- Oh, mm, yeah, that...

But, you know...

Oh, you look so pretty.

What... What are you doing here?

I'm in town.
I've been texting you for days.

00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:07,452
I wasn't trying to ambush you, I promise.

362
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,538
Did you get any of the Vietnamese crêpes?
Because they're dope.

363
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,540
No, no, no. I'm good, thanks.

364
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,297
[Stormfront] Your mom was telling me about

365

the hero pageants you used to do.

366
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,635
Lucky.

367
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:25,845
My mom would never let me.

368
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,056
Adele did not go in
for that sort of thing.

369
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,518
I had to do all my speeches
to a brush in the mirror.

Mom, this isn't a great time.

I know you're busy,

373

but you don't have to entertain me,
I promise.

374
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:42,946
I wanted to see you, sweetheart. I...

I miss you.

00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,117
Uh...

377
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,543
I think that this is something
that we need to discuss in private.

- [Stormfront] Donna, can I tell her?
- Tell me what?

379

Look, your mom is so sorry
about the Compound V.

380
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,800
And she understands

381
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:07,428
that keeping that a secret
really hurt your relationship.

382
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:10,890
And I used you as a trophy
to make myself feel important.

383
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,267
I know that now.

384
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,395
Why are you talking to a stranger
about our relationship?

385
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,647
She's not a stranger. She's your teammate.

386
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,154
Annie, look, the whole world
knows about Compound V.

387
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:28,783
I mean, lots of parents did what I did.

388
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:30,868
I...

389
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,496
I'm hoping that you'll...

390
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,331
That you'll forgive me.

391
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,541
Please, forgive me.

392

This is not the time
or the place for this.

Look, everyone is upset about Compound V.

394
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:47,844
I mean, someone was so upset,
they leaked it to the press.

395
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:51,889
Can you imagine how angry
that person is, whoever they are?

396
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,811
I'll let you two hash it out,

397
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:02,483
but I just think, if it was me,
I'd be grateful to have a mom like Donna.

Honey, please.

The connection is immediate,
all-consuming.

A sweet Sapphic love blossoms,

408

raising Maeve's consciousness
and revealing her own inner truth.

409
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,654
She's gay, and it's okay.

410

- It's...
- Powerful.

411
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,199
She's more than just a superhero now.

412
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,784
She is a symbol.

413
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,243
Representation matters.

414
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,871
She's hashtag "Brave Maeve."

We're recommending
a multipronged image makeover.

- Then an exclusive It Gets Better PSA.

and Chicago Pride,

because you are two proud lesbians.

You know Maeve is bi, right?

421
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:14,097
I just feel like
lesbian is an easier sell.

A bit more cut-and-dry.

Now, for Elena...

- [Elena] Me?
- You're gonna love it.

like Ellen and Portia.

Okay, let's get one thing straight.

I have no interest
in being in a public relationship.

If they want a lesbian Ken doll,

445
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,616
they can find someone else.

446
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:20,997
I'm gonna cash in my vacation days
and go stay with my sister.

447
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,167
- No, you can't do that.
- Why? I'm not under contract.

This is Homelander, okay?

And he's fucking with me.
If you go out there...

Elena, there is nowhere you can go
that he won't find you.

451
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,680
Please, stay.

452
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:41,434
I can't protect you if you leave.

453
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,854
But what are we gonna do?

454
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,817
We're gonna take that motherfucker down.

455

So that's it?
