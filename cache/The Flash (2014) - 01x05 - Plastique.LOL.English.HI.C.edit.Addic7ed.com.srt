00:00:01,136 --> 00:00:04,941
My name is Barry Allen, and
I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,132 --> 00:00:07,969
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:08,873
by something impossible.

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,411
Run, Barry. Run.

5
00:00:10,413 --> 00:00:13,288
My father went to prison for her murder.

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,205
Then an accident made me the impossible.

7
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:19,841
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensics scientist,

8
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:21,813
but secretly, I use my speed

9
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,558
to fight crime and find others like me.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,859
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother.

11
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,563
- Mom.
- And get justice for my father.

12
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:31,633
I am The Flash.

13
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:34,038
<i>Previously, on The Flash...</i>

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,775
Who do you think you are?

15
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:38,448
This is what we talked about,
using my speed to do good.

16
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,285
We talked about you helping
us contain other meta-humans.

17
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:43,523
After all of these journalism
classes, I started a blog.

18
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:44,694
I thought you were taking journalism,

19
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:46,065
not science fiction writing.

20
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:47,468
Ever since I have known you,

21
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,302
you have believed in the impossible.

22
00:00:49,304 --> 00:00:50,902
What if you were right about
the night that your mom died?

23
00:00:50,904 --> 00:00:53,876
Something out there is saving people.

24
00:00:57,316 --> 00:00:58,951
See you soon, Barry.

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,587
How often do you think about

26
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:04,323
why your friends came into your life?

27
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:08,434
Was it random, by design,
or maybe a little of both?

28
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:10,939
Nice.

29
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:14,349
Regardless of the reason,
some friends you just know

30
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:17,423
are gonna be by your side for a while.

31
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:20,596
Others, you're not so sure.

32
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:24,535
And then there's that one
friend who, well, you hope,

33
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:28,441
someday becomes something more.

34
00:01:28,443 --> 00:01:31,542
But "friend" will have to do for now.

35
00:01:31,544 --> 00:01:33,610
And that's okay.

36
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:35,446
I guess.

37
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:37,752
I'm glad you invited Caitlin and Cisco.

38
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:38,854
They're cool, right?

39
00:01:38,856 --> 00:01:40,558
They saved your life, Barry.

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,693
That makes them the coolest
people I've ever met.

41
00:01:42,695 --> 00:01:45,499
It's nice that you guys became friends.

42
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:50,104
To friends, old and new.

43
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:55,479
Ooh. I'm up.

44
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:59,385
Wish me luck.

Don't get cocky, West.

Yeah, he's so hot.

50
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,484
Uh, I mean, genetically speaking.

51
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:20,355
Because I'm a geneticist, of course.

52

Oh, my God, do I sound like Felicity?

I'm not talking about Eddie.

00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:27,599
I'm talking about this.

55
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,436
I can't feel anything.

56
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:32,673
Yeah, that's usually what
happens when you drink too much.

57
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:35,011
No, the alcohol is not affecting me.

I mean I literally feel nothing.

collection kit in your purse?

Bombers typically have
their own unique signatures.

109

Crimped wires, fragmentation.

00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:03,953
about the streak sightings,
and writing about them.

165
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:05,754
Baby, there's no streak.

166
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:07,323
Yes, there is.

167
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:10,558
I saw him last night,
dad. I looked right at him.

168
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,258
Something incredible is
happening in Central City.

169
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,725
And I am gonna write about it.

170
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:16,728
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I have to get to work.

171
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,566
Blogging about supernatural
events doesn't really pay well.

172
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:31,280
A va file number is all the
info you have on the bomber?

173
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,213
C.C.P.D's been ordered off the case.

174
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:34,778
Well, who has the power to do that?

175
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,380
The army. Some general.

176
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:39,380
His name was Eiling, I think.

177
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,214
General Wade Eiling.

178
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:43,350
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

179
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:45,321
About ten years ago, General Wade Eiling

180
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:47,054
contracted S.T.A.R. Labs to develop

181
00:09:47,056 --> 00:09:49,688
enhanced gene therapies for soldiers.

182
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:51,092
I was interested in the potential

183
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,092
medical benefits for civilians.

184
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:54,195
General Eiling really wanted to develop

185
00:09:54,197 --> 00:09:57,834
mind reading capabilities
for interrogation purposes.

186
00:09:57,836 --> 00:09:59,938
I stopped the study when I
saw his techniques up close,

187
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,371
but our split was less than amicable.

188
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:04,942
He took all the evidence
I collected on the bombing.

189
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:07,013
Everything but the folder.

190
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:09,885
Well... Lucky for us, the va finally

191
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:13,455
joined the new millennium
and digitized their records.

192
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:15,057
A lot of redacted info.

193
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:17,594
But our girl's name is Bette Sans Souci,

194
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:19,529
an EOD specialist for the army.

195
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,429
- EOD?
- Bombs.

196
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:22,496
Is there an address?

197
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,030
Hold on. Here, we go.

198
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:26,002
One person in case of emergency.

199
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:29,241
Cameron Scott. Inglewood.

200
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:52,079
Bette Sans Souci?

201
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,113
I need you to come with me.

202
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:56,317
Don't touch me.

203
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:58,353
Get whatever you're wearing off of you.

204
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:01,412
Hurry.

205
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:14,794
Barry?

206
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,701
Can you hear me? Barry?

207
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:18,766
There must be a perfectly
reasonable explanation

208
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:19,999
for why he's not answering.

209
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:21,797
Barry?

210
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:25,481
Uh...

211
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:26,473
Don't ask.

212
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:31,199
I'm gonna ask. Where's my suit?

213
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:34,566
It's... Gone.

214
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,265
What do you mean, it's gone?

215
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:37,566
What did you do with my suit?

216
00:11:37,568 --> 00:11:39,165
It blew up, dude.

217
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:42,468
I managed to get out of it
before it went, "kaboom."

218
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,071
My suit went "kaboom"?

219
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:47,006
Fun fact about Bette Sans Souci.

220
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:48,205
She's not carrying bombs.

221
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,673
She touched the emblem on the suit

222
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,242
and turned it into a bomb.

223
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,643
She's a meta-human.

224
00:11:53,645 --> 00:11:56,076
With the ability to
cause spontaneous combustion

225
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:58,411
upon tactile contact.

226
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:00,546
- She blew up my suit.
- You have, like, three more.

227
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:03,417
Okay, I have two. And I loved that one.

228
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:05,085
All right, what else
do we know about her?

229
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:07,921
Oh, I don't know. She's pure evil.

230
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:09,222
We're gonna find this girl

231
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:11,824
and send her butt into the pipeline.

232
00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:13,459
No one blows my tech to smithereens

233
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:16,997
and gets away with it...

234
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:20,936
Unless she looks like that.

235
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:22,504
I don't think she meant to hurt me.

236
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:24,037
Well, her being a meta-human

237
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,973
explains General Eiling's interest in her.

238
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:29,410
And why he stole the case from us.

239
00:12:29,412 --> 00:12:33,811
He didn't want anyone to
know what she could do.

240
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:35,248
- Detective.
- Doctor.

241
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,318
So... Human bomb.

242
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,952
Must be Tuesday in Central City.

243
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:41,821
Yes, and General Eiling's

244
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:44,992
not one to give up a potential
asset without a fight.

245
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:46,626
We have to find her before he does.

246
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:49,763
Barry? Can I see you for a second?

247
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:57,272
When were you planning on telling me

248
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:59,008
that Iris saw the streak?

249
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,180
That was not planned.
She caught me off guard.

250
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:02,881
We had a deal.

251
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,484
You keep her in the dark
about the meta-humans,

252
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,855
and I don't go Floyd Mayweather on you.

253
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:08,123
Okay, Joe, I know.

254
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,959
And she's writing a blog now.

255
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:11,328
I already talked to her about that.

256
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,531
Talk to her again.
And be more convincing.

257
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:19,199
Okay.

258
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:21,033
- You mean, right now?
- Yes, I do.

259
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,070
All right.

260
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:25,339
You've got to stop writing about this guy.

261
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:27,341
- He doesn't even exist.
- I saw him, Barry.

262
00:13:27,343 --> 00:13:29,844
He wears a red suit, like,
a uniform or something,

263
00:13:29,846 --> 00:13:32,451
with a lighting bolt on his chest.

264
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:33,886
I mean, Iris, come on.

265
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:36,089
You were drinking last night at the bar.

266
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:38,656
I was not drunk, and I know what I saw.

267
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:40,623
He wears a mask.

268
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,290
I think he smiled at me.

269
00:13:44,292 --> 00:13:47,026
Okay, first of all,
if he is wearing a mask,

270
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:49,193
that probably means he doesn't
want people to know who he is.

271
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,962
It doesn't matter who he is.

272
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:54,667
What matters is that people
know that he's out there.

273
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:56,902
What is wrong with you?
This is important to me.

274
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:59,437
Why can't you be more supportive?

275
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,573
I'm just... you haven't
even put your name on it.

276
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:07,276
How serious can you be
about an anonymous blog?

277
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:10,847
Okay, you know what? Our entire lives,

278
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,415
you couldn't scream loud enough
that the impossible existed.

279
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,982
And now it's actually
happening in Central City.

280
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:19,386
I have proof of it, and you
don't want to know about it?

281
00:14:19,388 --> 00:14:21,519
That doesn't make sense, Barry.

282
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:23,220
So when you're ready to tell
me what this whole routine

283
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:27,160
is really about, then we can talk.

284
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:31,531
- [Cell phone vibrates]
- Yeah.

285
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:33,497
We've piggybacked onto General
Eiling's own surveillance.

286
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,266
According to what they're saying,

287
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:38,937
the lovely Ms. Sans Souci
was just spotted in Inglewood.

288
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,572
The same neighborhood as
Dr. Harold Hadley's office,

289
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:43,073
the military surgeon who performed

290
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:44,440
several procedures on her.

291
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:46,074
That's why she was looking for the folder.

292
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:48,311
You got to get to
her before Eiling does.

293
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:49,714
Okay.

294
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,395
- Sgt. Sans Souci.
- You remember me.

295
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:10,101
Good. Because I remember you, doctor.

296
00:15:10,103 --> 00:15:12,002
I remember waking up from a coma.

297
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:13,403
You started cutting me open.

298
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:16,406
I was only trying to
help ease your condition.

299
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:17,842
You couldn't control it.

300
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:21,577
You did this to me. You and Eiling.

301
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:41,202
Go bring me my asset.

302
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:48,479
You okay?

303
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,046
Look, I can get you out of here.

304
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:51,415
I can help you understand
what happened to you.

305
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,952
- How?
- Because it happened to me too.

306
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,752
Please.

307
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:12,501
<i>Target is gone.</i>

308
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:21,701
<i>As the detonation dispersed
throughout Central City.</i>

309
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:23,603
<i>A number of people were exposed to a wave</i>

310
00:16:23,605 --> 00:16:25,106
<i>of unquantifiable energy.</i>

311
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,741
One of those people... Was you.

312
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:30,881
You were in Central City ten months ago.

313
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,354
I had just returned from Afghanistan.

314
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:36,653
I was there defusing roadside bombs

315
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:41,454
and... Shrapnel ripped through me.

316
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:42,757
I was flown back state side.

317
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,491
Spent months at the base recuperating

318
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:48,060
and next thing I know,

319
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:50,597
I became the thing that almost killed me.

320
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:54,100
And Eiling's favorite, new lab rat.

321
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:55,467
The dark matter must have combined

322
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:58,734
with the bomb particulate inside your body.

323
00:16:58,736 --> 00:17:01,438
I thought Eiling did this to me.

324
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,408
Eiling is not smart enough
to create someone like you.

325
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,479
Clever enough to see your value.

326
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:11,481
Do you know of any
others who were changed?

327
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:13,014
There've been a few.

328
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:18,156
But no one that looks like you.

329
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:22,328
I'm sorry. That was inappropriate.

330
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,563
Please don't leave.

331
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:26,533
I know how to perform a lobotomy.

332
00:17:26,535 --> 00:17:28,638
Her cellular structure's
unlike anything I've ever seen.

333
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,507
Her nitrogen levels are off the charts.

334
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,109
Do you think we can help her?

335
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:38,378
To answer that question,
we have to understand

336
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,114
how she works, and to understand that,

337
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:42,115
first we have to study her in action.

338
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:44,016
You want her to blow stuff up.

339
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:45,683
- Yes, now we're talking.
- Not in here.

340
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:47,752
- She's too unstable.
- I know.

341
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:49,287
I know you know.

342
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:50,789
So this is your life now, huh?

343
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,226
Testing people like me?

344
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:55,795
Stopping people like you.

345
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:59,828
It's not what I thought I'd be doing.

346
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,528
Actually, aside from Barry,

347
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,130
you're the first meta-human
that we've tested.

348
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:09,169
- "Meta-human"?
- It's just a term.

349
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,542
Oh, my God, what happened?

350
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:14,676
Why didn't you say that you were shot?

351
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:17,144
It just grazed me.

352
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:19,783
There's something in there.

353
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:28,962
A tracker.

354
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:34,734
Lock down the pipeline.
Get Bette out of here.

355
00:18:34,736 --> 00:18:37,270
I'll take care of Eiling.

356
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:46,414
Harrison Wells. How
the mighty have fallen.

357
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,083
General.

358
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,055
S.T.A.R. Labs.

359
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:54,258
This place used to be so important.

360
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,524
Tell me, what does one do

361
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:58,093
after such a spectacular, public failure?

362
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:02,032
One adapts. One evolves.

363
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:04,500
One becomes intent on
reversing one's fortune.

364
00:19:04,502 --> 00:19:06,938
Always the idealist.

365
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,676
- What do you want, Wade?
- Where's my asset?

366
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:11,479
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

367
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:13,246
We tracked her here, Harrison.

368
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:14,813
Turn her over to me before you see the rest

369
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,480
of your precious palace crumble.

370
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:20,317
Oh, Wade, Wade, Wade.

371
00:19:24,987 --> 00:19:28,327
We could've changed
the world, you and I.

372
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,474
427 kPa's.

373
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:44,509
Her Trauzl rating is around 45.

374
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,742
That's the same as any plastique.

375
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:50,081
Plastique. Ha... first try!

376
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:52,985
Didn't really think
this one through, did you?

377
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:59,389
Downrange, insurgents
started booby trapping cars.

378
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:01,123
The rest of my tour, I was terrified

379
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,760
to touch another vehicle.

380
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:06,395
Now, I'm gonna spend the rest

381
00:20:06,397 --> 00:20:11,634
of my life terrified to
touch another human being.

382
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:17,040
Have they tried to help you?

383
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:20,175
Yeah, they've helped me
learn how to use my powers.

384
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,773
Not reverse them.

385
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:26,413
If they could reverse it so
you weren't a meta-human,

386
00:20:26,415 --> 00:20:29,583
would you?

387
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:33,622
A friend told me I was
given my speed for a reason.

388
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:37,365
That I was chosen.

389
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,768
I don't know if I believe that,

390
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,171
but I always wanted to help people.

391
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:45,107
Now I can.

392
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:47,777
[Cell phone vibrates]

393
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,345
Sorry. Hey, Joe.

394
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:54,549
I see your little conversation
with Iris was a rousing success.

395
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:57,653
She just posted another
story about the streak.

396
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:59,489
Joe, I tried. I really tried.

397
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,910
She's got her name on it now, Barry.

398
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,299
What? Joe...

399
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:05,200
It's my fault, I shouldn't
have asked you to say anything.

400
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:06,300
I just wanted you to know.

401
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:08,402
Okay? Bye.

402
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,211
What was that about?

403
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:16,778
Iris posted about the streak again.

404
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,612
She signed her name to it.

405
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:21,315
- Oh, that's not good.
- No.

406
00:21:21,317 --> 00:21:23,083
If one of these bad meta-humans

407
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:24,616
we're dealing with figures
she knows something...

408
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:28,582
Then they may target her, I know.

409

[Knock at door, bell chiming]

Sorry, we're closed.

00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,601
Oh, my God, it's you.

412
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:44,102
Iris West,

413
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:45,602
I hear you've been writing about me.

414
00:21:53,205 --> 00:21:54,938
You are real.

415
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,891
I should, um... let
me just clean up...

416
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,498
Meet me on the roof.

417
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,232
I'll give you a head start.

418
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,842
I need you to stop writing about me.

419
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:22,675
There are a lot of
people who need someone

420
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:24,644
like you right now.

421
00:22:24,646 --> 00:22:27,816
To know that you're out there.

422
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:30,016
I have so many questions.

423
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:32,787
Where are you from?

424
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:35,059
I can't say.

425
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:37,230
Who are you?

426
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:40,033
I can't tell you that, either.

427
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:44,437
How can you do what you do?

428
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:50,080
You're a terrible interview.

429
00:22:50,082 --> 00:22:52,683
There's more to this
than you can understand.

430
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:54,485
Just trust me, please.

431
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:57,189
I need you to stop.

432
00:22:57,191 --> 00:22:59,125
Can you stop?

433
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,129
Running into buildings and rescuing people

434
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,032
without them even
knowing that you're there?

435
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:04,800
I don't do this for the glory.

436
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:06,335
So why do you?

437
00:23:13,113 --> 00:23:15,679
Look, I have this friend,

438
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:20,622
an he had something terrible
happen to him when he was a kid.

439
00:23:20,624 --> 00:23:22,990
His whole life, he's been telling stories

440
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:26,758
about this impossible thing.

441
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,894
And people laughed at him.
And shrinks analyzed him.

442
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:36,061
And he's been searching for
an explanation ever since.

443
00:23:36,063 --> 00:23:40,936
But now, suddenly, it's
like he's lost his faith.

444
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:44,839
But you... you are proof
that he wasn't crazy.

445
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:51,649
Help me save my friend.

446
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:58,694
He's a lucky guy.

447
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:19,087
Hey, what's wrong?

448
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:20,790
Did Eiling find out you're here?

449
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,690
No.

450
00:24:22,692 --> 00:24:27,425
Caitlin was about to give
me the not-so-good news.

451
00:24:27,427 --> 00:24:29,528
The shrapnel in your body

452
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,734
has merged with you on a cellular level.

453
00:24:33,736 --> 00:24:39,539
And the technology required
to unsplice your DNA...

454
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,376
it hasn't been invented yet.

455
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:49,151
Bette.

456
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:54,053
It's okay. Roger that.

457
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:57,091
I just need a minute. Don't worry.

458
00:24:57,093 --> 00:24:59,727
Pretty sure I can cry
without blowing stuff up.

459
00:25:08,105 --> 00:25:12,044
- What now?
- She joins us.

460
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:14,414
- Becomes a part of the team.
- Barry...

461
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:17,718
You have an amazing ability to help people.

462
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,487
She makes things explode.

463
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:23,521
She's the first meta-human not hell-bent

464
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:24,791
on destroying this city.

465
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:26,594
It's too dangerous.

466
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:27,962
Well, she's not going in the pipeline.

467
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:29,463
I'm not suggesting
she go in the pipeline,

468
00:25:29,465 --> 00:25:30,798
but were she to remain at S.T.A.R. Labs,

469
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,967
it would put all of us at risk.

470
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:35,137
From who? Eiling?

471
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:36,739
Eiling is a dangerous man, Barry.

472
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:41,547
We do not want him as an enemy.

473
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:44,886
After the lighting bolt,
what if you hadn't found me?

474
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:46,689
It could've been me.

475
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:51,528
Hunted, on the run, cut off from
everyone I know and care about.

476
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:52,995
You guys saved me.

477
00:25:52,997 --> 00:25:56,464
And I want to save her
just as bad as you do, Barry.

478
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:58,799
We all do.

479
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:10,112
Joe. What are you doing here?

480
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:13,917
Going over the materials
in your mom's case.

481
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,419
How's it going with you?

482
00:26:16,421 --> 00:26:19,720
Stellar... I made friends
with a human bomb

483
00:26:19,722 --> 00:26:23,660
who I promised I could
help, and then, I couldn't.

484
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:29,396
And I finally diagnosed why
Iris is writing about the streak.

485
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:34,434
She's doing it for me.

486
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:38,603
To prove the impossible is possible.

487
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:41,841
How do you know that?

488
00:26:41,843 --> 00:26:43,745
The streak may have talked to her.

489
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:47,015
Barry, don't you think Iris
would recognize your voice?

490
00:26:47,017 --> 00:26:49,815
No, I can do this cool
thing with my vocal cords,

491
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:53,754
where I vibrate them so I sound like this.

492
00:26:53,756 --> 00:26:57,588
I know. It's cool, it's cool.

493
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,692
Whoa.

494
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:04,730
Well, you put that out there now, so.

495
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:06,589
I want to keep her safe.

496
00:27:09,564 --> 00:27:11,137
You know the only real
way to get her to stop

497
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,400
is to tell her the truth.

498
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:15,875
Man, you really want to tell her.

499
00:27:15,877 --> 00:27:19,677
- I tell her everything.
- Mm...

500
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,849
Not everything.

501
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:36,802
Is it that obvious?

502
00:27:36,804 --> 00:27:40,572
Not to her.

503
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:43,443
But how long have you known for?

504
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:45,748
I have watched you be in love with Iris

505
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,151
since you were old enough
to know what love is.

506
00:27:48,153 --> 00:27:52,719
And I've been waiting
years for you to tell her.

507
00:27:54,754 --> 00:27:58,755
But you haven't.

508
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:01,626
Guess I was too slow.

509
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:04,062
Now, she's happy and
with someone else, so...

510
00:28:04,064 --> 00:28:06,130
When the universe wants
to make something happen,

511
00:28:06,132 --> 00:28:09,100
whether it be giving a
young man lighting speed

512
00:28:09,102 --> 00:28:11,702
or putting two people together,

513
00:28:11,704 --> 00:28:16,704
it has a way of figuring those things out.

514
00:28:16,706 --> 00:28:19,238
And I got to get home.

515
00:28:23,646 --> 00:28:26,114
Thanks.

516
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:36,661
Cisco?

517
00:28:36,663 --> 00:28:38,863
He went home.

518
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,621
I think our Cisco's developing
a little bit of a crush on you.

519
00:28:42,623 --> 00:28:45,690
Not sure I'm prize winning
date material anymore.

520
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:48,662
Change is hard.

521
00:28:48,664 --> 00:28:52,466
The same accident that changed
you put me in this chair.

522
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:54,335
Sorry. I didn't know.

523
00:28:54,337 --> 00:28:57,038
I don't share that story
with you to garner sympathy.

524
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,675
I tell it to you to
illustrate a larger point.

525
00:28:58,677 --> 00:29:00,277
And what point is that?

526
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:05,249
That I would do anything
to get back what I lost.

527
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:10,687
- As would you.
- I would.

528
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:12,524
I just don't know how.

529
00:29:20,503 --> 00:29:22,104
You soldiers, you call yourselves 
Sheep Dogs. Am I right?

530
00:29:22,106 --> 00:29:24,372
Happy and normal until
someone attacks our flock.

531
00:29:24,374 --> 00:29:26,406
Every good person who
was changed that night,

532
00:29:26,408 --> 00:29:29,108
people like you, people like Barry Allen,

533
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,343
those people are your flock now, Bette.

534
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:36,176
And General Eiling will never
stop attacking that flock,

535
00:29:36,178 --> 00:29:40,946
and he always gets his target.

536
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:43,446
Unless you stop him.

537
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:51,286
You know your duty, Sergeant.

538
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:54,423
Kill Eiling.

539
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:58,698
One last mission. And then you go home.

540
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:16,986
Where's Bette?

541
00:30:16,988 --> 00:30:18,355
- She left.
- What do you mean?

542
00:30:18,357 --> 00:30:20,357
- Where did she go?
- She didn't say.

543
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:22,725
Well, where the hell could she be?

544
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,431
- Go, go!
- Go, go!

545
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,867
On me.

546
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,209
I'm ready to give myself up.

547
00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:47,709
Oh, I highly doubt that.

548
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:52,545
You think you can pull one over on me?

549
00:30:52,547 --> 00:30:54,844
You can't.

550
00:30:54,846 --> 00:30:56,212
Stand down, soldier.

551
00:30:56,214 --> 00:30:57,612
I got back on the military feed.

552
00:30:57,614 --> 00:30:58,746
Looks like they've gone to the waterfront

553
00:30:58,748 --> 00:31:01,217
to rendezvous with Bette.

554
00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:02,886
She's turning herself in.

555
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:05,320
She's not turning herself in.

556
00:31:07,487 --> 00:31:09,621
Please, let him get to her in time.

557
00:31:09,623 --> 00:31:13,228
All over the world, people are
plotting to destroy our country.

558
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,128
To end our lives.

559
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,295
Brave American soldiers
are gonna die in that fight,

560
00:31:18,297 --> 00:31:19,529
but they don't have to.

561
00:31:19,531 --> 00:31:23,602
Because of you, we could have victory.

562
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:26,503
All I've ever wanted was to
make the world a safer place.

563
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:29,537
And it will be when you're not in it.

564
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,439
Take cover!

565
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:43,249
What are you doing here?

566
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:45,584
Being a soldier doesn't
mean you're a murderer.

567
00:31:45,586 --> 00:31:48,454
Don't become one now.

568
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,995
I'm sorry. I didn't see him.

569
00:31:52,997 --> 00:31:55,630
Don't be. It's not your fault.

570
00:31:55,632 --> 00:31:57,131
I'm glad you stopped me.

571
00:31:57,133 --> 00:31:58,464
I'm gonna get you back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

572
00:31:58,466 --> 00:32:04,639
Barry, Dr. Wells. He... he...

573
00:32:15,624 --> 00:32:18,092
Guys, we have a problem.

574
00:32:18,094 --> 00:32:20,563
Is Bette okay?

575
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:24,334
No. Eiling killed her.

576
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:27,106
She's glowing. She's gonna detonate.

577
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:29,074
Oh, my God, a mass that size,
the explosion, it would be...

578
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:30,475
Devastating.

579
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:33,142
Barry, you have to get
her away from the city.

580
00:32:33,144 --> 00:32:37,211
But there's no time.

581
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:39,547
Can I run on water?

582
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:41,315
I built up enough speed
to run up a building.

583
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:44,118
How fast do I need to go to run on water?

584
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,086
Assuming your weight...

585
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:49,589
450 pounds of force per
step for vertical suspension.

586
00:32:49,591 --> 00:32:50,757
Accounting for fluid drag.

587
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:53,524
Approximately 650 miles an hour.

588
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:59,031
You have to outrun the
blast or you'll die too.

589
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,578
<i>Nothing out of the ordinary occurred.</i>

590
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:27,150
<i>The military was simply conducting</i>

591
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,964
<i>an underwater weapons test.</i>

592
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:32,610
<i>There is no need for panic or alarm.</i>

593
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,612
<i>Central City is safe. I guarantee you.</i>

594
00:34:35,614 --> 00:34:38,780
He murdered Bette right in front of me.

595
00:34:38,782 --> 00:34:40,650
And there's nothing we can do to him.

596
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:44,720
Powerful men have a way
of avoiding consequences.

597
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:48,056
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

598
00:34:48,058 --> 00:34:49,961
You can walk on water.

599
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:53,164
Puts you in pretty interesting company.

600
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:10,956
If you came to do laundry,
I already have a load in.

601
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:15,093
Uh, no. I-I came to talk.

602
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:31,976
I was working a case.

603
00:35:31,978 --> 00:35:35,578
Someone I really thought
I could help befriend.

604
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:38,546
But they died.

605
00:35:38,548 --> 00:35:40,080
Barry, I'm really sorry.

606
00:35:40,082 --> 00:35:45,019
I didn't know her that
well. But it still hurts.

607
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:48,186
And as bad as I feel right now,

608
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:53,459
I know how much worse it is
to lose someone who's family.

609
00:35:55,061 --> 00:36:00,162
Iris... Writing about this stuff,
putting your name out there,

610
00:36:00,164 --> 00:36:02,231
it's dangerous.

611
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:07,906
So I'm asking you one
last time, please, stop.

612
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:10,475
And I am asking you one last time

613
00:36:10,477 --> 00:36:14,114
to tell me what is
really going on with you.

614
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:18,388
Why am I the only one of
us who's interested in this?

615
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:33,937
I guess, just, all
this stuff with my family,

616
00:36:33,939 --> 00:36:39,008
I finally just put it behind me.

617
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:43,848
I'm asking you to also.

618
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,717
That may have been how this started,

619
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:49,655
but it's about something
more than that for me now.

620
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:53,496
Whoever this streak is,
wherever he comes from,

621
00:36:53,498 --> 00:36:57,868
I am not stopping until the rest
of the world believes in him.

622
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:11,256
Maybe we shouldn't see
each other for a while.

623
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:18,164
Yeah.

624
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,911
Can I get another club soda, please?

625
00:37:43,785 --> 00:37:45,252
Hey.

626
00:37:45,254 --> 00:37:47,185
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

627
00:37:47,187 --> 00:37:49,820
We thought we should have a toast.

628
00:37:49,822 --> 00:37:51,821
Doesn't work on me, remember?

629
00:37:51,823 --> 00:37:53,556
Barry Allen, you of all people

630
00:37:53,558 --> 00:37:57,091
should know that nothing is impossible.

631
00:37:57,093 --> 00:38:01,195
I distilled a highly
fermented, potent suspension.

632
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:03,631
It's basically 500 proof.

633
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:08,105
I figured if anybody could use
a drink tonight, it was you.

634
00:38:08,107 --> 00:38:09,974
So here's to Bette.

635
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:15,243
Bette.

636
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:22,749
Whoa, oh.

637
00:38:22,751 --> 00:38:24,551
That hit too quick.

638
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,819
Are you buzzed?

639
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:30,555
Yeah. Yeah, I'm buzzed for sure.

640
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:35,160
Whoa. Whoa, that is good stuff.

641
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:39,830
And it's gone.

642
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:41,598
Work in progress.

643
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,904
For a guy who has experienced
his fair share of mysteries,

644
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,840
one mystery I still can't figure out

645
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:49,977
is why some people come into our lives.

646
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:51,845
Why some people go,

647
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:54,247
and others become a part of you.

648
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,888
Some friendships feel
like they'll last forever.

649
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,989
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey.

650
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:03,126
There's dinner in the fridge.

651
00:39:03,128 --> 00:39:04,694
Okay, thanks.

652
00:39:04,696 --> 00:39:05,927
Iris, about your blog...

653
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,995
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

654
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:11,795
And others end far too soon.

655
00:39:11,797 --> 00:39:15,533
Not every friendship is
meant to last a lifetime.

656
00:39:15,535 --> 00:39:21,134
What does last forever is the
pain when that person is gone.

657
00:39:29,613 --> 00:39:35,253
[Alarm sounds]

658
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,563
I was wrong about you, Harrison.

659
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:46,734
You're still one step ahead.

660
00:39:46,736 --> 00:39:50,103
Impressive for a man
without the use of his legs.

661
00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:52,773
I'm afraid I don't know what
you're talking about, Wade.

662
00:39:52,775 --> 00:39:54,708
A girl who can
transform ordinary objects

663
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,179
into explosives with the touch of her hand.

664
00:39:57,181 --> 00:40:00,218
Today I saw a man who can move
faster than the blink of an eye.

665
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,151
Extraordinary.

666
00:40:02,153 --> 00:40:04,857
The night your particle accelerator died

667
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:07,125
was the night the impossible was born.

668
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:09,927
I think we should start working
together again, Harrison.

669
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:11,562
I think you should leave.

670
00:40:11,564 --> 00:40:13,130
You know, I can have a
squadron of soldiers here

671
00:40:13,132 --> 00:40:14,797
in minutes.

672
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:16,664
You know, I can have an
army of press here like that.

673
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,667
Believe me, General, I'd be more than happy

674
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:19,969
to testify to your involvement

675
00:40:19,971 --> 00:40:24,573
in activities that were less than humane.

676
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:27,546
Threaten me again and I
will end you, General.

677
00:40:27,548 --> 00:40:31,185
And I am not talking about your career.

678
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:39,529
You know, I figured out
your little secret, Wells.

679
00:40:39,531 --> 00:40:42,232
Won't be long before the
public catches on as well.

680
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:57,113
This is everything we've
been working to achieve.

681
00:40:57,115 --> 00:41:00,249
We may have the same goals,
General, but not the same means.

682
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:03,619
I will not have this project
end before it even begins.

683
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:05,888
And as long as he's on my premises,

684
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,923
I will not have him subjected
to that kind of cruelty anymore.

685
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:12,256
We're done.

686
00:41:12,258 --> 00:41:16,761
We're done. General.

687
00:41:16,763 --> 00:41:20,129
Get out.

688
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:42,184
Hey.

689
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:45,189
- It's okay.
- [Heavy breathing]

690
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:46,693
It's okay, boy.

691
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:48,895
- It's okay.
- [Snarling]

692
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:51,162
He's gone.

693
00:41:51,164 --> 00:41:54,600
Don't you worry.

694
00:41:54,602 --> 00:41:57,807
I have a whole different
future in mind for you.

695
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,776
