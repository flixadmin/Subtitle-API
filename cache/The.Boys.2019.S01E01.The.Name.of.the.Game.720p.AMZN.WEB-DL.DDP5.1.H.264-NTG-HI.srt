165
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,281
Lot of respect for that girl.

166
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,778
Lot of love in the room.

167
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,451
And the spread. What a spread.

168
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,990
Just really nice.

169
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,913
MADELYN:
That does not begin to convey

170
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,333
the terrible regret...

171
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,682
Aw, geez.
Maybe there's a movie on.

172
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,100
- No, keep it.
- No, we can switch it.

173
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,754
- Keep it.
- (clears throat)

174
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,502
...awful, tragic loss.

175
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,916
My deepest condolences
to Robin Ward's family.

176
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,716
I was chasing
these bank robbers.

177
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,350
She just stepped
in the middle of the street,

178
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,518
and I-I couldn't...

179
00:09:58,557 --> 00:09:59,977
Middle of the...

180
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,557
She was a half step
off the fucking curb.

181
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,902
Oh, now, come on, Hughie.

182
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,727
Just, uh, don't get upset, okay?
Just...

183
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,522
He knows.

184
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,085
MADELYN: ...swift,
thoughtful attention...

185
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,239
(doorbell rings)

186
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,608
Now I think that A-Train
would like to get back to work.

187
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,366
MAN:
Everyone at Vought is just...

188
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,578
just wrecked about Robin.

189
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,619
Now, you two weren't married,
and look,

190
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,415
technically,
there's no legal claim.

191
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,710
But...

192
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,263
Vought wants to do
the right thing:

193
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,627
offer you $45,000
in restitution.

194
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,014
All you have to do is sign

195
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,224
right here,

196
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,273
and I'll offer you the check.

197
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:45,269
This is
a confidentiality agreement.

198
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,152
It's a boilerplate NDA.

199
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,149
I sign this, and...

200
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,942
I can't talk about it?

201
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,946
Have to pretend
like it didn't happen,

202
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,118
like I wasn't holding
Robin's arms in my hands?

203
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,078
Look, I know you're upset,

204
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,078
but we're just trying to help.

205
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,580
Then say you're sorry.

206
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,043
Excuse me?

207
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,713
I mean, you people say
"our condolences"

208
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,752
and "my sympathies"
and "our regrets,"

209
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,796
but nobody can look me
in the fucking eye

210
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,629
and say "I'm sorry."

211
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,925
I'm not signing anything.
Get out.

212
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,680
I said get the hell out!

213
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,646
You okay?

214
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:35,735
As I said,
boilerplate NDA, really.

215
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,739
Pretty standard stuff.

216
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,411
Can I think about it?

217
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,661
If you have
any questions at all,

218
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,495
just, uh...

219
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,004
(door opens)

220
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,506
- (exhales)
- (door closes)

221
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,429
DISPATCHER:
Unit 44, code 20.

222
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,467
Address is 1420 63rd Street...

223
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,471
Any maniacs out there?

224
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,175
Mm-mm. Quiet night.

225
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,725
Like every night.

226
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,598
(sighs) That's too bad.

227
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,645
We could really use the press
right now.

228
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,895
Oh, Annie.

229
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,863
I'm hungry.

230
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,863
Don't worry.
I didn't get the job.

231
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,195
You don't know that.

232
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,201
They're auditioning girls
nationwide.

233
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,914
Besides,
Countess probably got it.

234
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,914
- She's so good in a room.
- (phone ringing)

235
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,996
If you're negative,
negative things happen to you.

236
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,803
Hello?

237
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,797
Yes, I'm her mother.

238
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,510
Uh, yes. Uh...

239
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,141
uh, one moment.

240
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,758
(whispering):
It's them.

241
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,014
It's them.

242
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,265
Hello?

243
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,266
Yes, this is she.

244
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,811
I got it?

245
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,356
- You got it!
- (screams)

246
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,399
You got it!

247
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,322
Shh.

248
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,030
(whispering):
Oh, my God.

249
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,661
Uh, I'm so... I'm so sorry.

250
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,618
It's a weird connection.

251
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,118
I don't know what that was,
actually.

252
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,330
Uh... Mm-hmm.

253
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,120
HUGHIE:
Oh, shit.

254
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,325
MAN:
Yeah?

255
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,004
MAN 2:
I think she was an addict.

256
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,383
MAN:
Needle tracks?

257
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,709
MAN 2:
12 marks on one arm.

258
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,375
MAN:
More dope coming in.

259
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,512
More pushers at work.

260
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,260
What you doing?

261
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,722
Can't file a criminal case

262
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,114
against A-Train.
Supes are like cops.

263
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,638
They can't be charged

264
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,641
- for damages while they're on the job.
- Okay.

265
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,393
But maybe we can file
a wrongful death.

266
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,355
I just got to get Robin's
parents to sign off on it.

267
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,396
- Hughie, come sit with me.
- Dad, I'm not...

268
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,531
- I'm right...
- (pats couch)

269
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,568
Okay.

270
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,002
Good for you.

271
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:52,037
You want to make this right,
what happened to Robin.

272
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,213
But you can't.

273
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,714
So sign this.

274
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,680
What?

275
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,637
This is a lot of money, Hughie.

276
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,678
We could really use it.

277
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,102
I can't... Dad, they killed her.

278
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,812
Be realistic, okay?

279
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,352
Even if we could pay
for a lawyer...

280
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,686
and that's a big if...
there's no case.

281
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,111
She was in the street.

282
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,739
- Be like if a bus hit her.
- Dad, she was one step

283
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,947
- off the curb.
- I...

284
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,447
- I saw it!
- Hughie, look. Look.

285
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,488
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

286
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,135
- Dad, I have...
- You don't have the fight.

287
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,159
You never have.

288
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,708
I'm sorry, but it's-it's true.

289
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,752
Neither do I.

290
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,840
Now...

291
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,682
come and...
come and sit with me, okay?

292
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,179
Remington Steele's on.

293
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,682
- Hughie! Where you going?
- (door opens)

294
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,515
(door closes)

295
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
(sighs)

296
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,283
TV REPORTER: ...the red carpet
outside of Vought headquarters,

297
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,358
here for the annual
shareholders presentation...

298
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,863
(fans talking indistinctly,
shouting)

299
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,155
ASHLEY:
There she is.

300
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,868
- Welcome to New York.
- (fans cheering)

301
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,988
I'm Ashley Barrett,
director of talent relations.

302
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,656
So, uh, are all these people
here for me?

303
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,075
Oh, honey.

304
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,793
(laughs) Who else
would they be here for?

305
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,004
Come on.

306
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,554
We're running late.

307
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,837
Oh, my God.

308
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,720
(fans screaming, cheering)

309
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,338
(camera shutters clicking)

310
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,220
MADELYN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

311
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,524
it is without a doubt
a good time

312
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,768
to be in the Superhero business.

313
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,861
Our net income is up 14%.

314
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,978
Our latest film,
G-Men: World War,

315
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,106
just grossed shy

316
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,703
- of $1.7 billion world-wide.
- (cheers and applause)

317
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,330
And this fall, we break ground

318
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,577
on our newest theme park
outside of Paris.

319
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:56,039
The branding opportunities
are limitless.

320
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,041
(cheers and applause)

321
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,673
But, you know,
none of that really matters.

322
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:06,421
Because job one is managing,
supporting,

323
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,796
and advising the brave heroes

324
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:14,314
who put themselves in
harm's way each and every day

325
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,889
for us.

326
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,555

to-to vanish?

489
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,271
No, I don't actually vanish.

490
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:44,533
My skin turns into this
carbon meta-material

491
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,527
that bends the light.

492
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,278
Like an invisibility cloak.

493
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,910
All right,
but just to be clear,

494
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,946
you have to be
completely naked, right?

495
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,870
(TV audience reacts)

496
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,539
I appreciate you coming on
the show, my man. I love you.

497
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,658
You guys stay tuned for
a behind-the-scenes look

498
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,995
at Invisible Force 2, and
later, Translucent himself...

499
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,671
(clears throat)

500
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,459
You interested in a nanny cam?

501
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,064
'Cause we're actually running
a special on that.

502
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,418
Um, it's a pretty popular bear.

503
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,005
There's cameras in the eyes.

504
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,510
BUTCHER:
Tell me,

505
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,141
how many nannies shake
their babies?

506
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,559
Uh, I'm sorry?

507
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:19,768
You know, a good...
hard shake, like...

508
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,020
like tryin' to get ketchup
out of a bottle.

509
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:25,484
One percent? Less?

510
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,494
I-I don't really know.

511
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,356
Funny, that.

512
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:33,073
They sell a billion dollars
worth of that shit worldwide.

513
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,325
Goes to show you, doesn't it?

514
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:37,828
The bollocks people
will believe

515
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,830
if you get them scared enough.

516
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,712
(scoffs) Cool.

517
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,670
Cool, cool.

518
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,250
Um...

519
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,705
Is there anything I can
help you with today, or...?

520
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:51,506
I'm not gonna piss you about,
Hughie.

521
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,930
I heard what happened to Robin.

522
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,072
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry,
who are you?

523
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:56,426
She wasn't in the street.

524
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,312
She was one step off
the fucking curb.

525
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,519
And you didn't take the pay-off.

526
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,828
Yeah. I said,
who the hell are you?

527
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:02,902
How do you know that?

528
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,647
Name's Butcher.

529
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,319
Billy Butcher.

530
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,653
Listen, I was thinking that, uh,

531
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:13,574
you and me should have
a little bit of a chat.

532
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,079
Y-You're a Fed?

533
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,908
You don't sound like a Fed.

534
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,753
What, I can't immigrate?

535
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,266
There's a giant green slapper
with her ass in the harbor

536
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,750
that says different.

537
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,977
You don't really look
like one, either.

538
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,841
No? What do I look like?

539
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:30,127
Like you're starring in
a porn version of The Matrix.

540
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,222
Well, it's all right there
in black and white.

541
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:35,048
Okay. Uh, what exactly
can I do for you?

542
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,854
No, you got it all wrong,
Hughie.

543
00:26:36,887 --> 00:26:38,757
It's what I can do for you.

544
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,676
You see, you ain't alone, son.

545
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:42,935
It happens a lot more
than you think.

546
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:46,227
Supes lose hundreds of people
each year to collateral damage.

547
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,362
No. Come on, that'd be
all over the news.

548
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,029
People would be screaming
bloody murder.

549
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,545
Yeah, look, there might be
the odd mention

550
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,069
of it now and again,
like with Robin,

551
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,673
but there's a fuck-sight more
that happens

552
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,867
that just gets swept
right under the rug.

553
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:59,327
Why?

554
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,213
Ain't it obvious?

555
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:05,917
Movie tickets, merchandising,

556
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,418
theme parks, video games.

557
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,171
A multi-billion dollar
global industry supported

558
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,173
by corporate lobbyists

559
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,965
and politicians on both sides.

560
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:19,140
But the main reason
that you won't hear about it

561
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,310
is 'cause the public don't
want to know about it.

562
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,060
See, people love that cozy
feeling that Supes give them.

563
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,613
Some golden cunt

564
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,186
to swoop out of the sky
and save the day

565
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,782
so you don't got
to do it yourself.

566
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,858
But if you knew half the shit
they get up to...

Ooh... (clucks tongue)

Fuckin' diabolical.

569
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,789
But then...
that's where I come in.

570
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,670
Come in to... to do what?

571
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:51,208
Spank the bastards
when they get out of line.

572

573
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,547
Come on, son.

650
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:03,255
- (sighs)
- Translucent,

651
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,297
you're a goddamn pervert.

652
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,256
Ah...

653
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,603
Oh, uh...

654
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:15,771
I'll just go.

655
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,806
HUGHIE:
They're all like that?

656
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,315
All of them?
Even Homelander?

657
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:25,744
Homelander's the exception.

658
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,778
He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke.

659
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,911
Man's a saint.

660
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,618
But the rest of 'em, yeah.

661
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:34,039
Pardon my French,
fuck those fuckers.

662
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,618
Here.

663
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:38,043
Have a shufti of that.

664
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,042
- What are these?
- That's the police log

665
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,544
the day that Robin got murdered.

666
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,836
Couple of bar fights.
A few cars got nicked.

667
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,341
But you know
what's not in there?

668
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,104
No bank alarms going off.

669
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,386
No one charged
at Central Booking.

670
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,720
A-Train stopped
two bank robbers, my arse.

671
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:58,096
Someone's fucking
hiding something.

672
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,233
- Hiding what?
- Well, I don't know,

673
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,110
whatever dodgy shit
he was up to that night.

674
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,478
Why couldn't he stop?
I mean, what was in that bag?

675
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:07,526
You know?
Who was he running from?

676
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,109
- Or where was he running to?
- Bingo.

677
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,905
Work that out, and we'll have
the fucker, I can smell it.

678
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,791
Okay.

679
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,497
Okay, so, um...

680
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,580
what can I do to help?

681
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,915
Here's what you do.

682
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,921
Ring Vought, tell 'em you'll
take the money, sign the NDA,

683
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:30,014
but only if A-Train's there
in person when you do it.

684
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,390
Why does A-Train need
to be there?

685
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:32,696
Then they'll take you
into The Seven Tower,

686
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,930
through security, mate,

687
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,931
- and then you're gonna plant a bug.
- A bug?

688
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:38,143
A bug. And we'll have
a little listen.

689
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,393
See what's really going on.

690
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:43,056
Okay, let me just... sorry,
let me just get this straight.

691
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:46,565
You want me to... you want me
to go to Seven Tower by myself,

692
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,898
and-and you want me
to plant a bug,

693
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,534
like I'm... what,
like I'm fuckin' James Bond?

694
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:54,162
- Yeah, exactly. You got it.
- You're FBI.

695
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,869
If you're FBI,
then get a warrant.

696
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,179
- Why do you... why do you even need me?
- Hughie, Hughie,

697
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,663
look, mate,
I got a warrant, all right?

698
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,376
But that place is firewalled,
untappable,

699
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,137
and locked up tighter
than a nun's knickers.

700
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:07,299
I couldn't get myself in there
in a million years.

701
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:08,957
But you, son, you could do it.

702
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,756
- No, no, I can't, okay?
- Yeah.

703
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,889
I can't. No. You didn't see
A-Train covered in...

704
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,096
And-and I'm, what, I'm
just supposed to go in there,

705
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,467
and I'm supposed to...
I'm supposed to shake his hand?

706
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,524
- And smile?
- Yeah.

707
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,938
I'm not... Do you know
who my favorite musician is?

708
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,727
- Who?
- James Taylor.

709
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:26,691
Number two, Simon & Garfunkel.
Number three, Billy Joel.

710
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,362
Any of those guys,
they don't infiltrate.

711
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,701
Okay? I'm not an infiltrator.

712
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,157
Hughie, Hughie,
fucking grow a pair.

713
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:34,674
You heard that cunt
laughing at your girl.

714
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,328
No. No. No.

715
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,616
No, I can't.
I can't do that.

716
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,790
I'm sorry,
I'm just gonna fuck it up,

717
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,789
and you're not
gonna have your bug...

718
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,831
(panting):
...and I'll be dead.

719
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,381
I'm not... I'm not like you.

720
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,297
(door opens)

721
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,630
(door closes)

722
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,507
(chuckles):
This is amazing, Madelyn.

723
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,813
Thank you for this.
My kid is gonna lose his mind.

724
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,927
Ah, it is our pleasure.

725
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,894
Just do not sell it online.

726
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,385
(Madelyn chuckles)

727
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,646
All right.
What are you thinking?

728
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,358
Baltimore is a beautiful town.

729
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:11,108
But you've got a problem.

730
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:15,071
Your homicide rates
are up, what, 62%?

731
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,823
The police
are not closing cases.

732
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,718
You're on the verge
of needing a federal lifeline.

733
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,542
Cut to the chase, Madelyn.

734
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,367
Who are you proposing?

735
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:25,002
Nubian Prince.

736
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,960
Fits your population's demo,

737
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,790
but not too militant.

738
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,956
Caucasians love him,
too, with a...

739
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,094
59% approval rate.

740
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:37,341
I am willing to give you
a three-year exclusive contract

741
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:39,386
with full PR support,

742
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,059
and I'm gonna give you
nine and a half points

743
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,179
of the merchandising.

744
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,056
I thought he was in Detroit.

745
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,153
Well, we're thinking
about making a move.

746
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,978
How much?

747
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,533
- $300 million a year.
- (laughs)

748
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,818
(both laughing)

749
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,660
I know, I know,
it's a tough swallow.

750
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,409
But we both know that
your city needs a hero.

751
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,543
$200 million for Nubian Prince.

752
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,962
- I can sell that.
- Mm.

753
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,551
I'm sorry, Steve, I can't do it.

754
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:14,087
We've got Atlanta waiting
in the wings.

755
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,681
- I think maybe you can.
- (chuckles)

756
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,337
And why is that?

757
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,811
I happen to know
about Compound V.

758
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,732
What is Compound V?

759
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,650
It's the type of rumor

760
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,899
that could really tarnish
those heroes of yours.

761
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,531
Nobody wants that.

762
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,238
People need heroes.

763
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:39,068
Now, I can make sure
that that stays a rumor,

764
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,074
because I'm a friend.

765
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:44,366
But friendship
does cut both ways.

766
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:48,291
I'm sorry, Steve, I don't know
what you're talking about.

767
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:51,212
$300 million is the price,

768
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,841
or we go to Atlanta.

769
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,587
DONNA:
So, how amazing is it?

770
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,183
What's Homelander like?

771
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,087
Uh... he's busy.

772
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,556
I haven't really
met him yet, but...

773
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,515
Mom, I got to tell you
what happened.

774
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,349
Oh, I forgot.

775
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,274
I was playing mah-jongg
with Patty and Trish,

776
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,523
and Patty is going on and on
about how her daughter

777
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,225
got into med school,
and I'm thinking, so what?

778
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,196
My daughter got into The Seven!

779
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,906
Anyway, so-so,
what did you want to tell me?

780
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:26,122
Everything's great.

781
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,211
Just how we dreamed.

782
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,706
Um...

783
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,328
Mom, actually, you know what?
I have to go.

784
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:34,286
All right. Bye, honey.

785
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:45,933
(sniffles)

786
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,773
(takes deep,
shuddering breath)

787
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,105
Um...

788
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,650
excuse me.

789
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,704
I'm sorry, a-are you okay?

790
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,527
Just seemed like a...

791
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,702
tough call.

792
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,541
Sorry.
I don't mean to bother you.

793
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:07,946
No, no, it's okay.

794
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,155
Uh...

795
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,754
I'm fine.
I'm just...

796
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,210
I'm just having a bad day.

797
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:17,131
(chuckles):
Yeah, me, too.

798
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,170
Uh... is it, like,
a-a work thing, or...

799
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,045
a-a life thing?

800
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:26,053
(smacks lips)
It's a work thing.

801
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,852
You?

802
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,980
Uh... life thing.

803
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,396
You know how you have this...

804
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:40,862
image of yourself?

805
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,613
Like, I thought I was strong.

806
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,616
You know?
Like, made of steel.

807
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,948
A fighter.

808
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,413
And...

809
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:52,123
then I was faced
with this horrible situation

810
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,424
with this asshole...

811
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:57,208
and...

812
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:01,382
I just heard my mom's voice
in my head,

813
00:39:01,423 --> 00:39:03,303
"Keep smiling,

814
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,931
the show must go on,"

815
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:09,139
and... I didn't fight.

816
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:12,481
And now I just feel sick.

817
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,517
Partly because I did it, but...

818
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,562
mostly because...

819
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:24,244
...turns out I'm
not who I thought I was.

820

(sighs)

821
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:31,158
- Oh. Oh, I'm, um, sorry.
- Uh...

822
00:39:31,203 --> 00:39:34,003
I-I didn't mean
to just dump all of that

823
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,829
- onto you.
- No, no, it's totally fine that you dumped. Um...

824
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,378
Listen, d-do you like your job?

825
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,933
Oh.

826
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,466
It's the only thing
I've ever wanted.

827
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:49,221
And it's a good job?

828
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:52,142
Like, you're not
selling kids smack?

829
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,562
No, it's a great job.

830
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,311
I could help a lot of people.

831
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:00,154
Thing is, I, um...

832
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:03,110
used to know this girl,

833
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:06,321
and we used to go skating
at Rockefeller,

834
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:08,243
and I'd be on the side

835
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,241
with this death grip
on the rails.

836
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:13,793
She would just charge headfirst
into the middle of the rink.

837
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:17,169
And she wasn't... good.

838
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,247
Like, she fell...

839
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,632
a lot...

840
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,130
but she was never scared.

841
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,471
And she always used to say:

842
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:33,102
"Just 'cause you fall
on your ass doesn't mean

843
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,060
you have to stay there."

844
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,401
So you fell on your ass,
you know?

845
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,856
That's not who you are.

846
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:44,784

Yeah.

A-Train's apology

any rumors you may have heard

00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:04,487
Well, he ain't moving.

1133
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,818
Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.

1134
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,784
How'd you know the electric
could do the job?

1135
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,624
Skin's carbon.

1136
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,449
Highly conductive.

1137
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:15,535
Saw it on, uh, Jimmy Fallon.

1138
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:20,338
Would've taken me forever
to work that one out.

1139
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,707
Good job.

1140
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:23,054
Let's get him in the boot.

1141
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:25,299
Wait, wait, what?
Wait, what? What?

1142
00:56:25,341 --> 00:56:27,341
(grunts)
The trunk.

1143
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,653
No, no, I mean, what are we...
what are we...

1144
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,217
what are we doing with him?

1145
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:32,682
Well, Hughie, you just offed
one of The Seven, mate.

1146
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,103
Me? I...

1147
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,981
You-you hit him
with a fucking car!

1148
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,359
Look, potato, fucking po-tah-to.

1149
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,146
We're both in a shitload
of trouble.

1150
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,780
No, no, no, we're not!
It's... It...

1151
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:45,277
He-he attacked us, okay?

1152
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,739
And you're-you're
a federal officer, you know?

1153
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,410
Just-just call the fucking FBI.

1154
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,239
Yeah, o-okay, so, look,

1155
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:55,084
technically, I'm not a Fed.

1156
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,580
What?!

1157
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,665
Then who the fuck are you?!

It's just a little turbulence.
