1
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:02,712
Alex.

2
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,220
Tod and George's dad just called.

3
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:08,597
He's picking you up at 3:30 tomorrow.

4
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:11,012
And the bus leaves the high school
for the airport around 5.

5
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:12,950
How's my suitcase working out for you?

6
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:16,122
Mom, Mom, Mom,
you gotta leave that on.

7
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,340
Yeah, it's like you know,

8
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:21,145
The tag made the last flight without
the plane crashing or anything.

9
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:22,107
So I figure,

10
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:24,465
it's gotta be on the bag
or at least with the bag.

11
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,037
For luck.

12
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,748
Where would you get
a nutball idea like that?

13
00:03:30,663 --> 00:03:31,662
I'm still here.

14
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,372
So...

15
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,593
17, on the loose.

16
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,703
Senior trip with your friends...

17
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:44,156
in Paris. Ten days in the springtime.

18
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:47,467
Live it up, Alex.

19
00:03:48,058 --> 00:03:49,577
You got your whole life ahead of you.

20
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,190
<i>Alex.</i>

21
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,908
<i>Alex.</i>

22
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:01,091
<i>The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.</i>

23
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,636
<i>No parking.</i>

24
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:10,094
Hey, Hitchcock.
What?

25
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,257
Let me give you a hand with this, man.

26
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:12,165
No...
There you go.

27
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,892
Carter, you dick.

28
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:15,876
Schmuck.
Good one.

29
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,226
You left this on the bus.

30
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:21,951
Thanks, come on,
let's get your stuff together.

31
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,435
Hey, Christa.

32
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:24,835
Hi, Blake.

33
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,231
What are you doing?

34
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:28,147
He's the man. The man.

35
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:29,803
Alright, you guys got everything?

36
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,514
Yeah, yeah Dad, we're all set.

37
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:33,738
Students,

38
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:35,297
Let's go to France.

39
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:36,658
Does that mean...

40
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:37,505
go?

41
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,027
Don't know.

42
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,205
Look, this is for both of you,

43
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:43,414
alright?

44
00:05:43,438 --> 00:05:44,644
Have a great time.

45
00:05:44,683 --> 00:05:45,546
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah.

46
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:46,738
Both of us.
Let's go.

47
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:47,929
Alex.
Yes?

48
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,854
You take care of them.
I will.

49
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:02,576
I... I didn't think anything
could look worse than my yearbook photo.

50
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,821
How do you think I feel having
to look at you all the time?

51
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:09,908
Hey children, listen!

52
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:11,628
Excuse me, listen!

53
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:13,463
What is the call?

54
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,447
What the fuck does he want?

55
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:18,191
<i>Airport is not responsible
for their activities</i>

56
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:19,208
<i>Thank you.</i>

57
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,548
The airport does not endorse solicitors.

58
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:25,745
Good Clear, is correct

59
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:26,894
So...

60
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,769
Follow me.

61
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,433
We are going to France.

62
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,955
Death is not the end.

63
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,148
It will be for you
if you harass my students.

64
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,723
Hare Rama.

65
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:43,051
Fuck off.

66
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,298
I have to ask you a few questions
this evening.

67
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,189
Did you pack your bags yourself?

68
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,993
Have your belongings remained
in your possession the entire time?

69
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,503
Mr. Browning?

70
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:04,063
Yeah.

71
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:08,291
Have you received any packages
from persons unknown to you?

72
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,972
Same as your birthday.

73
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:23,884
What?

74
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,516
September 25,

75
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:27,099
9:25.

76
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,693
Your birthday's the same
as your departure time.

77
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,130
Because I looked at him.
Are you sure?

78
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,786
Lisa, wait up.

79
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:42,536
No, it's ok.

80
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,588
Fuck, that was good.

81
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,469
Dick.

82
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,333
Hey.
Hey, George, Dad said both.

83
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,666
Both of us, alright, man?

84
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,862
Come on, just give me some cash.

85
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,485
Hey, hey, knock it off.

86
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,136
Excuse me.
Catch.

87
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:56,847
You asshole.

88
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:09,642
Thanks.
You're welcome.

89
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:39,966
Alex,

90
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,686
let's go take a shit.

91
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,345
Why don't you go by yourself?

92
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:45,949
No, no, no, dude. Listen, ok?

93
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:47,208
Listen, take some knowledge.

94
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,194
We're about to board a seven-hour flight.

95
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,560
The toilets in coach are...

96
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:52,440
barely ventilated closets,
alright if that.

97
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,439
Now let's say halfway
through the flight right,

98
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:56,368
your body wants that food out.

99
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,318
You gotta go torque a wicked cable.
And then right after you...

100
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,738
like directly after you walks in...

101
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:03,250
Christa or Blake.

102
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,163
Did you want them to associate you
with that watery sting in their eye?

103
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,665
That reflexive gag
at the back of their throat?

104
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,608
John Denver.

105
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,537
Died in a plane crash.

106
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,740
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.</i>

107
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:38,185
<i>At this time, we would like
to begin preboarding</i>

108
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,358
<i>of Volée Air Flight,</i>

109
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:40,735
<i>180 to Paris,</i>

110
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:42,381
<i>through Gate 46.</i>

111
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:55,766
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?

112
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,209
How did we lose him?

113
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,628
21.22.23.

114
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:05,780
Come sir.
Go. Go.

115
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:08,085
25.

116
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:09,577
26.

117
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,204
Go.

118
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:36,894
That hurt.

119
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:53,229
My little baby.

120
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:56,503
That's a good sign.
The younger, the better.

121
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,479
It'd be a fucked-up God
to take down this plane.

122
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:00,952
Hi.

123
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,593
A really fucked-up God.

124
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,304
Hi.
Hey, Tod.

125
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:11,617
Hello. How you doing?

126
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,248
I'm gonna sit here.

127
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,304
Can you switch seats with Christa?

128
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:32,315
God.

129
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,451
You know, I would,
but I got a bladder thing.

130
00:11:35,522 --> 00:11:37,990
It's a urinary tract infection.

131
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,573
Let's go ask Alex.

132
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,071
Alex,

133
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:52,210
could you trade seats with Blake
so she and I could sit together?

134
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:55,471
She asked Tod, but he said
he had some sort of medical thing.

135
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,458
Please?

136
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,495
Yeah.

137
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,515
You're so sweet.

138
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,797
Thanks Alex.

139
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:08,440
Thank you, Alex.

140
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,676
You're welcome, you're welcome.

141
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,634
Fag.

142
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,807
Did you...

143
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:19,210
really think we're gonna
titty fuck them over Greenland?

144
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,853
You know,

145
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:22,813
because of you, I gotta sit here
and watch

146
00:12:22,837 --> 00:12:24,869
fucking Stuart Little.

147
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:27,142
Thank you.

148
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,486
Thanks man.

149
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,572
That's great.

150
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:33,574
Sorry I'm late.
Your number?

151
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:35,065
This way please.
That's my seat right there.

152
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:36,953
Hello?

153
00:12:36,977 --> 00:12:38,402
I'm going that way.

154
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,129
<i>May I have your attention?</i>

155
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:43,922
<i>To properly fasten your seat belts,
slide the flat portion into the buckle.</i>

156
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:50,914
<i>Equipped with six emergency exits.
Two in front, two over the wing, two in the rear.</i>

157
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,437
<i>All exits are clearly marked.</i>

158
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:55,662
<i>Follow the red exit signs
and public lighting in the aisle way.</i>

159
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,960
<i>Flight attendants, prepare for departure.</i>

160
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:33,103
Atention!

161
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:35,400
Our journey begins!

162
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,148
Alright!

163
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,069
Yeah.

164
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,498
Whatever.

165
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,337
It's ok.

166
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,727
I wanna go.
It's fine.

167
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,945
It's ok, honey, I...

168
00:14:31,578 --> 00:14:33,156
What the fuck...

169
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,558
Oh my God!

170
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,154
Everybody!

171
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:53,577
Quick. Quick. Quick.

172
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,498
No! No!

173
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,418
Christa! No!

174
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,849
Alex,

175
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,950
could you trade seats with Blake
so she and I could sit together?

176
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,740
She asked Tod, but he said
he had some medical thing.

177
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,159
Please?

178
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,159
What's up, dude?

179
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,328
Is there a problem, sir?

180
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:07,395
What's your problem?

181
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:08,775
Alex, what happen?

182
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,749
The fucking plane's gonna explode.

183
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:12,041
Shut up Browning.

184
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,252
You're so not funny.

185
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,439
If this is your joke

186
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:16,462
It's not a joke. It's not a joke.

187
00:16:16,487 --> 00:16:17,590
Alex take it easy.

188
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:18,995
That's it sit down, Browning.

189
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,092
It's going down.

190
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:21,538
We will remove you fro this airplane.

191
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,871
I'll remove him.
I'll remove myself.

192
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:25,230
Excuse me.
Get off him.

193
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,903
That's my seat right there.
This plane is going down.

194
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,322
Everybody in the aisle, off the plane.

195
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,655
Get off the plane.
Stay where you are.

196
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,274
Just sit tight.
The fucking plane is going down.

197
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,080
Go check him out.
See how he's doing.

198
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:39,813
Ok.

199
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,051
I got my ticket here.
Get off me.

200
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,118
Jerk.

201
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,297
Hey.
You got this?

202
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,024
No one gets back on board.

203
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,221
That's my call.

204
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:00,891
Wait, please.

205
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,079
I've got 40 students
going to Paris, please.

206
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:05,329
Please.
Look, you must understand my position.

207
00:17:05,354 --> 00:17:07,429
I do, I understand and I apologize for Alex.

208
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:09,305
But one of us needs to be on that plane.

209
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,581
I cannot let students
go to Paris for ten days

210
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:12,853
Carter no!

211
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,264
Sit the fuck down, Carter.

212
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,201
Sit.

213
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,616
One of you can go on the flight
and that's it.

214
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,225
Larry.

215
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,936
Look, the airline's not taking this very well.
But they'll let one of us back on, it's fine.

216
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,755
The rest of us can take an 11:10 flight. It
gets in three hours later, it's alright.

217
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,790
I'll stay.

218
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,082
No, no, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane,

219
00:17:33,106 --> 00:17:34,135
it's fine.

220
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:36,888
Hi, Mr. Murnau. See, I was in the bathroom.

221
00:17:36,962 --> 00:17:38,530
And the lock, it was stuck and...

222
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,625
Wait, I didn't fight with anyone.

223
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,469
Damn.

224
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,539
Thanks.

225
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,265
I just, I called your parents.
They're on their way.

226
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,928
We should be going.

227
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,139
Alex, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

228
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,232
I saw it.

229
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,442
Like, I don't know. I saw it.
I saw it...

230
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:12,983
on the runway. I saw it take off.

231
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,140
I saw out my window, I saw...

232
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:16,083
the ground and, and...

233
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:16,904
Carter.

234
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,919
The cabin, it starts to shake, right.
And...

235
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:20,491
the left side blows up.

236
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,350
And then the whole plane just explodes.

237
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,174
And it was so real.

238
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:26,077
Just like how everything happens,
you know?

239
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:27,763
You been on planes that blew up?

240
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,273
You must have fallen asleep.

241
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:32,794
We get thrown off the plane.

242
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,362
We blow what, a half a day in Paris

243
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,498
all because Browning
has a bad fucking dream?

244
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,565
But wait, the plane,
it's gonna blow up.

245
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:40,758
It's gonna blow up.
Hey, hey.

246
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,212
Fuck you, Horton.
Tod.

247
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:44,486
The only trip you're taking
is to the fucking hospital.

248
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,988
Get off him.

249
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:47,239
Hey, hey!
Alex!

250
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:48,668
Stop it!
Come on, now.

251
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:53,495
There they go,

252
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:54,994
here we stay.

253
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,084
You're paying for my trip, Browning.

254
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:00,447
I wish you were on that plane.

255
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,432
You fucking prick.
Shit!

256
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:13,431
Call it in. Security

257
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,877
You're looking at me as if I caused this.

258
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,267
I didn't cause this.

259
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,220
Are there any survivors?

260
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,439
How should I know?

261
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,729
What, you think I'm some sort of?
He's not a witch.

262
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,018
Hello, I'm Howard Seigel,

263
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:41,882
National Transportation Safety Board.

264
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:43,772
We've contacted all your families.

265
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:45,263
They are on the way.

266
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,443
Is there anyone here who...

267
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:50,307
feels they might need
a little medical attention

268
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:52,541
or spiritual counseling at this time?

269
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,243
What's going on?

270
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,592
Are there any survivors?

271
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,841
Well, the cause for the explosion
is still undetermined.

272
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,030
The Nassau County authorities
are on the scene.

273
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,290
Naval Search and Rescue en route.

274
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,288
We...

275
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,727
Excuse me.

276
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,976
I'm agent Weine, this is agent Schreck.

277
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,811
We're with the FBI.

278
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,355
I understand how you all
must be feeling right now.

279
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,351
I know it's gonna be difficult for you.

280
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,860
We're gonna ask you couple of questions
regarding today's events,

281
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:20,516
while they're still fresh in your mind.

282
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,562
This will prove invaluable
to our rescue attempts

283
00:21:23,587 --> 00:21:25,492
and any potential criminal investigation.

284
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,986
You said, listen to me.

285
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,166
This plane will explode on takeoff.

286
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,369
How did you know that?

287
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,893
I got this feeling.

288
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,382
This weird feeling.

289
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,071
Did you take any sedatives
before boarding the plane,

290
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,876
or on board did you take any sleeping,

291
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,612
pills, any narcotics, hallucinogens?

292
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,417
Alex, do you take any drugs?
No.

293
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,501
I saw it.

294
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,147
I saw it happen.

295
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,233
I saw the plane explode.

296
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,405
Did the real feelings have anything
to do with your saying that

297
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:04,663
you wished that Carter
Horton was on the plane

298
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:06,440
just before it exploded?

299
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,205
No.

300
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:10,202
Then why'd you say it?

301
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,443
Because I really didn't think
it was gonna happen.

302
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,052
If that's the case Alex,

303
00:22:15,893 --> 00:22:17,446
then why did you really
get off the plane?

304
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,455
My brother George,

305
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,123
he told me to go,

306
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:26,735
and keep an eye on Alex.

307
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:28,794
And...

308
00:22:28,997 --> 00:22:29,670
so...

309
00:22:30,568 --> 00:22:31,763
he stayed and...

310
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,158
He told me to get off the plane.

311
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,641
Larry Murnau said...

312
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,518
I should get back on but I...

313
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:46,783
I told him that he should go.

314
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,025
I sent him back on the plane.

315
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,662
Alright.

316
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,053
Nobody forced you off the plane.

317
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,225
You said you weren't friends
with those that were.

318
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,145
So Clear, why did you get off the plane?

319
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,934
Because I saw and I heard Alex.

320
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,278
And I believed him.

321
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:30,183
Honey.

322
00:23:33,856 --> 00:23:34,495
God.

323
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,731
There he is.

324
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,621
Over here.

325
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:07,623
Thank you for the ride.

326
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,760
<i>You're looking

00:25:31,482 --> 00:25:34,449
<i>Authorities are pessimistic
about the possibility</i>

335
00:25:34,504 --> 00:25:37,243
<i>of finding anyone alive
from the ill-fated flight.</i>

336
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,288
<i>All 287 passengers are feared dead.</i>

337
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:45,560
<i>Amongst the travelers,
a class of 40 students and four teachers</i>

338
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,295
<i>from Mount Abraham High School
in southeast New York</i>

339
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,729
<i>en route to Paris on a field trip.</i>

340
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,755
<i>There are reports that several students
were removed from the aircraft</i>

341
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,238
<i>moments before departure.</i>

342
00:25:56,304 --> 00:26:00,307
<i>However investigators remain guarded
about the specifics of this incident.</i>

343
00:26:00,902 --> 00:26:03,979
<i>Authorities from the National
Transportation and Safety Board</i>

344
00:26:04,004 --> 00:26:06,939
<i>and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
have arrived at JFK</i>

345
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,483
<i>to begin the initial investigation.</i>

346
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,572
<i>Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long Island</i>

347
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,947
<i>report seeing the plane explode.</i>

348
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:18,033
<i>No other aircraft
were visibly near Flight 180.</i>

349
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,995
<i>At JFK, air traffic controllers
are corroborating</i>

350
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,830
<i>these eyewitness accounts.</i>

351
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,362
<i>After the explosion,</i>

352
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:28,630
<i>debris apparently rained into the
Atlantic Ocean for several miles.</i>

353
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,091
<i>However, investigators are cautious
about verifying these accounts</i>

354
00:26:32,317 --> 00:26:36,513
<i>believing they'll learn more from the
found debris when daylight arrives.</i>

355
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,342
<i>Thirty-nine days have passed</i>

356
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,357
<i>since we lost our 39 loved ones,</i>

357
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:02,233
<i>friends and teachers.</i>

358
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,986
<i>As each day passes,</i>

359
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,449
<i>without a determining cause
for the accident</i>

360
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,449
<i>we ask ourselves.</i>

361
00:27:09,652 --> 00:27:10,464
<i>Why?</i>

362
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,417
<i>Ecclesiastes tells us:</i>

363
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,163
<i>Man,</i>

364
00:27:15,187 --> 00:27:17,207
<i>no more knows his own time,</i>

365
00:27:17,231 --> 00:27:19,910
<i>than fish taken in the fatal net</i>

366
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,617
<i>or birds trapped in the snare.</i>

367
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,297
<i>Like these,</i>

368
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:26,383
<i>the children of men caught,</i>

369
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:28,906
<i>when the time falls
suddenly upon them.</i>

370
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,039
<i>And so before we can heal,</i>

371
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,475
<i>before we can escape
the presence of death,</i>

372
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:36,932
<i>and time,</i>

373
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,688
<i>we must mourn and celebrate theirs,</i>

374
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,356
<i>with this...</i>

375
00:27:41,575 --> 00:27:42,544
<i>memorial.</i>

376
00:28:26,941 --> 00:28:29,860
I hope you don't think
because my name ain't up on this wall

377
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:31,128
that I owe you anything.

378
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,339
I don't.

379
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,214
Because all I owe are these people.

380
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,131
To live my life to the fullest.

381
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,875
Why don't you stay off the J.D.,
then, Carter?

382
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:43,281
Listen. Don't you ever fucking tell me
what to do, alright?

383
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,972
I control my life, not you.

384
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,900
Carter.

385
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,330
I'm never gonna die.

386
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,324
Hey, Alex.

387
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,355
Hey.
Hey.

388
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,118
I took my driver's test last week
at the DMV.

389
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,275
Got a 70.

390
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:09,464
It's the lowest score
you can get, but I passed.

391
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,331
The thing is when I was done with the test

392
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:13,725
You know the guy that drives
with you during the test?

393
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,473
Right.

394
00:29:14,675 --> 00:29:16,117
Yeah well, he goes...

395
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:16,826
Young man,

396
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:18,990
you're gonna die at a very young age.

397
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:21,139
Yeah. Yeah.

398
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:23,904
Is that true?

399
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:25,710
Not now,

400
00:29:25,734 --> 00:29:27,264
not here, not ever, Billy.

401
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,380
If I ask out Cynthia Paster,

402
00:29:32,991 --> 00:29:34,358
will she say no?
Fuck.

403
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,022
Ok.

404
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:36,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

405
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,450
Miss Lewton.
Don't talk to me.

406
00:29:47,475 --> 00:29:48,972
You scare the hell out of me.

407
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:51,968
I'm gonna go up.

408
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,225
Hey.

409
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,295
Hey.

410
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,887
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, man right.

411
00:30:08,655 --> 00:30:09,546
I miss you,

412
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:11,256
you know?
Yeah.

413
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,662
Yeah, I miss you too.

414
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:17,092
But my father, you know,
he doesn't understand.

415
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,302
Yeah.

416
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,294
Hey look, when he gets over this thing,

417
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:23,810
you and me,

418
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:26,073
little road trip to the city, you know?

419
00:30:26,335 --> 00:30:27,520
Catch the Yanks.

420
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:28,732
Yeah.

421
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:30,466
Yeah, alright, we'll do that.

422
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,230
Cool.

423
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,239
Look, I'd better go.

424
00:30:36,263 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah.

425
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,324
This thing Miss Lewton showed me in class,
they're gonna let me read it.

426
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,245
It says what I'm feeling.

427
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:46,893
Take care, man.

428
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,690
Because of you, I'm still alive.

429
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,110
Thank you.

430
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,204
We say, that the hour of
death cannot be forecast.

431
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,362
But...

432
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:19,115
when we say this,

433
00:31:19,709 --> 00:31:22,368
we imagine that the hour
is placed in an obscure...

434
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:24,060
and distant future.

435
00:31:25,146 --> 00:31:27,207
It never occurs to us
that it has...

436
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:28,403
any connection,

437
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:30,185
with the day already begun.

438
00:31:31,317 --> 00:31:34,231
Or that death could arrive
this same afternoon.

439
00:31:35,848 --> 00:31:38,684
This afternoon, which is so certain

440
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,387
and which has every hour,

441
00:31:42,816 --> 00:31:43,976
filled in advance.

442
00:37:29,027 --> 00:37:29,980
What happened?

443
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:32,417
Where's Tod?

444
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,106
Alex.

445
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,754
Get out of here.

446
00:37:54,938 --> 00:37:56,012
Didn't you see it?

447
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:57,313
What happened?

448
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,392
You caused Tod so much guilt over
George staying on the plane,

449
00:38:02,188 --> 00:38:03,578
he took his own life.

450
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,742
No.
Time to go.

451
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,123
Look,

452
00:38:09,216 --> 00:38:10,678
he wouldn't do that.

453
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:14,147
Ok? He said to me we'd be friends
again after you got better.

454
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:17,436
Why would he make plans with me
if he was thinking about killing himself?

455
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,629
Mr. Waggner.

456
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,383
Mr. Waggner.
Here we go.

457
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,506
Easy.

458
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,688
Alright.

459
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:29,243
Here we go.

460
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,760
Let's go.

461
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,772
Almost autumn.

462
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,438
It's only the end of June.

463
00:39:23,914 --> 00:39:25,969
Yeah, but everything's
always in transition.

464
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:28,741
If you focus, even now,
just one week into summer,

465
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,379
you can almost feel autumn coming.

466
00:39:31,232 --> 00:39:33,098
Kind of like being able to see the future.

467
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:36,659
Why were you at Tod's house last night?

468
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,165
I've seen enough TV to know that
the FBI doesn't investigate teen suicides.

469
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:46,189
They were there last night.
That means one,

470
00:39:46,473 --> 00:39:48,204
they still don't have a clue
what caused the crash.

471
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:50,112
They haven't ruled out anything.

472
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,376
The fact that seven people got off
the plane is probably weird enough.

473
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,090
Not to mention that one of those people
had a vision,

474
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:57,262
or whatever

475
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,481
of the plane exploding minutes before
it did explode, is highly suspicious.

476
00:40:02,007 --> 00:40:05,051
And it doesn't help that the visionary's
friend just committed suicide.

477
00:40:07,097 --> 00:40:08,426
Why were you there last night?

478
00:40:14,755 --> 00:40:16,011
Do you know what this is?

479
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:20,712
This is a...

480
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,478
Who's the spring-head guy?

481
00:40:26,913 --> 00:40:27,944
It's you.

482
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,725
Not a likeness.

483
00:40:32,132 --> 00:40:34,671
It's how you make me feel, Alex.

484
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,280
I'm sorry.

485
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:42,548
You know, like you, the sculpture
doesn't even know what or why it is.

486
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:45,376
It's reluctant to take form.

487
00:40:45,923 --> 00:40:47,683
And yet, creating an absolute...

488
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,462
but incomprehensible attraction.

489
00:40:53,805 --> 00:40:56,908
In four years of high school,
we haven't said one word to each other.

490
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,362
At that moment on the plane,
I felt...

491
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:00,447
what you felt.

492
00:41:00,817 --> 00:41:04,291
I didn't even know where those emotions were
coming from until you started freaking out.

493
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:07,870
I didn't see what you saw,

494
00:41:08,554 --> 00:41:09,780
but I felt it.

495
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,515
You can still feel it, can't you?

496
00:41:13,546 --> 00:41:16,069
Something from that day is still with you.

497
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,704
I know because I can still feel you.

498
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,743
That's why I was there last night.

499
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:30,990
You know, I've never dealt
with death before.

500
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,748
This could all be in our head.

501
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:37,953
It just feels like it's all around us.

502
00:41:38,855 --> 00:41:39,641
It?

503
00:41:42,642 --> 00:41:44,477
What if Tod was just the first?

504
00:41:46,451 --> 00:41:47,328
Of us?

505
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,756
Is that something that you're feeling?

506
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,336
I don't know, you know.
I just wish I could see him again.

507
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,007
One last time.

508
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,162
So maybe I would know.

509
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:00,993
Then let's go see him.

510
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,466
Easy.

511
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,201
Gives me a rush.

512
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:40,803
This place?

513
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,998
Doing something I'm not supposed to.

514
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,364
Come on.

515
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,458
Hurry up.

516
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,284
Is that him?

517
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:12,284
I think.

518
00:43:12,764 --> 00:43:15,141
Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?

519
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,151
Yeah, that's him.

520
00:43:18,686 --> 00:43:21,046
But whatever it was that made him Tod
is definitely gone.

521
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:25,778
Christ.

522
00:43:29,137 --> 00:43:30,130
Please.

523
00:43:31,514 --> 00:43:32,849
You'll wake the dead.

524
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:45,572
Why did his hand do that?

525
00:43:45,804 --> 00:43:46,904
Chemicals,

526
00:43:47,405 --> 00:43:49,109
in the vascular flush create...

527
00:43:49,134 --> 00:43:51,016
cadaveric spasms.

528
00:43:51,771 --> 00:43:52,624
Look...

529
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,633
I'm his friend and...
I know who you are.

530
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,283
What are all those tiny marks?

531
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,890
Cuticle lacerations
from pulling at the wire.

532
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,219
Pulling at the wire?

533
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,008
If he was pulling at the wire,
he wasn't trying to kill himself.

534
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,261
It was an accident.

535
00:44:10,285 --> 00:44:11,303
In death,

536
00:44:11,745 --> 00:44:13,274
there are no accidents.

537
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,848
No coincidences.

538
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:16,496
No mishaps.

539
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,011
And no escapes.

540
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,873
What you have to realize
is that we're all just a...

541
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,725
mouse that a cat has by the tail.

542
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,529
Every single move we make,

543
00:44:28,772 --> 00:44:30,966
from the mundane
to the monumental,

544
00:44:31,286 --> 00:44:33,818
the red light that we stop at or run

545
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,756
the people we have sex with
or won't with us

546
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,218
the airplanes that we ride
or walk out of

547
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,419
it's all part of death's sadistic design,

548
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:45,275
leading to the grave.

549
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,633
Design?

550
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,093
Does that mean if...

551
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:54,023
you figure out the design,
you could cheat death?

552
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,384
Alex.

553
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,431
You've already done that
by walking off the plane.

554
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,854
Your friend's departure...

555
00:45:02,259 --> 00:45:04,470
shows that death has a new design,

556
00:45:04,672 --> 00:45:06,048
for all of you.

557
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:10,112
Now, you have to figure out how...

558
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:11,280
and when...

559
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:13,138
it's coming back at you.

560
00:45:14,552 --> 00:45:16,011
Play your hunch, Alex.

561
00:45:16,325 --> 00:45:18,520
If you think you can get away with it.

562
00:45:19,385 --> 00:45:20,581
But remember...

563
00:45:21,746 --> 00:45:22,666
the risk...

564
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,446
of cheating the plan

565
00:45:24,754 --> 00:45:27,171
of disrespecting the design,

566
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:29,028
could incite a fury

567
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:32,044
that could terrorize
even the Grim Reaper.

568
00:45:34,118 --> 00:45:37,700
And you don't even wanna fuck
with that Mack Daddy.

569
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,698
Ok, then, well...

570
00:45:44,574 --> 00:45:46,824
Yeah, I'm sorry we broke in and...

571
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,192
No harm.

572
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:49,761
No foul.

573
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:55,123
I'll see you soon.

574
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:04,467
The mortician said
that death has a design.

575
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:05,912
Ok.

576
00:46:08,035 --> 00:46:09,373
I'm talking about omens.

577
00:46:10,045 --> 00:46:11,048
How do we know,

578
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,686
that just by sitting here,
by sipping this coffee

579
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:14,927
or breathing the air,

580
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:17,596
or crossing the intersection
that we haven't started...

581
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,014
in motion,

582
00:46:19,731 --> 00:46:21,372
the events that will lead to our death

583
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,669
40 years from now,
10 years from now, tomorrow?

584
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,230
We don't,

585
00:46:26,982 --> 00:46:28,561
unless we open ourselves up

586
00:46:28,798 --> 00:46:31,232
to the signs it's willing to show us.

587
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:36,736
I don't understand.

588
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:38,536
Did you see Tod die?

589
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,953
Did it happen again,

590
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:42,465
like on the plane?

591
00:46:42,794 --> 00:46:43,372
No.

592
00:46:43,669 --> 00:46:46,052
No it didn't, but I mean
it might as well have.

593
00:46:46,895 --> 00:46:49,044
This is a message of something, Clear.

594
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,796
Or someone,

595
00:46:51,535 --> 00:46:53,017
hinting at a design.

596
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,425
Total bullshit.

597
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:57,026
I mean, you can find
death omens anywhere you want to.

598
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,126
Coffee.
Starts with a C and ends with an E.

599
00:47:00,446 --> 00:47:02,914
So does the word choke.
So, what we're gonna choke to death?

600
00:47:03,778 --> 00:47:05,028
I wanna hear you.

601
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,180
We'll go nuts if you start with this shit.

602
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:11,108
The mortician said
that death has a design,

603
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:12,443
right?

604
00:47:12,972 --> 00:47:13,735
Now what if...

605
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:18,442
you, me, Tod, Carter,
Terry, Billy, Miss Lewton,

606
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:21,452
messed up that design
for whatever reason? I...

607
00:47:21,476 --> 00:47:22,703
saw death's plan,

608
00:47:23,676 --> 00:47:24,762
then we cheated it.

609
00:47:25,496 --> 00:47:26,776
But what if it was our time?

610
00:47:26,801 --> 00:47:28,691
What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?

611
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:31,314
What if it still is our time?

612
00:47:32,867 --> 00:47:33,797
If it is,

613
00:47:34,447 --> 00:47:35,697
then it's not finished.

614
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,676
And we will die...

615
00:47:38,173 --> 00:47:39,468
now, not later.

616
00:47:40,802 --> 00:47:41,866
Unless.

617
00:47:43,015 --> 00:47:45,671
Unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.

618
00:47:55,884 --> 00:47:57,938
After hearing you, I do believe

619
00:47:59,816 --> 00:48:01,321
that Tod killed himself.

620
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,125
Yeah, I'm fine. Whatever.

621
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,274
You alright man?

622
00:48:34,298 --> 00:48:35,990
Hey baby, come on, not now.

623
00:48:37,138 --> 00:48:37,943
Carter.

624
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,250
It looks like we have
a bit of a reunion here.

625
00:48:41,275 --> 00:48:42,115
Let it go.

626
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:43,507
When are you moving?

627
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,795
A couple weeks.

628
00:48:45,306 --> 00:48:46,540
That's too bad.
You dick.

629
00:48:46,782 --> 00:48:47,913
We're losing our favorite teacher.

630
00:48:47,937 --> 00:48:48,797
Baby, come on.

631
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:49,790
Look, guys.

632
00:48:49,814 --> 00:48:51,344
There's something
I need to tell you, ok?

633
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:52,034
Alex.

634
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:53,001
And you lived here your whole life?

635
00:48:53,227 --> 00:48:53,887
Yeah.

636
00:48:54,111 --> 00:48:55,379
And now she's gotta move...
Hey Carter, please listen...

637
00:48:55,616 --> 00:48:57,277
all because of Browning.
We're all in danger!

638
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:57,979
Enough!

639
00:48:58,107 --> 00:48:59,092
Both of you.

640
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,790
They died and we lived.

641
00:49:02,537 --> 00:49:03,522
Get over it.

642
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:08,381
I will not let this plane crash
be the most important thing in my life.

643
00:49:10,378 --> 00:49:11,520
I'm moving on,

644
00:49:11,901 --> 00:49:12,706
Carter.

645
00:49:13,048 --> 00:49:15,007
And if you wanna waste your life,

646
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,511
beating the shit out of Alex
every time you see him.

647
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,631
Then you can just drop fucking dead.

648
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,219
<i>Ok.
You look like a smart shopper.</i>

649
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,553
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

650
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:38,336
<i>Let's just say, you were to see this
knife set in a department store.</i>

651
00:49:38,399 --> 00:49:40,007
<i>What do you think you'd have to pay?</i>

652
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,750
<i>That's a huge knife set, but how many?</i>

653
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:48,724
<i>Hello?</i>

654
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,555
Is Alex there?

655
00:49:51,452 --> 00:49:53,155
<i>Hi, Clear. Yeah, just a minute.</i>

656
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,897
It's Clear, again.

657
00:49:55,921 --> 00:49:56,909
You wanna talk to her?

658
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,036
<i>Clear, he's in the shower.</i>

659
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,365
<i>Can I get him to call you back?</i>

660
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:07,029
Sure, bye.

661
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,334
She's concerned about you.

662
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,396
I'm concerned about you.

663
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,233
Why won't you talk to her?

664
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,374
Or me?

665
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,170
Dad, you and Mom
have both been a big help.

666
00:50:22,726 --> 00:50:25,357
But there's something I need
to understand before I can talk,

667
00:50:26,211 --> 00:50:27,055
to anyone.

668
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,211
<i>The National Transportation Safety Board
has a new theory tonight</i>

669
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,824
<i>on the possible cause of the explosion
of Volée Air Flight 180.</i>

670
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:40,148
<i>Officials believe
deterioration of silicon insulation</i>

671
00:50:40,263 --> 00:50:42,764
<i>on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump</i>

672
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,783
<i>may have leaked combustible fluids.</i>

673
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:45,989
<i>A spark in the fuel,</i>

674
00:50:46,013 --> 00:50:48,283
<i>beneath the coach cabin in the fuselage,</i>
That's Tod's seat.

675
00:50:48,486 --> 00:50:51,290
<i>May have ignited the fuel line
and proceeded to the fuel pump</i>

676
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,934
<i>which would have set off
the catastrophic explosion.</i>

677
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,925
The path of the explosion.

678
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,408
Ok, the first was Tod.

679
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:31,613
Then it was Terry.

680
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:34,315
They're dying in the order
they would have died.

681
00:51:34,955 --> 00:51:36,682
That's death's design.

682
00:51:37,752 --> 00:51:39,213
Miss Lewton's next.

683
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:44,060
And whenever I can fall asleep, I just...

684
00:51:44,236 --> 00:51:45,528
I see Terry Chaney.

685
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,551
And in the day,

686
00:51:47,717 --> 00:51:50,629
out of nowhere I hear the
sound of my own voice in my head

687
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,461
saying to Larry Murnau.

688
00:51:52,502 --> 00:51:53,181
No.

689
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,578
You know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane.

690
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:57,977
Everything reminds me of that day.

691
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:01,940
Right.

692
00:52:02,555 --> 00:52:03,186
Yeah.

693
00:52:03,211 --> 00:52:04,763
I'm hoping a change will help.

694
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:05,527
It's just that...

695
00:52:07,055 --> 00:52:08,113
I've lived...

696
00:52:08,137 --> 00:52:09,629
I've lived here my whole life,

697
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,995
you know and everywhere I looked
were great memories.

698
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,095
And now all I see is...

699
00:52:15,595 --> 00:52:16,949
Larry and those...

700
00:52:17,286 --> 00:52:18,081
those kids,

701
00:52:18,855 --> 00:52:19,683
you know?

702
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:21,376
Just...

703
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:25,090
just looking out my own front yard
makes me feel nothing but fear.

704
00:52:31,564 --> 00:52:33,384
Laura, I'm gonna have to call you back.

705
00:52:34,366 --> 00:52:35,009
Right.

706
00:52:44,692 --> 00:52:47,118
Hi, this is Valerie Lewton.
I need agent Schreck.

707
00:53:13,572 --> 00:53:14,929
What are you doing here?

708
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:17,312
I was just...

709
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,270
I was checking the air in the tire
to make sure it's safe.

710
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,848
Get in the car.

711
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,159
Put on your seat belt.

712
00:53:59,925 --> 00:54:01,226
I believe that...

713
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:04,987
Miss Lewton is next.

714
00:54:06,422 --> 00:54:07,463
Next?
Yes.

715
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:10,944
Yeah, next, because...

716
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:12,719
there's this pattern...

717
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:14,476
that's occurring.

718
00:54:14,641 --> 00:54:16,032
Right, a pattern, yeah.

719
00:54:16,415 --> 00:54:17,508
You noticed that too?

720
00:54:34,374 --> 00:54:35,617
Mom's favorite.

721
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,546
So, what about this pattern, Alex?

722
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,840
Did you see it
in another one of your visions?

723
00:55:03,306 --> 00:55:05,217
Did you catch it in some TV static?

724
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,085
You know, I never asked for...

725
00:55:09,785 --> 00:55:11,098
for what happened on the plane.

726
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:14,341
You guys are gonna sit on your
little chairs and make fun of me.

727
00:55:14,508 --> 00:55:15,676
Whatever, it's fine.

728
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:18,176
But I saved six lives on that plane.

729
00:55:19,035 --> 00:55:22,651
Six lives, and everybody in my
entire school thinks I'm a freak.

730
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,434
And I'm...

731
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:25,936
I'm not suffering from...

732
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,143
posttraumatic stress.

733
00:55:27,168 --> 00:55:29,832
I don't have a narcissistic deity complex.

734
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,733
I'm not going Dahmer,

735
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:33,214
on you guys.

736
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:35,003
This just is.

737
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,280
There is a pattern,

738
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,486
for us all.

739
00:55:38,558 --> 00:55:39,616
There's a pattern for you,

740
00:55:40,272 --> 00:55:42,494
There's a pattern,
there's a design for everyone.

741
00:55:42,518 --> 00:55:43,714
I don't know how yet.

742
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,318
But I'm gonna break this one.

743
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,703
Alex,

744
00:57:07,231 --> 00:57:09,789
you came to our attention at first
because you were under suspicion

745
00:57:09,813 --> 00:57:11,036
in this plane explosion.

746
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,208
Now,

747
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:15,465
I know you didn't blow up the plane.

748
00:57:16,254 --> 00:57:17,630
And we were ready to move on,

749
00:57:18,778 --> 00:57:20,833
but then the other survivors started to die.

750
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:22,778
First, your friend Tod.

751
00:57:23,379 --> 00:57:25,708
Then Terry Chaney,
while you were there at the scene.

752
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,186
And now tonight we pick you
up at Val Lewton's house.

753
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,821
Alex, nobody has control
over life and death.

754
00:57:30,846 --> 00:57:32,187
Unless they are taking lives,

755
00:57:32,211 --> 00:57:33,350
and causing death.

756
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,143
Now, can you promise me
that no one else is going to die?

757
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:39,909
No, I can't.

758
00:57:40,155 --> 00:57:42,674
As long as I'm in here,
it's out of my control, I'm sorry.

759
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:49,746
Ok.

760
00:57:50,785 --> 00:57:51,623
Go ahead.

761
00:57:51,647 --> 00:57:52,675
Get out of here.

762
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:55,277
Thank you.

763
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,148
That kid gives me the creeps.

764
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,425
What are we gonna do?
We got nothing to hold him.

765
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:10,196
That's not what I'm talking about.

766
00:58:10,895 --> 00:58:12,604
There were a couple of moments there...

767
00:58:14,721 --> 00:58:16,354
where I almost believed him.

768
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,901
Can I tell you something?
Don't take this the wrong way.

769
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,319
But sometimes,

770
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:22,854
you give me the creeps.

771
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,559
You've gotta stop this.
Stop this, it's a stupid mug.

772
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,259
You're out of here.

773
00:58:44,433 --> 00:58:45,620
Pretty soon, you'll be gone.

774
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,097
You'll be gone.

775
01:00:59,616 --> 01:01:00,381
Miss Lewton.

776
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:10,905
Miss Lewton.

777
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:13,950
Ok.

778
01:01:14,387 --> 01:01:15,379
Alright, ok. I...

779
01:01:15,712 --> 01:01:17,713
Ok. Ok. Ok. Just stay still, ok?

780
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,516
God. God. Miss Lewton.

781
01:01:43,378 --> 01:01:44,330
Hey, Alex.

782
01:02:05,424 --> 01:02:06,283
Dude.

783
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,525
I don't know where he is.

784
01:02:11,578 --> 01:02:12,800
He's not talking to me.

785
01:02:13,103 --> 01:02:13,860
Why?

786
01:02:14,845 --> 01:02:16,157
Because I didn't believe him.

787
01:02:16,716 --> 01:02:18,071
If he does contact you

788
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:21,235
I think it would be in the best
interest of your safety if you called us.

789
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:22,352
Now,

790
01:02:22,726 --> 01:02:23,874
here's my card.

791
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:25,976
Toll-free number.

792
01:02:30,327 --> 01:02:31,624
Interesting work.

793
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,426
Carter, you dick.

794
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,902
What are you doing?

795
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,792
Terry's name should be on this wall.

796
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:11,768
Shit.

797
01:03:13,298 --> 01:03:14,971
Why'd you want us
to meet you here anyway?

798
01:03:16,135 --> 01:03:17,407
Because they're watching me,

799
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,510
see if I go to Alex.

800
01:03:19,855 --> 01:03:21,469
That's why you're taking me.

801
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,089
Why would I wanna see him?

802
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,602
Because he knows
which one of us is next.

803
01:03:40,725 --> 01:03:42,959
So, drive the speed limit, ok?

804
01:03:44,076 --> 01:03:44,851
And...

805
01:03:45,037 --> 01:03:46,412
don't pass on the right.

806
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,571
Billy, wait a minute here.
I'm getting a vision.

807
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,530
You're the next one, man.

808
01:03:53,404 --> 01:03:54,717
Hey, man, why'd you say that?

809
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,653
Because if you say another word,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

810
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,683
He could be anywhere from here
to a mile down on the road.

811
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:24,332
So you guys drive down there,
start that way we'll meet around the middle.

812
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:25,774
It'll take half the time.

813
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,225
Do you think they're still up there?

814
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:01,802
Somehow,

815
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:04,156
Flight 180, are they still in flight?

816
01:05:04,694 --> 01:05:05,765
Somewhere,

817
01:05:06,382 --> 01:05:07,430
are they safe?

818
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:11,938
When I was a kid,

819
01:05:12,859 --> 01:05:14,132
like 6 or 7

820
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,495
I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

821
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,457
Lying awake at night just worrying.

822
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,773
Yeah, well, most kids do, I guess.

823
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,429
Most kids never have it happen.

824
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,124
When I was 10,

825
01:05:32,148 --> 01:05:34,512
my dad went into a 7-Eleven
for cigarettes.

826
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,182
I guess that he heard someone say,
Don't turn around.

827
01:05:37,294 --> 01:05:37,922
So...

828
01:05:37,946 --> 01:05:40,629
on reflex or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.

829
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,647
And the guy blew his head off.

830
01:05:45,498 --> 01:05:47,178
Life became shit after that.

831
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,287
My mom just couldn't deal anymore.

832
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,658
She married this asshole

833
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:56,810
who my mom with my real dad would
have crossed the street to avoid this guy.

834
01:05:58,114 --> 01:05:59,527
He really didn't want a kid.

835
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,669
So my mom didn't either anymore.

836
01:06:04,235 --> 01:06:05,408
If that was the design,

837
01:06:05,724 --> 01:06:07,458
for my father and my family

838
01:06:08,434 --> 01:06:09,528
then fuck death.

839
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,499
God, I have thought a lot,

840
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:15,489
about that somewhere, Alex.

841
01:06:15,948 --> 01:06:17,378
It exists that place.

842
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:19,355
Where my dad is still safe.

843
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:23,073
Where he had a full pack of cigarettes
that night and just kept driving.

844
01:06:24,456 --> 01:06:26,631
Where me and my mom
and my dad are still together

845
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:29,232
and have no idea about this life here.

846
01:06:32,242 --> 01:06:33,873
Where our friends are still in the sky.

847
01:06:36,009 --> 01:06:38,595
Where everyone gets a second chance.

848
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:41,027
Alex,

849
01:06:41,184 --> 01:06:42,337
we can't give up.

850
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,545
Look, I can't go home.

851
01:06:48,985 --> 01:06:51,617
Alright? Because after Miss Lewton,
they're gonna be looking for me.

852
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:53,901
No, we're taking you
to my dad's cabin woods.

853
01:06:54,142 --> 01:06:55,736
It's only a couple miles from my house.

854
01:06:55,908 --> 01:06:58,111
Alright, Browning, you fucking warlock.

855
01:06:59,212 --> 01:07:00,504
Did you know about Miss Lewton or what?

856
01:07:01,141 --> 01:07:02,626
Why do you think I was hiding?

857
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,907
Billy told the FBI he saw you
running from her house.

858
01:07:06,753 --> 01:07:08,557
I was running because
they blame me for everything.

859
01:07:08,582 --> 01:07:10,273
They blame me for Tod,
they blame me for her,

860
01:07:10,297 --> 01:07:11,951
They blame me
for the fucking plane crash Billy.

861
01:07:11,952 --> 01:07:14,602
The fire like caramelized her blood Alex.

862
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:15,912
Your shoe prints were in it.

863
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,730
Your fingerprints were on the knives.

864
01:07:17,754 --> 01:07:19,423
I told you Billy,
I told you they were not...

865
01:07:19,448 --> 01:07:22,109
I'm not talking about whether
you did alright or not you did it.

866
01:07:22,133 --> 01:07:23,495
Or even if you knew she was dead.

867
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:25,529
Did you know she was gonna be next...

868
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:27,057
before she was?

869
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,258
Yeah, I did.

870
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,249
I knew.

871
01:07:38,116 --> 01:07:38,788
Alright.

872
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:40,836
Out of us,

873
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:43,444
who's next to see it?

874
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:44,632
Please,

875
01:07:45,476 --> 01:07:47,645
tell me I'm gonna get to see
the Jets win a Super Bowl.

876
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,387
It's me, right?

877
01:07:50,163 --> 01:07:51,311
That's why you're not saying.

878
01:07:53,409 --> 01:07:56,661
Alright I knew I should have felt up
Tammy in the pool that time.

879
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:57,937
What are you whining about?

880
01:07:57,961 --> 01:07:59,939
He say I'm next.
He didn't say anything.

881
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:01,493
Just drive.

882
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:02,775
Shit,

883
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,737
you have a responsibility to tell me.

884
01:08:04,879 --> 01:08:07,151
Do you think it's gonna make it
easier to know, Carter?

885
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,601
It's not, it's gonna make it fucking harder.

886
01:08:12,234 --> 01:08:13,077
Yeah you know,

887
01:08:13,101 --> 01:08:14,672
you get off having control over me.

888
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,539
You let me decide how to deal with it.

889
01:08:16,563 --> 01:08:18,265
It doesn't matter who's next.

890
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:21,210
Because we're all on the same list.

891
01:08:21,234 --> 01:08:22,040
All of us.

892
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:24,463
Fuck.

893
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:26,813
Really?

894
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:35,395
Alright, then why bother?

895
01:08:35,727 --> 01:08:37,148
What's the fucking point, right?

896
01:08:37,173 --> 01:08:39,061
Me and Terry, we'll be back together
on the other side,

897
01:08:39,085 --> 01:08:40,313
so why wait any longer?

898
01:08:42,724 --> 01:08:43,782
Carter, what are you doing?

899
01:08:46,428 --> 01:08:47,482
Carter, slow down.

900
01:08:48,016 --> 01:08:49,983
Slow down, Carter!
Fuck you.

901
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,534
Knock it off.

902
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,845
May as well go out
on my own free will, right?

903
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:57,371
Not with us in the fucking car.

904
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,890
Jesus, Carter, no.
Stop it.

905
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,404
Carter, stop the car.

906
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,565
Hey, what's the fucking worry
if it ain't your time?

907
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,594
I can get nailed
running this next red light.

908
01:09:12,619 --> 01:09:13,696
And you all wouldn't give a shit, right?

909
01:09:13,721 --> 01:09:15,463
It's only me.
It doesn't work that way, Carter.

910
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,245
And I fucking hated French class.

911
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,029
Get control yourself.

912
01:09:30,053 --> 01:09:30,863
That's what I'm doing.

913
01:09:30,888 --> 01:09:33,639
I know what you're doing.
And it's alright to be scared, Carter.

914
01:09:33,664 --> 01:09:34,742
I'm not afraid.

915
01:09:34,766 --> 01:09:36,398
Alright, I decide when it's time.

916
01:09:36,461 --> 01:09:39,148
I control my life, I can...
I control my death.

917
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,531
You don't have to prove to us
how big your balls are. Not now.

918
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,338
Carter, stop driving like such an asshole.

919
01:09:47,745 --> 01:09:48,746
What are you doing?

920
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,618
Fuck it Carter, Jesus Christ.

921
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:54,498
Carter, put your hands back on the wheel.

922
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,351
Carter stop.
Hands on the wheel Carter.

923
01:09:58,780 --> 01:09:59,476
Shit.

924
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,757
Ok, Carter, easy.

925
01:10:03,842 --> 01:10:06,635
I am so close to puking
right now, you don't even wanna know.

926
01:10:09,155 --> 01:10:11,530
We're afraid too, Carter,
but we're not going to quit.

927
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:14,381
Stop what you're doing
and stop this fucking car.

928
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:18,486
Damn it Carter.
I want you to stop this car right now.

929
01:10:37,646 --> 01:10:39,021
Billy.
Move it.

930
01:10:39,046 --> 01:10:41,840
Hey, open the door Billy.
Move the fucking car!

931
01:10:41,865 --> 01:10:43,104
Hey, open the fucking door.

932
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:44,965
Move the car.

933
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:45,904
Open it.

934
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,456
Open the door.
Easy, easy, open the fucking door.

935
01:10:48,481 --> 01:10:50,662
Open the door.
Billy, open the fucking door!

936
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,762
Billy, open it!
Open the door!

937
01:10:52,787 --> 01:10:53,871
Open the door!

938
01:10:57,933 --> 01:11:01,120
Carter, listen to me. Don't do this.

939
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,542
Goddamn it!

940
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:08,237
Get out of the fucking car.

941
01:11:08,967 --> 01:11:10,129
Carter listen to me.

942
01:11:10,153 --> 01:11:11,552
Hey, listen to me.

943
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,684
This isn't the way.

944
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,966
It's not the way. Get out of the car.

945
01:11:14,991 --> 01:11:16,783
Come on!
It's coming, it's coming!

946
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:21,056
Carter!

947
01:11:21,829 --> 01:11:23,157
It ain't my time.

948
01:11:34,552 --> 01:11:35,435
Shit.

949
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:36,655
Carter, listen to me.

950
01:11:36,679 --> 01:11:38,880
This isn't the way.
Get out of the car, Carter.

951
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:40,544
Carter, get out of the car.

952
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,856
Come on, get out!

953
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:53,224
I can't get out!

954
01:11:55,117 --> 01:11:56,216
Alex!

955
01:11:57,326 --> 01:11:58,273
No!

956
01:12:05,317 --> 01:12:06,778
Man, he really is next.

957
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,199
Get out!
Get out!

958
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:11,909
Come on!
Fuck!

959
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:32,857
God.

960
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:37,115
I saw it. I saw the belt.

961
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:38,634
Scared now?

962
01:12:38,878 --> 01:12:39,771
It broke.

963
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:40,885
Bullshit.

964
01:12:41,464 --> 01:12:42,732
He saved your life again.

965
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,108
That's right.

966
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,183
You're next, Carter.

967
01:12:46,594 --> 01:12:48,422
I'm staying the fuck away from you.

968
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:49,478
Shut up Billy.

969
01:12:49,502 --> 01:12:51,040
We don't need this shit right now.

970
01:12:51,065 --> 01:12:52,272
I don't need it ever.

971
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:54,329
What are you doing?
Get away from him, he's next.

972
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:56,120
Hey fuck you Billy I'm not dead.

973
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:57,569
You will be.

974
01:12:57,803 --> 01:12:59,624
You're dead, you're dead.

975
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:02,795
And you ain't taking me with you!

976
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,657
Shit. Shit.

977
01:13:18,406 --> 01:13:20,018
Jesus fucking Christ!

978
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,762
You should've been next.

979
01:13:23,786 --> 01:13:25,257
You should've been next after Lewton.

980
01:13:25,282 --> 01:13:26,901
That's the plan. That's the design.

981
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:29,407
You should be fucking dead.
You're the fucking devil.

982
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:31,750
I saw the seat belt. I knew it would rip.

983
01:13:32,225 --> 01:13:34,250
That's how I saved him.
Just like the plane.

984
01:13:34,282 --> 01:13:35,939
Just like the explosion, I saw it.

985
01:13:35,964 --> 01:13:36,859
The police are coming.

986
01:13:36,883 --> 01:13:37,977
Fuck, I saved him.

987
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,164
Because I saved him

988
01:13:39,202 --> 01:13:42,747
it skipped Carter, went to the next
in the path of the explosion, Billy.

989
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:44,124
I have to see it.

990
01:13:44,781 --> 01:13:48,920
And if I see it, then I intervene.
And if I intervene, I cheat the design.

991
01:13:48,945 --> 01:13:50,710
What intervene?
What are you God now?

992
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:53,179
Gods aren't afraid to die.

993
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:55,972
Gods don't die. We do.

994
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,287
You know?
Baby, you're losing it, ok?

995
01:13:58,312 --> 01:14:00,726
The police will be here.
We have to get you to my cabin.

996
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,593
You can hide,
and get your head together.

997
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:04,928
Ok, after Billy, I'm next.

998
01:14:05,311 --> 01:14:06,489
I'm next.

999
01:14:07,638 --> 01:14:08,557
And then me.

1000
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:10,640
Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen.

1001
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,488
I'm not gonna let it happen, ok?

1002
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:13,645
Listen to me,

1003
01:14:13,763 --> 01:14:15,043
alright?
Hey, hey, hey.

1004
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,999
Why don't you two
just get the fuck out of here?

1005
01:17:11,963 --> 01:17:12,884
Rusted.

1006
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:15,259
Tetanus.

1007
01:17:17,257 --> 01:17:18,080
Nice one.

1008
01:17:20,366 --> 01:17:21,507
I overlooked it.

1009
01:17:24,105 --> 01:17:26,241
You tried to capitalize.
But I caught you.

1010
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:27,991
You fuck.

1011
01:17:30,006 --> 01:17:30,904
I can beat you.

1012
01:17:32,443 --> 01:17:33,762
Yeah, I mean not forever,

1013
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:36,936
but I got this cabin rigged
to beat you now!

1014
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:30,736
She was there a minute ago.

1015
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:33,249
What are you talking about?

1016
01:18:33,764 --> 01:18:35,056
I'm not turning him in.

1017
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,232
It's too dangerous for him
out there alone.

1018
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,122
I go with you.

1019
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:44,164
You can't.

1020
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:49,117
Clear, you just tell us where he is.

1021
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,163
Wait at home, I give you my word

1022
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:53,538
that we will bring him in safely
in protective custody.

1023
01:19:24,492 --> 01:19:25,747
I never moved.

1024
01:19:28,048 --> 01:19:30,564
Christa asked me to change seats
but I never moved.

1025
01:19:30,589 --> 01:19:32,204
I would've been up next to Tod.

1026
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,556
Fuck, why didn't I remember that?

1027
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:38,460
I never moved.
Clear's seat was in front of mine.

1028
01:19:55,266 --> 01:19:56,170
She's next.

1029
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:35,647
Alex!

1030
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,584
Alex!

1031
01:20:40,733 --> 01:20:42,117
Come on, get in the car.

1032
01:20:42,141 --> 01:20:43,522
We're going around. Get in the car.

1033
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:44,295
Come on!

1034
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:45,952
Go!
Move!

1035
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,146
There!
Come on, let's go!

1036
01:21:53,568 --> 01:21:54,222
Over here.

1037
01:21:58,788 --> 01:21:59,522
Alex!

1038
01:22:00,368 --> 01:22:02,077
Alex, we're trying to help you.

1039
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,617
Fritz,

1040
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:07,076
get away from it.

1041
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:20,660
Come on.

1042
01:22:25,082 --> 01:22:25,689
Alex!

1043
01:22:51,846 --> 01:22:52,605
Run!

1044
01:23:39,847 --> 01:23:40,720
We lost him.

1045
01:23:40,993 --> 01:23:43,410
From the direction,
there's only one place he's heading.

1046
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:44,431
No shit.

1047
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,239
Clear!

1048
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:28,591
No.

1049
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,379
Oh my God.

1050
01:25:41,765 --> 01:25:42,953
Don't move. Stay there.

1051
01:25:45,501 --> 01:25:48,003
Don't move, don't move.
Don't touch anything.

1052
01:25:48,132 --> 01:25:49,685
You're grounded by the tires, ok?

1053
01:26:19,518 --> 01:26:20,838
The car's gonna explode.

1054
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,432
I can only hold on for so long,
you know what to do.

1055
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,630
Don't!

1056
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,701
When I do this, it'll skip you,
and it'll be over.

1057
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:34,802
It's the only way
we can cheat death again.

1058
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:36,398
No, don't!

1059
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:38,806
Clear, I am not gonna let it beat us both.

1060
01:26:39,353 --> 01:26:40,372
You know what to do.

1061
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:44,360
I'll always be with you.

1062
01:26:48,368 --> 01:26:49,410
No!

1063
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,405
Alex!

1064
01:26:55,092 --> 01:26:56,625
Alex, get away from there.

1065
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,254
No!

1066
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:18,096
Alex.

1067
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:19,648
Alex.

1068
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:23,437
Damn it,

1069
01:27:23,602 --> 01:27:24,952
you can't do this to me.

1070
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:26,896
Come on, baby.

1071
01:27:27,171 --> 01:27:27,890
Come on.

1072
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:29,701
Alex, Alex?

1073
01:27:30,046 --> 01:27:31,234
Alex, Alex?

1074
01:27:32,154 --> 01:27:33,474
Shit, he's not breathing.

1075
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,076
Hold on, Alex.
Come on, stay with me.

1076
01:28:04,168 --> 01:28:05,676
Welcome to France.
Goodbye.

1077
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:08,067
Hi. Welcome to France.

1078
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:13,692
Well, we made it.

1079
01:28:14,513 --> 01:28:16,712
Paris, I can't believe it.

1080
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:19,020
You know what, I just can't believe
we got on a plane again.

1081
01:28:19,222 --> 01:28:20,301
You know what I'm saying?

1082
01:28:43,934 --> 01:28:44,934
Voila.

1083
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:46,442
Thanks.

1084
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:50,738
It's weird being here?

1085
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:53,096
We finally completed a puzzle.

1086
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,903
It's just, there's something missing,

1087
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:58,275
you know?

1088
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:02,947
To Terry.
Yeah.

1089
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:04,118
To Tod.

1090
01:29:04,509 --> 01:29:06,482
To all of our friends that can't be here.

1091
01:29:06,655 --> 01:29:08,126
Cheers.
Cheers.

1092
01:29:11,908 --> 01:29:12,763
What?

1093
01:29:13,806 --> 01:29:15,603
If you would have told me
six months ago

1094
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:18,127
that the three of us would be 
sitting here having a drink.

1095
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:19,884
Yeah.

1096
01:29:20,283 --> 01:29:21,386
I don't know I mean,

1097
01:29:21,652 --> 01:29:23,166
sometimes it just feels
like the two of you

1098
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,774
are the only ones
who can really understand.

1099
01:29:29,379 --> 01:29:30,520
You were right, Browning.

1100
01:29:31,293 --> 01:29:32,949
It did skip us. There was a design.

1101
01:29:34,281 --> 01:29:36,113
We beat it. You know, we won.

1102
01:29:37,572 --> 01:29:40,866
I think the only thing we won, Carter,
is a chance at a full life.

1103
01:29:42,105 --> 01:29:43,792
A chance that I won't ever waste.

1104
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:45,827
Yeah,

1105
01:29:46,916 --> 01:29:47,916
there's just something,

1106
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:49,994
You know, something I can't figure out.

1107
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:51,081
What?

1108
01:29:52,041 --> 01:29:52,886
About the design.

1109
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:54,710
Alex, just let it go.

1110
01:29:54,827 --> 01:29:55,940
Alright?

1111
01:29:56,015 --> 01:29:56,754
I swear just...

1112
01:29:57,051 --> 01:29:58,350
Just hear me out, alright?

1113
01:29:59,954 --> 01:30:01,092
Oh my God.

1114
01:30:01,116 --> 01:30:02,343
It's just Listen.

1115
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,887
Now, the path of the explosion,

1116
01:30:04,911 --> 01:30:06,608
determined the order of our deaths, right?

1117
01:30:06,713 --> 01:30:08,532
When I intervened and saved Carter

1118
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:11,841
it skipped him and went to the next 
person in the path. It went to Billy.

1119
01:30:12,466 --> 01:30:13,755
Alright, and then it was Clear.

1120
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:17,606
But I intervened and saved her,
so it went to me, but in my case...

1121
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:20,297
no one intervened, right?

1122
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:22,780
I was thrown from that power...

1123
01:30:23,063 --> 01:30:24,209
line by the explosion.

1124
01:30:24,516 --> 01:30:26,891
So.
So why did it skip you, right?

1125
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:30,243
How do we know that this isn't exactly
what was meant to happen?

1126
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:32,665
That out of everyone on Flight 180

1127
01:30:32,689 --> 01:30:34,594
you, me and Carter were meant to live.

1128
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:37,952
Maybe that was the design all along.

1129
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:40,590
Or you could still be next.

1130
01:30:40,824 --> 01:30:41,895
Shut up, Carter.

1131
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:43,301
What?

1132
01:30:43,379 --> 01:30:44,372
I didn't make up the rules.

1133
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:46,898
Somebody's gotta intervene
before death can skip them.

1134
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:48,306
Alex proved that three times.

1135
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:50,138
In the plane, with me, you.

1136
01:30:50,493 --> 01:30:53,353
For all I know, it could circle back
and get us all again.

1137
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:56,814
But I am the safest fucker in the world,

1138
01:30:57,134 --> 01:30:58,712
because you're still next.

1139
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,126
Can we just stop talking about this?

1140
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:08,406
Let's figure out
what we're gonna do tomorrow.

1141
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:26,396
I'm gonna meet you back at the hotel, ok.

1142
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:27,845
Just wait, I'll go with you.

1143
01:31:27,869 --> 01:31:28,721
No, no. Just...

1144
01:31:29,174 --> 01:31:31,197
Just stay here, ok?
Clear just stay here.

1145
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:32,431
Alright?

1146
01:31:32,778 --> 01:31:34,227
See, it's true.

1147
01:31:34,251 --> 01:31:35,572
I told you you were next, man.

1148
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:36,781
Stop it Carter.

1149
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:38,147
Alex wait.

1150
01:31:38,171 --> 01:31:39,558
No Clear, stay there.

1151
01:31:39,741 --> 01:31:40,483
Ok?

1152
01:31:40,826 --> 01:31:41,912
Stay away.

1153

01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:10,442
Alex!

01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:16,208
I told you, you were next.

01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:18,354

1157
01:32:18,378 --> 01:32:19,449
So who's next?
