1
00:00:00,958 --> 00:00:03,208
Smoking causes cancer. Smoking kills.

2
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:05,625
Consumption of alcohol
is injurious to health.

3
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:07,250
Be safe. Don't drink and drive.

4
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:10,208
Drug usage is injurious to health
and is a criminal offense.

5
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:53,250
The paintings you drew
Are etched in my heart

6
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:57,041
Even the rain cannot wash them away

7
00:01:57,416 --> 00:02:01,458
A day filled with laughter
And joy with you

8
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:05,250
There is no happiness
That can surpass that, oh dear!

9
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,666
Even the mirror looks at you

10
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,500
To see its beauty

11
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:17,208
The breeze will sing to you what I can't

12
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:21,458
Your words bring life to me

13
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:25,416
The amethyst flower and our native music

14
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,333
Fill me with happiness when I sing

15
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:33,291
To my dear love, my girl…

16
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,500
Girl! Sing a song with "girl" in it.

17
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,458
Hey there, my chubby girl

18
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,250
Can't you see my eyes
Are calling out to you?

19
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:45,333
Did my mustache prick you
Oh, diamond rose?

20
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:50,166
Does she lovingly call you Tom?

21
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,083
-Tom!
-Tom!

22
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:55,916
Now, Maharaja will sing a song
with the word "Tom" in it.

23
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,166
Go ahead, sing. "Tom."

24
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,208
Tom…

25
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,083
-Yes, Tom.
-Tom…

26
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes. The word is "Tom."

27
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,375
-Tom.
-Tom.

28
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,583
-Tom?
-Yes.

29
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,750
-Tom…
-Yes.

30
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,500
-Tomorrow, I want a day off.
-What?

31
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,041
-Tomorrow, I want a day off.
-You want a day off?

32
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,166
-Yes.
-There is no such song.

33
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,458
Have you heard any such song?

34
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,875
Of course, but it goes,
"I want a day off today."

35
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,416
I need a day off today

36
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,458
-I need a--
-Hey, I'll break your jaws!

37
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,000
Is this how you talk to your boss?

38
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,000
-Are you both mocking me?
-I wasn't mocking.

39
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,000
My wife wanted
to go shopping for our baby.

40
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,708
-Hence…
-No, I don't get it.

41
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,416
I really don't get it.

42
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,958
You talk as if
you're the only one with a family.

43
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,958
Do you think we don't have families too?

44
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,958
You always run off
to fulfill your wife and kid's needs.

45
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,708
If everyone took time off,
who would attend to our customers?

46
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,375
Customers? Yeah, right!

47
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,541
You talk as if there's a queue
24 hours a day to get haircuts.

48
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:59,041
To attract customers,
we need to sport a smiling face.

49
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,916
If you keep a face like an old,
smothered brush,

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,291
not even a dog will come to our shop.

51
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,666
Excuse me.

52
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,166
Excuse me, it was just a figure of speech.

53
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,875
We don't cut hair for dogs.

54
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,833
Sir, I'm not here for him but for myself.

55
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,500
I take Max to a pet spa for grooming.

56
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,625
For you?

57
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,041
Maharaja will attend to you.
Please come in.

58
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,791
What are you looking at?
You wanted a day off, right?

59
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,250
Well, you will attend to all the customers
that come in today.

60
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,791
Sir, please take a seat. Come.

61
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,958
-Got rejected at home?
-Yes.

62
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,333
Fine, find another one.

63
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,916
-She said okay to this.
-Give it.

64
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,250
-Bill this one as well.
-Listen,

65
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,333
get approval for this one as well.
What if she rejects it?

66
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,250
She will love it.

67
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:12,916
I am Jothi.

68
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,541
I'm studying in the tenth grade.

69
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,750
To be honest,
I'm a bit weak in my studies.

70
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,708
But I am very much interested in sports.

71
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,708
I spend more time on the field
than in the classroom.

72
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,083
And that's why none
of the teachers like me.

73
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,000
Waste!

74
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,916
Except one.

75
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,291
Ms. Asifa, our P.E. teacher.

76
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,083
-Oh, sorry. Ma'am…
-Please come, ma'am.

77
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,125
After all, it's P.E. period, right?

78
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:42,041
I have to finish the syllabus.
Let me have it.

79
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,250
What do you mean by
"After all, it's P.E. period"?

80
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,166
"Sound body, sound soul."
Haven't you heard?

81
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,250
She's very straightforward
and very friendly.

82
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,333
I'm her favorite.

83
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,833
She helps me with other subjects as well.

84
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,583
Right now, she's training me
for the 100-meter zonal competition.

85
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,458
And our house?

86
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,166
Here, this is our house.

87
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,708
This is my father, Maharaja.

88
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,708
We are a family of three.

89
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,208
Myself, Dad, and Lakshmi.

90
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,541
Who's Lakshmi? Your mom?

91
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,375
My mother passed away when I was a baby.

92
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,833
Oh, sorry! So, who's Lakshmi?

93
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,666
A dustbin named Lakshmi?

94
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,708
So, you guys named a dustbin?

95
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,291
When I was a baby, the house
I was in was destroyed in an accident.

96
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,875
Lakshmi fell upon me,
covered me, and saved my life.

97
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,916
Since then,
Lakshmi has been a part of our family.

98
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,750
Every Friday, Dad and I bathe Lakshmi,

99
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,666
apply holy ash and vermilion to it,
and pray together.

100
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,875
Dear, it's getting late.

101
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,750
You should have woken me up early!

102
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,833
She keeps snoozing when I wake her up

103
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,375
and then blames me for being late!

104
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,416
What have you prepared?

105
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,041
Lemon rice and egg.

106
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,666
Every day!

107
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:43,916
O, my daughter, you are my world

108
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,083
You are like the pointing finger
That shows me the right direction

109
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,666
Even your cry is a melody to my ears

110
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,291
Even if you hurt me
I will still love you with all my heart

111
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:58,375
A daughter is every father's world

112
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,458
This grandpa is Mr. Gopal.

113
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,125
So, tell me something.
Who named you Maharaja?

114
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,125
The apt name for you
is Mr. "Long Face" King.

115
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:09,375
A smile on your face makes you look good.

116
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:14,541
Instead, if you keep a long face,
no dog will ever step into our shop!

117
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,625
Well, thanks to kind-hearted people
like him, our shop keeps running.

118
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,791
Please turn your head.

119
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,208
Don't give the money to me.
Pay it to the owner.

120
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,750
He is the owner, and I am the laborer
for this "good for nothing" shop.

121
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,375
See, my father works under him
despite being the owner of the shop.

122
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,375
This is doctor uncle,

123
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:38,041
a friend of my dad's.

124
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,958
Why did you come all the way here?

125
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,333
I could have come to your shop.

126
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,041
It would have been
a good walking exercise for me.

127
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,500
I am talking to you!

128
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,875
Once a month, he takes a day off,
and we roam around.

129
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,041
Not to exotic destinations
but to the shopping street and the beach.

130
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,500
You switch the spoon of salt with sugar
and the spoon of sugar with chili powder!

131
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,041
I've told you a thousand times
to scrub the cloth before washing.

132
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,458
It's still dirty!

133
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,958
Haven't I told you to bathe before
entering the kitchen after salon work?

134
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,833
Look at all these hairs.

135
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:22,208
His shop and our home,
that's my dad's world.

136
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:26,458
Mom came as my daughter

137
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,458
Came to take care
Of the father's mental health

138
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,458
My dad never gives up on me,
no matter what.

139
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,541
Let me explain what happened one day.

140
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,666
Here's your daughter's transfer
certificate and sports certificate.

141
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,083
Take them and leave!

142
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,958
Sir, let me speak.

143
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,916
-To hell with your "Sir"!
-Sir--

144
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,958
Your daughter mixed alcohol
in the chief guest's welcome drink!

145
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:47,958
He was an IAS officer!

146
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,083
I had my school
ranked among the top ten! Top ten!

147
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:52,333
It's all gone now!

148
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,708
-She wouldn't have done it, sir.
-Come again! She wouldn't have done it?

149
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,125
The alcohol bottle was found
in your daughter's bag!

150
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,625
Are the witnesses lying,
or do you think I'm lying?

151
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,416
I don't care about that, sir.
My daughter wouldn't have done it.

152
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,083
Your daughter, my foot!

153
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,250
You and your daughter better leave!
Or else, just one phone call,

154
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,083
and you will be in prison! Shall I?

155
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,583
Now, watch me!

156
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:14,833
Sir!

157
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,708
Now, you're going to tell me he did it,
and she's innocent. Am I right?

158
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,041
All I'm saying is, please investigate
such sensitive issues thoroughly.

159
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,708
Don't any of you have any sense?

160
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,958
Is this how you accuse someone
without conducting a proper inquiry?

161
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,583
I was embarrassed in front
of the IAS officer then,

162
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,416
and now I'm embarrassed
by all of you again in front of him!

163
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,791
You! Come here!

164
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,250
I said, come here!

165
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,166
Sir, what are you doing?

166
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,583
Principal, his father
must be here tomorrow. Got it?

167
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,833
Don't think you got away.

168
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,416
If I catch you doing something wrong,
I'll throw you out of here!

169
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,541
There won't be any hearings like this.

170
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,458
Got it?

171
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,958
You all may leave.
Hey! I said, leave!

172
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:09,875
I said, out!

173
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,125
You! Do you need special instruction?

174
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,166
-Get lost.
-Jothi.

175
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,875
Didn't I tell you
she wouldn't have done it, sir?

176
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:20,875
-You rushed to judgment and scolded her.
-So what?

177
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,666
Apologize to my daughter, sir.

178
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,000
-Come again.
-Sir…

179
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,166
My daughter is innocent. Right, sir?

180
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,875
-Dad, let's go.
-Yet you scolded her.

181
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,208
Wasn't that wrong?

182
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,541
Apologize to my daughter, sir.

183
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,791
-Dad, let's go.
-Hey!

184
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,541
Do you know whom you're talking to?

185
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,333
-I own many schools and colleges!
-Dad, let's go.

186
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,708
-Let him apologize.
-You want me to apologize?

187
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,083
That too to your daughter?

188
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,958
-Even if I--
-I don't care about that.

189
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,791
Wasn't it wrong of you to scold her?
She'd be hurt, right?

190
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,125
-Apologize to her, and I'll leave, sir.
-Hey!

191
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,291
-Out! Get out!
-Dad, let's go.

192
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,125
-Wait, we'll go.
-Security! Come here!

193
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,541
-Throw him out!
-Apologize to my daughter, sir.

194
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,166
-Drag him away and throw him out!
-Sir, it was wrong of you to scold her.

195
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,833
-Apologize.
-Drag him away!

196
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,208
-Dad, let's go. Please.
-Sir, apologize…

197
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,833
-Dad, please! Let's go.
-Sir…

198
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,958
-Apologize to her, sir. She is innocent.
-Dad, please. Let's leave.

199
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,708
-Throw him out!
-Sir, apologize!

200
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,708
Teacher, my daughter's innocent.
Ask him to apologize.

201
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,458
-Dad, please. Let's leave.
-Stop listening to him!

202
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,458
-Throw him out!
-Sir, apologize to her.

203
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,500
Sir, you're being unfair.
Ask them to leave him.

204
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,291
-I don't want him here! Throw him out!
-Sir…

205
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:18,958
Sir, you were wrong to scold her.

206
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,166
-Sir, you were wrong to scold her.
-Get out of here, you rascal!

207
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,125
-Sir…
-You better leave!

208
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,833
-Apologize to her!
-Sir, please listen to me.

209
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,708
-Apologize to her!
-Dad…

210
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,375
-Sir, let go of him. Please.
-Apologize to her!

211
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:30,708
-Apologize to her!
-Jothi…

212
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,875
-Throw him out! Now!
-Sir…

213
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,166
-Don't spare him!
-Sir…

214
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,000
Sir, he won't let go of that grip
until you apologize to me.

215
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,375
Please apologize to me, sir.

216
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,833
You're being so unfair!

217
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,416
Apologize to her, sir!

218
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,958
Please listen to me, sir.

219
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,625
Sir, please apologize to me.

220
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,958
-He isn't listening to us, sir.
-Apologize to my her, sir.

221
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:54,083
Apologize to my daughter, sir!
Apologize to her!

222
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:58,291
Sir, please apologize to my daughter!
Apologize to her!

223
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,291
-Hey! Let go of him.
-Apologize to her.

224
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,833
Just let go of him!

225
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,291
I said, let go of him!

226
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,583
-Apologize to her, sir.
-Let go of him. Leave him.

227
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,000
Let go of him!

228
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,750
Look, dear.

229
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,666
I was wrong to scold you.

230
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,541
It was an honest mistake, dear.
Forgive me.

231
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,208
That's my dad for you.

232
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,416
I am going out of town
to attend a sports camp.

233
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,083
For the first time, my dad
will be away from me for a week.

234
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,791
Since I won’t be here, don’t be careless
and leave the main door open.

235
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,375
-Fine.
-Eat on time, Dad.

236
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,833
Also, sleep on time.

237
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,750
I am going to a camp,

238
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,375
so I won’t be in school.

239
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,208
Don’t forget that
and end up going to school.

240
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:55,875
Okay?

241
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,666
Yes, an important thing.

242
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,250
Keep Lakshmi clean.
I’ll make video calls often and check!

243
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,708
And I will call when I'm free.
Understood?

244
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,583
-Good morning, Miss.
-Good morning.

245
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,625
-Hi.
-Hi, Jothi.

246
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,666
Dad, bye.

247
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,500
-See you.
-Take care.

248
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,041
Yes, sir? What happened?

249
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:23,125
Have you watched the movie
Parvai Ondre Podhume?

250
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,500
Parvai Ondre Podhume…
No, sir.

251
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,833
The gentle breeze and a beautiful flower

252
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,791
-They fell in love--
-I've not watched it, sir.

253
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,750
-No? Really?
-No. I don't know.

254
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,666
-You didn't watch it?
-No, sir.

255
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,750
I left my car here for service,

256
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,541
and you stole the sunglasses
that were in it?

257
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,791
-Where are my Kunal sunglasses?
-It hurts, sir.

258
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,750
-Where are my hero's sunglasses?
-Sir!

259
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,875
-Where are the Kunal sunglasses?
-Sir…

260
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,875
Where are they?

261
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,875
-Where are they? Tell me!
-Sir, please.

262
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,333
-Brother…
-Get lost.

263
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:51,375
If you come near me,
I’ll rip you all apart!

264
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,125
-Where are my hero’s sunglasses?
-Sir, I didn't take it. I swear.

265
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,875
-I don't know, sir.
-Get up!

266
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,583
-Tell me! Move!
-Sir…

267
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,000
-Sir…
-Tell me! Today, all of you are finished!

268
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,666
-I don't know, sir.
-Where are my hero’s sunglasses?

269
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,708
-Tell me, or else I’ll chop you down!
-Sir, let me speak. Wait.

270
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,125
-Tell me! Now!
-Sir…

271
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,208
Sir…

272
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,375
Sir, that guy is the one
who delivered your car.

273
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,791
Sir, let me check with him. Please.

274
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,416
Hey! Where are the Kunal sunglasses?

275
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:18,791
Kunal sunglasses?

276
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,625
Why are you asking me?

277
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:24,541
You're the one who serviced his car
and delivered it last evening.

278
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,250
If not you,
who else could have taken them?

279
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,916
Are you accusing me of stealing
just because I delivered the car?

280
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,750
-Mind your job!
-You're the thief!

281
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,791
-You're crossing the line!
-You thief!

282
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:32,958
You just got released from prison!

283
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
-I showed pity on you
-These guys!

284
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,333
and you steal from the customer?

285
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,500
Why should I get the beatings
for your crime?

286
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:44,000
You delivered the car this morning
instead of last evening!

287
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,750
-Sir…
-My house is just three kilometers away!

288
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,291
Did you travel the whole night
to reach my home?

289
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,500
-Sir…
-Where are my sunglasses? Answer me!

290
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,916
Hands off me! Today, I will…

291
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,041
Speak! Where is it?

292
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,666
-Answer me!
-Sir! Please, no!

293
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,708
-Leave him. I'll buy you a new one.
-A new one?

294
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,333
-Damn it, my hero Kunal gifted it to me!
-Sir…

295
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,875
There's no replacement for it.
I want that back!

296
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,833
I want those sunglasses back!

297
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,250
Listen, if I don’t get
my sunglasses back by tomorrow,

298
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,958
I'll burn down the whole garage.

299
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,708
Understood? Hands off me!

300
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,208
Get lost! I'll kill both of you.

301
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:18,708
Understand?

302
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,458
You shouldn't have let him go so easily.

303
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,666
You should've beaten him up
even more. Frauds!

304
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,500
-Brother, bring me a drink.
-In a similar case, a guy in Kerala

305
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,833
bought a second-hand Benz.

306
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,583
Only when he left his car
for service did he find out

307
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,291
it wasn't a Benz but a cheap car.

308
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:47,666
See how they trick people,
just like in the movies!

309
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,041
Buddy, you shouldn't have settled for
just beating him up.

310
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,541
You should have burned down his garage.

311
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,500
I'll finish you off today!

312
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,875
You roam around in my car,

313
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,041
and on top of that, you beat me up?

314
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,208
I won't spare you.

315
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,291
Mr. Police.

316
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,333
-Mr. Police.
-Sir…

317
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,458
Come here.

318
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:17,958
Sir…

319
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:19,958
Sir?

320
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,125
"Mala, how are you, Mala?"

321
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:24,916
I'm good.

322
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,708
Sir, please wrap it up quickly.

323
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,250
I have a lot of work to do.
I have to go.

324
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:30,500
Wait, turn around.

325
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,083
-What's this?
-Master key, sir.

326
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:34,916
Why are you wearing it as a necklace?

327
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,625
So that nobody will steal it.

328
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:37,916
From you?

329
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,041
-Yeah, right!
-Sir, how do you want me to stand?

330
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,291
However you wish.

331
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,625
Oh, mother! Oh, my God!

332
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,000
Oh, father!

333
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,833
G. SURENDAR

334
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,333
Oh, mother! Oh, father!

335
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,375
You must not take a dump for ten days!

336
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:11,416
Hey, stop!

337
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,125
Where are you running? Stop!

338
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,083
Hey!

339
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,041
You'll steal mopeds?

340
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,791
-Come here!
-Sir…

341
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,083
-Sir…
-Is this your in-laws house?

342
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,125
-You want to leave immediately?
-Sir…

343
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:26,666
Oh, God!

344
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,125
No! Things don't work here
as per your wish.

345
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:30,833
-You thief!
-Sir!

346
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:31,833
Oh, God!

347
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:33,750
I'll finish you off, jerk.

348
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:36,708
Hey.

349
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,125
-Who are you?
-Sir, my name is Maharaja.

350
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,375
There was a theft in my house.
I want to file a police report.

351
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:44,541
You want to file a police report?

352
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,416
Why don't you also start
the investigation?

353
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:50,166
First, tell us what was stolen.

354
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,208
I will decide if a police report
is needed.

355
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:53,958
A police report straight away? My foot!

356
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:09,958
Quenched your thirst?

357
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,666
Your proper introduction
and tell me what exactly was stolen.

358
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,750
Provide a clear explanation.

359
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:18,000
Sir, my name is Maharaja.

360
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,958
I run a salon in K.K. Nagar.

361
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:22,708
Yes, sir.

362
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:24,958
I reside at Bharathi Nagar, Pallikaranai.

363
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,083
Last night, around ten o'clock,

364
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,666
I returned home after closing my shop.

365
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,666
I always keep the house key
under a flower vase outside.

366
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,625
Okay.

367
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,625
Yesterday, upon reaching home,
I retrieved the key,

368
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:40,958
unlocked the door, and entered the house.

369
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,375
I switched on the living room light.

370
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,625
Then, I removed the bag
from my shoulder and placed it down.

371
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:50,916
-Then I went inside the room to change.
-Okay.

372
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,833
Suddenly, I heard a noise from behind.

373
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:58,750
I turned around.

374
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:02,875
There were two of them,

375
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:04,750
wearing masks.

376
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:05,750
What are you saying?

377
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,791
One of them advanced toward me.

378
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,083
I screamed, "Who are you?"

379
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:14,958
He quickly covered my mouth
with his hand and restrained me.

380
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:17,041
-God!
-Then I bit his hand, sir.

381
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,166
Suddenly, a third guy…
I think he was hiding in the living room.

382
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:28,041
He rushed toward me
and struck me with an iron rod.

383
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,000
I lost my senses, sir.

384
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:33,125
My vision blurred,
and everything went blank.

385
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,750
-All three of them started hitting me.
-Wait!

386
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:42,583
So they broke into your house
even before you arrived?

387
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,500
Yes, sir.

388
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,166
Okay.

389
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:46,500
Continue.

390
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:49,708
They beat me up,
stole my Lakshmi, and ran off.

391
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,041
Please help me find my Lakshmi, sir.

392
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:55,000
It'll be a bit difficult.

393
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:57,916
So, how many grams?

394
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,833
Sir, not jewels.

395
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,666
-Then, money?
-Not money either, sir.

396
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:03,958
Then Lakshmi must be…

397
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,500
-Your wife?
-She passed away long ago.

398
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,958
-I'm sorry.
-I live with my daughter.

399
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,666
She's on a school camping trip.

400
00:26:12,083 --> 00:26:13,416
You're confusing me, man!

401
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,166
You say it's not your daughter,
wife, or sister.

402
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,625
Then who is Lakshmi?

403
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,750
Sir… Lakshmi, sir…

404
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,625
What does this mean?

405
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,666
-Who is Lakshmi?
-Sir… Lakshmi, sir.

406
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,750
Sir, wait. Hold on.

407
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:30,500
Here, sir. Look at this.

408
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,833
This is you.

409
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:35,958
-And that's my daughter.
-I can see that.

410
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:37,416
Where's Lakshmi?

411
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:40,541
Lakshmi, sir.

412
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,500
-The dustbin?
-That's Lakshmi, sir.

413
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:49,791
The dustbin?

414
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:51,625
That's Lakshmi?

415
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:53,708
I'm much better than him.

416
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,875
Earlier, when you said
you wanted to file a police report,

417
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:01,083
it was for this missing dustbin?

418
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:02,541
-Sir, that's Lakshmi.
-You!

419
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,958
-A dustbin, right?
-Sir, Lakshmi.

420
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,000
I'll break your jaws!

421
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,208
Fine.

422
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,208
Answer my questions clearly.

423
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:16,791
Was there any jewelry
or money in the dustbin?

424
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:17,750
No, sir.

425
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,291
-Any important documents?
-No, sir.

426
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,833
-There was nothing in it?
-No, sir.

427
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,125
-Not even garbage?
-No, sir.

428
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:26,041
-Not even any garbage in the dustbin?
-No, sir.

429
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,041
Fine.

430
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,583
Was that dustbin

431
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:34,958
-made of gold?
-Lakshmi is made of iron, sir.

432
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,250
-Iron?
-Yes, sir.

433
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,750
-How much did it cost?
-Well…

434
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,958
back then, it was worth
about 350 to 400 rupees, sir.

435
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:46,541
And those three broke in to steal
that 350-rupee dustbin?

436
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:47,458
Yes, sir.

437
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,166
-They attacked you and took it!
-Yes, sir.

438
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,208
-But the dustbin is empty.
-Yes, sir.

439
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,291
Do I look like a fool to you?

440
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,250
Or does this police station look
like a mental asylum?

441
00:27:57,458 --> 00:28:00,000
Sir, it was Lakshmi who saved
my daughter’s life.

442
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:02,166
-So please help me find her.
-Hey!

443
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:04,291
Look, I'm already quite upset!

444
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:06,958
Stop irritating me and leave!

445
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:08,500
Missing dustbin, my foot!

446
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,250
Please find my Lakshmi
before my daughter returns, sir.

447
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,333
Or else, I will…

448
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:15,500
How dare you point your finger?

449
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:18,625
Or else what? What will you do?!

450
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:20,208
Say it! What will you do?

451
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:22,458
What will you do?
What the hell can you do?

452
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,166
What will you do? Tell me!

453
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,125
I will…

454
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,583
file a complaint against you
with higher officials.

455
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:31,000
You'll complain to my superiors?
Go ahead! Do it, I say!

456
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,958
Go and complain to the IG!
I'll face it!

457
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:35,958
-Where are you running?
-Please leave me. Please.

458
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,416
Sir, why aren't you taking my complaint?

459
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,000
-Sir… My Lakshmi…
-Let go of me! Leave me!

460
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,625
Don't hit him, sir.

461
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:46,291
Sir!

462
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,208
-Why are you hitting him?
-Shut up!

463
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,125
Sir…

464
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,750
Sir, he seems to be a madman.

465
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,375
This could become an issue.

466
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:57,375
Don't listen to him. I'm not crazy.
Please find my Lakshmi, sir.

467
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,916
-You think he's crazy?
-Sir…

468
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,125
-He's driving us crazy! Throw him out!
-Sir, please find my Lakshmi.

469
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,916
-Thrown him out! Now!
-Sir, my Lakshmi…

470
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,791
-Sir, my Lakshmi.
-Throw him out!

471
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,958
-Come on, throw him out.
-Please find my Lakshmi, sir.

472
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:11,875
-Pull him! Come on!
-Sir, please. Find my Lakshmi.

473
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,333
-Sir, my Lakshmi…
-Bite him!

474
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:14,833
Sir, my Lakshmi…

475
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,125
Sir! Please find my Lakshmi, sir!

476
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,791
Please find my Lakshmi, sir!

477
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,291
I won't let go of the grip, sir!

478
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:26,333
-It's about to break!
-Please find my Lakshmi, sir.

479
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,291
Hey!

480
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:39,708
Snake!

481
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,000
A snake! Run!

482
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:42,416
Get out!

483
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
Sir!

484
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,041
Run! Everybody run!

485
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,083
Let's go!

486
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,375
-Come!
-Run…

487
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,750
Move!

488
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,375
Put it down! It might bite you!

489
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,541
Put it down. It's a snake!

490
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,500
Put the snake down!

491
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:26,625
-Are you crazy? Put it down!
-Put the snake down!

492
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,250
Let the inspector come,
and we'll discuss your case.

493
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,416
Put it down!

494
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,375
Put it down!

495
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:39,625
So the key was placed there?

496
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,041
-Sir?
-I asked, was the key placed there?

497
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,041
Yes, sir.

498
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:45,791
I just searched,
and all the keys were here.

499
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:46,708
-You!
-Dad, no.

500
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,708
-You steal in my house and--
-Sir, hold on. Sir…

501
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,625
If he gets hurt,
we'll have to answer to the magistrate.

502
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,333
Was going to Tirupathi temple a mistake?

503
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,000
He has robbed us completely!

504
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,333
Was it the Tirupathi God's order
to leave the keys on top of the cupboard?

505
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:03,833
It's your house,
and you must safeguard it.

506
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,791
Come on, sir! 680 grams of gold, sir!

507
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:08,625
Didn't we recover it?
Calm down, sir.

508
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,041
Here you go, sir.

509
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:27,458
Check it.

510
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:32,166
Sir, this is an awesome house
that you've built.

511
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:34,041
It must have cost you 30 million, right?

512
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,875
Which era are you living in, sir?

513
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,916
Including the grand interior decoration,
it cost me 70 million.

514
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,125
My house steals the show
in this whole locality.

515
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:45,041
-Keep it inside…
-Sir…

516
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,041
Sir, I was told
that you work in the RTO department.

517
00:32:47,708 --> 00:32:50,250
So your salary, after deductions,
must be 60,000 per month.

518
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:51,958
Then how did you build such a grand…

519
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:53,750
What did you say?

520
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,041
Who are you to question that, sir?
Are you from the Income Tax department?

521
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,541
Why are you bothered about my earnings?

522
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:00,458
Let the IT department come!

523
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,791
I have the correct documents
and will present them.

524
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:05,791
-Where should I sign?
-Here, sir.

525
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:11,666
You may leave, sir.

526
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:18,166
Blame it all on fate!

527
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,166
-Sir!
-That's true.

528
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,083
-Sir!
-Sir!

529
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,500
-Sir!
-Sir!

530
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:27,458
Sir, the jewels you handed over to us
are all fake gold!

531
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:31,250
-You wasted our time on fake gold?
-No, sir!

532
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,750
Our jewels are pure gold.

533
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,416
The ones you handed over to us are fake.

534
00:33:36,583 --> 00:33:39,666
The designs are a perfect match,
and that's what we retrieved for you.

535
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,291
Sir, the designs look the same,

536
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,375
but this is fake gold,
whereas ours was pure gold.

537
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,916
Bring him here.

538
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,750
Hey, come.

539
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:50,625
Where are the jewels?

540
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,833
-Sir, I handed them over to you.
-He claims that it's all fake gold.

541
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:55,625
-Where's the gold?
-Sir, I stole only these.

542
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,833
-You stole these? Where's the gold?
-Sir!

543
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:58,791
-Where are they?
-Sir!

544
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,791
-Where are the original jewels?
-Sir, it hurts. Please, sir.

545
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:02,750
Sir!

546
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,083
Hey, 680 grams of gold jewels were stolen,

547
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:09,833
and the recovered amount is 696 grams?
Can't you duplicate it properly?

548
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:12,541
Sir, what if the owner finds out?

549
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:14,833
-We'll manage.
-It hurts!

550
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:15,750
It hurts? My foot!

551
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:18,416
-Where are the gold jewels?
-He told me it's gold.

552
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,500
-But now he's saying otherwise.
-He's lying, sir!

553
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,791
-Are you both cheating the government?
-No, sir.

554
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,958
-No, sir. Not at all.
-Sait, you jerk!

555
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:28,958
Didn't you ask why we are bothered
about your earnings?

556
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,041
So this is how you earned it all?

557
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,666
-No, sir.
-No?

558
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,666
-No…
-Then how?

559
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,166
-Sir, leave it. Sir…
-Leave what?

560
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:36,125
-Go inside. Now!
-Just leave it, sir.

561
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:38,458
Do you need
special instructions, ma'am? Go!

562
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:42,458
"Seventy million! I have the documents!

563
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,083
Steals the show in this whole locality!"
I'll tear you apart!

564
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:00,666
Here you go.

565
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:05,291
If you need anything,
come home and inform my wife. Okay?

566
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:09,125
Amudha, take care of yourself
and the baby.

567
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,833
I'll be out of prison soon.

568
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:14,750
-Sir!
-Sir!

569
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,041
Sir, please change your shirt.
Wear this one.

570
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,916
A dustbin story has turned
the police station into a dustbin.

571
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,833
Sir is here.

572
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:30,708
Sir…

573
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:37,791
What happened?

574
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,708
Did some political party
hold a conference in our police station?

575
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:53,000
Greetings, sir.

576
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:05,041
So tell me, Maharaja,

577
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,000
what's the issue in your kingdom
under your reign?

578
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,750
Sir, my name is Maharaja.

579
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:11,291
I run a salon in K.K. Nagar.

580
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,583
I reside at Bharathi Nagar, Pallikaranai.

581
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:15,458
Last night, around ten o'clock,

582
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,375
-I returned home after closing my shop.
-There he goes again.

583
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,250
I unlocked the door
and entered the house.

584
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:21,416
-Got a cigarette?
-I switched on the living room light.

585
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,500
Then, I removed the bag
from my shoulder and placed it down.

586
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,833
Then I went inside the room to change.

587
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:29,833
Suddenly, I heard a noise from behind.

588
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:31,666
I turned around.

589
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,583
There were two of them, wearing masks.

590
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,208
A third guy…
I think he was hiding in the living room.

591
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,958
-He rushed toward me--
-Wait.

592
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:42,083
So they broke into your house
even before you arrived?

593
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,541
-Oh, come on! Move.
-Yes, sir.

594
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:47,375
Sir, he's telling you
the exact same story he told me.

595
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:50,416
-A dustbin is missing from his house.
-What? A dustbin?

596
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,875
Yes, sir. A dustbin worth 300 rupees.

597
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,166
Three unidentified thieves
broke into his house to steal it.

598
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,666
They attacked him and stole it.

599
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,083
He wants to file a police report,
it seems.

600
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,083
Look!

601
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:04,083
People get no justice here
even when their lives are in danger,

602
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:07,208
and here you are,
creating a ruckus over losing a dustbin.

603
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:09,000
Here!

604
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,541
Buy yourself a new dustbin
and never show your face here again.

605
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,875
Sir, I don't want a new one.

606
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,875
I want my Lakshmi back.

607
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:19,333
-Lakshmi?
-That's the dustbin's name, sir.

608
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:21,541
-A dustbin with a name?
-They don't understand, sir.

609
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:24,166
Lakshmi saved my daughter's life.

610
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,250
-That is our--
-How can a dustbin save a life?

611
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:28,291
Sir, Lakshmi is made of iron.

612
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:29,916
When the house collapsed,

613
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,250
it fell on my daughter,
covered her, and saved her.

614
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,250
Just tell me, what do you want?

615
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:36,083
Lakshmi is the deity
that resides in our home.

616
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,416
My daughter will ask for Lakshmi
as soon as she returns from camp.

617
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:41,583
Please help me find Lakshmi, sir.

618
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,583
Fine, we'll find it.

619
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,750
Just answer my questions properly.

620
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:49,833
Usually, criminals leave clues.
Did you find any?

621
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:51,125
-No, sir.
-Okay.

622
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,916
They must have talked to each other
while stealing your dustbin.

623
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,208
Did they speak Tamil
or some other language?

624
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:57,625
Can you identify them?

625
00:38:01,583 --> 00:38:03,208
Sir, all three had masks on.

626
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,291
-Hey!
-Right!

627
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,625
Obviously! They won't come naked
to rob a house!

628
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:10,125
Apart from the dustbin,
what else did they steal?

629
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:12,166
-Nothing else, sir.
-Nothing?

630
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,541
He's been telling the same story
since morning, and it's driving me crazy.

631
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:17,500
-Sir, just throw him out.
-Sir…

632
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,041
I'd honestly tell you
if something else was stolen.

633
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:22,000
Hey!

634
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,708
One slap and your head will roll!

635
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:30,166
You say they stole an empty dustbin
and nothing else?

636
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,041
Were they indeed thieves or madmen?

637
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:34,083
Look, your story doesn't sound believable.

638
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:37,125
Tell me one thing that's believable,
and I will take up this case.

639
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:40,166
Otherwise, I'll put you in prison
for creating a ruckus here

640
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,333
and break your knees.

641
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:53,250
Sir, I noticed something
peculiar about one of them.

642
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,041
What was it?

643
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,166
-When the three of them were hitting me,
-Yes…

644
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,583
I pushed them away, asking them to stop.

645
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:04,208
During the fight, one of the guy's shirts
got hooked on a nail and tore.

646
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,333
I saw his back, sir.

647
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:09,083
On his back…

648
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,250
-On his back…
-On his back?

649
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,750
On his back…

650
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,250
there was an ear protruding out.

651
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,458
-An ear on the back?
-Yes, sir.

652
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:25,583
Now, this is interesting.

653
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:26,916
I saw it with my own eyes, sir.

654
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,625
An ear on the back…

655
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,125
Sir, I have a doubt.

656
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,916
If we cover his two ears,

657
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,208
can he still hear
with the ear in his back?

658
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:40,250
-Please ask him.
-Who's that fellow?

659
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,333
Police, sir.

660
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,166
-Police?
-No, sir.

661
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,083
That's his name, but he's a thief.

662
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:46,458
He steals TVS 50 mopeds.

663
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:48,875
So far, he has stolen 27 TVS 50s.

664
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,375
He even stole my father-in-law's TVS 50.
I was inquiring about it.

665
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,125
There are millions of costly bikes,

666
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:06,875
so why steal
the TVS 50 brand in particular?

667
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:10,750
-Sir, I don't ride bikes with gears.
-Oh, really?

668
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,250
-Shall I teach you?
-Sir…

669
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:15,333
-Sir, how do you want me to stand?
-However you wish.

670
00:40:15,416 --> 00:40:18,166
Sir, move. I have to get beatings.

671
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:22,958
-Did he come prepared for this?
-Ready, sir.

672
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:27,625
How dare you steal?
Stealing only TVS 50s, my foot!

673
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:31,583
-These people are a pain in the head!
-Rascal!

674
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:32,958
Oh, God!

675
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:38,125
You have questions?
And how dare you steal?

676
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:40,333
-You want to trouble the cops?
-Don't go there.

677
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,750
-Sir…
-Oh, God!

678
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:43,666
Sir…

679
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:46,958
Sir, if you cannot take up my case,

680
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,291
at least recommend
moving Lakshmi's case to CBI.

681
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,416
-CBI?
-He's going to die today.

682
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:54,916
-Don't leave him.
-Come on, lift him.

683
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,875
Hold him.

684
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:57,541
-Look, he's kicking his leg.
-Hold his leg.

685
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,083
Sir… Sir, my Lakshmi!

686
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,708
Sir, please find my Lakshmi.

687
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,083
Grab him!

688
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:05,875
He's trying to hold something.
Don't let him!

689
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:09,375
Sir, Lakshmi…

690
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,000
Sir, please help me find my Lakshmi.

691
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:12,166
Sir!

692
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:19,458
Hey!

693
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:22,291
Take one step forward,
and I'll shoot you down!

694
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,125
I dare you!

695
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:25,250
I dare you!

696
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:26,625
Hey!

697
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:33,625
Leave! I said, leave!

698
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,666
I shouldn't see you around. Leave.

699
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:40,708
Leave! Now!

700
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:42,833
You heard me! Leave!

701
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,458
Are you all blind?

702
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,208
Don't you know there's a gun here?

703
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:57,375
-If you had taken it and pointed at him,
-Sir…

704
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:58,875
-he would have run for his life.
-Sir…

705
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,083
See how he ran away?

706
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:01,125
Do you think he'll dare to come back?

707
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,000
People must fear the police.

708
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:07,333
There are so many of you here,
yet you couldn't throw a madman out?

709
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,958
Don't call yourselves police!
Aren't you ashamed?

710
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,833
Hey!

711
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,375
-Why are you feeling bad? Are you police?
-Sir?

712
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,875
-Are you police?
-Sir, please! Not the gun.

713
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,916
Please use the baton.
Don't change your habits, sir.

714
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,458
Sir, I'm ready.

715
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,541
-You're so used to beatings
-Sir,

716
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:26,875
-that you have no fear at all.
-pass him the baton.

717
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,416
-I'll shoot you right there!
-Sir…

718
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,916
-Sir, not the gun. Please.
-Sir…

719
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,250
-No, don't.
-Sir…

720
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:33,666
It's me, sir.

721
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:36,708
Sir,

722
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,250
keep this 40,000 rupees as an advance.

723
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:41,041
Please find my Lakshmi, sir.

724
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,583
I'll pay you five hundred thousand, sir.

725
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:47,791
Five hundred thousand for a dustbin?

726
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,250
How dare you try to bribe me!

727
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,416
Do you have any sense?

728
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:02,416
Who accepts bribes in front of people?

729
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,083
Have some respect for the inspector.

730
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,291
Hereafter, deal with me regarding money.

731
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:08,166
Understood?

732
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,750
Sir, I turned on this switch.

733
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,666
I kept the key over there.

734
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,875
-I placed my bag here.
-Hey! Wait!

735
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,333
-Lakshmi was here.
-Look!

736
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:35,000
-Don't start again. I'll become furious!
-Sir, Lakshmi…

737
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,958
-Look here, we can't find your dustbin!
-Sir, Lakshmi…

738
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:45,041
You move the case to CBI.
Just leave me alone! God!

739
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:47,083
He keeps flapping his gums.

740
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,041
Sir!

741
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,333
They broke in from here.

742
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:02,083
There is nothing here.

743
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:13,916
Sir, this shop
would be better off without him.

744
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:16,291
He can't even perform his job properly.

745
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:19,875
Even now, he took two days off
without notifying anyone.

746
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,041
He's simply a waste, sir.

747
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:25,000
-Sir…
-What is it?

748
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:26,666
Come here.

749
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,458
He has one and a half million rupees
in his savings account.

750
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:37,375
Dad, this is the TT court.

751
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,250
I don't play this game, but my friends do.

752
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:41,666
Look, there's Sumathi.

753
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,708
Sumathi, say hi to my dad.

754
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:46,333
-Hi, Uncle.
-By the way, today's Friday.

755
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:48,291
Did you clean Lakshmi?
Click a photo and send it to me.

756
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,250
A few days ago, a land revenue officer
had stuffed the bribe he got

757
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,708
into a grinder, mixer, and utensils.

758
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,083
Yes, that guy from Salem.

759
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,208
Sir, just like that,

760
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:01,333
there's a major illegal stash
in this house.

761
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:02,833
They must have stolen it.

762
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:04,833
This guy is hiding something from us.

763
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:07,083
Sir, based on my calculations,

764
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:09,291
there's something very valuable
in that dustbin.

765
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,458
If we squash him,

766
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,791
we won't have to work
for small change anymore.

767
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:16,208
We could make a lot of money.

768
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:23,333
I don't smoke, sir.

769
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:26,541
So, is this your own house?

770
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:29,208
Yes, sir. We moved in here
after my wife passed away.

771
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,250
Do you suspect anyone?

772
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:34,833
Those who work in nearby fields
or guests who visit you regularly.

773
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:36,750
No, sir.

774
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,458
Look, I'll be working in this police
station until I retire from service.

775
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:46,583
Don't be afraid of anyone.
Nobody can harm you while I'm here.

776
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:49,750
When it comes to thieves,
there are various types.

777
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,833
Chain snatchers,
jewel robbers, vehicle thieves.

778
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,666
They all have a modus operandi.

779
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:57,958
Now, if we knew
what was really inside the dustbin,

780
00:45:58,375 --> 00:45:59,541
we could find the thief,

781
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:02,500
their whereabouts,
and where they'll sell it.

782
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:05,833
Otherwise, we'll have to waste time
roaming around.

783
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,166
-Before your daughter returns--
-Sir, don't beat around the bush.

784
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,625
Not 500,000, I'll add another two
and pay you 700,000.

785
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,166
Please find my Lakshmi
before my daughter returns at any cost.

786
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:57,500
Where are the onions?

787
00:46:58,166 --> 00:46:59,083
Onions.

788
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,583
Check in the refrigerator.

789
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:02,416
Who keeps onions in the refrigerator?

790
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:04,416
They don't?

791
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:06,541
Sorry, man.

792
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:09,458
Where are the onions?

793
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:12,458
In the loft?

794
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,208
In a box?

795
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,500
They're in a box in the loft.

796
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:20,916
Add some curd to the chicken.

797
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,458
There's no curd in the refrigerator.

798
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:24,333
You don't have curd at home?

799
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,500
Oh, come on, you don't have curd
in such a huge household?

800
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,291
I wonder how you guys run the family.

801
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:31,541
Fine, forget it.

802
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,541
The food has come out delicious today!

803
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:41,833
Five minutes.

804
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,041
Selvam, the food's ready.

805
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:58,000
Selvam, wait.

806
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,666
Looks like she has something to say.
Let's hear it out.

807
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:05,083
Speak.

808
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:08,583
Sir, you took everything you wanted.

809
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:11,916
Please spare our lives
and leave our house.

810
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,875
Look at that! Even in this situation,

811
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:16,833
she's telling us what to do.

812
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:18,083
Sir, no, sir. Not at all.

813
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:19,750
I didn't mean it that way.

814
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,291
Sir, please, sir.

815
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:24,625
You are only thinking about yourself.

816
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,500
Spare a thought for us, too.

817
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:28,708
Please, sir.

818
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:31,208
So far, wherever we've robbed,

819
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:35,875
we've never spared anyone
who saw our faces.

820
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:38,041
-Please, sir.
-But you? Like some daring warrior,

821
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:40,500
you jumped across,
pulled our masks off, and saw our faces.

822
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:42,041
-Sir…
-If we spare your lives,

823
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:45,791
-you'll go to the police.
-No, sir. I won't, sir.

824
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,916
-The police will…
-No…

825
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,083
-No, sir. I won't go to the police.
-I have no choice.

826
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:52,916
No, sir. We won't go to the police.
We won't utter a word, sir.

827
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:54,583
Fine, imagine I spare your lives.

828
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,166
What's in it for us?

829
00:48:56,458 --> 00:48:59,000
Sir, didn't you take so many jewels?

830
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:01,416
You even snatched my nuptial necklace.

831
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,875
Still not enough.

832
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:08,833
Sir, over there,

833
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,041
in front of the God's portrait,

834
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,250
is my mother-in-law's nuptial necklace.

835
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:16,208
See that, she's opening up one by one!

836
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:22,833
Still not enough.

837
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:28,666
I've kept 20,000 rupees
in the kitchen to pay my daughter's fee.

838
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:36,041
-Sir, that's all.
-Not enough.

839
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:37,916
I gave you everything I had.

840
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:40,083
I swear I don't have anything else, sir.

841
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:41,041
Really?

842
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:57,458
I promise I don't have anything else.

843
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,208
You don't have anything?

844
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,000
No, sir.

845
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,250
You've nothing left?

846
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:07,041
No, sir! No!

847
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:08,708
-Sir, please get out.
-Hey.

848
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:10,875
Do you think
you're in a position to refuse?

849
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:11,875
Sir, please.

850
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:14,000
She's my child! Please, no, sir.

851
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:15,166
-Please, sir!
-Selvam?

852
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:18,583
Please, leave her alone, sir. Sir!

853
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,500
Sir! Please don't!

854
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:22,583
My child!
Please ask him to leave her!

855
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:25,250
Sir! Please, sir!

856
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:26,166
Sir!

857
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,083
Oh, my God!

858
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,083
Sir!

859
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:30,208
My child! Please, sir!

860
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,625
Abhi! Dear Abhi!

861
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:38,291
Abhi! Please, sir!

862
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:40,666
Abhi!

863
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:09,833
Abhi…

864
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:11,541
Oh, my.

865
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:12,583
Abhi…

866
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:16,500
Her screaming is so nagging.
It's so irritating.

867
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:18,125
Fine, what do we do with her?

868
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:43,708
Give it to me.

869
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:46,791
Who's that?

870
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:49,875
Where's Ammu?

871
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:53,625
Hey, catch her. Catch her.

872
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:58,958
Be careful.

873
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,000
Darling.

874
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,958
Ammu, look what daddy got for you.

875
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,125
Why? You don't want it?

876
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:15,750
No…

877
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:17,625
You don't want it?

878
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:37,541
Excuse me! Come here.

879
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:42,375
They won't find your dustbin.

880
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:45,375
Don't waste your money.

881
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:47,750
The inspector promised me he would
form two special units to look for it.

882
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:48,791
They will find it soon.

883
00:52:51,916 --> 00:52:55,083
As if this is some Veerappan case
that needs special forces to search!

884
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:57,708
Look, they won't do anything about it.

885
00:52:57,791 --> 00:52:59,875
They will leave you stranded
until you're stripped bare.

886
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:04,416
I want a dustbin exactly like this one.

887
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:07,958
Is this a dustbin?
It looks like a rice cooker.

888
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,958
Sir, this is a new model.

889
00:53:12,041 --> 00:53:14,083
-Not this one, ma'am.
-It's a new model, sir.

890
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:17,541
Sir…

891
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
If it's gold that was stolen,
it can't be sold without my knowledge.

892
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:22,625
I can guarantee you that.

893
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,125
Sir, he refuses to go home.

894
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,375
He says he'll stay here
until we find the dustbin.

895
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:36,875
Once the duplicate dustbin is here,
he'll leave.

896
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:40,208
Mr. Dustbin! You garbage.
Come here.

897
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:42,375
Five biryanis and a pack of cigarettes.

898
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,833
Sir,

899
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:47,375
-my name is not Dustbin, it's Maharaja.
-I know.

900
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,208
37TH STATE LEVEL ATHLETIC COACHING CAMP
& SELECTION TRIALS - 2023

901
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,625
Okay.

902
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:08,250
-Anything else?
-That's all.

903
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:10,291
KOKHILA ELECTRICALS

904
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:12,666
Hello.

905
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:15,958
Which area?

906
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:37,291
Get lost! Look at him and his ugly face!

907
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:01,916
Make it fast. How long will you take?

908
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:27,458
It's okay. It will heal soon.

909
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,000
Sir,

910
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:33,458
-did you want to install a cupboard?
-I informed you three days ago.

911
00:55:33,666 --> 00:55:35,416
Well, sir, I had a lot of pending work.

912
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,750
Fine, the work's in the kitchen.

913
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,000
-Dear, make it fast.
-Coming.

914
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,791
What happened to the baby?
What's with the bandage?

915
00:55:47,916 --> 00:55:50,333
I had some old stuff up in the loft.

916
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:52,708
When I was taking it down,
it slipped and fell on her.

917
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:53,625
Oh.

918
00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:55,916
Almost done.

919
00:55:56,333 --> 00:55:57,666
It'll heal in no time, okay?

920
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:11,333
Call me without fail
after you watch this video.

921
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:13,416
I called you twice yesterday,
and you didn't answer.

922
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:14,833
Where are you?

923
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:16,791
I asked for Lakshmi's photo,
and you haven't sent it yet.

924
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:24,166
Excuse me, you must've bought this
for only 50 rupees.

925
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,208
But you're selling it for 90 rupees?

926
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:29,958
Sir, how can we sell it
for the same price we bought it?

927
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:31,083
Such a huge utensils shop,

928
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:33,041
-and you don't have this?
-No, we don't!

929
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:35,125
-Sir, we have many other things here.
-Don't raise your voice at the customer!

930
00:56:35,916 --> 00:56:37,291
Sir, this is a utensils shop!

931
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:39,041
You're asking for a dustbin here?

932
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:40,416
And it's an ancient model!

933
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,750
-Where else will I ask? Call the owner!
-Kuzhanthai…

934
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,041
Nallasivam, what are you doing here?

935
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:46,500
Why are you yelling?

936
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:48,250
Don't ask me. Give that!

937
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:52,541
The inspector asked me to buy
a dustbin exactly like this for a case.

938
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:54,416
And everywhere I go, they keep saying
they don't have it!

939
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,041
We'll say no if we don't have it.

940
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:58,291
-I'm getting pissed off!
-Sir, please tell him.

941
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:00,250
He's creating a scene here for a dustbin.

942
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:02,375
He orders me to call the owner.

943
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:05,541
-I've been here for ten years--
-But what's the use?

944
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:06,791
-Kuzhanthai.
-They don't even have a dustbin--

945
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,000
The inspector is calling.

946
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,833
-Sir.
-Kuzhanthai,

947
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:12,166
which temple's bell are you ringing?

948
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,500
I'm not ringing any bell, sir.
I'm searching for the dustbin.

949
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:18,375
Somehow, I just can't believe
you're actually working.

950
00:57:18,458 --> 00:57:21,583
Sir, I swear!
Even now, I'm in a shop looking for it.

951
00:57:21,666 --> 00:57:25,166
I met Nallasivam here.
Talk to him if you don't believe me.

952
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,333
-Nallasivam?
-Yes.

953
00:57:26,416 --> 00:57:27,958
What's he doing there?
Give the phone to him.

954
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:28,916
I'll give it, sir.

955
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:31,916
-What is it?
-He wants to talk to you.

956
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,291
Sir, tell me.

957
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:35,916
Nallasivam, what are you doing there?
No work today?

958
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,875
No, sir. Today is my day off.

959
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:40,416
I need a dustbin for a case.

960
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,250
-Did Kuzhanthai tell you?
-He did show me. I saw it.

961
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:46,208
I need an exact replica of that one.
A used one.

962
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:47,458
Find me one.

963
00:57:47,583 --> 00:57:48,500
A used one, sir?

964
00:57:49,291 --> 00:57:51,250
Kuzhanthai is looking for a brand-new one.

965
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:52,833
I knew he'd mess up like this.

966
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:55,791
-Stay with him and get this done.
-Definitely, sir.

967
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:56,791
-Okay.
-Okay, sir.

968
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,666
I need the last 20 days of

969
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,458
incoming and outgoing call details
for this number.

970
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:06,083
Also, I need the locations it's been in.

971
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:08,291
T-18 station?
Inspector Varadhan, right?

972
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:09,250
Yes, sir.

973
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:10,958
With the last case, he bought a car.

974
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:12,250
Is he going to buy an apartment
with this one?

975
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:13,916
Sir, we are dealing with this legally.

976
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,375
I know how well you deal
with things legally. Wait for a moment.

977
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,416
We have to toil hard
for them to make a fortune.

978
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,916
The dustbin that I showed you
in the photo,

979
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,541
how much do you think it costs?

980
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,083
It must cost around 500 to 600 rupees.

981
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:31,833
But a guy is ready to pay us
700,000 if we find it for him.

982
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:32,833
Your thoughts on that?

983
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:35,833
If someone's paying a bribe
in the hundreds of thousands,

984
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:37,666
then he's hiding something
worth tens of millions.

985
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,958
Don't let go of him. He's got something
really big that he's hiding.

986
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,166
Mr. Dustbin!

987
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:44,291
You garbage!

988
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,458
-Sir.
-Come here.

989
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:54,833
Never enter the control room, even if
anyone from here calls you. Got it?

990
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:57,625
Then why did you enter now?

991
00:58:58,708 --> 00:58:59,750
You called me.

992
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:03,166
I told you! Don't enter even if anyone
from here calls you. Get lost!

993
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:06,250
The number's not reachable.

994
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:09,666
-I don't know his whereabouts, sir.
-Did you inquire around?

995
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,916
I did, sir, but nobody knows.

996
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,791
-Name?
-Prabhu, sir.

997
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:18,500
I mean, the name of your friend
who's missing?

998
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:19,416
Dhana, sir.

999
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:22,291
-He works with me in the garage--
-Stop!

1000
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:23,625
You can give all those details inside.

1001
00:59:24,625 --> 00:59:26,416
The writer has stepped out to smoke.
He'll be back.

1002
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:30,958
-Do you have his photo and details?
-Yes, on my mobile.

1003
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:33,416
Everything's on mobile these days.
Do you have a hard copy of his photo?

1004
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,833
A friend is bringing it.

1005
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:40,166
I told you this would be a headache.
But you didn't listen to me.

1006
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:43,791
Looks like Karunakaran is on his way
with his lawyer.

1007
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:45,208
Move!

1008
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:48,750
THOSE WHO LIVE BY RIGHTEOUSNESS
DO NOT FALL INTO DISGRACE,

1009
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:50,041
KNOWING THE HARM CAUSED
BY UNRIGHTEOUSNESS.

1010
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:48,125
Tell me, sir.

1011
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:50,500
The white colored car parked outside,

1012
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:51,625
-whose car is it?
-The Fortuner?

1013
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,541
It belongs to our councilor. There he is.

1014
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:00,708
Pour some more water.

1015
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:03,666
What do you want?

1016
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,291
I am Maharaja.

1017
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:06,541
Maharaja?

1018
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:07,875
King of which kingdom?

1019
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:10,791
Go ahead, tell me.

1020
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:14,291
Your car that's parked outside, TN10AT…

1021
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:17,375
So you were the one who inquired
at my home this afternoon?

1022
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:22,500
Did those car robbers take you for a ride?

1023
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:26,791
I told you, Karna!
They roamed all over the place last night.

1024
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:29,041
I don't care if they took my car,

1025
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:31,041
but they stole my hero Kunal's sunglasses!

1026
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:35,166
I've given him a day's time, or else
tomorrow morning, I'll rip him apart!

1027
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,125
He doesn't know whom he's messing with.

1028
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:43,833
Sir, the guy who took your car last night,

1029
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:45,000
any idea where he is now?

1030
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:47,708
Here. Get lost!

1031
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,250
Who in the hell is he?

1032
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:54,541
You shouldn't have let him go so easily.

1033
01:01:54,625 --> 01:01:55,875
You should've beaten him up even more.

1034
01:01:56,291 --> 01:02:00,041
In a similar case, a guy in Kerala
bought a second-hand Benz.

1035
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:02,583
Only when he left his car
for service did he find out

1036
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:04,416
it wasn't a Benz but a cheap car.

1037
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:08,458
See how they trick people,
just like in the movies!

1038
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:12,583
I'll finish you off today!

1039
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:14,875
Hey!

1040
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:30,958
Hey!

1041
01:02:32,083 --> 01:02:33,458
You roam around in my car,

1042
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,000
and on top of that, you beat me up?

1043
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:39,083
I won't spare you.

1044
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:20,916
Bro, wait!

1045
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,083
Mr. Barber.

1046
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:26,541
What's up? All good?

1047
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:28,875
I should have killed you
when I broke into your house.

1048
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:30,833
I show you pity,

1049
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:32,708
and you're tailing me?

1050
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:34,916
Do you love me so much?

1051
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:38,791
Dhana, who is he?
Where did you find him?

1052
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,625
Well, he's a nobody.

1053
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:44,541
Instead of eating
and sleeping like a common man,

1054
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,083
-how dare you disturb us?
-No, wait!

1055
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:48,916
Don't finish him off so quickly.

1056
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:50,833
Chop his arms and legs one by one.

1057
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:52,833
I need some entertainment
to go with my booze.

1058
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:54,500
Or else I would have already killed him.

1059
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:55,666
Hey.

1060
01:04:56,416 --> 01:04:57,458
Stretch his hand out.

1061
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:58,875
Move.

1062
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:16,333
I said, stretch his hand out!

1063
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:25,666
Stop shaking and hold it properly.

1064
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:12,291
I only want to kill him.

1065
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:14,875
I'm sure you all have families.

1066
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:17,166
So forget what happened here and leave.

1067
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:18,375
Leave!

1068
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:19,666
I said, leave!

1069
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:50,500
Hey, give me that.

1070
01:06:57,791 --> 01:06:59,000
Did I feed you biscuits?

1071
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,500
Why are you tailing me like a dog?

1072
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:37,666
Hey!

1073
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,916
You are one of the three
who broke into my house.

1074
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:41,875
Who are the other two?

1075
01:08:42,541 --> 01:08:43,458
Tell me!

1076
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:48,416
Whether I reveal who they are or not,
you'll kill me anyway.

1077
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,083
So why should I tell you?

1078
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,583
Tell me…

1079
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,708
I'll tell you…

1080
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:03,708
I'll tell you…

1081
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,958
One of them is
at the police station in your locality.

1082
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:17,708
Find out who he is if you can.

1083
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:18,958
Go, find out. Okay?

1084
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:20,625
Find out if you can!

1085
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:28,708
Hey!

1086
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:11,291
I'll go to the police station!

1087
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:15,333
I'll chop his head off,
just like I chopped yours!

1088
01:10:36,916 --> 01:10:38,291
Whose photo is that, sir?
Your friend?

1089
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:40,208
A friend?

1090
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:42,291
He dragged me
into huge trouble and escaped.

1091
01:10:42,375 --> 01:10:43,791
He's been missing for three days now.

1092
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:46,750
I have no idea where he is
or what happened to him! No idea at all.

1093
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:50,083
It's frustrating, sir.

1094
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,958
Don't worry. You'll find him.

1095
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:01,625
I'm also here
because something of mine is missing.

1096
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:02,583
What is that?

1097
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,333
Well…

1098
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:05,916
-Lakshmi--
-Hey!

1099
01:11:10,583 --> 01:11:11,750
Do you not have any connections

1100
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:13,458
at the police station?

1101
01:11:13,958 --> 01:11:16,416
Anyone who knows both you and your friend.
Why don't you ask them?

1102
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:18,083
Nope, I don't know anybody here.

1103
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:19,625
This mongrel is the one who's always

1104
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,541
going back and forth
to the police station and prison!

1105
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:24,208
I mortgaged my house
and lent him one million.

1106
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:26,333
If not repaid on time,
then my head is on the line.

1107
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:28,041
Put your trust in God.

1108
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:29,791
You'll find him.

1109
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,541
Oh, God.

1110
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:39,125
Listen, Mr. Lawyer,

1111
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:42,583
-speak clearly and bring this to a close.
-Okay, sir.

1112
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:51,125
Sir, it's true that
I caused an issue at his service station.

1113
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:53,750
That guy broke the sunglasses
that my hero Kunal gave me.

1114
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,000
Wouldn't that make anyone furious?

1115
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:57,083
So I just roughed him up.

1116
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,375
They are here for such a silly matter.

1117
01:11:58,458 --> 01:12:00,291
See that, sir? He confessed.

1118
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:01,541
Arrest him and investigate.

1119
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:04,500
Arrest me? You fool.

1120
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:08,250
-Fool? I'd have bashed you the other day.
-Stop it. Look!

1121
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:11,541
You had a feud with him last.
Tell us what you did to him.

1122
01:12:11,625 --> 01:12:14,875
If I find out the truth, I won't care that
you're a politician. I'll beat you up!

1123
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:18,458
Look at me. Like a poet,
I'm always gazing at the sky and talking.

1124
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:22,791
That kid beat me up really bad at the bar.
So badly that my neck has gone stiff.

1125
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:26,375
How can I talk about it in public?
It'll be so embarrassing for me.

1126
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:27,625
You know that very well, sir.

1127
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:29,333
Remember anything else from that night?

1128
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:31,625
Anything else?

1129
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:35,541
Yes, sir. Before that guy came to the bar,

1130
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,458
another fellow came to me
asking about him.

1131
01:12:37,791 --> 01:12:40,375
-Who was that?
-He told me his name.

1132
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:41,916
His name is…

1133
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,791
A very nice name. It's almost
on the tip of my tongue but…

1134
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:45,708
NO RECOMMENDATION IS REQUIRED
TO MEET THE POLICE INSPECTOR

1135
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:47,291
What did he say his name was?

1136
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:50,250
-His name…
-Hey!

1137
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:52,333
Leave! Tell me when you recollect it. Go!

1138
01:12:52,416 --> 01:12:54,083
Okay, sir. See you.

1139
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:55,458
-Thanks, sir.
-Move!

1140
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:04,375
Niranjan, these guys look suspicious.

1141
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:07,250
If we dig deep into the issue,
we might strike gold.

1142
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:09,791
Excuse me, brother.

1143
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:11,208
Move over a little bit.

1144
01:13:11,916 --> 01:13:12,833
Oh, God.

1145
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:19,916
God.

1146
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:22,583
His name…

1147
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:24,708
What did he say it was?

1148
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:27,333
His name…

1149
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:28,708
Inquire about Dhana.

1150
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,625
-Trace details using his number.
-Okay, sir.

1151
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:33,250
Otherwise, they will mess things up,
and we'll have to run around.

1152
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:34,875
His name…

1153
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,541
Sir! His name is…

1154
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:45,000
-Sir, I got his name!
-What is his name?

1155
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,041
Illayaraja.

1156
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,458
Get lost! Look at him
and his hairstyle, jerk!

1157
01:13:50,958 --> 01:13:52,250
I guess he is a Rahman fan.

1158
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:23,541
Hey!

1159
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,833
What's wrong with you?
Watching a man getting dressed!

1160
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:28,291
Your cigarettes, sir.

1161
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:34,875
K. KALIMUTHU

1162
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,291
-Tell me, dear.
-We're leaving home.

1163
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:45,166
We'll take a rickshaw.
Will you come directly to the shop?

1164
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:46,708
Listen, an important thing.

1165
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,875
Your daughter will keep asking
for things at the shop.

1166
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:52,583
Do not buy everything she asks for.

1167
01:14:52,958 --> 01:14:55,291
Just buy what we can afford.

1168
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,708
-Got it?
-Okay, dear.

1169
01:14:56,875 --> 01:14:59,375
It's too hot outside.
Take care of Ammu.

1170
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:02,458
"Palani Engine-err Works."

1171
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:04,541
He couldn't even write that properly!

1172
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,083
Will he do a good job?

1173
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:09,958
Kuzhanthai, these days,
it's the uneducated who do a neat job.

1174
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:12,416
-Fine, come.
-Let's go and meet that "Engine-err."

1175
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:19,375
-I hope he'll do a neat job.
-I'll do it, sir.

1176
01:15:19,875 --> 01:15:21,083
It's 1.5 by 1.5 in size.

1177
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:23,333
-Come back the day after tomorrow.
-The day after tomorrow?

1178
01:15:23,666 --> 01:15:26,166
The inspector said it's urgent,
and he's saying come back in two days.

1179
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,083
-Please…
-This is not magic.

1180
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:31,083
I've got to get the pattern right.
It'll take time.

1181
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:32,166
I promise to do a neat job.

1182
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:33,625
Fine, ask how much?

1183
01:15:33,916 --> 01:15:35,750
-How much will it cost?
-2,500 rupees, sir.

1184
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,083
2,500 rupees?

1185
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:39,875
You told me it'd cost 500 to 600 rupees.

1186
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:42,750
-Look, I am a cop.
-That's why I'm offering a lower price.

1187
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,041
-Okay, do a neat job.
-Don't worry. It'll be perfect.

1188
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:51,583
Check this model, madam.
This is the current trend.

1189
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,916
-Dad, this one.
-How about this one?

1190
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:57,375
-What?
-These are the latest models, sir.

1191
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:58,833
I don't want these models.

1192
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:00,458
It's for my kid's birthday.

1193
01:16:00,708 --> 01:16:02,750
-So, show me some new and unique models.
-Okay, sir.

1194
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:04,166
-One moment.
-These look good.

1195
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:05,541
Why don't you choose one of these?

1196
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:06,541
Wait, dear.

1197
01:16:08,416 --> 01:16:09,250
-Madam.
-That one.

1198
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:11,166
-That one? Look at this.
-Check out these ones.

1199
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:12,583
Look.

1200
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:19,208
This looks good, right?
How is this one?

1201
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:20,666
Wow!

1202
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:23,833
Superb.

1203
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:25,875
-I knew it.
-Do you like this one?

1204
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:28,208
-I want this one.
-Shall we buy it?

1205
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:30,125
It's good.

1206
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:31,666
-You'll wear it on your birthday, okay?
-This one.

1207
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:32,583
Good choice, madam.

1208
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:35,250
It has a rare red diamond.
A classic design, madam.

1209
01:16:35,916 --> 01:16:38,125
They say it has a red diamond.
It might be costly.

1210
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:40,083
-Let's not buy it.
-Why do you worry about that?

1211
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,625
We don't have that much money.

1212
01:16:41,708 --> 01:16:44,000
Look, don't borrow money for this.

1213
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:45,541
-Daddy.
-Fine, don't worry about it.

1214
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:50,333
She likes this. Please bill it.

1215
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,416
Sir, we have to pre-order and make it.

1216
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:55,583
Her birthday is in two days.

1217
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:58,708
If it will be very late,
let us know right now.

1218
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:00,708
It won't take that long.
I'll give it in two days.

1219
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,541
-Will I get it in two days?
-Definitely, sir.

1220
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,458
-It'll look awesome.
-To hell with dad and his daughter.

1221
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:17,875
Manju, come here.

1222
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:19,875
Tell me.

1223
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:21,750
With whose permission
did you take my shoes?

1224
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:25,750
Well, the other day, my shoe ripped.

1225
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:28,333
-I needed a pair, so I took yours--
-What did I ask?

1226
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:29,916
Did you ask for my permission?

1227
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:32,833
Don't you know you must ask for
permission before taking someone's things?

1228
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:40,541
Fine, leave it. Shall we go and eat?

1229
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,333
Not sleepy?

1230
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:55,125
Was it necessary to spend
so much on that necklace?

1231
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:57,000
We must buy only according to our status.

1232
01:17:57,833 --> 01:17:58,916
To hell with status.

1233
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:00,875
Everything depends on our needs.

1234
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:03,291
Well, that's what I'm asking.

1235
01:18:03,458 --> 01:18:06,708
What's the need
to buy a diamond necklace for her?

1236
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:08,416
My daughter's happiness is all I need.

1237
01:18:09,375 --> 01:18:10,750
Everything she wishes under the sky

1238
01:18:11,375 --> 01:18:12,541
must be hers.

1239
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:15,041
Money should never be a hindrance to that.

1240
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:20,250
Doctor, Collector, Engineer,
let her become whatever she wishes for.

1241
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:22,500
No matter how much it costs.
I'll take care of it.

1242
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:25,250
She must live the life she wants.

1243
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:30,958
You talk as if our fathers run a bank.

1244
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,375
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

1245
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:58,166
Missing your dad's cooking?

1246
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:01,625
Not just Dad's cooking,
but I miss Dad, Lakshmi, and home.

1247
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,250
You are so emotional here,

1248
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:06,750
but at home,
you dominate your dad. Why is that?

1249
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:08,500
Miss, he likes it.

1250
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:12,000
When I scold him
or teach him something,

1251
01:19:12,083 --> 01:19:15,500
he feels so proud
that his daughter knows everything.

1252
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:27,375
Where is he looking at?

1253
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:36,958
Forget 500,000, just pay me 400,000.

1254
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:38,916
I'll help you find your dustbin.

1255
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:42,416
Why are you looking at me like that?
I'm also Police.

1256
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,125
Ask anyone here.

1257
01:19:47,291 --> 01:19:48,666
Fine, pay me 300,000.
I'll get it done.

1258
01:19:53,708 --> 01:19:56,125
Are you going to tell on me?

1259
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:58,583
I'll break your neck.

1260
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:02,000
The third time you made that noise,

1261
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,166
it didn't sound like a cat's meow.

1262
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:24,125
Niranjan!

1263
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:26,708
-What are you doing here?
-Sir!

1264
01:20:27,166 --> 01:20:28,375
What are you doing here, sir?

1265
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:29,958
Maharaja's case.

1266
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:31,291
I'm here for Illayaraja's case.

1267
01:21:02,875 --> 01:21:04,791
-Tell me, dear.
-Got the necklace?

1268
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:06,541
I'm at the shop. I'll collect it now.

1269
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:08,708
Do check the weight.
Don't let them cheat you.

1270
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:11,083
It's a reputed shop. They won't.

1271
01:21:11,458 --> 01:21:13,208
-Happy birthday, Ammu.
-Listen,

1272
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:15,000
-Bye.
-did you buy the things for the ritual?

1273
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:17,166
-I'll buy them on my way.
-Okay.

1274
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:18,458
I'm forgetting something.

1275
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,166
I had given my blouse for stitching.

1276
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,625
Along with the ready-made one,
collect that as well.

1277
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:24,708
-Okay.
-Also,

1278
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:26,250
we're expecting many guests, dear.

1279
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:29,250
So, go to a good salon
and shave your beard.

1280
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,500
I'll look bad without the beard.

1281
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:33,083
-At least trim it.
-Ma'am.

1282
01:21:33,166 --> 01:21:34,125
-Ma'am!
-Yes?

1283
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:36,875
-I'll talk to you later. Bye.
-Okay.

1284
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:39,458
-Yes, what is it?
-Where do we place these benches?

1285
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:57,083
Everybody, listen up.

1286
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:59,791
Today is my daughter's birthday.
We have a function at our home.

1287
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,791
So, don't cook or eat outside.

1288
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:05,291
-Ms. Jaya, especially you.
-Yes.

1289
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,166
Be at my house in half an hour.

1290
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:09,208
-Or else, no more ties with you.
-Okay.

1291
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:11,500
Shall we get ready
before your dad arrives?

1292
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:54,666
Hello. Is it delivered?

1293
01:22:55,416 --> 01:22:56,250
No?

1294
01:22:56,333 --> 01:22:58,541
The function is at three o'clock.
When will you deliver?

1295
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:03,250
Where are you now?

1296
01:23:05,041 --> 01:23:06,458
Keep going straight.

1297
01:23:06,791 --> 01:23:08,750
The house in the
street next to Vetri Medicals.

1298
01:23:09,375 --> 01:23:11,625
-Thanks.
-You can see a decorated house.

1299
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:14,666
They'll be waiting. Make it fast!

1300
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:20,833
Please come.

1301
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,833
Take care of things here.
I'll go have a tea and come.

1302
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:27,666
-Shall I join?
-Come.

1303
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,375
-Cutting or shaving, sir?
-Trimming.

1304
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:30,458
Okay.

1305
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:34,250
Any function at home, sir?

1306
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:38,708
Well, I heard you talking on the phone.

1307
01:23:39,708 --> 01:23:40,875
Yes, my child's birthday.

1308
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:42,916
Son or daughter, sir?

1309
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:46,125
-Daughter.
-I, too, have a daughter, sir.

1310
01:23:47,125 --> 01:23:47,958
What's her name, sir?

1311
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:51,708
Will you trim only if I tell you her name,
place, horoscope, and all the details?

1312
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:53,875
Just mind your business.

1313
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,916
Okay, sir.

1314
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,833
What happened? Battery's dead?

1315
01:24:19,916 --> 01:24:21,916
Yes, sir. I'll trim it with scissors.

1316
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:24,666
Will you trim one by one?

1317
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:27,541
Go and buy the battery.

1318
01:24:30,666 --> 01:24:31,625
Please wait. I'll be back, sir.

1319
01:24:45,666 --> 01:24:47,250
-Tell me, Sabari.
-Where are you?

1320
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:49,416
In a salon. What's the matter?

1321
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:52,375
Step out. I want to have a word.

1322
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:54,291
I'm all alone here. Tell me.

1323
01:24:54,625 --> 01:24:56,541
Our robberies are in the newspaper.
Saw it?

1324
01:24:56,708 --> 01:24:58,166
Is it? What's written?

1325
01:24:58,458 --> 01:25:01,791
They have not just written
about our last robbery,

1326
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:04,500
but they have written about
each and every robbery of ours.

1327
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:06,125
Wait a minute. Let me check.

1328
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:08,500
Brother, I need five meters of this wire.

1329
01:25:09,583 --> 01:25:11,166
I'm talking to you. I need this wire.

1330
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:12,208
Please leave!

1331
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,666
What a jerk.
Shouldn't have come to your shop.

1332
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:16,583
Not only that,

1333
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:18,958
but they've also mentioned it as if
it was done by guys from another state.

1334
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:22,750
How long will the police
keep the case file open?

1335
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,916
They will obviously try to
frame somebody and close the case.

1336
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Well, Selvam,
if they have got so much detail,

1337
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,708
then don't you think
that by now they know it's us?

1338
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:34,666
They print such news
so that we'll react and get caught.

1339
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:37,166
Don't beat yourself
thinking about this. Got it?

1340
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:39,041
Be on time for the function.

1341
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:49,916
BURGLARS TARGETING ISOLATED HOMES
THE POLICE ARE ON ALERT

1342
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:15,791
Just 20 rupees.

1343
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:18,250
No tips, please.

1344
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:34,958
Sister, why are you doing these chores?

1345
01:26:35,041 --> 01:26:37,666
-It's okay. You attend to the guests.
-Okay.

1346
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:39,291
Come, dear.

1347
01:26:40,458 --> 01:26:42,416
-Please serve the juice to everybody.
-Bye.

1348
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:44,541
-Bye. Okay.
-The glasses are over there.

1349
01:26:44,666 --> 01:26:45,833
Waving bye to her?

1350
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:50,000
Hey.

1351
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,333
What happened?

1352
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:57,166
What happened, dear?
Why do you look dull?

1353
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:59,500
You've been dull
since you arrived home.

1354
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:03,166
-Are you not feeling well?
-I'm tired after driving for a long time.

1355
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:06,708
You look so sharp after trimming.
Now sport a smile, come on.

1356
01:27:07,541 --> 01:27:08,416
Smile now.

1357
01:27:08,791 --> 01:27:09,916
Ask your daddy to smile.

1358
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:13,125
Tell him, "Smile, Daddy."
Come on, let me see that.

1359
01:27:14,041 --> 01:27:14,958
Selvam.

1360
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:16,791
Selvam.

1361
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:20,833
Here.

1362
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:22,791
-Come here.
-What happened?

1363
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:27,791
Sabari, remember our call earlier?

1364
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,875
The guy at the salon heard it.

1365
01:27:31,166 --> 01:27:32,958
Hey, look, your mom's calling.

1366
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:34,166
Please take him.

1367
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:38,166
You said you were all alone.
Then how?

1368
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,125
I was alone when you called.

1369
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:41,708
But after the call, I turned
and saw him standing there.

1370
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:47,000
Okay, we'll follow him.

1371
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:48,833
We'll find the right time
and finish him off.

1372
01:27:48,916 --> 01:27:51,208
Should we move the money
and jewels elsewhere?

1373
01:27:51,791 --> 01:27:53,541
Let's split it
and stash it in different places.

1374
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:54,750
-That'll be safe.
-Dear…

1375
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:56,333
Dear…

1376
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:57,916
Where's the necklace?

1377
01:27:58,125 --> 01:28:00,625
-Check in the bag.
-I did, but it's not there.

1378
01:28:00,833 --> 01:28:01,916
-It's not there?
-No.

1379
01:28:02,958 --> 01:28:04,333
Fine, you carry on with the work.

1380
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:25,750
Leave it. After searching everywhere,
he'll finally come here.

1381
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:27,583
-We'll give it to him then.
-I feel bad for him.

1382
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:30,000
He told me his daughter's
birthday function was at 3 p.m.

1383
01:28:30,291 --> 01:28:33,625
If it bothers you so much,
then go and give it to him yourself.

1384
01:28:33,916 --> 01:28:34,833
Okay, boss.

1385
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:37,666
So you want a day off
today as well, right?

1386
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:38,625
Poor guy, boss.

1387
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,958
Go. Get lost.

1388
01:28:45,166 --> 01:28:46,041
It's not there.

1389
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:47,666
-Tell me everywhere you went.
-I was…

1390
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:53,041
One minute…

1391
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:55,875
Sabari…

1392
01:28:56,583 --> 01:28:58,125
-Sabari…
-I got work here.

1393
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:00,041
-Just come!
-Take care of it.

1394
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:17,750
Selvam, why is the police here?

1395
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:23,416
Doesn't look like
they are here for us. Be quiet.

1396
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,500
No, they are here for us.

1397
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:28,166
He ratted us out. Jerk!

1398
01:29:29,625 --> 01:29:32,000
Sabari, leave. Just leave.

1399
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:35,250
Damn it! You thief!

1400
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:37,416
How long have we been searching for you?
Finally, gotcha!

1401
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,541
You thief! You rascal!

1402
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:40,583
You decorate your house
with all the money you stole

1403
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:41,583
-and you're celebrating here?
-Sir…

1404
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,875
-Sir.
-Do you take police for fools?

1405
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:45,458
Understood our power now?

1406
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:48,250
-Arrest him! Walk!
-Sir…

1407
01:29:48,833 --> 01:29:51,458
-Please move.
-Stop acting innocent!

1408
01:29:52,375 --> 01:29:53,416
Leave! Move!

1409
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:56,291
-Don't come near! Move!
-Hands off him!

1410
01:29:56,375 --> 01:29:58,291
-I said, hands off him!
-Walk!

1411
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:00,291
Stop! Stop it!

1412
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:02,875
I said stop it,
and you're manhandling my husband?

1413
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:06,875
He widowed, raped, and killed many women!

1414
01:30:06,958 --> 01:30:09,208
-You live with him without knowing that?
-Who told you all this?

1415
01:30:09,291 --> 01:30:10,791
Are you shocked by just this?

1416
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:13,208
A few days ago,
your husband and that fellow

1417
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:15,250
burned a woman and her daughter alive.

1418
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:16,333
Do you know all that?

1419
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,083
Rascal, tell her!

1420
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:19,166
Tell her!

1421
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:22,250
-I said, tell her! You heard me!
-Stop hitting him.

1422
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:24,833
Let me talk to him.
Dear, what is he blabbing?

1423
01:30:24,916 --> 01:30:25,833
-Is he your "dear"?
-Does the police have the

1424
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:26,875
-He is a murderer!
-license to say anything?

1425
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:29,041
How dare he accuse you?

1426
01:30:29,208 --> 01:30:30,416
Tell him you're innocent.

1427
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:32,833
Don't I know about my darling?

1428
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,833
You're a nice man,
and you run a shop, right?

1429
01:30:34,916 --> 01:30:35,958
-Tell me.
-What are you guys doing there?

1430
01:30:36,041 --> 01:30:37,416
-Aren't they framing you
-Let's smash both

1431
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,750
-instead of finding the real culprit?
-these culprits today.

1432
01:30:39,916 --> 01:30:42,333
-Tell them you're innocent, dear.
-Say it, if you can!

1433
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,208
-Say it, dear.
-Hey, move aside!

1434
01:30:44,291 --> 01:30:45,333
-Tell them you're innocent.
-Move!

1435
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,083
-Tell them you're innocent.
-Don't let him escape! Catch him!

1436
01:30:49,166 --> 01:30:50,000
Hey, Sabari!

1437
01:30:50,416 --> 01:30:51,291
Oh, God!

1438
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:55,208
-No! Put the gun down!
-Sabari, what did you just do?

1439
01:30:55,291 --> 01:30:58,708
Put the gun down.
You're again making a mistake!

1440
01:30:58,791 --> 01:30:59,875
-Don't come near me!
-Put the gun down!

1441
01:30:59,958 --> 01:31:02,000
-Selvam, run!
-Sabari, listen to me. No!

1442
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:04,750
-You run! I'll manage them.
-No, Sabari.

1443
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:06,333
Sabari, we are caught!
We'll handle it later.

1444
01:31:06,416 --> 01:31:07,625
-I'll shoot you if you come near me.
-Sabari…

1445
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:08,666
-Put the gun down!
-Sabari…

1446
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:12,500
Hey, his gun might be loaded.
Everyone, move aside.

1447
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:14,541
-Move aside, man! Move!
-Sabari, no.

1448
01:31:14,625 --> 01:31:15,916
-Surrender the gun.
-Leave!

1449
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,833
-Listen to me!
-Sabari.

1450
01:31:16,916 --> 01:31:18,916
-I'll kill you all! Selvam, I got this!
-Sabari, no! Surrender the gun.

1451
01:31:19,375 --> 01:31:20,208
Hey!

1452
01:31:20,291 --> 01:31:22,375
-Kokhila, I'll explain it to you later.
-Hey, listen to me.

1453
01:31:22,458 --> 01:31:23,541
-Selvam, you escape!
-Just surrender the gun.

1454
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:24,708
Listen to me.
This is for your own good.

1455
01:31:25,458 --> 01:31:26,583
You better put the gun down.

1456
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:27,916
-I'll shoot!
-Listen to me…

1457
01:31:38,208 --> 01:31:39,041
Sabari!

1458
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:41,500
Hey, Sab…

1459
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:43,625
Hey, Sabari?

1460
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:45,458
Sabari?

1461
01:31:46,541 --> 01:31:47,416
Sabari!

1462
01:31:47,666 --> 01:31:50,000
No! Sabari…

1463
01:31:50,708 --> 01:31:51,541
Sabari…

1464
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:55,958
Kokhila…

1465
01:32:00,541 --> 01:32:01,375
Walk!

1466
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,750
Daddy!

1467
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:09,541
-Daddy!
-Sir.

1468
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:10,458
Ammu.

1469
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:12,500
-Ammu!
-Hey!

1470
01:32:12,916 --> 01:32:15,000
-Sir, let me talk to my daughter once.
-Mummy!

1471
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:16,750
-No! No!
-One last time, sir.

1472
01:32:16,833 --> 01:32:18,541
-No way!
-Just once, sir.

1473
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,416
-Ammu!
-I won't give you my child.

1474
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:22,166
Ammu…

1475
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:26,333
He must not even lay a finger on my child.
Take him away! Arrest him.

1476
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:29,583
I cut ties with my family
and married you.

1477
01:32:29,958 --> 01:32:33,250
How could you cheat me?
I curse you!

1478
01:32:33,583 --> 01:32:35,625
-You've insulted me in front of the world.
-Ammu…

1479
01:32:35,916 --> 01:32:37,625
-My life is ruined! Where will I go now?
-Ammu…

1480
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:39,625
-Daddy.
-The only thing I can do is end my life.

1481
01:32:40,416 --> 01:32:43,708
Don't show up even if I die.
Don't come to my funeral either!

1482
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:47,750
-Take him away, sir.
-Enough of your drama! Walk!

1483
01:32:49,125 --> 01:32:50,375
Daddy!

1484
01:32:50,583 --> 01:32:53,583
Don't cry, dear. Take him away.

1485
01:32:53,666 --> 01:32:54,708
All of you move.

1486
01:32:56,083 --> 01:32:58,541
-Did you take the police for fools?
-Move!

1487
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:01,416
Move!

1488
01:33:02,375 --> 01:33:03,291
Walk!

1489
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,583
Don't cry, dear.

1490
01:33:18,541 --> 01:33:19,541
Did you take all your belongings?

1491
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:22,041
Get in, let's go.

1492
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:25,666
What are you discussing there?
It's getting late. Let's go.

1493
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:28,250
Dad, we are heading back.
I'll reach home tonight.

1494
01:33:28,791 --> 01:33:33,375
My new shoes got torn
while I was jogging this morning.

1495
01:33:33,625 --> 01:33:35,208
Buy me the same red-colored new pair.

1496
01:33:35,291 --> 01:33:36,500
I have practice tomorrow on the ground.

1497
01:33:36,833 --> 01:33:39,625
I've sent you the photo.
Don't forget to buy it, okay?

1498
01:33:40,666 --> 01:33:41,541
DAD

1499
01:33:47,791 --> 01:33:49,291
Buy me the same red-colored new pair.

1500
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:50,583
I have practice tomorrow on the ground.

1501
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:53,166
I've sent you the photo.
Don't forget to buy it, okay?

1502
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:54,083
So…

1503
01:33:55,291 --> 01:33:56,833
Looks like they found the culprit.

1504
01:33:57,291 --> 01:33:59,958
-You'll get the dustbin tomorrow.
-Thank you, sir.

1505
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,750
Do you think I was waiting
for your thanks?

1506
01:34:07,666 --> 01:34:08,625
Nallasivam, check it properly.

1507
01:34:11,375 --> 01:34:12,875
-Here.
-Rushing things is never good.

1508
01:34:13,541 --> 01:34:14,375
Touch and feel it.

1509
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:17,875
-It's as smooth as a young girl's skin.
-You and your comparisons!

1510
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:20,000
How is it, sir?

1511
01:34:20,458 --> 01:34:22,500
-It looks exactly like that one.
-Yes, it does.

1512
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:26,166
-Yes, sir. It wasn't an easy task--
-Nallasivam, you're a skilled worker.

1513
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:27,166
-Thanks, sir.
-Sir!

1514
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:29,208
You're good at wasting time, too.

1515
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:34,166
Now, dent it and make it dirty,
exactly like in this photo.

1516
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:35,416
Consider it done, sir.

1517
01:34:41,083 --> 01:34:42,541
-Give me that.
-Here.

1518
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:45,416
Look carefully. This is the spot.

1519
01:34:46,166 --> 01:34:47,000
This spot.

1520
01:35:06,791 --> 01:35:08,166
Rub it nicely.

1521
01:35:10,583 --> 01:35:11,875
Sir, he has done it. Look.

1522
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:12,791
Here.

1523
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:17,041
-Nallasivam, you beauty!
-Sir.

1524
01:35:17,333 --> 01:35:18,875
You've made it look exactly the same!

1525
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:20,458
You've proved
that you're indeed a skilled worker.

1526
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:23,458
Apply holy ash and vermilion,
and it'll be ready.

1527
01:35:23,541 --> 01:35:25,750
-Superb!
-Sir, I have a doubt.

1528
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:29,250
What if he finds out
this is a duplicate dustbin?

1529
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:32,375
Let him find out!
That's what we want.

1530
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:33,958
-I don't get it.
-Look,

1531
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:35,916
if he's really looking for the dustbin,

1532
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,166
then he'll accept this,
pay us the balance, and leave.

1533
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:40,333
But if there's something big behind this,

1534
01:35:40,416 --> 01:35:43,791
he'll ask us who stole it,
where it was, and other details.

1535
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:45,666
We'll point to some accused and end it.

1536
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:47,958
Sir, he will pay
the remaining balance to us

1537
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:50,416
and follow the accused we showed him,
believing he's the real thief.

1538
01:35:51,208 --> 01:35:53,500
He'll fall into the trap,
and we'll know what's inside it.

1539
01:35:53,583 --> 01:35:57,416
-Correct! Spot on, Nallasivam.
-Sir, this is like taking the long route.

1540
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,041
-Do you have a better idea?
-No, sir.

1541
01:35:59,125 --> 01:36:00,833
No, right?
Then, shut up and follow my orders.

1542
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:02,625
Okay, sir. As you wish.

1543
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:22,583
Enough.

1544
01:36:23,583 --> 01:36:25,333
-Keep it here.
-Okay.

1545
01:36:30,083 --> 01:36:32,750
-Tell me, sir.
-Can you turn yourself in for stealing?

1546
01:36:33,666 --> 01:36:36,333
For stealing what, sir?
If you want, I'll steal it for real.

1547
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:38,041
We've got back the stolen item.

1548
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:40,000
You just turn yourself in.
I'll handle the rest.

1549
01:36:40,083 --> 01:36:42,083
Okay, sir. What's the stolen item?

1550
01:36:42,458 --> 01:36:45,083
-Nothing but just an ordinary dustbin.
-A dustbin?

1551
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:47,333
-Yes, a dustbin.
-What was inside it, sir?

1552
01:36:47,416 --> 01:36:49,041
Nothing. Just an empty dustbin.

1553
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:52,791
Sir, do you think I'm a fool to turn in
for stealing an empty dustbin?

1554
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:54,416
-Hang up the call, sir!
-Hey…

1555
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:56,500
Kumar, where are you?

1556
01:36:56,583 --> 01:36:58,875
Sir, it's me, Kumar's wife.

1557
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:01,000
Is he not home?
I need a favor from him.

1558
01:37:01,291 --> 01:37:05,041
Last week, Inspector Pallavaram
needed a favor, and now he's in prison.

1559
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:08,208
Let him come out, sir.
I'll tell him that you need a favor.

1560
01:37:08,291 --> 01:37:10,791
-Don't worry. He'll do it, sir.
-Okay.

1561
01:37:11,083 --> 01:37:13,541
Rajamanickam, Inspector Varadhan here.

1562
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:15,166
Tell me, sir. Hope you're fine.

1563
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:17,000
I'm good. How about you?

1564
01:37:17,083 --> 01:37:18,583
-I'm doing great.
-Great.

1565
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:20,833
-I need your help.
-What help, sir?

1566
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:23,083
Well, we've got the stolen item back.

1567
01:37:23,541 --> 01:37:25,000
Just turn yourself in for stealing it.

1568
01:37:25,083 --> 01:37:27,416
No worries, sir. I'll take the blame.

1569
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:29,791
So, what's the item, sir?

1570
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:32,791
Come in person. I'll show it to you.

1571
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:34,250
Sir, if you tell me what is it,

1572
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:36,750
I'll rehearse well and do a neat job.

1573
01:37:37,125 --> 01:37:38,791
Well, it's a…

1574
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:40,875
It's a dustbin.

1575
01:37:42,333 --> 01:37:43,708
Hello?

1576
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:46,750
Rajamanickam!
I know you're on the line.

1577
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:48,625
You! Hey!

1578
01:37:48,791 --> 01:37:52,000
Kuzhanthai, you'll cross that
traffic signal on your way back, right?

1579
01:37:52,291 --> 01:37:53,458
Drop me at that signal.

1580
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:54,916
I'll take a rickshaw
from there and go home.

1581
01:37:55,666 --> 01:37:56,708
Let's meet the inspector before we leave.

1582
01:37:59,083 --> 01:38:00,875
Is it? Fine, I'll take care of it.

1583
01:38:02,916 --> 01:38:06,250
Sir, now that's a lot of cigarettes.

1584
01:38:06,791 --> 01:38:09,458
Looks like you'll spend
that 700,000 rupees on cigarettes.

1585
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:12,208
700,000, my foot!
To get that money, we need a thief.

1586
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:13,500
But what happened?

1587
01:38:13,916 --> 01:38:16,375
I called everyone on this list,
and none of them are ready to come.

1588
01:38:16,625 --> 01:38:18,625
Is it such a shame
to play a dustbin thief?

1589
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:21,291
Who said it's a shame, sir?
Call Rajamanickam, sir.

1590
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:24,083
Don't even utter his name.
If I catch hold of him, I'll slap him!

1591
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:25,625
-Kuzhanthai…
-Sir?

1592
01:38:26,041 --> 01:38:27,666
I don't know what we are going to do,

1593
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:29,166
but by tomorrow morning, I need a thief.

1594
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,041
Sir, before morning? Impossible.

1595
01:38:31,125 --> 01:38:33,041
Earlier, I said 30,000,
but I'm ready to pay 50,000.

1596
01:38:33,125 --> 01:38:36,166
-Money is fine, but before morning--
-Sir…

1597
01:38:37,416 --> 01:38:39,375
-50,000 rupees, sir?
-Yes.

1598
01:38:39,583 --> 01:38:41,208
Do you know anybody
who can turn themselves in?

1599
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:42,791
If so, tell us. We'll pay you as well.

1600
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:45,916
Kuzhanthai, if we get anything
from the dustbin, we'll share that, too.

1601
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,291
Sir, that's too much.

1602
01:38:47,375 --> 01:38:50,125
-It's okay if we can get anyone.
-Sir… Kuzhanthai sir…

1603
01:38:51,583 --> 01:38:54,333
You're going to find a thief
who will turn himself in anyway.

1604
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:56,500
Why ask me to find someone I know?

1605
01:39:00,166 --> 01:39:01,500
I shall play that part, sir.

1606
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:03,833
Nallasivam,

1607
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,875
-can you act?
-Sir,

1608
01:39:06,666 --> 01:39:09,458
during childhood,
I acted in school plays.

1609
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:11,875
Just tell me what I must do, sir.

1610
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:13,916
-Sir…
-I'll nail it, sir.

1611
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:16,541
Wait, I have an idea. Hold on.

1612
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:19,041
Thank God. You're a savior!

1613
01:39:27,666 --> 01:39:28,583
Mom.

1614
01:39:29,291 --> 01:39:30,750
-Okay, bye.
-Bye, ma'am.

1615
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,916
-Hello, tell me, sir.
-Shanmugan,

1616
01:39:36,375 --> 01:39:37,416
is Mr. Dustbin still there?

1617
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,208
He's here more than any of us, sir.

1618
01:39:39,416 --> 01:39:42,458
Ask him to repeat that story,
but don't let him know I'm on the call.

1619
01:39:42,541 --> 01:39:44,708
Sir, please. I can't hear
or bear that story once again.

1620
01:39:44,958 --> 01:39:46,083
Last week,
my child got admitted to a school.

1621
01:39:46,166 --> 01:39:48,541
-Which school?
-CS Public School, sir.

1622
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:51,375
Hey, that school is so costly.
How are you going to manage it?

1623
01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:53,458
If you want, I'll narrate the story.

1624
01:39:53,541 --> 01:39:56,083
Why don't you try RDE School?

1625
01:39:56,166 --> 01:39:58,500
-Three robbers broke into--
-Listen, wait!

1626
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:00,625
Except for him,
nobody can narrate it properly.

1627
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:01,833
It's urgent. Ask him to narrate it.

1628
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:05,333
Mr. Dustbin,

1629
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:08,416
where to? Come to my table.

1630
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:10,166
You heard me. Sit down.

1631
01:40:12,708 --> 01:40:15,375
Look, we can't file a police report
for a missing dustbin.

1632
01:40:15,458 --> 01:40:16,958
I'll at least file a CSR.

1633
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:20,416
So tell me, in detail, what exactly
happened, and I'll note it down.

1634
01:40:20,708 --> 01:40:23,333
Sir, everybody knows my story.

1635
01:40:23,666 --> 01:40:25,458
I must go home now.
I'll narrate it tomorrow.

1636
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:27,208
Do you want your dustbin or not?

1637
01:40:27,666 --> 01:40:29,625
If yes, then narrate it now.
Otherwise, you may leave.

1638
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,833
-May I drink some water?
-Yes.

1639
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:42,333
-Kuzhanthai, record it.
-It's already recording.

1640
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:48,500
Sir, my name is Maharaja.

1641
01:40:50,125 --> 01:40:51,708
I run a salon in K.K. Nagar.

1642
01:40:52,458 --> 01:40:54,291
I reside at Bharathi Nagar, Pallikaranai.

1643
01:40:54,958 --> 01:40:56,500
On that day, around ten o'clock,

1644
01:40:57,791 --> 01:40:58,791
I closed my shop

1645
01:40:59,625 --> 01:41:01,041
and headed home on my bike.

1646
01:41:01,375 --> 01:41:03,083
I took the usual route.

1647
01:41:04,625 --> 01:41:05,916
I reached home, sir.

1648
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:11,916
-Bye, ma'am.
-Bye, Jothi.

1649
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:12,833
-Bye.
-Bye.

1650
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,208
I always keep the house key
under a flower vase outside.

1651
01:41:17,791 --> 01:41:19,375
I retrieved the key,

1652
01:41:19,916 --> 01:41:21,291
unlocked the door, and entered the house.

1653
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:23,625
I switched on the living room light.

1654
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:26,541
Then…

1655
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:30,083
I removed the bag
from my shoulder and placed it down.

1656
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:38,166
Then…

1657
01:41:39,958 --> 01:41:42,958
I went inside the room to change.

1658
01:41:43,208 --> 01:41:44,708
When I was changing…

1659
01:42:10,125 --> 01:42:10,958
Who is it?

1660
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:36,958
That was unfortunate, Selvam.

1661
01:43:37,791 --> 01:43:39,625
If he had been here when we broke in,

1662
01:43:40,375 --> 01:43:42,375
we could've killed him,
disposed of his body, and left.

1663
01:43:43,291 --> 01:43:44,666
Now, she's an obstacle.

1664
01:43:46,166 --> 01:43:48,500
Damn it. On top of that, she's beautiful.

1665
01:43:53,083 --> 01:43:54,583
What's with that look?

1666
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:57,250
As if we haven't done it before.

1667
01:43:57,958 --> 01:43:58,791
Don't give me that look.

1668
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,541
My wife has been out of town
for quite a while now.

1669
01:44:03,916 --> 01:44:05,250
Say something, Selvam.

1670
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:17,666
Do you want the exact same model of shoes?

1671
01:44:18,083 --> 01:44:19,291
How about a different model?

1672
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:21,958
-I want this exact one.
-The stock has run out.

1673
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:23,625
My daughter's coming back from her tour.

1674
01:44:24,041 --> 01:44:25,750
She'll be expecting me to have bought it.

1675
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,333
If it's urgent, please wait.

1676
01:44:27,416 --> 01:44:30,375
We have a warehouse three kilometers away.
I'll have my assistant fetch it.

1677
01:45:14,958 --> 01:45:17,916
You said he'd be home by 10:15 p.m.
Why isn't he home yet?

1678
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:19,708
Bad spying!

1679
01:45:20,416 --> 01:45:23,625
If I was bad at spying, how could I have
been a police informer for seven years?

1680
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:27,083
Selvam, for a whole month,

1681
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:28,916
I closely monitored him.

1682
01:45:29,291 --> 01:45:30,166
Let me tell you that!

1683
01:45:30,541 --> 01:45:33,708
Typically, he closes his shop
around 9:30 p.m.,

1684
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,750
heads straight home,

1685
01:45:36,083 --> 01:45:38,083
and should arrive by 10:15 p.m.

1686
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,833
I wonder what happened today.

1687
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:44,375
Clearly, not every day
is the same, Selvam.

1688
01:45:44,625 --> 01:45:45,458
This girl?

1689
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:48,083
This brat wasn't in town for a week,

1690
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,708
and now she's home,
complicating things for us.

1691
01:45:51,208 --> 01:45:54,500
Selvam, no matter how long it takes,
let's wait and finish him off.

1692
01:45:54,583 --> 01:45:55,416
What do you say?

1693
01:46:00,041 --> 01:46:01,125
Wait, Dhana!

1694
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:03,750
-Where are you going?
-Should I wait for him?

1695
01:46:03,833 --> 01:46:06,000
First, let me slit her throat.
Then we'll take care of him.

1696
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:07,333
Hey.

1697
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:10,083
Anyway, we're going to kill her.

1698
01:46:10,833 --> 01:46:13,458
Before that, shall I do it again?

1699
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:16,125
Selvam?

1700
01:46:18,208 --> 01:46:19,041
Hey.

1701
01:46:32,416 --> 01:46:33,750
I lost my senses, sir.

1702
01:46:35,666 --> 01:46:37,375
Those three were so huge,

1703
01:46:40,041 --> 01:46:41,750
I couldn't fight them alone.

1704
01:46:48,375 --> 01:46:49,833
I almost died, sir.

1705
01:46:59,166 --> 01:47:00,708
I almost died, sir.

1706
01:47:06,166 --> 01:47:07,083
They beat me up,

1707
01:47:08,208 --> 01:47:09,708
stole my Lakshmi, and ran off.

1708
01:47:15,916 --> 01:47:16,791
Please, somehow,

1709
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,000
find my Lakshmi, sir.

1710
01:47:27,833 --> 01:47:29,833
Are you done? Move.

1711
01:47:29,958 --> 01:47:30,833
Dhana.

1712
01:47:32,541 --> 01:47:33,416
We'll do it later.

1713
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,416
Let's go.

1714
01:47:35,791 --> 01:47:36,625
What do you mean?

1715
01:47:37,125 --> 01:47:38,875
Weren't you waiting 13 years for this?

1716
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:42,500
Back in prison,
you desperately wanted to kill him.

1717
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:45,125
What's stopping you now?
Are you crazy?

1718
01:47:46,125 --> 01:47:47,000
Let's finish her off.

1719
01:47:50,375 --> 01:47:51,208
Let's go.

1720
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:53,083
Now, come on!

1721
01:48:02,083 --> 01:48:04,666
Look, I have written down
everything you said.

1722
01:48:04,750 --> 01:48:05,708
The office assistant is not here.

1723
01:48:06,375 --> 01:48:07,833
The inspector will come in the morning.

1724
01:48:08,375 --> 01:48:10,666
I'll get his signature as soon
as he arrives and file a CSR.

1725
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:12,625
-Okay, sir.
-You come and collect it in person.

1726
01:48:16,625 --> 01:48:17,458
Brother…

1727
01:48:17,833 --> 01:48:18,708
Maharaja.

1728
01:48:22,666 --> 01:48:23,750
I am sure of one thing.

1729
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:26,500
You're not here for the dustbin.

1730
01:48:35,583 --> 01:48:36,458
Lakshmi, sir.

1731
01:48:46,791 --> 01:48:47,750
Nallasivam,

1732
01:48:48,541 --> 01:48:49,666
I hope everything is okay.

1733
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:52,375
Hey, sir is talking to you.

1734
01:48:53,125 --> 01:48:54,750
I hope you understood everything clearly.

1735
01:48:55,208 --> 01:48:58,166
When you act it out there,
don't repeat exactly what he said.

1736
01:48:58,458 --> 01:49:00,166
Change the story a bit

1737
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:01,791
so he won't doubt us.

1738
01:49:05,083 --> 01:49:06,208
Now, what's so funny?

1739
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:07,625
Well, sir,

1740
01:49:08,458 --> 01:49:11,333
acting as a thief who stole a dustbin

1741
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:14,458
will be very embarrassing.
This is what I was thinking.

1742
01:49:14,916 --> 01:49:18,666
If my friends find out about it,

1743
01:49:18,958 --> 01:49:20,083
-they will tease me--
-Hey!

1744
01:49:20,583 --> 01:49:22,875
One slap and your jaw will be
lying on the floor!

1745
01:49:23,125 --> 01:49:25,708
Rascal! You know me very well.

1746
01:49:27,791 --> 01:49:28,708
Sir,

1747
01:49:29,333 --> 01:49:31,666
why are you getting so angry
over such a silly matter?

1748
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:32,583
Of course, I will.

1749
01:49:33,166 --> 01:49:36,166
Sir, I never said that I wouldn't do it.

1750
01:49:36,791 --> 01:49:40,333
Well, I am going to play a dustbin thief.

1751
01:49:40,916 --> 01:49:42,333
I was just telling you the consequences.

1752
01:49:43,083 --> 01:49:45,541
Sir, I'll do it. We'll make it work!

1753
01:49:46,041 --> 01:49:46,958
What do you say?

1754
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:49,375
Wait a moment.

1755
01:49:50,083 --> 01:49:52,708
Let me make a call to my wife, sir.

1756
01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:54,333
-Go ahead.
-Come.

1757
01:49:54,416 --> 01:49:55,583
Oh, come on now, sir.

1758
01:49:56,125 --> 01:49:59,041
I've nobody to call my own.
I'll be a loner even in death.

1759
01:50:00,875 --> 01:50:02,666
For now, with the help of some locals,

1760
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:06,041
I'm taking up electrical contracts
in major apartments.

1761
01:50:07,333 --> 01:50:08,166
Let's see.

1762
01:50:13,125 --> 01:50:14,708
-Tell me, Nallasivam.
-Selvam,

1763
01:50:15,166 --> 01:50:16,416
we’re caught!

1764
01:50:16,916 --> 01:50:20,333
The salon owner
filed a missing dustbin complaint.

1765
01:50:20,833 --> 01:50:22,250
After running in circles,

1766
01:50:22,416 --> 01:50:24,083
they ended up
calling me to play the thief.

1767
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:26,541
-They don’t know we’re behind it.
-Okay, fine!

1768
01:50:26,958 --> 01:50:29,666
-Call Dhana. He'll help you.
-His number hasn’t been reachable

1769
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:30,875
for the past three days.

1770
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:33,500
I don’t know where he is.
And where the hell are you?

1771
01:50:33,583 --> 01:50:36,041
I came to Salem for some important work.

1772
01:50:36,208 --> 01:50:38,833
We’ll deal with him
once I’m back in Chennai. Don’t panic.

1773
01:50:38,916 --> 01:50:40,041
Don't panic, my foot!

1774
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:42,250
You postponed the plan to kill him,
and now look!

1775
01:50:42,333 --> 01:50:43,208
Hey.

1776
01:50:43,291 --> 01:50:44,583
I'll be exposed anyway.

1777
01:50:44,833 --> 01:50:46,916
So, I’ll tell them
I’ll come directly tomorrow morning

1778
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,208
-and escape.
-Don't do that. Listen to me.

1779
01:50:49,291 --> 01:50:51,208
-That will get you caught--
-Leave it! Now, hang up!

1780
01:50:53,875 --> 01:50:54,791
Hang up.

1781
01:50:59,333 --> 01:51:01,166
Nallasivam, done talking to your wife?

1782
01:51:03,333 --> 01:51:05,000
Yes, sir. I spoke to her.

1783
01:51:05,583 --> 01:51:10,041
Just let me know when
and where to come tomorrow.

1784
01:51:10,208 --> 01:51:11,875
I’ll come directly in the morning.

1785
01:51:11,958 --> 01:51:14,708
-See you, sir. See you, Kuzhanthai.
-No need. Stay here.

1786
01:51:16,208 --> 01:51:18,541
Sir, just tell me the time and place,

1787
01:51:18,708 --> 01:51:21,291
and I'll be there on time.
What's the big deal?

1788
01:51:21,375 --> 01:51:23,500
-Why are you--
-Your house is 20 kilometers away.

1789
01:51:23,583 --> 01:51:25,416
Escorting you will be a headache.

1790
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:26,500
Shut up and sleep here.

1791
01:51:27,791 --> 01:51:31,125
-Kuzhanthai, tell him--
-You heard me! Sleep here.

1792
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:34,083
-Kuzhanthai, you sleep here as well.
-Sir.

1793
01:51:34,166 --> 01:51:35,666
We’ve got booze.
If you want some, have it.

1794
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:36,583
What else do you need?

1795
01:51:36,666 --> 01:51:39,375
Have a few drinks
and rehearse for tomorrow.

1796
01:51:39,458 --> 01:51:40,833
-I'll stay, sir.
-Go.

1797
01:51:40,916 --> 01:51:42,916
-What's the big deal?
-Then come along.

1798
01:52:08,916 --> 01:52:09,750
Jothi,

1799
01:52:10,291 --> 01:52:12,208
you warned me, but now
you’ve carelessly left the door open.

1800
01:52:13,125 --> 01:52:15,333
Did you wash your hands
in the plate from which you ate?

1801
01:52:16,375 --> 01:52:18,000
The footwear shop guy made me wait.

1802
01:52:18,625 --> 01:52:20,375
I didn’t get the color you asked for.

1803
01:52:21,375 --> 01:52:22,416
Check this color.

1804
01:52:22,833 --> 01:52:24,208
-See if you like it…
-Dad…

1805
01:52:26,625 --> 01:52:27,500
Dad…

1806
01:52:28,625 --> 01:52:29,708
Oh, my God!

1807
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:40,958
-Doctor, save my child.
-Maharaja, get up.

1808
01:52:41,041 --> 01:52:42,375
Get up. First, get up.

1809
01:53:06,625 --> 01:53:07,458
Hey.

1810
01:53:11,583 --> 01:53:14,541
Why didn't you inform me?

1811
01:53:15,958 --> 01:53:18,458
My heart aches to see this.

1812
01:53:23,208 --> 01:53:24,083
Hey.

1813
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:28,291
If I were your age,

1814
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:33,166
I would find those mongrels,
no matter where they are,

1815
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:35,583
and stab them to death.

1816
01:53:36,291 --> 01:53:37,583
You’re a waste.

1817
01:53:50,916 --> 01:53:52,208
Fine, shall we sleep?

1818
01:53:55,125 --> 01:53:56,000
Oh, my!

1819
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:06,916
Dad…

1820
01:54:08,375 --> 01:54:09,916
-Dear?
-Dad…

1821
01:54:10,958 --> 01:54:11,833
Dad…

1822
01:54:13,416 --> 01:54:15,333
Who were they, Dad?

1823
01:54:16,625 --> 01:54:19,208
Why did they do this to me?

1824
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,458
What's my fault, Dad?

1825
01:54:24,416 --> 01:54:25,500
Tell me, Dad.

1826
01:54:28,416 --> 01:54:29,250
Dad…

1827
01:54:33,625 --> 01:54:37,333
You’ve never refused me anything
I’ve ever asked for, right?

1828
01:54:38,875 --> 01:54:41,208
Can you do something for me, Dad?

1829
01:54:42,708 --> 01:54:45,333
I want to meet the one responsible

1830
01:54:46,041 --> 01:54:47,208
for my current plight.

1831
01:54:48,875 --> 01:54:50,833
I want to have a word with him.

1832
01:54:52,458 --> 01:54:54,208
Please take me to him, Dad.

1833
01:54:55,958 --> 01:54:57,875
Will you take me to him, Dad?

1834
01:55:01,916 --> 01:55:03,458
I want to have a word with him.

1835
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:06,791
Take me to him, Dad.

1836
01:55:12,166 --> 01:55:13,416
-Kuzhanthai…
-Sir?

1837
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,958
Did you give him
all the details about Maharaja?

1838
01:55:16,041 --> 01:55:17,500
Yes, sir. He memorized them.

1839
01:55:17,583 --> 01:55:18,958
Isn't that right? Tell him.

1840
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:22,083
We might get angry and raise our hands
at you in front of Maharaja.

1841
01:55:22,166 --> 01:55:23,166
Don't mind it.

1842
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:25,291
Come on, sir.
Nallasivam is one of us.

1843
01:55:25,458 --> 01:55:26,875
He won't mind it.

1844
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:35,083
Oh, my.

1845
01:55:35,458 --> 01:55:36,291
Nallasivam…

1846
01:55:36,875 --> 01:55:37,791
Hey!

1847
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:38,875
Get down. Come.

1848
01:55:45,875 --> 01:55:46,750
Walk!

1849
01:55:47,833 --> 01:55:50,250
Maharaja, he's the one
who stole your dustbin.

1850
01:55:51,166 --> 01:55:52,500
There are a lot of valuable things
here to steal.

1851
01:55:52,625 --> 01:55:55,416
I asked him why he stole it,
and he said it was beautiful. Here.

1852
01:55:55,833 --> 01:55:57,250
What was so beautiful about it?

1853
01:55:59,291 --> 01:56:00,333
Check it properly.

1854
01:56:02,375 --> 01:56:04,750
Maharaja, what are you thinking?

1855
01:56:05,166 --> 01:56:06,458
I hope you brought the balance payment.

1856
01:56:07,458 --> 01:56:08,458
I have, sir.

1857
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,125
Go stand over there.

1858
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:12,375
You come here.

1859
01:56:13,333 --> 01:56:14,208
Act it out.

1860
01:56:16,083 --> 01:56:19,250
Act out the whole robbery scene
that you and your friends committed.

1861
01:56:20,583 --> 01:56:21,625
Why are you quiet?

1862
01:56:26,625 --> 01:56:28,458
So, where are the other two?

1863
01:56:28,541 --> 01:56:31,375
He said they escaped to North India.
We caught him, and we'll catch them, too.

1864
01:56:31,458 --> 01:56:33,708
Sir, everyone is telling
their own stories,

1865
01:56:33,791 --> 01:56:34,958
and you're believing them?

1866
01:56:35,041 --> 01:56:36,833
You act it out. Go ahead.

1867
01:56:42,125 --> 01:56:43,083
Well, somehow,

1868
01:56:43,416 --> 01:56:45,666
we thought we'd find
something valuable here,

1869
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:47,875
so my friends
and I decided to rob this house.

1870
01:56:50,208 --> 01:56:51,125
From there…

1871
01:56:57,875 --> 01:56:59,625
We broke in through this door.

1872
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:04,250
What weak construction.
Two blows, and it opened up.

1873
01:57:07,125 --> 01:57:08,875
We found nothing in the kitchen.

1874
01:57:08,958 --> 01:57:10,875
Then, we all headed to the living room.

1875
01:57:12,625 --> 01:57:15,458
We realized there's nothing
valuable here to steal.

1876
01:57:15,708 --> 01:57:18,000
So, realizing
there was nothing worth stealing,

1877
01:57:18,166 --> 01:57:19,541
we decided to leave.

1878
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:21,208
That's when

1879
01:57:21,791 --> 01:57:24,500
we heard the main door open.

1880
01:57:25,083 --> 01:57:27,791
Out of curiosity,
we hid to find out who was entering.

1881
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:29,833
It was him, sir.

1882
01:57:30,833 --> 01:57:33,291
He opened the door, came in,
and switched on the light.

1883
01:57:33,541 --> 01:57:36,041
He put the keys aside
and then placed his bag down.

1884
01:57:36,291 --> 01:57:37,750
After he placed his bag down…

1885
01:57:38,208 --> 01:57:40,041
Since he runs a salon,

1886
01:57:40,375 --> 01:57:42,416
I was sure he'd go take a shower.

1887
01:57:42,541 --> 01:57:44,916
We thought we'd escape
when he went for a shower,

1888
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:47,375
but instead, he started walking toward us.

1889
01:57:47,958 --> 01:57:48,875
He walked toward us.

1890
01:57:49,208 --> 01:57:50,083
Oh, God!

1891
01:57:55,291 --> 01:57:58,916
As he came closer,
we came in here, split up, and hid.

1892
01:58:00,208 --> 01:58:01,125
He came in…

1893
01:58:01,666 --> 01:58:02,500
He came in…

1894
01:58:03,583 --> 01:58:04,583
He started changing.

1895
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:07,875
I kept looking.

1896
01:58:12,916 --> 01:58:14,000
Just my luck,

1897
01:58:15,166 --> 01:58:16,750
something fell behind me.

1898
01:58:17,125 --> 01:58:18,833
He turned around at once!

1899
01:58:18,916 --> 01:58:21,541
He yelled,
"Who are you? Tell me! Who are you?"

1900
01:58:21,833 --> 01:58:23,666
I got confused, rushed…

1901
01:58:26,291 --> 01:58:27,125
and covered his mouth.

1902
01:58:48,583 --> 01:58:49,500
Dad…

1903
01:58:50,458 --> 01:58:51,583
There were three of them, Dad.

1904
01:58:52,375 --> 01:58:55,541
One of them had a bump on his back.

1905
01:58:58,375 --> 01:58:59,458
Out of nowhere, he bit my hand!

1906
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:01,833
I immediately slapped him.

1907
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:04,208
Didn't I?

1908
01:59:06,791 --> 01:59:07,666
Forgive me.

1909
01:59:11,625 --> 01:59:12,666
As soon as you hit me,

1910
01:59:13,125 --> 01:59:15,375
-I fainted and fell on you, right?
-Yes.

1911
01:59:24,625 --> 01:59:26,625
Sorry for hitting you.
Please forgive me.

1912
01:59:26,708 --> 01:59:29,333
There was nothing worth stealing,
so I stole the dustbin.

1913
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:31,708
Why create such a fuss
over this trivial matter?

1914
01:59:32,375 --> 01:59:33,250
Right?

1915
01:59:34,708 --> 01:59:35,625
Maharaja,

1916
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:38,625
we found the thief
as well as your dustbin.

1917
01:59:38,916 --> 01:59:40,875
Can you honor
what you promised us? It's getting late.

1918
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:47,708
I want to talk to him, sir.

1919
01:59:47,958 --> 01:59:48,916
With him?

1920
01:59:50,291 --> 01:59:51,125
Go ahead.

1921
01:59:51,583 --> 01:59:52,458
Come, let's wait outside.

1922
01:59:54,541 --> 01:59:56,291
What do you want to talk about?

1923
01:59:56,458 --> 01:59:57,333
What is it?

1924
01:59:57,625 --> 01:59:58,833
How old are you?

1925
02:00:00,500 --> 02:00:02,000
Fifty… Fifty-four.

1926
02:00:02,083 --> 02:00:03,041
At this age…

1927
02:00:03,583 --> 02:00:06,583
-Isn't that wrong?
-What does age have to do with it?

1928
02:00:06,958 --> 02:00:09,458
It looked beautiful. Isn't that enough?

1929
02:00:09,666 --> 02:00:12,041
Let it go. Okay?

1930
02:00:12,291 --> 02:00:13,125
Just forget it.

1931
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:16,833
-Don't you think it's wrong?
-Look,

1932
02:00:17,041 --> 02:00:21,333
I had no intentions of breaking in here.

1933
02:00:21,416 --> 02:00:25,250
My friend was insistent
on breaking in here,

1934
02:00:25,416 --> 02:00:27,666
so I tagged along.

1935
02:00:28,208 --> 02:00:29,250
Got it?

1936
02:00:30,583 --> 02:00:31,541
"It hurts…

1937
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,458
Please let go of me. Please!"

1938
02:00:35,583 --> 02:00:37,458
Listen,

1939
02:00:38,041 --> 02:00:40,333
if I wanted to,

1940
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,291
I could have

1941
02:00:43,208 --> 02:00:45,375
crushed that dustbin and thrown it away.

1942
02:00:45,916 --> 02:00:46,833
Did I?

1943
02:00:47,708 --> 02:00:48,541
I didn't.

1944
02:00:48,958 --> 02:00:50,791
I obeyed the inspector

1945
02:00:51,416 --> 02:00:52,750
and returned the dustbin.

1946
02:00:53,625 --> 02:00:58,166
Look, you're here, I'm here,

1947
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,541
and so is the dustbin.

1948
02:01:00,875 --> 02:01:02,916
Do you get what I'm saying?

1949
02:01:03,208 --> 02:01:05,291
Hey, do you understand?

1950
02:01:05,375 --> 02:01:06,250
Hey!

1951
02:01:06,583 --> 02:01:07,958
Threatening him at his own house?
How dare you!

1952
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,041
Well, sir,

1953
02:01:10,458 --> 02:01:12,750
even if I go to prison for this,

1954
02:01:12,833 --> 02:01:14,250
I'll get released
after three months anyway.

1955
02:01:14,333 --> 02:01:16,916
He must know
what I might do to him, right?

1956
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:17,958
That's what I was explaining.

1957
02:01:18,041 --> 02:01:20,208
-Are you threatening him?
-No, sir. Why would I--

1958
02:01:20,291 --> 02:01:21,166
I'll smash you!

1959
02:01:23,125 --> 02:01:24,000
Maharaja,

1960
02:01:24,541 --> 02:01:25,458
what do you want to do with him?

1961
02:01:31,291 --> 02:01:33,583
-Forgive and let him go.
-What? Forgive and let him go?

1962
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,416
Are you kidding?

1963
02:01:35,833 --> 02:01:37,250
You've spent hundreds of thousands
on this case.

1964
02:01:37,333 --> 02:01:38,750
He even broke your door,

1965
02:01:38,833 --> 02:01:41,125
stole your dustbin, and harmed you.

1966
02:01:41,416 --> 02:01:42,875
Just tell me,
how do you want him punished?

1967
02:01:44,875 --> 02:01:46,000
-Let him go, sir.
-I'll file a police report.

1968
02:01:47,083 --> 02:01:48,916
-Let him go, sir.
-So that's your conclusion?

1969
02:01:50,291 --> 02:01:51,333
Forgive him for everything he did?

1970
02:01:52,041 --> 02:01:54,291
-Yes, sir. Let him go.
-Forgive him for "all" his crimes?

1971
02:01:54,625 --> 02:01:55,500
Sir,

1972
02:01:56,208 --> 02:01:57,208
let him go.

1973
02:01:57,416 --> 02:01:58,583
Even if he had raped your daughter?

1974
02:01:59,083 --> 02:02:00,500
Sir!

1975
02:02:01,166 --> 02:02:02,416
Sir! Sir, what's going on?

1976
02:02:02,958 --> 02:02:04,125
Sir…

1977
02:02:22,166 --> 02:02:23,541
-What? This is shocking!
-Yes, sir.

1978
02:02:23,666 --> 02:02:25,291
-I just can't believe it.
-Nallasivam, sir.

1979
02:02:25,875 --> 02:02:27,416
Sir, please don't.

1980
02:02:27,916 --> 02:02:30,291
Sir, what's going on?
Sir…

1981
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:32,541
Sir. Inspector, please don't.

1982
02:02:32,875 --> 02:02:34,375
Sir, please don't do this.

1983
02:02:34,458 --> 02:02:36,041
-Here, kill him!
-Sir, please don't.

1984
02:02:36,166 --> 02:02:37,541
-Sir, no. Please.
-Butcher him!

1985
02:02:37,708 --> 02:02:38,666
-Listen to me, sir!
-Slash him!

1986
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:40,291
-Slash him! Take it!
-Sir! Please, no!

1987
02:02:40,375 --> 02:02:41,333
-Listen to me!
-Hey!

1988
02:02:41,458 --> 02:02:42,458
Come here!

1989
02:02:43,083 --> 02:02:44,291
-Perumal…
-Take it!

1990
02:02:44,375 --> 02:02:46,041
-Please tell him, Perumal.
-Slash him!

1991
02:02:46,291 --> 02:02:47,833
-Either you do it, or I'll do it!
-Perumal, I came here because of you.

1992
02:02:47,916 --> 02:02:49,083
-Do it!
-Perumal, please tell him.

1993
02:02:49,166 --> 02:02:51,166
-Take it!
-Sir, no. Please, no.

1994
02:02:51,250 --> 02:02:52,583
Don't give him the machete, sir!

1995
02:02:52,791 --> 02:02:54,000
Perumal, no. Please tell him.

1996
02:02:54,083 --> 02:02:55,500
Isn't this the guy
with an ear on the back?

1997
02:02:56,166 --> 02:02:59,333
Weren't you looking for him?
One slash and his head must roll!

1998
02:02:59,416 --> 02:03:02,708
No, leave me! Kuzhanthai, please.
At least you tell them.

1999
02:03:02,791 --> 02:03:03,875
Save me, Kuzhanthai.

2000
02:03:05,166 --> 02:03:07,666
You're going to die anyway.
You better die now!

2001
02:03:15,333 --> 02:03:16,750
Please, don't. Sir, no.

2002
02:03:18,375 --> 02:03:19,291
Sir!

2003
02:03:19,916 --> 02:03:22,375
Sir, we gave him the machete,

2004
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:24,125
what if we land in trouble in the future?

2005
02:03:24,291 --> 02:03:25,416
We'll handle it.

2006
02:03:25,666 --> 02:03:27,416
Would we stay quiet
if this had happened to our daughter?

2007
02:03:28,583 --> 02:03:29,458
-Let him die.
-Yes, sir.

2008
02:03:30,375 --> 02:03:31,208
Brother…

2009
02:03:31,916 --> 02:03:33,833
Please forgive me, brother.

2010
02:03:34,125 --> 02:03:36,500
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
Please forgive me.

2011
02:03:41,375 --> 02:03:42,333
Oh, God!

2012
02:04:00,875 --> 02:04:02,083
Sir!

2013
02:04:02,291 --> 02:04:04,541
Sir! Sir, open the door, please!

2014
02:04:46,958 --> 02:04:47,833
Perumal…

2015
02:04:48,083 --> 02:04:50,500
-Did you find the third guy's whereabouts?
-Yes, sir.

2016
02:05:12,250 --> 02:05:13,125
-Hello.
-Brother!

2017
02:05:13,208 --> 02:05:15,208
Someone's beating us up,
asking for you! Hey!

2018
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:39,916
Do you remember me?

2019
02:06:41,416 --> 02:06:42,458
Do you remember?

2020
02:06:46,041 --> 02:06:47,541
Fifteen years ago,

2021
02:06:47,833 --> 02:06:49,125
you sent me to prison!

2022
02:06:49,916 --> 02:06:51,083
Do you remember?

2023
02:06:53,875 --> 02:06:55,708
I lost my child because of you!

2024
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,041
I lost my wife!

2025
02:06:59,333 --> 02:07:01,291
My whole life is ruined!

2026
02:07:04,125 --> 02:07:05,291
Tell me, do you remember?

2027
02:07:06,041 --> 02:07:06,916
Or did you forget it?

2028
02:07:07,458 --> 02:07:08,708
Did you forget all that?

2029
02:07:11,125 --> 02:07:13,000
Hey, maybe you've forgotten,

2030
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:14,833
but I haven't!

2031
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,250
I haven't!

2032
02:07:22,541 --> 02:07:24,583
In prison, all I thought about
was getting revenge on you.

2033
02:07:25,125 --> 02:07:26,416
After you sent me there,

2034
02:07:26,833 --> 02:07:28,666
both you and your daughter
lived a happy life, right?

2035
02:07:29,166 --> 02:07:31,583
Does it hurt now? Does it?

2036
02:07:33,041 --> 02:07:34,458
Does it hurt, you mongrel?!

2037
02:09:06,375 --> 02:09:08,291
I am used to this pain.

2038
02:09:12,083 --> 02:09:13,208
It'll eventually fade away.

2039
02:09:15,458 --> 02:09:16,416
But…

2040
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:19,541
the pain that I inflicted on you

2041
02:09:20,833 --> 02:09:22,583
will last forever.

2042
02:09:28,708 --> 02:09:31,750
You will cry every time
you think about your daughter's plight.

2043
02:09:32,500 --> 02:09:33,625
And that is what I want.

2044
02:09:35,708 --> 02:09:36,833
That's all I want.

2045
02:09:41,625 --> 02:09:43,375
Why are you quiet?

2046
02:09:44,291 --> 02:09:45,208
Speak.

2047
02:09:45,916 --> 02:09:46,958
Speak.

2048
02:09:54,416 --> 02:09:55,458
Dad…

2049
02:10:01,958 --> 02:10:02,791
Dear…

2050
02:10:04,791 --> 02:10:06,625
You don't have to see him.
Let's go.

2051
02:10:06,708 --> 02:10:08,375
-Dad, leave me.
-Listen to me, dear.

2052
02:10:08,458 --> 02:10:09,583
-I want to have a word with him.
-Teacher,

2053
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,500
-please tell her not to.
-I want to have a word with him.

2054
02:10:11,583 --> 02:10:13,083
-Jothi, listen to your dad.
-Dad, leave me.

2055
02:10:13,166 --> 02:10:14,625
-Dad, leave me.
-No, dear. Let's go.

2056
02:10:14,791 --> 02:10:16,500
-No need. Please listen to me.
-Leave me. Dad!

2057
02:10:16,958 --> 02:10:17,958
I must have a word with him.

2058
02:10:24,041 --> 02:10:25,250
Teacher, please wait here.

2059
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:44,250
Dad, please wait outside.

2060
02:10:44,833 --> 02:10:45,791
You talk. I'll wait here.

2061
02:10:47,041 --> 02:10:48,416
Just wait outside for a minute.

2062
02:11:03,041 --> 02:11:04,708
Why are you looking at me like that?

2063
02:11:05,333 --> 02:11:08,583
I came here expecting to see
the most despicable person in the world.

2064
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:10,416
And I'm looking at him.

2065
02:11:19,708 --> 02:11:20,833
You came for this, right?

2066
02:11:22,416 --> 02:11:23,250
Here, take it.

2067
02:11:27,125 --> 02:11:30,500
Don't think you've achieved
something great by doing this to me.

2068
02:11:31,208 --> 02:11:32,291
I won't break down.

2069
02:11:32,666 --> 02:11:34,583
I will move on from this.

2070
02:11:35,250 --> 02:11:37,791
If you have a daughter like me,
then go and ask her

2071
02:11:38,333 --> 02:11:41,083
how many filthy dogs like you
we encounter every day.

2072
02:11:42,250 --> 02:11:44,125
If I had known you'd talk so much,

2073
02:11:45,166 --> 02:11:46,958
I would've killed you back then.

2074
02:11:47,041 --> 02:11:49,666
If I hadn't come here,
my dad would've killed you by now.

2075
02:11:50,708 --> 02:11:52,291
Remember, you didn't show mercy to me.

2076
02:11:52,958 --> 02:11:54,583
I'm showing mercy to you
and sparing your life.

2077
02:11:55,708 --> 02:11:56,541
You may live.

2078
02:11:58,625 --> 02:11:59,541
Dad.

2079
02:12:21,250 --> 02:12:22,333
Wow!

2080
02:12:24,833 --> 02:12:26,750
-Do you like this one?
-I want this one.

2081
02:12:26,833 --> 02:12:28,250
-Shall we buy it?
-Yes.

2082
02:12:28,333 --> 02:12:31,041
One guy came to your house
with his wife and kid.

2083
02:12:40,041 --> 02:12:42,458
On your daughter's birthday,
your husband went to his salon.

2084
02:12:42,750 --> 02:12:44,708
He forgot the necklace there.

2085
02:12:44,916 --> 02:12:47,416
By the time he could return it
to your home, a lot had happened.

2086
02:12:47,583 --> 02:12:49,250
We even went to your house a few times.

2087
02:12:49,666 --> 02:12:50,708
But it was locked.

2088
02:12:51,125 --> 02:12:53,458
We looked everywhere
and finally found you in this house.

2089
02:12:54,875 --> 02:12:55,708
Hey.

2090
02:12:56,125 --> 02:12:56,958
Hand it over.

2091
02:12:59,416 --> 02:13:01,791
Please. I don't want
that piece of jewelry.

2092
02:13:02,166 --> 02:13:07,166
I wonder how many families
he killed and robbed to buy this.

2093
02:13:07,458 --> 02:13:09,291
Please donate it to some temple.

2094
02:13:09,625 --> 02:13:12,666
I wish that even a small gift
my daughter receives

2095
02:13:12,833 --> 02:13:14,458
must come from hard-earned money.

2096
02:13:21,375 --> 02:13:22,250
Hey.

2097
02:13:22,666 --> 02:13:24,666
Go to the shop across the road
and buy her a doll.

2098
02:13:57,166 --> 02:13:58,500
In that accident,

2099
02:13:58,750 --> 02:14:02,083
only one child survived,
and they took her to the hospital.

2100
02:14:02,291 --> 02:14:06,000
But I heard that the kid succumbed
to the injuries and died.

2101
02:14:25,375 --> 02:14:26,291
Ammu!

2102
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:28,666
Ammu!

2103
02:14:29,583 --> 02:14:31,000
Nothing. Let's leave.

2104
02:14:31,166 --> 02:14:32,000
Come.

2105
02:14:32,083 --> 02:14:32,958
Ammu!

2106
02:14:36,375 --> 02:14:37,416
Ammu!

2107
02:14:38,958 --> 02:14:39,875
Ammu!

2108
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,166
-Ammu!
-You guys keep walking. I'll be back.

2109
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:44,416
Ammu!

2110
02:14:48,125 --> 02:14:49,083
Hey…

2111
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,083
That's my daughter, isn't she?

2112
02:14:51,666 --> 02:14:53,750
Isn't she my daughter? Tell me.

2113
02:14:56,791 --> 02:14:57,791
Ammu!

2114
02:14:57,916 --> 02:15:01,083
Oh God! Please forgive me, O my deity!

2115
02:15:01,375 --> 02:15:02,208
Hey…

2116
02:15:02,291 --> 02:15:04,416
She's my daughter, isn't she?
Please tell me!

2117
02:15:04,541 --> 02:15:07,166
Let me talk to her once.
Just once! Please!

2118
02:15:07,250 --> 02:15:08,541
I promise I won't tell her
that I'm her father.

2119
02:15:08,625 --> 02:15:09,541
Ammu!

2120
02:15:09,666 --> 02:15:12,291
Please call her. I beg you.

2121
02:15:12,916 --> 02:15:14,875
Please call her. Please call my daughter.

2122
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,250
Please call my daughter.
Please!

2123
02:15:35,166 --> 02:15:38,333
Please bring her here.
Let me ask for forgiveness. Call her.

2124
02:15:38,416 --> 02:15:40,875
She's my daughter, isn't she?
Tell me!

2125
02:15:41,166 --> 02:15:42,083
Bring her here.

2126
02:15:46,083 --> 02:15:47,041
She's my daughter.

2127
02:15:47,666 --> 02:15:48,958
Ammu!

2128
02:15:49,708 --> 02:15:50,958
Ammu!

2129
02:15:51,875 --> 02:15:53,208
Ammu!

2130
02:15:53,541 --> 02:15:54,833
Ammu!

2131
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:11,541
Ammu!

2132
02:16:13,041 --> 02:16:14,666
Ammu…

2133
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:19,375
Ammu!

2134
02:16:19,666 --> 02:16:20,625
Ammu!

2135
02:16:21,083 --> 02:16:22,916
Ammu…

2136
02:16:36,666 --> 02:16:37,708
Ammu!

2137
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:40,375
Ammu!

2138
02:16:53,791 --> 02:16:54,875
Ammu!

2139
02:16:56,625 --> 02:16:57,791
Ammu!
