1
00:00:41,689 --> 00:00:43,732
Oh, great and mighty Rapu

2
00:00:44,442 --> 00:00:47,862
we pray to you for water and sustenance.

3
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:53,409
I pray to you, not for me,
but for my daughter.

4
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:32,239
I'm tired.

5
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:15,449
You have suffered.

6
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:18,160
Come to me.

7
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:21,330
Come to me.

8
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:29,046
You have suffered.

9
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:35,261
Come to me.

10
00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:48,732
You have suffered.

11
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:32,151
What do we have here?

12
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:35,654
Look at it.

13
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:37,615
It's gobbling up all my fruit.

14
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:42,369
Rapu.

15
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:47,207
Bringer of Light.

16
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,584
Oh, it's one of mine.

17
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:53,464
I am Gorr, the last of your disciples.

18
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:56,550
We have lost everything, my lord.

19
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:58,344
The land is dry.

20
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,679
All life is lost.

21
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:05,017
But our faith in you never wavered
and now we await the promise

22
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:08,646
of the eternal reward.

23
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:11,023
Is this why you celebrate?

24
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,402
He thinks there's an eternal reward.

25
00:04:19,657 --> 00:04:21,450
No. No, sorry.

26
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:23,744
There's no eternal reward for you, dog!

27
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:28,248
What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.

28
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:31,460
We just vanquished
the holder of the Necrosword...

29
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:33,188
- You have suffered.
- Before he could harm

30
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:35,607
- any other gods with that cursed blade.
- If it's revenge you seek.

31
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:38,008
He threatened to end my entire empire.

32
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,135
But, my lord

33
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:43,263
your empire has already ended.

34
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:45,683
There's no one left to worship you.

35
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,352
There'll be more followers to replace you.

36
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,728
There always are.

37
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:51,689
We have suffered,

38
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:54,983
and we have starved.

39
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,780
My daughter died

40
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:03,659
- in your name.
- And well you should.

41
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:06,745
Suffering for your gods is your
only purpose.

42
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:09,164
There's nothing for you after death.

43
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:10,708
Except death.

44
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,128
You are no god.

45
00:05:20,926 --> 00:05:22,428
I renounce you.

46
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:32,646
Now your meaningless life
finally does have a purpose.

47
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:36,316
To sacrifice yourself to me.

48
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:41,780
If it's revenge you seek

49
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:43,991
kill all the gods.

50
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:45,993
Go to Eternity.

51
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:49,121
If it's revenge you seek

52
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:52,332
summon the Bifrost.

53
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,667
Go to Eternity.

54
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:56,795
- Kill all the gods.
- Summon the Bifrost.

55
00:05:56,962 --> 00:05:58,130
Go to Eternity.

56
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:01,550
Kill all the gods. Kill all the gods.
Kill all the gods.

57
00:06:15,063 --> 00:06:16,690
The sword chose you.

58
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,485
You are now cursed!

59
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:20,736
Funny.

60
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:22,946
It doesn't feel like a curse.

61
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,202
Feels like a promise.

62
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:31,330
So, this is my vow.

63
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,418
All gods will die.

64
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,174
Come, come, gather round.

65
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:27,594
And listen to the legend of the
Space Viking.

66
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:33,433
AKA the God of Thunder.
AKA Thor Odinson.

67
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:42,067
Raised in the way of the warrior

68
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:44,736
Thor was taught to help win battles

69
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:48,198
fighting the good fight
for those who can't fight good.

70
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:54,329
He grew and he grew and he grew.

71
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:57,249
He was sensitive, like a smile.

72
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:00,627
And his loving nature did not discriminate.

73
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:03,797
He once loved a swashbuckling Passionista.

74
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:06,842
Another time, he loved a Wolf Woman

75
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:08,594
on a Woman Wolf.

76
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:15,183
But Thor's one true love was an
Earth woman named Jane Fonda.

77
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:17,728
Wait. No. Jane Foster.

78
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:21,356
But sadly, in the battle for love,
Thor lost.

79
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:26,320
In fact, he lost a lot of people
in those days.

80
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:27,654
His mum.

81
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:28,947
His dad.

82
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:30,489
And that guy.

83
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:31,617
And that guy.

84
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:32,910
And whoever that is.

85
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:34,119
And Heimdall.

86
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:35,286
And his brother.

87
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:37,789
And his brother, again.

88
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:38,957
And again.

89
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:43,211
Poor Thor had to watch his planet explode.

90
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,131
And then he said, "What have I done?"

91
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,135
It seemed that everything
and everyone he loved, he lost.

92
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:53,138
And so he hid his heart
behind a big, fleshy bod,

93
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:55,849
so it could never be broken again.

94
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,895
But just because he was done loving,
didn't mean he was done fighting.

95
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:03,607
He teamed up
with the Guardians of the Galaxy,

96
00:09:03,815 --> 00:09:06,193
and set off on some classic
Thor adventures.

97
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,236
He got in shape.

98
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:10,197
Putting in the hard yards.

99
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:14,368
Turning pains into gains,
and never skipping leg day.

100
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,830
He went from Dad Bod to God Bod.

101
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:22,125
But beneath his God Bod,
there was still a Sad Bod

102
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:23,502
just trying to get out.

103
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:29,299
Because all of the bods
that Thor had worn over the years

104
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:32,636
couldn't hide the pain
that he was feeling on the inside.

105
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:36,390
So he gave up his search for love

106
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:40,227
accepting that he was only good
for one thing...

107
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,731
Waiting in quiet contemplation
for someone to say.

108
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:48,360
"Thor, we need your
help to win this battle."

109
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:51,113
Thor.

110
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:53,240
We need your help to win this battle.

111
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,616
Let's go.

112
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:56,868
Okay. Come on, Storm breaker.

113
00:09:57,202 --> 00:09:58,412
Back to work.

114
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:01,540
We must hurry, okay?

115
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:03,917
People are dying.

116
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:05,085
See you down there.

117
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:11,133
Hurry up!

118
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,895
Give me those.
You're gonna break 'em.

119
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:26,273
I am Groot!

120
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,025
You got sap all over it.

121
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:33,572
- Hello, everybody.
- Well, well, look who it is.

122
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:34,990
How are we doing, guys?

123
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:36,491
Terrible!

124
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,577
We're all about to die.

125
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:41,038
You said this planet
would be a relaxing holiday.

126
00:10:41,163 --> 00:10:44,082
I said it was going to be,
"Like a relaxing holiday."

127
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:47,377
But look at that resplendent skyscape.
Three suns of Saturn.

128
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:49,087
What could be more relaxing than that?

129
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:51,131
An actual holiday!

130
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:53,341
Die Booskan scum!

131
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:57,637
God of Thunder.

132
00:10:57,804 --> 00:10:59,014
King Yakan.

133
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,725
You have finally joined our fight.

134
00:11:01,892 --> 00:11:04,478
Well, as they say,
"Better late than not at all."

135
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,229
Yes, it's very nice.

136
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:09,441
As you know,
we used to live in a peaceful oasis.

137
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,486
- But then our gods were murdered.
- Murdered?

138
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:15,739
And now our sacred temple
has been left unguarded,

139
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:18,700
and Habooska's hordes
took control of its power.

140
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:22,162
It is our most sacred shrine
and he desecrates it.

141
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,370
Not for long.

142
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:29,044
King Yakan, tell them
what happened here today.

143
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:31,421
Tell of the time that Thor,

144
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:36,301
and his ragtag, motley crew
of misfit desperados

145
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:38,345
turned the tide of the battle,

146
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:40,597
and etched their names in history.

147
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:43,975
For the odds may be against us,
but I'll tell you this for free...

148
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:45,227
Here it comes.

149
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:49,481
This ends here and now!

150
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:46,264
He's not going to go into
the temple, is he? No.

151
00:13:57,859 --> 00:13:59,277
Well done, everybody.

152
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:02,572
We can collectively take credit for that
because we worked as a team.

153
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:06,284
We used our hearts and our minds
to defeat the enemy

154
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:08,036
with minimal loss or damage.

155
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:17,879
What a classic Thor adventure!

156
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,256
Hurrah!

157
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:44,281
Good book?

158
00:14:44,406 --> 00:14:45,448
Yeah.

159
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,325
I wrote it.

160
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:50,996
Wait. You're Dr. Jane Foster?

161
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:52,330
I am.

162
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:54,124
- Hi.
- Hi.

163
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,834
How's the Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

164
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:57,377
It's tough.

165
00:14:57,544 --> 00:14:58,712
- Yeah.
- Really tough.

166
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,672
It's... You need a 3D model.

167
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,299
You ever see Event Horizon?

168
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:03,508
No.

169
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:06,136
- Interstellar?
- No.

170
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:08,103
That movie explains everything
really clearly.

171
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:10,598
All right. The Einstein-Rosen Bridge

172
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:14,352
folds space, so that point A and
point B

173
00:15:15,353 --> 00:15:17,355
coexist in space and time.

174
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:19,023
Like that.

175
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:22,235
You just ruined your own book.

176
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,029
Yeah, but now you understand wormholes.

177
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:27,782
Watch those movies.

178
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,284
- Okay.
- Okay.

179
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:31,745
Saw the Hot Cheetos, had to get it.

180
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:41,004
So, how's it going?

181
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:44,382
It's going amazing.

182
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:52,432
Have you told anyone else besides me?

183
00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:57,395
When people find out they start
acting weird. They're just different.

184
00:15:58,229 --> 00:16:00,065
I don't need that in my life right now.

185
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:01,816
Anyway, it's not that serious.

186
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:03,443
Jane, it's Stage Four.

187
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,779
Out of, like, how many stages?

188
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:07,530
Four.

189
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:08,907
That we know about.

190
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:15,455
Oh, you have somewhere else
you gotta be right now

191
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:17,332
that's more important than chemo?

192
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:18,750
No.

193
00:16:26,383 --> 00:16:28,069
You're trying to get back to the lab,
aren't you?

194
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:29,761
I have a few ideas I'm trying.

195
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:31,721
Okay, no, time out.

196
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,830
I know you think your lab work is
something you have to do

197
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:37,519
otherwise you're letting down
all of civilization,

198
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:41,856
but you're not getting what the universe
is actually trying to tell you,

199
00:16:42,023 --> 00:16:43,400
so let me translate.

200
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:46,027
Slow down.

201
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:48,154
You need your energy to fight this thing.

202
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:51,699
I'll fight it my way, okay?

203
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:53,284
Well, FYI

204
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,122
"my way" does not have to equal
alone in a lab.

205
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:02,085
Maybe it's time to
play the Space Viking card.

206
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:03,420
It's not a card.

207
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:04,379
Yes, it is.

208
00:17:04,462 --> 00:17:05,862
- There's no card.
- There's a card.

209
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,383
It's tall, it's blond, and it's gorgeous.

210
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,968
It's a handsome card.

211
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:11,845
- Jane, are you sure?
- Look, Darcy

212
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:15,223
I will figure this out by myself.

213
00:17:22,772 --> 00:17:25,817
Results are still coming back the same.

214
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:28,403
I'm afraid the chemo has
very little effect.

215
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:32,115
I'm so sorry, Jane.

216
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,744
If there's anything I can do,
or if you just wanna talk, call me.

217
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:34,552
Smell like a king, because you're worthy.

218
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:36,054
Old Spice.

219
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:40,016
Cut!

220
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:09,337
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

221
00:19:09,671 --> 00:19:10,922
Home.

222
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:12,257
Yes, home, Father.

223
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:14,425
We're here to take you home.

224
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,345
Yes. To planet Asgard.

225
00:19:17,512 --> 00:19:19,847
Asgard is not a planet, my sons.

226
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:22,600
It is people. It is you!

227
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:27,522
And now, it is time for me
to pass on to the spirit realm.

228
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:31,901
I will take my place

229
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,988
in the great banqueting hall
of Valhalla

230
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:37,490
the resting place of the gods.

231
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:39,576
Oh, one more thing.

232
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:41,744
You have a sister.

233
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:46,666
And so now, I turn into godly stardust,

234
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,876
and say farewell.

235
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:50,628
Oh, look.

236
00:19:51,254 --> 00:19:53,089
Do you see? It's happening.

237
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:55,550
I'm disappearing.

238
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:01,514
No!

239
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,724
Father!

240
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:06,311
But wait! Brother!

241
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:10,940
An ominous portal hath appeared behind us.

242
00:20:11,524 --> 00:20:12,609
Transform!

243
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:25,163
I am Hela, Goddess of Death.

244
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:30,293
Now, I return to Asgard to stake my claim
as the rightful heir to the throne,

245
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,253
and no one will stop me!

246
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:33,421
Join me or die!

247
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:35,798
We will never join you, witch!
Mjolnir!

248
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,971
Impossible!

249
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,433
I broke your hammer!

250
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,976
Time to die!

251
00:20:47,143 --> 00:20:48,436
Bifrost!

252
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:02,700
You can almost feel the power

253
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:05,703
of these magnificent and immovable stones.

254
00:21:06,204 --> 00:21:08,623
Okay. Let's head back to the village

255
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:11,709
where we can drink
some real Asgardian mead.

256
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,419
Come on.

257
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:49,914
God of Disaster

258
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:52,417
we thank you.

259
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:56,254
We feared we would be at war forever
without the protection of our gods,

260
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:59,465
but now, peace shall reign.

261
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:03,386
In return for your service,
please accept these gifts.

262
00:22:04,512 --> 00:22:09,434
As is tradition, the protectors of our
world are bestowed with great beasts.

263
00:22:11,978 --> 00:22:12,978
Giant goats!

264
00:22:13,104 --> 00:22:15,148
Look at those! They are wonderful.

265
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:18,067
Korg, look at that.
Those things are beautiful.

266
00:22:18,484 --> 00:22:20,570
King Yakan, thank you so much.

267
00:22:20,737 --> 00:22:22,488
Listen, about the temple

268
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:23,924
I don't wanna talk about the temple.

269
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:25,801
I know, but if we were to talk about it,
I think it's important...

270
00:22:25,825 --> 00:22:27,386
- It's making me sad.
- To life and material objects...

271
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,850
- And mad.
- Okay, I'll stop talking.

272
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:30,538
Don't forget the goats.

273
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:32,999
Which you accepted,
and now must take with you.

274
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,333
No backsies.

275
00:22:36,043 --> 00:22:38,421
- They are beautiful.
- Yes, they are beautiful.

276
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:40,798
They also scream quite a lot.

277
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:41,965
They'll be fine.

278
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:43,843
I am Groot.

279
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,846
We need to find the damn remote
so we can download the distress signal!

280
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:48,891
Retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?

281
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:50,375
One of your goats probably ate it!

282
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:52,369
Goats didn't eat the remote.
Don't be ridiculous.

283
00:22:52,393 --> 00:22:53,871
Well, I ain't digging through their crap.

284
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:56,522
I love them!
They should live with us forever!

285
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:57,774
Found the remote!

286
00:22:57,982 --> 00:22:59,025
I'm putting them down.

287
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:00,294
- Me too.
- Is it working or not?

288
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:01,754
No, it's not workin'. It's not charged.

289
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:03,547
- Well, maybe you need to find a charger...
- Get out of my way!

290
00:23:03,571 --> 00:23:05,131
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

291
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:08,743
- Korg, you okay?
- Yeah, bro. All good.

292
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:11,412
All right. Everybody, just relax.
The goats are gonna be fine.

293
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:13,139
If not, we can just use them
for meat

294
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:15,958
ting people.

295
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,169
Meeting people.
They're a great conversation starter.

296
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:20,773
And I've been told you can summon them
with a special whistle

297
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:22,077
that goes something like this...

298
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:24,050
No, that's not it.
No, that's not it.

299
00:23:24,342 --> 00:23:25,718
No, that's not it.
You have a go.

300
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,261
No, that's not it.

301
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,055
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Kraglin!

302
00:23:29,263 --> 00:23:30,263
No, that's not it.

303
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:33,076
- You been here this whole time?
- Yeah, you said to stay with the ship.

304
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,061
This is Glenda. We're married.

305
00:23:36,103 --> 00:23:37,104
I am Groot.

306
00:23:37,313 --> 00:23:39,899
What did we tell you
about jumpin' into new relationships?

307
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:41,317
That I shouldn't be doing that.

308
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:44,070
Yeah, you can't get married
on every single planet we land on.

309
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:45,696
I am Groot.

310
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:47,698
Finally!

311
00:23:47,824 --> 00:23:49,659
All right, here we go. Distress calls.

312
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:52,995
Please help us!
The God Butcher has found us!

313
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:54,372
God Butcher?

314
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,082
He left them hanging as a warning.

315
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,042
Look at all of these gods, murdered.

316
00:23:58,209 --> 00:24:01,879
Our greatest champions,
now laid to waste.

317
00:24:01,963 --> 00:24:03,130
The horror.

318
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:04,939
Who could have done something like this?

319
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:06,884
Thor, where are you?

320
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:08,649
Wait, wait, wait. What was that? Go back.

321
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:11,097
Play that one.

322
00:24:12,682 --> 00:24:14,100
- Thor, where are you?
- Sif?

323
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:15,560
We need you here.

324
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:17,949
My friend is in danger.
We must go at once.

325
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:19,647
Start the ship, my friends.

326
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:21,774
I don't know,
maybe we should split up.

327
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,902
So many people to save,
I mean, look at all of these distress

328
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,571
calls.

329
00:24:29,907 --> 00:24:30,908
Thor.

330
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:32,410
You gonna be okay?

331
00:24:32,577 --> 00:24:35,288
I admire your commitment to each other.
It's a beautiful thing.

332
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:37,164
Alas, it's something I'll never have.

333
00:24:37,331 --> 00:24:38,708
Buddy, if I may...

334
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:40,293
You may.

335
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:44,996
After thousands of years of living, you
don't seem to know who the hell you are.

336
00:24:45,339 --> 00:24:46,799
I've been lost before.

337
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:49,552
But then I found meaning, I found love.

338
00:24:50,803 --> 00:24:52,847
And yeah, it got taken from me,
and god, that hurts.

339
00:24:54,932 --> 00:24:57,643
But that shitty feeling
is better than feeling empty.

340
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,773
My hope for you is that
one day you will find something

341
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,484
to make you feel this shitty.

342
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,321
I have loved before. It didn't work out.

343
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:12,199
They either die a grismal death
or they dump you with a handwritten letter.

344
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,703
I don't know which is worse, but it's why
I keep everyone at arm's length.

345
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,934
You've grown too attached.
Damn it, I knew this would happen.

346
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:22,835
You must go. I'll find Sif.

347
00:25:23,544 --> 00:25:26,255
You answer the other calls.
The galaxy needs its Guardians.

348
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:28,799
- Cool, yeah. We were just leaving...
- I know it hurts.

349
00:25:28,925 --> 00:25:30,765
But it's better this way.
You have to trust me.

350
00:25:31,636 --> 00:25:33,304
To ease the pain, why don't you

351
00:25:34,263 --> 00:25:36,849
take this ship here
as a parting farewell gift?

352
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,809
You're giving me my ship?

353
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:40,227
Yes, she's yours.

354
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:43,105
May you make as many memories with her
as I have.

355
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,815
She's a temperamental old lass.

356
00:25:44,982 --> 00:25:47,234
Will serve you well in a tight pickle.

357
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,670
- I'll start the ship.
- Thank you.

358
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:49,987
Goodbye, old friend.

359
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:52,907
A human handshake

360
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:54,867
to the Asgardian shake.

361
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:57,620
Into the snake that you cannot trust.

362
00:25:58,704 --> 00:25:59,890
You're really dragging this out.

363
00:25:59,914 --> 00:26:02,792
And finish with the classic
Asgardian high one.

364
00:26:06,712 --> 00:26:07,880
Let's go.

365
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:10,216
Take care of my crew.
This is gonna be hard for them.

366
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:11,342
Hurry up!

367
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,551
Not her.

368
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:14,053
Remember what I told you.

369
00:26:15,012 --> 00:26:16,472
You ever feel lost

370
00:26:17,264 --> 00:26:19,600
just look into the eyes
of the people that you love.

371
00:26:19,976 --> 00:26:21,978
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

372
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:27,399
All right. Bye.

373
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,572
For what it's worth,
let's cling to the good memories.

374
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:37,910
We Asgardians say, "May you travel
with the speed of Odin's ravens."

375
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:41,455
"I'll see you in Valhalla
where we shall drink mead and..."

376
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,668
- They're gone.
- Alone again. Just me and you.

377
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:46,961
Storm breaker!

378
00:26:47,837 --> 00:26:49,922
Watch out, you frickin' crazy axe!

379
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:54,802
So what do we do now, bro?

380
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:56,262
Let's go get Sif!

381
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:13,654
Who or what is that?

382
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:16,949
Falligar, God of the Falligarians.

383
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:19,368
One of the nicest gods you'll ever meet.

384
00:27:21,037 --> 00:27:22,163
Oh, no.

385
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:32,882
Sif, it's me, Thor.

386
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:34,467
Odinson?

387
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:36,052
You're missing an arm.

388
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:37,386
I'm gonna get you home.

389
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:39,472
No! Leave me here.

390
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,640
I want to die a warrior's death.

391
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:43,851
On the battlefield. In battle.

392
00:27:44,018 --> 00:27:46,896
And then I can claim my place in Valhalla.

393
00:27:47,396 --> 00:27:49,273
Oh, I hate to break it to you,

394
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,443
but for a warrior to get into Valhalla,
you have to die in the battle.

395
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:55,196
- You survived.
- Oh, shit.

396
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,615
Maybe your arm is in Valhalla.

397
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:00,451
What happened here?

398
00:28:01,077 --> 00:28:02,536
I've been hunting a madman.

399
00:28:02,745 --> 00:28:04,830
I followed him here, but it was a trap.

400
00:28:04,955 --> 00:28:05,956
Who is this madman?

401
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,793
The God Butcher is coming.

402
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,212
He seeks the extinction of the gods.

403
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:13,172
Asgard is next.

404
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:04,742
Look, it's Thor!

405
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:06,869
- Thor!
- Take Sif to the infirmary.

406
00:30:06,994 --> 00:30:07,995
Hey!

407
00:30:08,162 --> 00:30:09,246
Who'd you piss off now?

408
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:11,099
This is not my fault.
I've never even seen these things

409
00:30:11,123 --> 00:30:11,999
whatever the hell they are.

410
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:13,250
Welcome back.

411
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:39,944
Who's the new guy?

412
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,780
That guy? You're gonna love that guy.

413
00:30:57,586 --> 00:30:59,463
Mjolnir! Mjolnir!

414
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:00,714
It's me, Thor.

415
00:31:00,923 --> 00:31:02,174
Have you seen my hammer?

416
00:31:02,716 --> 00:31:03,716
Mjolnir, here, boy.

417
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:07,263
Mjolnir?

418
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:12,559
Mjolnir.

419
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:19,817
You're back!

420
00:31:23,404 --> 00:31:24,404
Mjolnir!

421
00:31:52,266 --> 00:31:53,266
Excuse me.

422
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:55,227
Hello. That's my hammer you've got there.

423
00:31:56,603 --> 00:31:58,063
And that's my look.

424
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:06,780
Hey!

425
00:32:09,116 --> 00:32:10,284
Enough tomfoolery.

426
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:12,619
Why don't you take off that mask
and reveal yourself?

427
00:32:12,786 --> 00:32:13,787
Come on.

428
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:16,706
Hey.

429
00:32:17,333 --> 00:32:18,459
Jane?

430
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:27,092
Let me tell you the
legend of Thor and Jane.

431
00:32:28,761 --> 00:32:32,806
He was a God of Thunder
and she, a woman of science.

432
00:32:34,058 --> 00:32:36,435
And although
they were from different worlds

433
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,980
somehow, it just made sense.

434
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:44,735
And together they embarked
on a journey of love.

435
00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:52,785
Thor taught Jane the way of the warrior...

436
00:32:54,953 --> 00:32:57,998
And Jane taught Thor the way of the people.

437
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:03,504
And as time passed,
their love grew deeper and deeper.

438
00:33:06,632 --> 00:33:08,634
She's incredible, isn't she, Mjolnir?

439
00:33:11,428 --> 00:33:14,598
I need you to promise me
you'll always protect her.

440
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:18,310
I love you too, buddy.

441
00:33:19,812 --> 00:33:23,399
And love that deep
has a way of becoming magical.

442
00:33:27,152 --> 00:33:29,238
Thor set his sights toward a future,

443
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:31,407
and all it might hold.

444
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:39,832
But the more he pondered a life with Jane,
the more he feared losing that life.

445
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:42,709
And although Jane
didn't want to admit it

446
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:45,212
she was scared of loss as well.

447
00:33:48,674 --> 00:33:51,009
And so, they built walls between them.

448
00:33:51,802 --> 00:33:53,887
Thor got busy saving humanity.

449
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:55,639
Heimdall!

450
00:33:57,099 --> 00:33:59,393
And Jane got busy doing the same.

451
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:01,603
Real busy.

452
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:06,817
And eventually, the space between them grew
and grew until it became too wide to bear.

453
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:14,158
Something had to give.

454
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:17,911
I have to stay up all night
to go through this data. Okay?

455
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,265
And I have to stay up all night
and clean all of this up.

456
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:22,458
- There's two plates!
- It's two plates and two forks!

457
00:34:26,712 --> 00:34:28,797
And then, one night, it did give.

458
00:34:30,466 --> 00:34:32,050
Jane wrote a note.

459
00:34:33,343 --> 00:34:35,304
And Thor read that note.

460
00:34:37,097 --> 00:34:39,725
And their legend suddenly became myth.

461
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,228
Or so they thought.

462
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:47,733
You okay?

463
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:50,736
Yeah, it's a little hot in...

464
00:34:51,653 --> 00:34:52,863
Startin' to feel...

465
00:34:53,197 --> 00:34:55,908
It's claustrophobic with the helmet.

466
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:01,246
How?

467
00:35:04,374 --> 00:35:05,584
Can we talk about this later?

468
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:07,211
Yeah, sure.

469
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:08,504
Great seeing you.

470
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:11,423
What?

471
00:35:17,763 --> 00:35:20,057
Kill all the gods.

472
00:35:58,512 --> 00:36:00,514
Hey. Is that the Necrosword?

473
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,933
That's cool.
I've only ever read about it in stories.

474
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:06,061
Then you know this is going to hurt.

475
00:36:06,728 --> 00:36:07,771
Pain.

476
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:10,399
What is pain but a construct
invented by the weak?

477
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:11,775
Okay, that's very sharp!

478
00:36:21,118 --> 00:36:22,119
Ready?

479
00:36:22,953 --> 00:36:25,998
Don't touch my things.

480
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:54,401
Yeah, you better run, you coward.

481
00:37:13,962 --> 00:37:16,381
The children. They're taking the children!

482
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:18,341
Mommy!

483
00:37:20,302 --> 00:37:21,386
Mom!

484
00:37:45,077 --> 00:37:47,621
Shadow monsters. Disgusting.

485
00:37:51,249 --> 00:37:53,543
Flew around the world twice.
Nothing.

486
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,046
Cowards must have run away.
We'll find them.

487
00:37:59,466 --> 00:38:01,426
- Quite a reunion, huh?
- You're telling me.

488
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:03,428
What's it been?
Like, three, four years?

489
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,847
Eight years, seven months, and six days.

490
00:38:06,264 --> 00:38:07,307
I haven't forgotten

491
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:10,060
the last time I saw you, or didn't see you,
because you left.

492
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,563
It's kind of an oversimplification
to say that I left.

493
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,816
No, you left. You did.

494
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:17,818
You wrote me a beautiful
handwritten letter.

495
00:38:17,984 --> 00:38:19,111
I should know, I was there.

496
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:22,656
- You weren't there, actually, hence the note.
- I was.

497
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,994
And if you weren't there to see me leave,
then maybe it was you that left.

498
00:38:28,912 --> 00:38:30,372
Fair point.

499
00:38:30,997 --> 00:38:32,541
Not that it matters.

500
00:38:32,666 --> 00:38:34,506
- Like, who's keeping track, right?
- No, yeah.

501
00:38:35,043 --> 00:38:36,920
I suppose we both left and both got left.

502
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:38,755
Now you're leaving again.

503
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,093
Miek, we need detailed accounts
from all the witnesses.

504
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:45,821
Darryl, get me all the names of
the children who have been lost.

505
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:48,658
Your Majesty, my daughter has been taken,
and I don't know where she is.

506
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:50,183
And she'll be found.

507
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:53,103
Guys, they're bleeding.
Get them to the infirmary. Now!

508
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:54,312
Darryl!

509
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:58,275
Majesty, should we start working
on a performance of this entire debacle?

510
00:38:58,442 --> 00:38:59,860
The people need entertainment.

511
00:39:00,026 --> 00:39:01,778
Particularly now, in times of crisis.

512
00:39:01,903 --> 00:39:03,447
Particularly.

513
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,742
I did not hear a, "No."

514
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:08,368
Nor did I.

515
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:09,703
- Asgard. Night.
- Yes!

516
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:11,188
We open on some sleeping children.

517
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,377
So, that's the ex-girlfriend, is it?

518
00:39:17,836 --> 00:39:19,045
The old ex-girlfriend.

519
00:39:19,212 --> 00:39:20,297
Jodie Foster.

520
00:39:20,464 --> 00:39:21,464
Jane Foster.

521
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,758
The one that got away.

522
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,509
The one that got away.

523
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:25,677
That means escaped.

524
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:27,429
Yeah. Yeah... Yeah.

525
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:30,015
Must be hard for you
to see your ex-girlfriend,

526
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:32,851
and your ex-hammer hangin' out,
and getting on so well.

527
00:39:37,063 --> 00:39:38,315
What you up to, bro?

528
00:39:39,357 --> 00:39:40,400
Come on.

529
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:42,194
Come to daddy.

530
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,197
Come on. Mjolnir.

531
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:49,201
Hey! There you are.

532
00:39:49,743 --> 00:39:50,744
Hey.

533
00:39:51,077 --> 00:39:52,930
- Do you know what I think we should do?
- I was just calling you.

534
00:39:52,954 --> 00:39:55,540
- Start an army!
- With what? Half our soldiers are dead!

535
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:57,125
Half our soldiers are always dead!

536
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:58,895
- Everyone, please...
- Where are the children?

537
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,646
Go home.
I promise you we'll have news soon.

538
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,230
Someone needs to tell us what happened.

539
00:40:02,297 --> 00:40:03,673
We shall find them.

540
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:07,111
- I just don't understand.
- You know what?

541
00:40:07,135 --> 00:40:08,386
This is all our fault.

542
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:09,596
Stop it!

543
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:10,806
Asgard!

544
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:22,734
My friends, we must not quarrel.

545
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:26,112
In times like this, we need to unite,
come together.

546
00:40:26,863 --> 00:40:28,698
I see what's happening here.

547
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:30,700
You're afraid.

548
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:33,245
Scared.

549
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:35,622
Afraid.

550
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:36,832
Anxious.

551
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,587
If we are to find the children,
we must first look within ourselves.

552
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:47,384
I'm sorry. Miek, it's very hard
to give a rousing speech with the... noise.

553
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:49,028
- What are you doing?
- She's taking minutes.

554
00:40:49,052 --> 00:40:50,428
Precious minutes we don't have.

555
00:40:51,596 --> 00:40:52,596
You want the kids back?

556
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:55,267
I'll be back in a minute.

557
00:40:56,393 --> 00:40:57,593
You can write that down, Miek.

558
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,730
No!

559
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:13,285
Storm breaker, what are you doing?
Is this about Mjolnir?

560
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,120
Everyone, out!

561
00:41:17,914 --> 00:41:18,914
Didn't find them.

562
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
Bae, your cape's on fire.

563
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:21,246
It's fine. It'll grow back.

564
00:41:21,293 --> 00:41:22,373
I'm invoicing you for this.

565
00:41:22,502 --> 00:41:23,502
Listen.

566
00:41:23,837 --> 00:41:25,064
What do we know about this guy?

567
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:27,883
- He travels through shadows.
- And he creates monsters with them.

568
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:29,634
Absolutely freaky monsters.

569
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,761
He also wields the Necrosword.
How do I know that?

570
00:41:31,845 --> 00:41:33,281
Because he almost speared me
in the face with it.

571
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:34,389
What's a Necrosword?

572
00:41:34,598 --> 00:41:37,718
It's an ancient weapon that's been passed
through hands since the dawn of time.

573
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:40,103
It has the ability to slay gods,

574
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,939
but it slowly corrupts and kills
whoever wields it, which means...

575
00:41:43,106 --> 00:41:46,067
- So, it infected him.
- It's infecting him. Yes. It must be.

576
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:50,739
So basically, we're up against a cursed,
shadow-zombie kidnapper.

577
00:41:51,072 --> 00:41:52,574
Awesome. When do we leave?

578
00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:53,742
Thor.

579
00:41:54,534 --> 00:41:55,577
Can you see me?

580
00:41:55,744 --> 00:41:56,912
Floating head alert.

581
00:41:56,995 --> 00:41:58,914
It's Astrid. Heimdall's son.

582
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,707
Astrid, are you okay?

583
00:42:00,874 --> 00:42:02,876
I no longer go by the name Astrid.

584
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:04,961
I'm now known as Axl.

585
00:42:05,128 --> 00:42:07,255
He's a singer from a popular band
I heard on Earth.

586
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:08,590
- G N' R.
- Astrid

587
00:42:08,757 --> 00:42:10,675
your father gave you
a very tough Viking name,

588
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:12,344
and I intend to honor his wishes.

589
00:42:12,552 --> 00:42:13,552
- Axl.
- Astrid.

590
00:42:13,678 --> 00:42:14,804
- I said Axl.
- Astrid.

591
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,057
- Axl!
- It's asshole. Now listen to him!

592
00:42:17,223 --> 00:42:19,893
All right, fine, Axl. Where are you?

593
00:42:19,976 --> 00:42:23,188
I'm not sure. I don't know how to use
my magic eyes yet.

594
00:42:23,355 --> 00:42:24,957
Your father taught me
and I'm gonna teach you.

595
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:27,359
I need you to focus and hold out your hand.

596
00:42:27,901 --> 00:42:29,986
Okay, good. Now focus.

597
00:42:30,153 --> 00:42:31,321
Close your eyes.

598
00:42:37,077 --> 00:42:38,328
Thor!

599
00:42:40,288 --> 00:42:41,623
Hey, how's it going, kids?

600
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,625
"How's it going?" Look where we are.

601
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:45,710
We're in a cage made of spikes.

602
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:48,004
Yes, right. Not good. Yeah.

603
00:42:48,088 --> 00:42:49,168
Are you gonna do something?

604
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:50,924
Yes. Yes, I am, but just not right now.

605
00:42:51,049 --> 00:42:53,051
I'm the vision ghost. Look.

606
00:42:54,469 --> 00:42:56,137
- See?
- What will happen to us?

607
00:42:56,972 --> 00:42:59,849
Who can tell? I mean,
this is a very, very bad situation.

608
00:42:59,975 --> 00:43:02,435
You know,
the good news is you're Asgardians.

609
00:43:02,644 --> 00:43:04,688
So, if you die, you'll end up in Valhalla.

610
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:05,981
Oh, my God. Go away.

611
00:43:06,106 --> 00:43:07,190
Wait, wait. Listen.

612
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,237
Okay. It's all right, children.
Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.

613
00:43:12,404 --> 00:43:15,657
Listen, I've got a plan, okay? I'm putting
together a really, really good team.

614
00:43:15,865 --> 00:43:19,577
We've got Uncle Korg, King Valkyrie

615
00:43:20,537 --> 00:43:24,082
my ex-girlfriend, Jane, which is a whole
other story I won't bore you with, okay?

616
00:43:24,249 --> 00:43:26,209
But it is a top-notch team,

617
00:43:26,376 --> 00:43:28,336
and we're gonna have you home
before you know it.

618
00:43:28,545 --> 00:43:29,671
Yeah.

619
00:43:37,053 --> 00:43:38,096
I know where you are.

620
00:43:41,224 --> 00:43:42,434
I'm gonna get you out of here.

621
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:45,145
I'm scared. We all are.

622
00:43:46,062 --> 00:43:48,314
Thor! Thor! Save us.

623
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:53,254
Get me out of here.
You take care, okay?

624
00:43:53,278 --> 00:43:55,030
Take care. I'll see you soon.
All right?

625
00:43:55,155 --> 00:43:56,448
Axl, get me out of here!

626
00:43:57,991 --> 00:43:59,111
They're in the Shadow Realm.

627
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,160
How do you know?

628
00:44:00,326 --> 00:44:02,954
The heavy atmosphere there
has a darkness like no other.

629
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:05,081
It's as if color fears to tread.
It's unmistakable.

630
00:44:05,874 --> 00:44:07,459
Well then, if it's color we need

631
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:09,419
let's bring the rainbow.

632
00:44:11,463 --> 00:44:13,482
"Bring the rainbow"?
Is that a catchphrase or something?

633
00:44:13,506 --> 00:44:15,050
She's only been a Thor for a minute.

634
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:18,029
I mean, saving lives, she's quite good at.
But the rest of it, she needs work.

635
00:44:18,053 --> 00:44:19,973
- How many catchphrases have there been?
- A lot.

636
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:23,433
Yep. Jumped the gun.

637
00:44:23,683 --> 00:44:26,686
Hang on, he moves through shadows
and he's going to the Shadow Realm

638
00:44:26,853 --> 00:44:28,456
it seems like that's where
he's going to be the most powerful.

639
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,624
You're right. We can't just go
marching in there. It could be a trap.

640
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:32,025
We'd be endangering the children.

641
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:34,027
We need reinforcements.
We must raise an army.

642
00:44:34,152 --> 00:44:35,546
Are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

643
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:36,922
- I'm thinking it.
- What are we thinking?

644
00:44:36,946 --> 00:44:38,466
- Thinking what?
- I'm thinking it too.

645
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:39,657
Omnipotence City.

646
00:44:41,076 --> 00:44:42,494
What's Omnipotence City?

647
00:44:42,702 --> 00:44:44,902
It's the home of the most powerful gods
in the universe.

648
00:44:44,996 --> 00:44:46,873
We could pull together
the greatest team ever.

649
00:44:46,998 --> 00:44:49,125
We could recruit Ra, Hercules...

650
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:50,376
Tūmatauenga.

651
00:44:50,627 --> 00:44:54,255
Quetzalcoatl, maybe. And Zeus,
the oldest and wisest of them all.

652
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,673
Did you say Zeus?

653
00:44:55,882 --> 00:44:56,674
Yeah, Zeus.

654
00:44:56,758 --> 00:44:58,134
Like, the Zeus. Zeus-Zeus?

655
00:44:58,343 --> 00:44:59,737
I'm not sure if he has a second name.

656
00:44:59,761 --> 00:45:01,971
Do you think my god will be there,
Ninny of the Nonny?

657
00:45:02,138 --> 00:45:04,241
You never know, Korg. But if they are,
we'll ask them to join our team.

658
00:45:04,265 --> 00:45:05,100
Yes.

659
00:45:05,266 --> 00:45:06,267
Storm breaker.

660
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,937
All right. Calm down. Relax.

661
00:45:09,104 --> 00:45:11,981
No, no, no, mate, we are not traveling
in Stormbreaker's janky Bifrost.

662
00:45:12,107 --> 00:45:12,982
Look what just happened.

663
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:15,461
We can't exactly go in your tiny, little,
flying portal horse, can we?

664
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:16,485
We won't all fit.

665
00:45:16,528 --> 00:45:18,047
What are you talking about?
Warsong's awesome.

666
00:45:18,071 --> 00:45:19,155
Stormbreaker's awesome too.

667
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,680
Storm breaker just needs a conduit.

668
00:45:20,782 --> 00:45:22,302
Anything that can handle space travel.

669
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:23,567
I love it when she talks shop.

670
00:45:23,743 --> 00:45:25,054
It has the power to get us there

671
00:45:25,078 --> 00:45:28,665
it just needs something to focus
that energy so it's not so unpredictable.

672
00:45:28,832 --> 00:45:30,752
You know, if we had a ship
we could harness it,

673
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,475
and use Storm breaker as a power source.

674
00:45:32,544 --> 00:45:34,170
- Oh, like an engine.
- Like an engine.

675
00:45:34,337 --> 00:45:35,672
You need a ship?

676
00:45:35,964 --> 00:45:37,257
I've got a ship.

677
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:43,054
Get rid of all those seats.

678
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:45,223
And you guys,
go tie those goats to the front.

679
00:45:45,348 --> 00:45:46,641
We leave in 15 minutes.

680
00:45:46,808 --> 00:45:48,643
Essentials only, everyone.

681
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,353
That's essential.

682
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:51,938
Fifteen minutes to departure!

683
00:45:52,147 --> 00:45:53,690
Well, you moved on quick, didn't you?

684
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:57,026
You're some piece of work.

685
00:45:58,528 --> 00:46:00,321
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

686
00:46:00,572 --> 00:46:03,116
- Just catching up with an old friend.
- Yeah.

687
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:05,076
I've been meaning to apologize.

688
00:46:05,493 --> 00:46:08,533
Sorta acting a little weird before.
I just haven't really been myself lately.

689
00:46:08,663 --> 00:46:10,165
You know, kind of...

690
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,251
Trying to figure out who I am,
and just felt a little bit lost.

691
00:46:13,418 --> 00:46:16,004
And then, all of a sudden,
I see you dressed as me,

692
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:17,463
and it was kind of...

693
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,090
It's a lot for me, too.

694
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:22,427
So, how did you guys get together?
How did this happen?

695
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:26,097
I swear I heard Mjolnir call to me.

696
00:46:26,222 --> 00:46:27,807
Ah, did it?

697
00:46:27,974 --> 00:46:29,559
And so I came here to investigate,

698
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:32,437
and its pieces started
glowing and swirling, and then...

699
00:46:32,729 --> 00:46:33,730
Crazy.

700
00:46:34,063 --> 00:46:35,315
Thor.

701
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:38,902
Well, you know what,
it looks good on you, it works, so...

702
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:43,990
Just checking.

703
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:49,037
See you later.

704
00:46:49,204 --> 00:46:51,289
Five minutes to departure!

705
00:46:55,376 --> 00:46:56,544
What?

706
00:46:57,086 --> 00:46:58,379
We were just talking.

707
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,893
Mommy, don't leave me.

708
00:47:12,268 --> 00:47:13,937
Don't be afraid.

709
00:47:15,438 --> 00:47:17,023
Even when I'm gone, honey...

710
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:20,526
You won't be alone.

711
00:47:23,279 --> 00:47:25,281
And whatever happens

712
00:47:27,158 --> 00:47:28,868
never stop fighting.

713
00:47:29,661 --> 00:47:31,287
Never stop fighting.

714
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:47,136
Hey. You all right?

715
00:47:47,387 --> 00:47:48,388
Great.

716
00:47:50,014 --> 00:47:51,391
The sink would say otherwise.

717
00:47:53,268 --> 00:47:54,811
You think I really should be coming?

718
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:56,396
I'm not getting any better.

719
00:47:56,562 --> 00:47:58,314
You're a Thor. Of course, you should come.

720
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,130
Besides, what else are you gonna do?

721
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:01,484
You're a Viking now.

722
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:03,820
Means you pretty much
have to die in battle,

723
00:48:03,987 --> 00:48:06,072
and it needs to be devastatingly painful.

724
00:48:06,197 --> 00:48:07,757
Otherwise, you don't get into Valhalla.

725
00:48:08,157 --> 00:48:09,242
That's my plan.

726
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:11,619
What about, you know, kinging and stuff?

727
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:14,414
I love being king.
I love my people,

728
00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:16,099
but it's all meetings and raven-mail,

729
00:48:16,165 --> 00:48:17,885
and meetings that could've been raven-mail.

730
00:48:17,917 --> 00:48:19,085
I miss fighting.

731
00:48:19,294 --> 00:48:20,336
I miss my sisters.

732
00:48:20,503 --> 00:48:22,423
Which is why you need to come,
'cause I need one.

733
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:24,589
Okay, we should go.

734
00:48:24,882 --> 00:48:25,925
You packed?

735
00:48:26,509 --> 00:48:27,510
Are you packed?

736
00:48:29,345 --> 00:48:30,345
Yes!

737
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:33,891
A hand grenade?

738
00:48:34,058 --> 00:48:35,518
No. It's a portable speaker.

739
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:43,359
Let's go.

740
00:48:44,277 --> 00:48:47,822
If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps?

741
00:48:48,156 --> 00:48:49,282
I got you.

742
00:48:52,076 --> 00:48:53,703
My fellow Asgardians...

743
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,249
Wish us well, for we shall travel
with the speed of Odin's ravens.

744
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:01,127
We will return with children.

745
00:49:02,628 --> 00:49:04,213
Many children.

746
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,673
And then we shall feast!

747
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,133
Not on the children.

748
00:49:07,842 --> 00:49:09,594
We do not do that anymore.

749
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:12,263
Those were dark times. Shameful times.

750
00:49:13,056 --> 00:49:14,349
Okay, we should go.

751
00:50:00,937 --> 00:50:02,563
So, you still rollerblading?

752
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,482
No. No. You?

753
00:50:04,649 --> 00:50:05,942
Oh, yeah. Every weekend.

754
00:50:06,067 --> 00:50:07,985
Once you blade, you never fade.
Right, Korg?

755
00:50:08,111 --> 00:50:09,111
Skate mates for life!

756
00:50:09,195 --> 00:50:11,155
- Hey, can I run something by you?
- Yeah.

757
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,281
So, I was thinking

758
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:15,701
when we get to the bad guy, what about
if I had, like, a cool catchphrase?

759
00:50:16,494 --> 00:50:17,787
Like, "Eat this hammer!"

760
00:50:18,454 --> 00:50:21,207
Or, like, "Check out my hammer."

761
00:50:21,749 --> 00:50:23,459
Like, what about...

762
00:50:23,626 --> 00:50:25,503
No... I'm work shopping it.

763
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:28,005
No, they are all really good.
Mine is...

764
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:29,966
"This ends here and now."

765
00:50:30,091 --> 00:50:31,259
Oh, that's such a good one.

766
00:50:31,426 --> 00:50:32,736
Took me a long time to perfect it.

767
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,154
You'll get there.
You just need to practice.

768
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:35,555
Just my first bad guy.

769
00:50:35,763 --> 00:50:37,098
You never forget your first.

770
00:50:40,435 --> 00:50:41,477
Yeah.

771
00:50:42,103 --> 00:50:43,396
So, you got a girlfriend?

772
00:50:44,605 --> 00:50:47,525
No, no. Too busy, don't have time,
you know?

773
00:50:48,109 --> 00:50:49,986
Just the work and everything.

774
00:50:50,153 --> 00:50:52,155
Cool. Gonna check this place out.

775
00:50:56,701 --> 00:50:57,702
So cool.

776
00:50:57,869 --> 00:50:58,870
Who's so cool?

777
00:50:59,078 --> 00:51:00,455
The buildings are cool.

778
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,415
- What's happening there?
- Where?

779
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,084
Am I sensing feelings?

780
00:51:05,626 --> 00:51:07,378
Feelings? What, for Jane?

781
00:51:07,503 --> 00:51:08,963
No, don't be ridiculous. Feelings.

782
00:51:09,172 --> 00:51:10,840
The last time we had feelings were

783
00:51:11,048 --> 00:51:12,734
long time ago. Long, long gone.
I think you...

784
00:51:12,758 --> 00:51:14,385
- Maybe you have feelings.
- Right.

785
00:51:15,511 --> 00:51:17,489
- Mate, relax. We're on the same team.
- I don't know.

786
00:51:17,513 --> 00:51:19,849
Know exactly what team we're on, okay?

787
00:51:20,057 --> 00:51:21,392
Team Jane.

788
00:51:25,646 --> 00:51:28,232
Thing about Thor
is that he always bounces back.

789
00:51:28,649 --> 00:51:30,289
- Yeah.
- Like when Hela stole his hammer

790
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:33,196
he went and built an axe which was forged
in the heart of a dying star.

791
00:51:36,449 --> 00:51:38,910
And the same axe was used
to cut off Thanos' head.

792
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,413
That's a good one.

793
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:47,710
What a neat story!

794
00:51:49,921 --> 00:51:52,798
With all this talk
about chopping off heads

795
00:51:53,049 --> 00:51:54,383
I wanna have a go.

796
00:51:55,218 --> 00:51:56,219
What's this?

797
00:52:01,557 --> 00:52:04,060
This is Octy. Hello, Octy.

798
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:05,895
How are you?

799
00:52:06,354 --> 00:52:08,314
You know what Octy loves?

800
00:52:08,773 --> 00:52:10,775
Having his head ripped off!

801
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,406
What? You liked it a second ago.

802
00:52:18,574 --> 00:52:19,909
All right, all right, all right.

803
00:52:20,284 --> 00:52:21,285
Octy's gone.

804
00:52:25,248 --> 00:52:26,290
Come on.

805
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:28,376
I'm scared.

806
00:52:28,876 --> 00:52:30,086
Look at you.

807
00:52:31,295 --> 00:52:34,257
I knew a little girl just like you.

808
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:38,427
And she was brave,
and she was smart,

809
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:43,683
and funny and she liked to draw.

810
00:52:46,435 --> 00:52:48,229
Let me ask you a question

811
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:50,940
about gods.

812
00:52:51,566 --> 00:52:53,609
They're meant to protect you, right?

813
00:52:54,235 --> 00:52:55,611
Well, where are they?

814
00:52:55,736 --> 00:52:58,447
- Thor is on his way.
- Yeah!

815
00:52:58,614 --> 00:53:01,284
Yes. I'm counting on that.

816
00:53:01,909 --> 00:53:04,120
That's why you're here.

817
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,519
It's invitation only, so we're gonna have
to keep a low profile and blend in.

818
00:53:10,543 --> 00:53:13,087
Luckily, disguises are my specialty.

819
00:53:13,796 --> 00:53:14,839
Greek philosopher?

820
00:53:15,506 --> 00:53:16,549
Got us these.

821
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:18,092
What are those?

822
00:53:18,259 --> 00:53:19,260
Actual disguises.

823
00:53:20,011 --> 00:53:22,138
They're the cloaks of the emotion gods.

824
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:25,975
Every color signifies a different emotion.

825
00:53:26,517 --> 00:53:27,893
Where are the emotion gods?

826
00:53:28,227 --> 00:53:29,478
Don't ask.

827
00:53:32,773 --> 00:53:33,983
Holy shit.

828
00:53:43,117 --> 00:53:44,994
Welcome to the Golden Temple, kids.

829
00:53:45,202 --> 00:53:48,414
This is where the most powerful
creator gods in the universe hang out.

830
00:53:51,334 --> 00:53:55,212
There's the god of magic,
the god of dreams

831
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:56,380
the god of carpentry.

832
00:53:56,672 --> 00:53:57,757
Look at that one.

833
00:53:57,923 --> 00:53:59,592
Oh, yes. That's Bao, god of dumplings.

834
00:53:59,967 --> 00:54:01,677
- Hey, Bao!
- Bao.

835
00:54:01,844 --> 00:54:02,845
Look up there, guys!

836
00:54:03,012 --> 00:54:04,889
That's the Kronan god, Ninny of the Nonny.

837
00:54:05,556 --> 00:54:07,224
Hey, Ninny Nonny!

838
00:54:17,485 --> 00:54:20,321
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

839
00:54:20,446 --> 00:54:22,990
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

840
00:54:49,684 --> 00:54:50,810
Yes.

841
00:54:52,019 --> 00:54:53,521
I am Zeus!

842
00:54:57,983 --> 00:54:59,235
There he is!

843
00:54:59,402 --> 00:55:01,362
The man, the myth, the legend.

844
00:55:01,779 --> 00:55:02,839
I don't know if you know this,

845
00:55:02,863 --> 00:55:04,949
but I base a lot of what I do
on this guy.

846
00:55:05,116 --> 00:55:06,885
He's the god of lightning,
I'm the god of thunder.

847
00:55:06,909 --> 00:55:08,953
- Huge source of inspiration.
- That's really good.

848
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,706
You should lead with that
when you ask him for an army.

849
00:55:12,707 --> 00:55:15,251
How do we get up there?
Do we just, like, fly?

850
00:55:15,418 --> 00:55:16,812
No, we can't interrupt him
in the middle of an entrance.

851
00:55:16,836 --> 00:55:18,546
He's famous for his entrances.

852
00:55:18,713 --> 00:55:20,506
Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt!

853
00:55:21,048 --> 00:55:22,049
Yes!

854
00:55:24,802 --> 00:55:26,137
Zeus!

855
00:55:35,521 --> 00:55:37,606
Yes! Thunderbolt!

856
00:55:45,364 --> 00:55:46,364
Order.

857
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:48,033
Order!

858
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:52,329
Silence! Silence!

859
00:55:56,584 --> 00:55:58,461
I hereby open

860
00:55:59,086 --> 00:56:02,339
this holy council of the god.

861
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:07,261
Where we have many, many serious matter
to be talk about.

862
00:56:07,762 --> 00:56:08,804
Such as

863
00:56:09,764 --> 00:56:11,932
where are we going
to hold this year's orgy?

864
00:56:12,683 --> 00:56:13,934
Is this guy for real?

865
00:56:14,101 --> 00:56:15,269
Honestly, I'm not mad at it.

866
00:56:15,436 --> 00:56:17,104
Yeah, I'm sure he has a point, okay?

867
00:56:17,605 --> 00:56:18,606
Sorry.

868
00:56:18,814 --> 00:56:20,083
So now we're going to
announce the winner

869
00:56:20,107 --> 00:56:25,196
of the, "Most human souls sacrificed
in the name of a god."

870
00:56:25,571 --> 00:56:26,851
Okay, maybe he's not that great.

871
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:28,407
Oh, no, not good.

872
00:56:28,574 --> 00:56:30,427
No, I don't think it's gonna get
any better than this.

873
00:56:30,451 --> 00:56:31,851
Look, these gods aren't gonna help.

874
00:56:31,952 --> 00:56:34,497
But that thunderbolt,
I think that might be of use.

875
00:56:34,663 --> 00:56:36,582
Jane, you go right.
Thor, you go left.

876
00:56:36,749 --> 00:56:39,126
We bum-rush him, take the bolt,
ding-dong.

877
00:56:39,293 --> 00:56:41,378
- All right, let's go get it!
- No, no, no, wait!

878
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:43,214
There's no ding-donging or bum-rushing.

879
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,799
Especially not Zeus' bum.

880
00:56:45,007 --> 00:56:46,651
When the time is right,
I'm gonna talk to him.

881
00:56:46,675 --> 00:56:47,510
The time is right now.

882
00:56:47,676 --> 00:56:48,676
Time is not right now.

883
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:50,012
Who is talking?

884
00:56:50,221 --> 00:56:51,263
Who is talking?

885
00:56:51,472 --> 00:56:52,723
- These guys.
- Korg, shut up.

886
00:56:52,848 --> 00:56:55,351
Do you have something to say to the group?

887
00:56:55,726 --> 00:56:56,727
Sorry.

888
00:56:56,852 --> 00:56:59,605
I'm bashing heads in 60 seconds,
so speak fast.

889
00:56:59,772 --> 00:57:01,148
Literally, heads will roll.

890
00:57:01,982 --> 00:57:03,234
Who are you two?

891
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:05,152
Hello.

892
00:57:05,778 --> 00:57:08,378
Let me be the first to say it is an honor
and a privilege to be...

893
00:57:08,405 --> 00:57:09,573
No, I can't hear you.

894
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:11,075
Why don't you take the stage?

895
00:57:11,534 --> 00:57:13,118
The stage down there?

896
00:57:13,285 --> 00:57:17,581
Well, yes. You see the area
that looks very much like a stage?

897
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:20,042
Got ya.

898
00:57:27,258 --> 00:57:28,258
Coming through.

899
00:57:29,468 --> 00:57:30,761
Oops. Sorry.

900
00:57:30,886 --> 00:57:31,887
Good luck, bro.

901
00:57:39,728 --> 00:57:40,980
Mighty Zeus!

902
00:57:41,689 --> 00:57:42,731
Wow!

903
00:57:43,274 --> 00:57:44,859
Gods of the universe.

904
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:48,654
I come here to ask for your help,
to raise an army.

905
00:57:48,904 --> 00:57:51,907
There's a maniac called the God Butcher
who seeks to end us all.

906
00:57:52,074 --> 00:57:53,576
His destruction is everywhere.

907
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:55,786
Entire planets, realms

908
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:57,431
have been left completely unprotected.

909
00:57:57,538 --> 00:57:59,665
He's left nothing but chaos in his wake.

910
00:58:00,082 --> 00:58:01,625
But I know where he is,

911
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:05,880
and with your help we can crush him
before he kills anyone else.

912
00:58:06,505 --> 00:58:07,756
That guy

913
00:58:07,882 --> 00:58:10,843
he killed a couple of low-level god.

914
00:58:11,093 --> 00:58:12,094
Boo-hoo.

915
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:13,679
If that's all

916
00:58:13,846 --> 00:58:14,930
pretty boy

917
00:58:15,055 --> 00:58:16,891
you go back to your seat
and you be quiet.

918
00:58:17,016 --> 00:58:20,019
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Did you not hear any of what I just said?

919
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:22,146
He's murdering en masse.

920
00:58:22,313 --> 00:58:24,440
I tell you one time

921
00:58:24,565 --> 00:58:25,566
now, you shut up.

922
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:26,734
You be quiet.

923
00:58:26,901 --> 00:58:29,570
Because you are this close
to being uninvited to the orgy.

924
00:58:29,695 --> 00:58:31,947
Zeus, we must do something.

925
00:58:32,114 --> 00:58:33,908
You cannot come to the orgy!

926
00:58:34,074 --> 00:58:35,993
- You have to listen to us!
- That's it!

927
00:58:36,577 --> 00:58:37,620
Shackle!

928
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,850
Your Highness, whenever you're ready,
you just tell me.

929
00:58:41,874 --> 00:58:43,074
- We go on my signal.
- Mm-hmm.

930
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:44,168
What is the signal?

931
00:58:44,293 --> 00:58:45,294
It'll be, "Go."

932
00:58:49,506 --> 00:58:50,799
Let's see who you are.

933
00:58:50,925 --> 00:58:52,593
I take off your disguise.

934
00:58:52,718 --> 00:58:53,718
And flick!

935
00:59:01,852 --> 00:59:03,562
You flicked too hard, damn it!

936
00:59:06,065 --> 00:59:08,275
Should we help him?

937
00:59:08,484 --> 00:59:09,860
I mean, eventually.

938
00:59:09,985 --> 00:59:11,028
Grape?

939
00:59:11,195 --> 00:59:12,863
Looks like a shy courgette.

940
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:14,782
And what about the others?

941
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:16,189
We take off their disguise too.

942
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:17,493
Oh, no. No. Don't flick us.

943
00:59:17,618 --> 00:59:18,661
It's cool.

944
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:20,245
Disguise gone!

945
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:21,329
Disguise off. Cool?

946
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:22,706
Asgardians.

947
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,668
I thought we'd seen the last of you
when Odin died.

948
00:59:27,086 --> 00:59:29,380
You are Thor

949
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:31,382
the God of Thunder.

950
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:35,344
But is not thunder
just the sound of lightning?

951
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,889
Good one, Dad.

952
00:59:39,056 --> 00:59:40,265
Zeus, this is bigger than us.

953
00:59:40,432 --> 00:59:42,434
He's taken Asgardian children.

954
00:59:42,643 --> 00:59:45,854
Who do you think we are?
The god police?

955
00:59:46,772 --> 00:59:49,733
Every god watches over their own peoples.

956
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:52,778
Nothing more, nothing less.

957
00:59:52,945 --> 00:59:54,571
Asgardian problems

958
00:59:55,489 --> 00:59:57,658
are Asgardian problems.

959
00:59:58,283 --> 01:00:00,285
How the mighty have fallen.

960
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:02,621
My hero, Zeus

961
01:00:02,788 --> 01:00:03,789
afraid.

962
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,302
Couple of thing.

963
01:00:18,053 --> 01:00:21,056
One, yes, I am scared.

964
01:00:21,557 --> 01:00:23,934
Gorr has the Necrosword

965
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:26,186
which means he could kill us.

966
01:00:26,729 --> 01:00:28,105
Not good. Two

967
01:00:28,272 --> 01:00:30,190
I know you're trying
to do the right thing.

968
01:00:30,357 --> 01:00:31,567
I understand.

969
01:00:31,692 --> 01:00:33,902
But all you do is cause a panic.

970
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,030
Panic is not good.

971
01:00:36,155 --> 01:00:37,740
We are safe here.

972
01:00:37,906 --> 01:00:40,200
You, my friend. You are safe here.

973
01:00:40,826 --> 01:00:42,411
So, chill, baby cake.

974
01:00:42,953 --> 01:00:45,164
Have some wine, have some grape.

975
01:00:45,289 --> 01:00:46,832
Anything goes here

976
01:00:46,999 --> 01:00:49,209
in Omnipotence City.

977
01:00:50,002 --> 01:00:52,421
Three, don't talk back to Zeus.

978
01:00:52,796 --> 01:00:54,923
I flicked too hard.
I put your clothes back on.

979
01:00:56,675 --> 01:00:58,093
Now I put your clothes back on!

980
01:00:58,302 --> 01:00:59,136
Flick, flick.

981
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:02,014
For this is the Golden Temple of the god.

982
01:01:02,514 --> 01:01:04,683
It's not a rudie-nudie festival.

983
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,770
If you're not gonna help us,
then at least let us use your weapon.

984
01:01:07,936 --> 01:01:09,313
We need your lightning bolt.

985
01:01:10,022 --> 01:01:12,232
My lightning bolt is called Thunderbolt.

986
01:01:12,357 --> 01:01:15,611
So, I think to use
somebody's secret weapon like this

987
01:01:15,778 --> 01:01:18,322
that you should at least get the name right
when you ask.

988
01:01:18,947 --> 01:01:20,657
Can I borrow Thunderbolt?

989
01:01:20,824 --> 01:01:21,825
Thunderbolt!

990
01:01:49,436 --> 01:01:50,437
No!

991
01:01:54,066 --> 01:01:55,818
Do not worry.

992
01:01:56,401 --> 01:01:58,153
The God Butcher

993
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:00,739
he will not reach Eternity.

994
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:02,157
Eternity?

995
01:02:02,282 --> 01:02:04,034
What does he mean, reach Eternity?

996
01:02:07,412 --> 01:02:09,206
Oh, shit.

997
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:16,171
Eternity is a very powerful being
at the center of the universe.

998
01:02:17,005 --> 01:02:20,008
It will grant the desire
of the first person who reaches it.

999
01:02:20,134 --> 01:02:22,010
So, it's like a wishing well?

1000
01:02:24,429 --> 01:02:27,224
What do you think a guy called
the God Butcher would wish for?

1001
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:30,351
If he seeks the Altar of Eternity,
that means he could wipe us out at once.

1002
01:02:30,477 --> 01:02:32,104
Zeus, we must act now.

1003
01:02:32,229 --> 01:02:33,981
He's not going to make it.

1004
01:02:34,189 --> 01:02:35,440
He doesn't have the key.

1005
01:02:36,024 --> 01:02:37,818
Is this the purpose of the gods?

1006
01:02:37,943 --> 01:02:40,612
To hide away in a golden
palace like cowards?

1007
01:02:40,821 --> 01:02:42,197
Maybe we have lost our way.

1008
01:02:42,865 --> 01:02:44,867
You know what?
We'll stop him ourselves.

1009
01:02:45,033 --> 01:02:47,202
I am afraid I cannot allow that.

1010
01:02:47,494 --> 01:02:49,913
This is a secret place

1011
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,832
known only to the gods.

1012
01:02:52,207 --> 01:02:53,917
You know where we are.

1013
01:02:54,126 --> 01:02:57,713
The God Butcher could use you
to find us.

1014
01:02:58,463 --> 01:02:59,798
This is no good.

1015
01:03:00,966 --> 01:03:01,967
So now

1016
01:03:03,177 --> 01:03:04,761
you must stay.

1017
01:03:06,096 --> 01:03:07,097
Guards!

1018
01:03:09,808 --> 01:03:10,809
Hey.

1019
01:03:10,976 --> 01:03:11,976
Can we do my plan now?

1020
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,896
Yes. Rush his bum.

1021
01:03:14,062 --> 01:03:15,063
Hell, yeah!

1022
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:19,443
You didn't say, "Go."

1023
01:03:24,114 --> 01:03:25,449
Coming, guys!

1024
01:03:35,626 --> 01:03:36,627
Thor, catch!

1025
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,880
Korg!

1026
01:04:00,275 --> 01:04:01,401
Val, duck!

1027
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:07,908
Korg!

1028
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,160
Thor.

1029
01:04:12,704 --> 01:04:14,706
Oh, no. No. Korg!

1030
01:04:15,374 --> 01:04:18,835
Thor, I'm perishing!

1031
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:24,800
Zeus!

1032
01:04:26,885 --> 01:04:28,303
You're next, Odinson!

1033
01:04:36,103 --> 01:04:38,313
That's the sound of lightning.

1034
01:04:45,487 --> 01:04:46,697
No!

1035
01:04:47,406 --> 01:04:49,408
Korgi. Korgi!

1036
01:04:49,574 --> 01:04:50,575
Thor.

1037
01:04:50,826 --> 01:04:52,160
- Korgi?
- I'm down here.

1038
01:04:52,327 --> 01:04:54,538
Where? Where are you?
I'm gonna get you out. It's okay.

1039
01:04:54,788 --> 01:04:56,039
- Korg. Korgi!
- Here I am!

1040
01:04:56,206 --> 01:04:57,206
I didn't die!

1041
01:04:57,332 --> 01:04:59,376
Oh, my God. Yes! You're alive!

1042
01:04:59,543 --> 01:05:02,045
Turns out the only part of a Kronan
that's alive is his mouth.

1043
01:05:02,546 --> 01:05:04,506
Korgi, listen.
I need you to call the goats.

1044
01:05:04,673 --> 01:05:05,673
I'll do my best.

1045
01:05:05,757 --> 01:05:07,092
Guard him with your life.

1046
01:05:07,259 --> 01:05:08,093
I will.

1047
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,260
Ready to go for a ride?

1048
01:05:13,557 --> 01:05:14,850
Now you've got my six.

1049
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:16,476
Eight o'clock, Val.

1050
01:05:17,436 --> 01:05:18,478
7:48.

1051
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,273
I can do this, damn it.

1052
01:05:22,065 --> 01:05:23,501
No, that's not it. No, that's not it.

1053
01:05:23,525 --> 01:05:24,568
Nope.

1054
01:05:24,693 --> 01:05:27,154
Come on, Korg, purse those lips.

1055
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:41,918
I did it!

1056
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:22,000
And then the goat boat came in,
rescued us,

1057
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:24,544
and we flew out the window.
The end.

1058
01:06:24,753 --> 01:06:26,296
Another classic Thor adventure.

1059
01:06:26,963 --> 01:06:28,465
I can't believe you killed Zeus.

1060
01:06:28,632 --> 01:06:31,510
Well, you know what they say,
never meet your heroes.

1061
01:06:33,345 --> 01:06:35,665
But what's important is
we are on our way to you right now.

1062
01:06:36,098 --> 01:06:37,641
How are you guys doing?
Are you okay?

1063
01:06:37,808 --> 01:06:39,434
We're all right. A little scared.

1064
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:41,686
Well, listen, I know
what it's like to be scared.

1065
01:06:41,812 --> 01:06:43,438
And I'll tell you,
when I was your age

1066
01:06:43,605 --> 01:06:45,375
I don't think I would have been
as brave as you.

1067
01:06:45,399 --> 01:06:46,400
Really?

1068
01:06:46,566 --> 01:06:49,403
In fact, might just be
the bravest Asgardians that I've ever met.

1069
01:06:49,528 --> 01:06:50,695
All of you.

1070
01:06:50,862 --> 01:06:52,781
So I need you to
keep being brave, all right?

1071
01:06:52,989 --> 01:06:55,158
And take care of each other.
You're a team now.

1072
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:56,660
Team Kids in a Cage.

1073
01:06:58,370 --> 01:06:59,413
Can you do that?

1074
01:06:59,996 --> 01:07:02,165
Yeah. I think we can do that.

1075
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:03,834
I know you can.

1076
01:07:07,421 --> 01:07:08,463
Right?

1077
01:07:08,839 --> 01:07:10,006
- Thor?
- Yeah.

1078
01:07:10,424 --> 01:07:11,842
I'm glad I met my hero.

1079
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:13,176
Oh, thanks, buddy.

1080
01:07:17,556 --> 01:07:19,307
How are the children?

1081
01:07:19,433 --> 01:07:21,244
As you can imagine, they're a little bit
scared because they're kids,

1082
01:07:21,268 --> 01:07:23,037
but I told them that
everything is going to plan.

1083
01:07:23,061 --> 01:07:24,061
Oh, so you lied to them?

1084
01:07:24,146 --> 01:07:25,146
We still have a plan?

1085
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:26,374
- Yes, there's a plan.
- There's no plan.

1086
01:07:26,398 --> 01:07:28,483
- There is a plan.
- No. There's no plan.

1087
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,694
We failed to raise a god army...

1088
01:07:30,819 --> 01:07:31,862
Korg is dead.

1089
01:07:32,028 --> 01:07:33,256
- He's not dead.
- I'm not dead.

1090
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,739
Well, he's a head. And you

1091
01:07:34,906 --> 01:07:36,283
you got properly humiliated.

1092
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:38,743
No, I got properly naked,
which I am okay with.

1093
01:07:38,910 --> 01:07:40,454
- Jane?
- I was okay with it.

1094
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,788
- Korg?
- I loved it.

1095
01:07:41,997 --> 01:07:43,891
The point is,
we are going into the Shadow Realm

1096
01:07:43,915 --> 01:07:45,250
weaker than we were before.

1097
01:07:45,417 --> 01:07:46,626
I mean, we're gonna die.

1098
01:07:46,793 --> 01:07:48,336
- No one's gonna die, okay?
- Really?

1099
01:07:48,503 --> 01:07:50,672
Everything is fine.
We did great back there.

1100
01:07:50,839 --> 01:07:52,757
- We killed Zeus!
- You killed Zeus.

1101
01:07:52,966 --> 01:07:55,844
I mean, that may or may not be catastrophic
for the whole universe,

1102
01:07:56,052 --> 01:07:58,072
and, sure, the entire god kingdom
is probably going

1103
01:07:58,096 --> 01:07:59,615
to hunt us down
for the rest of our days,

1104
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:02,142
but listen, you stole
this beautiful weapon.

1105
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:04,186
All right? This is the army right here.

1106
01:08:04,352 --> 01:08:07,355
It's sleek, it's slender,
it's powerful, it's beautiful...

1107
01:08:09,441 --> 01:08:11,318
For you. I love it for you, Valkyrie.

1108
01:08:11,485 --> 01:08:13,085
I mean, it's not really what I'm into

1109
01:08:13,153 --> 01:08:14,988
'cause I've got my weapon out there.

1110
01:08:15,197 --> 01:08:16,740
Can I borrow that for a second?

1111
01:08:19,784 --> 01:08:22,078
There you are, old friend.

1112
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:24,873
That was quite an entrance back there.

1113
01:08:30,629 --> 01:08:31,922
Listen

1114
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:33,381
are we good?

1115
01:08:33,632 --> 01:08:34,633
Yeah?

1116
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,319
I mean, I know it's a little weird
having my ex-weapon around,

1117
01:08:37,928 --> 01:08:39,846
but come on, Mjolnir, in the past.

1118
01:08:40,263 --> 01:08:41,431
It's you and me now, buddy.

1119
01:08:41,723 --> 01:08:43,225
You know what?

1120
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:45,727
I think it's time for your first beer.
What do you say?

1121
01:08:51,525 --> 01:08:52,943
Delicious.

1122
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:55,278
I'm sorry we've been fighting lately.

1123
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:04,371
Hey.

1124
01:09:04,704 --> 01:09:05,705
Oh, hey.

1125
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:10,293
It's quite the view, huh?

1126
01:09:10,919 --> 01:09:11,920
Yeah. Beautiful.

1127
01:09:12,087 --> 01:09:15,757
I just want to say that was very, very
impressive what you did back there.

1128
01:09:16,466 --> 01:09:18,301
You and Mjolnir, you know.

1129
01:09:20,929 --> 01:09:21,930
Yeah.

1130
01:09:24,558 --> 01:09:26,393
- Space dolphins.
- What?

1131
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:28,790
You should see some space dolphins...

1132
01:09:28,853 --> 01:09:29,853
What?

1133
01:09:30,522 --> 01:09:31,940
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1134
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:33,692
Beautiful.

1135
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:35,986
So beautiful. So rare.

1136
01:09:36,194 --> 01:09:37,237
Very loyal creatures.

1137
01:09:37,404 --> 01:09:40,156
They mate for life, in packs of six.

1138
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:42,117
Just love.

1139
01:09:42,242 --> 01:09:45,161
With a hey ninny-nonny
and a fair finny-fonny.

1140
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:48,582
Ooh, brother man, you look so hot

1141
01:09:48,748 --> 01:09:51,585
I wanna get in your rocks.

1142
01:09:52,377 --> 01:09:55,171
When we get together
We're gonna get it on.

1143
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:59,092
And we're all gonna make some babies.

1144
01:09:59,884 --> 01:10:03,763
That is the song that my dad sang
to my other dad when they were courting.

1145
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:06,850
When two Kronans wanna make a baby,
they get together inside a mountain,

1146
01:10:07,017 --> 01:10:10,478
and they go down to a little lava pool,
and they hold hands over the hot lava,

1147
01:10:10,604 --> 01:10:12,856
and then, after a month,
they pull their hands apart,

1148
01:10:13,064 --> 01:10:16,026
and they find they've created
a beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

1149
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:18,445
Fascinating. And hot.

1150
01:10:18,695 --> 01:10:20,006
Did you ever have a special someone?

1151
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,866
I've had so many special someones.

1152
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:25,327
But I don't know.

1153
01:10:26,411 --> 01:10:27,680
I don't know if I want that again.

1154
01:10:27,704 --> 01:10:30,474
Is that because you lost your girlfriend
in battle and never forgave yourself?

1155
01:10:30,498 --> 01:10:33,269
And now, you're just trying to find answers
in the bottom of a bottle,

1156
01:10:33,293 --> 01:10:36,087
or some meaningless dalliance,
which only serves to numb the pain

1157
01:10:36,296 --> 01:10:38,840
instead of bringing you real happiness
or satisfaction?

1158
01:10:39,049 --> 01:10:41,426
Yeah. Something like that.

1159
01:10:44,179 --> 01:10:47,015
Beautiful. Beautiful things.

1160
01:10:51,353 --> 01:10:52,354
Jane.

1161
01:10:52,812 --> 01:10:53,813
Thor.

1162
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,231
I wanna feel shitty about you.

1163
01:10:55,398 --> 01:10:56,399
What?

1164
01:11:00,487 --> 01:11:04,115
I wanna feel shitty about something
and I think that's you.

1165
01:11:04,324 --> 01:11:05,524
Not really getting any better.

1166
01:11:05,575 --> 01:11:06,951
It's not, is it? Damn it.

1167
01:11:08,662 --> 01:11:11,289
My friend, he told me
that it's better to feel shitty

1168
01:11:12,582 --> 01:11:14,644
from losing love
than it is to never experience love,

1169
01:11:14,668 --> 01:11:16,187
and to feel nothing at all,
to feel empty,

1170
01:11:16,211 --> 01:11:17,291
and I think he was right

1171
01:11:18,171 --> 01:11:20,590
which is how I've been feeling
for a long time.

1172
01:11:20,757 --> 01:11:23,051
I've pushed people away,
kept them at a distance

1173
01:11:23,259 --> 01:11:24,654
because of the fear of that loss,

1174
01:11:24,678 --> 01:11:26,822
but I don't wanna do that anymore.
I don't wanna live like that.

1175
01:11:26,846 --> 01:11:28,658
Better to close off your heart
than feel the pain.

1176
01:11:28,682 --> 01:11:30,892
That's what I did, yes.
I closed off my heart,

1177
01:11:31,059 --> 01:11:32,769
and I meditated.
Did you meditate?

1178
01:11:32,936 --> 01:11:34,104
No. It's so boring.

1179
01:11:34,354 --> 01:11:35,939
It actually made me more angry.

1180
01:11:36,898 --> 01:11:39,526
But I'm tired of giving myself over
to the idea of fate,

1181
01:11:39,693 --> 01:11:41,945
and trying to figure out
what the universe wants from me.

1182
01:11:42,112 --> 01:11:44,715
I wanna live in the moment,
I wanna live like there's no tomorrow

1183
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:45,824
throw caution to the wind.

1184
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:47,951
I wanna be with you, Jane.

1185
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,078
What do you say?

1186
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:52,288
I have cancer.

1187
01:11:54,666 --> 01:11:55,667
I'm sorry. What?

1188
01:11:56,334 --> 01:11:57,335
I'm sick.

1189
01:11:57,502 --> 01:11:59,045
- Wait. What's happening?
- Bye.

1190
01:11:59,838 --> 01:12:02,090
No, no, no. Jane, Jane, Jane.
Wait, wait, wait. Jane.

1191
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,843
What did I say? I didn't mean that.
Just kidding.

1192
01:12:06,469 --> 01:12:08,012
I don't have cancer.

1193
01:12:08,179 --> 01:12:09,597
Let's go smash something.

1194
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:11,391
Jane, I'm so sorry.

1195
01:12:11,558 --> 01:12:13,518
Don't be sorry for me.

1196
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,604
When did you find out?

1197
01:12:18,773 --> 01:12:20,650
Like six months ago.

1198
01:12:20,734 --> 01:12:24,612
I was just feeling tired,
and then they told me I have Stage Four.

1199
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:26,489
Get my affairs in order.

1200
01:12:27,282 --> 01:12:29,659
And then I heard Mjolnir calling me,

1201
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:32,871
so I thought maybe,
if science isn't working

1202
01:12:33,788 --> 01:12:36,291
maybe Viking space magic.

1203
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:38,752
That's why you came to New Asgard.

1204
01:12:38,877 --> 01:12:41,755
Yeah, I thought the hammer
maybe could cure me,

1205
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,799
and I think it's getting better.

1206
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:46,926
Maybe not.

1207
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:50,180
Jane, none of us know how long we have.

1208
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:52,682
We don't know what tomorrow holds.

1209
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:53,808
And Mjolnir

1210
01:12:54,142 --> 01:12:55,435
Mjolnir chose you.

1211
01:12:56,311 --> 01:12:58,229
And it chose you because you're worthy.

1212
01:12:58,396 --> 01:12:59,647
And that's something.

1213
01:12:59,814 --> 01:13:00,940
When I first met you.

1214
01:13:01,608 --> 01:13:04,235
I was unworthy.
I was unable to pick up that hammer.

1215
01:13:05,111 --> 01:13:06,321
But you taught me

1216
01:13:06,488 --> 01:13:09,449
there is no greater purpose
than to help those in need.

1217
01:13:10,116 --> 01:13:12,202
You made me worthy.

1218
01:13:13,745 --> 01:13:15,872
So whatever you wanna do,
we can do together.

1219
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,042
Okay.

1220
01:13:19,167 --> 01:13:20,960
Now what do you wanna do?

1221
01:13:22,086 --> 01:13:24,756
I wanna get those children
back to their families.

1222
01:13:24,923 --> 01:13:26,174
I wanna finish that mission.

1223
01:13:27,425 --> 01:13:28,802
Spoken like a true Thor.

1224
01:13:30,595 --> 01:13:31,888
How do you feel now?

1225
01:13:33,097 --> 01:13:34,265
So scared.

1226
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,601
How are you feeling?

1227
01:13:36,768 --> 01:13:37,894
Shitty.

1228
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:39,061
How shitty?

1229
01:13:39,103 --> 01:13:40,814
- Really shitty.
- Well, then.

1230
01:13:51,866 --> 01:13:53,906
I wonder what those two are talking about
out there.

1231
01:13:54,577 --> 01:13:55,829
Yeah, they're not talking.

1232
01:13:58,414 --> 01:14:02,877
Do you think those two will ever hold hands
over a hot lava pool and make a Thor baby?

1233
01:14:04,712 --> 01:14:06,881
It's unlikely, sadly.

1234
01:14:07,423 --> 01:14:10,134
That's too bad.
I think Thor would make a great dad.

1235
01:14:13,346 --> 01:14:14,764
Hey. We're here.

1236
01:14:23,731 --> 01:14:25,316
Where did all the color go?

1237
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:00,018
They're not here.

1238
01:15:05,523 --> 01:15:06,566
Where are they?

1239
01:15:25,835 --> 01:15:27,545
What the hell is this place?

1240
01:15:55,907 --> 01:15:57,909
Bifrost is the key?

1241
01:16:07,251 --> 01:16:08,586
It's a trap!

1242
01:16:25,979 --> 01:16:28,579
You wanna tell me why you just threw
Storm breaker out the window?

1243
01:16:28,606 --> 01:16:30,733
He needs it to open the Gates of Eternity.

1244
01:17:02,056 --> 01:17:03,617
We really have to stop meeting like this.

1245
01:17:03,641 --> 01:17:04,684
Call the axe.

1246
01:17:04,892 --> 01:17:06,495
I'll call the axe when
you call the dentist.

1247
01:17:06,519 --> 01:17:09,147
Call the axe.

1248
01:17:09,313 --> 01:17:11,399
Tell me where the children are
or I'm gonna kill you.

1249
01:17:18,489 --> 01:17:19,949
Call the axe.

1250
01:17:27,123 --> 01:17:29,000
Some god you are.

1251
01:17:29,876 --> 01:17:33,212
You know nothing of being a god.

1252
01:17:35,757 --> 01:17:40,219
You went to the gods for help,
and they did nothing.

1253
01:17:40,428 --> 01:17:43,056
We're alike in that sense.

1254
01:17:43,723 --> 01:17:44,974
He's nothing like you.

1255
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:46,684
What was that?

1256
01:17:49,854 --> 01:17:51,606
I said he's nothing like you.

1257
01:17:51,814 --> 01:17:53,149
That's right.

1258
01:17:53,316 --> 01:17:57,695
I'm not a hypocrite.
I'm truly creating peace.

1259
01:17:57,862 --> 01:17:59,614
Peace? You're murdering innocent gods.

1260
01:17:59,781 --> 01:18:00,823
Innocent?

1261
01:18:01,991 --> 01:18:02,992
Are you a Valkyrie?

1262
01:18:03,117 --> 01:18:04,117
Yes.

1263
01:18:05,328 --> 01:18:06,871
How exciting!

1264
01:18:07,914 --> 01:18:10,958
Oh, the gods failed you, too

1265
01:18:11,209 --> 01:18:15,004
when your sisterhood was led to slaughter.

1266
01:18:15,129 --> 01:18:16,214
Don't you dare speak...

1267
01:18:17,048 --> 01:18:19,092
Did you pray to the gods

1268
01:18:19,217 --> 01:18:23,471
when the women you loved
laid dying on the battlefield?

1269
01:18:25,348 --> 01:18:27,475
Did you beg them for help

1270
01:18:28,101 --> 01:18:30,144
as your family was massacred?

1271
01:18:33,106 --> 01:18:34,107
Good chat.

1272
01:18:37,944 --> 01:18:39,112
This one.

1273
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:41,280
You're interesting.

1274
01:18:42,406 --> 01:18:44,033
You're different.

1275
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:45,910
Yes.

1276
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:55,503
You're dying.

1277
01:18:57,296 --> 01:18:58,548
I'm sorry.

1278
01:18:59,715 --> 01:19:01,509
We're on the same path.

1279
01:19:03,886 --> 01:19:07,181
Just as the sword empowered me

1280
01:19:07,890 --> 01:19:10,017
the hammer empowered you.

1281
01:19:10,935 --> 01:19:13,646
But it did nothing
to change your fate.

1282
01:19:14,647 --> 01:19:17,775
The gods will use you,

1283
01:19:18,693 --> 01:19:21,320
but they will not help you.

1284
01:19:21,863 --> 01:19:26,993
There is no eternal reward for us.

1285
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:35,126
She'll be gone soon.

1286
01:19:36,878 --> 01:19:38,588
And you know who won't help her?

1287
01:19:38,754 --> 01:19:40,506
I'll give you one guess.

1288
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:53,144
I know your pain.

1289
01:19:53,227 --> 01:19:55,271
Love is pain.

1290
01:19:59,901 --> 01:20:02,320
I had a daughter once.

1291
01:20:03,196 --> 01:20:05,114
I put my faith in a higher power

1292
01:20:05,281 --> 01:20:07,992
hoping it would save her,

1293
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:09,869
and she

1294
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:12,788
died.

1295
01:20:16,834 --> 01:20:18,920
Now I understand.

1296
01:20:19,086 --> 01:20:21,297
My daughter is the lucky one.

1297
01:20:21,964 --> 01:20:27,178
She does not have to grow up
in a world of suffering,

1298
01:20:27,303 --> 01:20:28,804
and pain

1299
01:20:28,971 --> 01:20:33,226
run by wicked gods.

1300
01:20:34,936 --> 01:20:37,230
Choose love.

1301
01:20:38,356 --> 01:20:41,901
Call the axe.

1302
01:20:50,534 --> 01:20:52,578
Call

1303
01:20:52,995 --> 01:20:54,372
the axe.

1304
01:21:30,616 --> 01:21:31,951
You okay?

1305
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:33,202
Yeah.

1306
01:21:36,163 --> 01:21:37,206
I wanna kill this guy.

1307
01:21:37,331 --> 01:21:39,792
So do I, but we have to take him alive.

1308
01:21:39,959 --> 01:21:41,961
He's our only link to
finding those children.

1309
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:57,703
Thank you, Mr. Goat.

1310
01:23:30,444 --> 01:23:31,445
Val!

1311
01:23:42,623 --> 01:23:43,999
We gotta get her out of here!

1312
01:23:53,801 --> 01:23:55,094
Hey. I got you.

1313
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:08,065
Hey, guys, we're here.
Come on, let's go.

1314
01:24:08,315 --> 01:24:10,151
Storm breaker, take us home.

1315
01:25:05,789 --> 01:25:08,083
At a rate that
none of us have seen before.

1316
01:25:08,209 --> 01:25:11,378
Look, there are other more aggressive forms
of treatment we can try,

1317
01:25:11,504 --> 01:25:14,673
but something's affecting her
body's ability to fight the cancer.

1318
01:25:15,591 --> 01:25:17,301
I'm sorry, Thor.

1319
01:25:31,273 --> 01:25:32,900
There you are. Okay.

1320
01:25:33,108 --> 01:25:34,151
What's goin' on out there?

1321
01:25:34,276 --> 01:25:37,196
Some moron made a fridge without a door.
Can you believe it?

1322
01:25:37,321 --> 01:25:40,407
Not to worry. Got it open
and got you all sorts of goodies.

1323
01:25:40,533 --> 01:25:41,534
How's Val?

1324
01:25:41,825 --> 01:25:44,245
She's in a lot of pain,
but she is stable.

1325
01:25:44,411 --> 01:25:45,411
Okay, good.

1326
01:25:45,704 --> 01:25:48,123
Now you just gotta get this out of my...

1327
01:25:48,332 --> 01:25:49,851
No, no, no.
That's gotta stay in there.

1328
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:53,170
That's all the magic potions
and elixirs doing their thing, so.

1329
01:25:53,754 --> 01:25:56,650
I'm just gonna pop out for a moment,
pick up the kids, kill the bad guy,

1330
01:25:56,674 --> 01:25:57,994
and then I'll come straight back.

1331
01:25:59,009 --> 01:26:00,553
You're going without me?

1332
01:26:01,345 --> 01:26:02,346
Yeah.

1333
01:26:02,513 --> 01:26:04,473
What happened to, like,
doing everything together?

1334
01:26:04,598 --> 01:26:06,559
He's gonna use those kids to distract you.

1335
01:26:06,684 --> 01:26:07,768
You need me.

1336
01:26:07,935 --> 01:26:10,229
I do need you, Jane. I need you alive.

1337
01:26:10,396 --> 01:26:13,399
It'd be great to have you on the
battlefield, fighting Gorr side by side,

1338
01:26:13,566 --> 01:26:15,317
but that hammer is killing you.

1339
01:26:16,652 --> 01:26:19,655
Every time you use it, it's
draining all of your mortal strength

1340
01:26:19,822 --> 01:26:21,991
leaving your body
unable to fight the cancer.

1341
01:26:22,783 --> 01:26:24,743
What happened to,
"Live like there's no tomorrow"?

1342
01:26:24,868 --> 01:26:26,828
Well, that's before I knew
you might not have one.

1343
01:26:26,912 --> 01:26:28,330
Why not have one more adventure?

1344
01:26:28,497 --> 01:26:30,657
Jane, if there's a chance to live,
you have to take it.

1345
01:26:30,749 --> 01:26:33,627
Spoken like a true Thor
who does not have cancer.

1346
01:26:37,131 --> 01:26:41,093
I know I seem like some cool astrophysicist
from New Mexico

1347
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:43,846
just living the dream,
but look at me.

1348
01:26:44,013 --> 01:26:47,641
I wanna keep fighting.
I'm the Mighty Thor.

1349
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:49,090
And you want me not to do that?

1350
01:26:49,268 --> 01:26:51,770
What's the point of more time of this?

1351
01:26:52,813 --> 01:26:54,440
Because I love you.

1352
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,652
I've always loved you.

1353
01:26:59,695 --> 01:27:01,780
And this is a chance for us.

1354
01:27:02,531 --> 01:27:05,993
But if you pick up that damn hammer again,
then that chance is gone.

1355
01:27:18,088 --> 01:27:19,506
It's your choice, Jane.

1356
01:27:20,633 --> 01:27:23,469
But I'd regret it every single day
if I didn't ask you to stay here,

1357
01:27:23,636 --> 01:27:25,512
so we could try and
figure this out together.

1358
01:27:28,682 --> 01:27:30,684
You better come back to me.

1359
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,479
I'm coming back as soon as I can.

1360
01:27:36,023 --> 01:27:38,484
- Break a leg.
- I'll break all his legs.

1361
01:27:51,997 --> 01:27:54,309
Remember that the Gate to Eternity
is at the literal center

1362
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:55,560
- of the universe.
- Universe. Yes.

1363
01:27:55,584 --> 01:27:56,936
If you go past the cluster of comets...

1364
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,440
Yes, yes, I know. We've been over this.
I'm not gonna get lost.

1365
01:27:59,713 --> 01:28:02,132
So how you feeling with the old stab wound?

1366
01:28:02,299 --> 01:28:03,467
I think I lost my kidney.

1367
01:28:03,634 --> 01:28:04,885
Gone completely?

1368
01:28:05,052 --> 01:28:06,136
I wish I could join you,

1369
01:28:06,387 --> 01:28:08,827
but I'd probably die,
and that won't help get the kids back,

1370
01:28:08,931 --> 01:28:10,432
so you'll have to go alone.

1371
01:28:10,974 --> 01:28:13,602
All you have to do is destroy that sword.

1372
01:28:13,727 --> 01:28:16,397
It's his source of power.
He won't survive long without it.

1373
01:28:18,357 --> 01:28:20,317
Hey. Don't die.

1374
01:28:20,734 --> 01:28:21,860
Yeah, I know.

1375
01:29:15,622 --> 01:29:17,624
Eternity.

1376
01:29:19,877 --> 01:29:21,378
Finally.

1377
01:29:36,101 --> 01:29:37,352
Come on.

1378
01:30:03,212 --> 01:30:04,213
Hey, kids.

1379
01:30:06,757 --> 01:30:08,091
I knew he'd come.

1380
01:30:08,801 --> 01:30:09,802
Go!

1381
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:11,010
Go, kids!

1382
01:30:20,062 --> 01:30:22,856
Everyone okay? All right, gather round.
Gather round.

1383
01:30:23,315 --> 01:30:26,068
Good to see you in person, buddy.
Good to see you.

1384
01:30:36,912 --> 01:30:38,392
All right, listen up.
Here's the plan.

1385
01:30:38,497 --> 01:30:40,624
We're gonna sneak our way
towards Storm breaker

1386
01:30:40,749 --> 01:30:44,711
being very careful not to bump into
any of those big shadow monsters.

1387
01:30:46,171 --> 01:30:47,631
They're behind me, aren't they?

1388
01:30:53,262 --> 01:30:54,888
Does anyone here have battle experience?

1389
01:30:55,013 --> 01:30:56,013
Battle experience?

1390
01:30:56,139 --> 01:30:58,100
Well, no time to learn
like the present.

1391
01:30:58,267 --> 01:31:00,686
We're not strong like you. We're just kids.

1392
01:31:00,853 --> 01:31:02,813
Hey, don't forget you're Asgardian kids.

1393
01:31:03,272 --> 01:31:04,940
I'm not. I'm just a Lycan kid.

1394
01:31:05,107 --> 01:31:06,233
And I'm a Midassian kid.

1395
01:31:06,483 --> 01:31:07,723
- I'm Falligarian.
- Okay, okay.

1396
01:31:07,776 --> 01:31:10,153
But today you're Asgardians.

1397
01:31:10,362 --> 01:31:11,655
Now collect your weapons.

1398
01:31:11,822 --> 01:31:12,822
What?

1399
01:31:12,865 --> 01:31:14,867
Go and find anything you can pick up.

1400
01:31:14,992 --> 01:31:15,993
Bring it back here.

1401
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:17,828
Hurry, hurry!

1402
01:31:18,287 --> 01:31:19,454
Okay, cool. Come on!

1403
01:31:20,706 --> 01:31:22,332
They're getting closer.
Hurry up!

1404
01:31:22,499 --> 01:31:23,500
Come on!

1405
01:31:25,127 --> 01:31:28,714
Today is a day that
will go down in history.

1406
01:31:29,715 --> 01:31:32,885
Today is the day they will talk about
for generations to come.

1407
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:35,429
Today we are Space Vikings!

1408
01:31:36,263 --> 01:31:38,098
Present arms!

1409
01:31:43,478 --> 01:31:46,189
Whosoever holds these weapons,
and believes in getting home

1410
01:31:46,356 --> 01:31:49,192
if they be true of heart
is therefore worthy,

1411
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:50,819
and shall possess,

1412
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:53,363
for limited time only

1413
01:31:53,906 --> 01:31:57,659
the power of Thor!

1414
01:32:06,919 --> 01:32:08,170
General Axl

1415
01:32:09,838 --> 01:32:11,632
lead your army to that axe.

1416
01:32:12,341 --> 01:32:13,800
We shall do our worst.

1417
01:32:15,302 --> 01:32:16,637
For Asgard.

1418
01:34:12,878 --> 01:34:14,087
Yeah!

1419
01:34:16,506 --> 01:34:17,507
No.

1420
01:34:31,897 --> 01:34:33,273
Jane.

1421
01:34:50,248 --> 01:34:51,917
We destroy that sword and he's dead.

1422
01:34:52,042 --> 01:34:54,242
The gateway's almost open.
You gotta stop Storm breaker.

1423
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:56,213
It's okay. I got him.

1424
01:35:04,262 --> 01:35:05,764
Storm breaker, stop this!

1425
01:35:06,515 --> 01:35:08,284
Get a hold of yourself.
Look what you're doing!

1426
01:35:08,308 --> 01:35:09,684
I'm gonna get you out of there.

1427
01:35:10,644 --> 01:35:13,021
Come on. Come on, buddy.

1428
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:21,488
Let go of my friend.

1429
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:27,202
You've lost, Lady Thor.

1430
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:35,709
First off

1431
01:35:36,044 --> 01:35:38,713
the name is Mighty Thor.

1432
01:35:40,215 --> 01:35:41,508
And secondly

1433
01:35:41,758 --> 01:35:43,760
if you can't say Mighty Thor

1434
01:35:44,761 --> 01:35:48,348
I'll accept Doctor Jane Foster.

1435
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:53,520
And thirdly...

1436
01:35:54,229 --> 01:35:57,107
Eat my hammer!

1437
01:36:05,365 --> 01:36:07,784
Storm breaker!

1438
01:36:12,122 --> 01:36:13,331
I knew you could do it.

1439
01:36:14,416 --> 01:36:16,418
Axl! Get them home!

1440
01:38:05,402 --> 01:38:06,569
Jane?

1441
01:38:07,070 --> 01:38:08,071
I'm okay.

1442
01:38:08,405 --> 01:38:09,739
You have to stop him.

1443
01:38:40,061 --> 01:38:41,396
Gorr! Stop!

1444
01:38:46,067 --> 01:38:48,236
What kind of father would I be

1445
01:38:48,737 --> 01:38:50,363
if I stopped?

1446
01:38:54,284 --> 01:38:57,454
I know your pain,
but this isn't the way.

1447
01:38:59,414 --> 01:39:02,334
It's not death or revenge that you seek.

1448
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:07,464
What do I seek?

1449
01:39:20,977 --> 01:39:22,187
You seek love.

1450
01:39:25,523 --> 01:39:26,900
Love?

1451
01:39:27,942 --> 01:39:29,944
Why should I seek love?

1452
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:32,447
Because it's all any of us want.

1453
01:39:34,908 --> 01:39:36,076
How

1454
01:39:36,284 --> 01:39:39,954
dare you turn your back on me?

1455
01:39:41,498 --> 01:39:43,291
You've won, Gorr.

1456
01:39:43,416 --> 01:39:45,293
Why would I spend
my last moments with you

1457
01:39:45,418 --> 01:39:46,836
when I can be with her?

1458
01:39:48,213 --> 01:39:49,672
I choose love.

1459
01:39:49,964 --> 01:39:52,717
You can, too. You can bring her back.

1460
01:39:56,638 --> 01:39:58,431
Make your wish.

1461
01:40:29,587 --> 01:40:30,964
I'm dying.

1462
01:40:32,424 --> 01:40:34,050
She would have no one.

1463
01:40:35,301 --> 01:40:37,137
She would be alone.

1464
01:40:44,436 --> 01:40:46,438
She won't be alone.

1465
01:41:56,799 --> 01:41:58,051
My love.

1466
01:42:08,061 --> 01:42:09,979
I've missed you so much.

1467
01:42:12,857 --> 01:42:14,484
I missed you too.

1468
01:42:18,071 --> 01:42:19,322
I'm so sorry.

1469
01:42:19,447 --> 01:42:20,448
It's okay.

1470
01:42:22,534 --> 01:42:24,911
Ever since I picked up that hammer

1471
01:42:26,746 --> 01:42:28,122
it's like

1472
01:42:28,831 --> 01:42:30,375
I've gotten an extra life.

1473
01:42:31,793 --> 01:42:33,711
And it was

1474
01:42:35,421 --> 01:42:36,923
magical.

1475
01:42:39,801 --> 01:42:41,844
Not too bad for a human.

1476
01:42:43,513 --> 01:42:45,098
Not too bad for a god.

1477
01:42:46,015 --> 01:42:49,894
Hey. I think I figured out my catchphrase.

1478
01:42:50,395 --> 01:42:51,915
- Oh, yeah? What is it?
- Come close...

1479
01:42:57,902 --> 01:42:59,070
It's perfect.

1480
01:42:59,237 --> 01:43:00,572
It's the best one yet.

1481
01:43:00,697 --> 01:43:01,906
Thanks.

1482
01:43:09,998 --> 01:43:12,292
Keep your heart open.

1483
01:43:17,755 --> 01:43:19,173
I love you.

1484
01:43:20,466 --> 01:43:21,926
I love you, too.

1485
01:44:07,639 --> 01:44:09,057
Protect her.

1486
01:44:10,683 --> 01:44:11,976
Protect my love.

1487
01:44:45,968 --> 01:44:49,764
Let me tell you
the legend of the Space Viking...

1488
01:44:50,598 --> 01:44:55,770
AKA the Mighty Thor,
AKA Dr. Jane Foster.

1489
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:00,525
Her sacrifice saved the universe,

1490
01:45:00,692 --> 01:45:04,278
and taught us all
what it means to be worthy.

1491
01:45:04,821 --> 01:45:06,739
She helped the children of the gods

1492
01:45:06,906 --> 01:45:09,242
who laser-beamed
their way back home

1493
01:45:09,367 --> 01:45:13,329
to their dozy little fishing village
turned tourist destination.

1494
01:45:14,414 --> 01:45:15,498
Axl!

1495
01:45:15,623 --> 01:45:17,041
I missed you.

1496
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:18,811
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1497
01:45:18,835 --> 01:45:19,961
- Are you sure?
- I'm okay.

1498
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,629
The kids were safe to be kids again.

1499
01:45:21,754 --> 01:45:23,089
Louder, three!

1500
01:45:24,757 --> 01:45:25,758
Widen your stance.

1501
01:45:25,925 --> 01:45:29,345
Especially after their king made them
all go to self-defense classes.

1502
01:45:29,512 --> 01:45:31,305
Look at all those budding Space Vikings.

1503
01:45:31,472 --> 01:45:32,598
And the most important part.

1504
01:45:33,099 --> 01:45:34,434
The war cry!

1505
01:45:35,852 --> 01:45:37,145
Even Heimdall's son...

1506
01:45:37,353 --> 01:45:38,938
Axl Heimdall son

1507
01:45:39,147 --> 01:45:41,399
who could now do
his dad's freaky eye magic

1508
01:45:41,566 --> 01:45:43,401
was becoming quite the warrior.

1509
01:45:43,776 --> 01:45:45,987
The future of Asgard was secure.

1510
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:50,783
Speaking of futures,
I was forging one of my own

1511
01:45:50,908 --> 01:45:52,368
now that my body's grown back

1512
01:45:53,286 --> 01:45:55,455
with a dude I met called Dwayne.

1513
01:45:57,081 --> 01:45:58,708
And what about Thor, you ask?

1514
01:45:59,333 --> 01:46:01,461
He embarked on a new journey

1515
01:46:01,586 --> 01:46:05,923
because he had found something to live for,
something to love for.

1516
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:10,678
A little someone who turned him
from Sad God into Dad God.

1517
01:46:10,803 --> 01:46:11,929
Breakfast is served.

1518
01:46:13,514 --> 01:46:15,433
Hello. There you go.

1519
01:46:15,641 --> 01:46:17,560
Hey. Breakfast.

1520
01:46:17,977 --> 01:46:20,480
Excuse me. What is that?

1521
01:46:20,646 --> 01:46:22,482
They're pan-flaps. From Earth.

1522
01:46:22,648 --> 01:46:24,484
I don't think I like pan-flaps.

1523
01:46:24,650 --> 01:46:25,836
- You love them.
- No, I don't.

1524
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:27,740
- Yes, you do.
- I've never had that in my life.

1525
01:46:27,862 --> 01:46:29,590
Come on. Eat up. We have to go.
We're gonna be late.

1526
01:46:29,614 --> 01:46:30,614
Now where are your boots?

1527
01:46:30,782 --> 01:46:32,742
I'm wearing them.

1528
01:46:33,034 --> 01:46:34,202
You're not wearing those.

1529
01:46:34,452 --> 01:46:35,953
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

1530
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,330
Yes, I am.

1531
01:46:37,538 --> 01:46:38,581
No. You're not.

1532
01:46:38,748 --> 01:46:39,874
Go to hell, demon!

1533
01:46:41,834 --> 01:46:42,834
Wow!

1534
01:46:43,127 --> 01:46:45,838
Brand new, now destroyed.
Thank you very much.

1535
01:46:45,963 --> 01:46:47,799
You know what? You wear what you want.

1536
01:46:47,965 --> 01:46:49,943
Don't come complaining to me
when your feet get sore, all right?

1537
01:46:49,967 --> 01:46:51,719
You'll get no sympathy here from me.

1538
01:46:51,886 --> 01:46:54,138
Fine, I'll wear the boots.

1539
01:46:54,347 --> 01:46:55,347
Thank you.

1540
01:46:55,389 --> 01:46:57,058
Remember what my mother used to tell me.

1541
01:46:57,266 --> 01:46:58,306
Listen to the grown-ups,

1542
01:46:58,476 --> 01:47:00,520
and if you see anyone scared
or being picked on

1543
01:47:00,686 --> 01:47:02,080
- you look after them, okay?
- Okay.

1544
01:47:02,104 --> 01:47:03,564
And most of all, have fun.

1545
01:47:03,731 --> 01:47:05,191
- Gotcha.
- Gotcha.

1546
01:47:05,399 --> 01:47:07,401
Now where is Mjolnir?
Where did I put him?

1547
01:47:07,568 --> 01:47:08,848
Over there. Sleeping in the bed.

1548
01:47:08,903 --> 01:47:10,071
In the bed.

1549
01:47:11,656 --> 01:47:12,657
Oh, wow.

1550
01:47:15,117 --> 01:47:16,869
That is not coming off.

1551
01:47:17,662 --> 01:47:19,038
What did you do?

1552
01:47:19,247 --> 01:47:21,123
She looked boring before.

1553
01:47:22,208 --> 01:47:23,793
Yeah. Suppose it did.

1554
01:47:23,876 --> 01:47:24,877
I love it.

1555
01:47:25,211 --> 01:47:26,504
Very creative.

1556
01:47:30,675 --> 01:47:31,675
Okay.

1557
01:47:32,218 --> 01:47:33,612
Now, you see the aliens down there?

1558
01:47:33,636 --> 01:47:35,888
- The stripy ones?
- They look nice.

1559
01:47:36,013 --> 01:47:37,950
Yeah, they are nice.
That's why we have to look after them.

1560
01:47:37,974 --> 01:47:39,809
Got it. Protect the nice ones.

1561
01:47:40,893 --> 01:47:41,894
I love you, sweetie.

1562
01:47:42,103 --> 01:47:43,396
Love you, Uncle Thor.

1563
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:47,859
They will always be there for us.

1564
01:47:47,984 --> 01:47:51,153
The Space Viking
and his girl, born from Eternity.

1565
01:47:51,362 --> 01:47:53,739
With the powers of a god.

1566
01:47:56,158 --> 01:47:57,827
Two warriors

1567
01:47:57,952 --> 01:48:01,080
fighting the good fight
for those who can't fight good.

1568
01:48:06,752 --> 01:48:10,423
They have traveled far,
and have been given many names.

1569
01:48:11,007 --> 01:48:13,509
But to those who know them best

1570
01:48:13,676 --> 01:48:15,261
they are simply known

1571
01:48:15,511 --> 01:48:17,471
as Love and Thunder.

1572
01:50:05,329 --> 01:50:09,333
It used to be that being a god,
it meant something.

1573
01:50:11,085 --> 01:50:13,129
People would whisper your name

1574
01:50:13,796 --> 01:50:17,717
before sharing
their deepest hopes and dreams.

1575
01:50:18,801 --> 01:50:21,095
They begged you for mercy

1576
01:50:21,804 --> 01:50:24,515
without ever knowing if you were
actually listening.

1577
01:50:26,892 --> 01:50:27,893
Now

1578
01:50:28,561 --> 01:50:30,479
you know, they look to the sky

1579
01:50:31,272 --> 01:50:33,566
they don't ask us for lightning.

1580
01:50:34,191 --> 01:50:36,569
They don't ask us for rain.

1581
01:50:37,194 --> 01:50:41,615
They just want to see
one of their so-called superheroes.

1582
01:50:44,910 --> 01:50:47,204
When did we become the joke?

1583
01:50:50,291 --> 01:50:51,584
No.

1584
01:50:52,543 --> 01:50:54,045
No more.

1585
01:50:55,546 --> 01:50:58,132
They will fear us again

1586
01:50:58,632 --> 01:51:01,635
when Thor Odinson falls from the sky.

1587
01:51:04,889 --> 01:51:07,767
Do you understand me, Hercules?

1588
01:51:08,184 --> 01:51:10,686
Do you understand me, my son?

1589
01:51:10,978 --> 01:51:12,313
Yes, Father.

1590
01:57:59,845 --> 01:58:00,845
What?

1591
01:58:02,431 --> 01:58:03,557
Hey.

1592
01:58:04,933 --> 01:58:06,435
Jane Foster.

1593
01:58:07,311 --> 01:58:08,854
Heimdall.

1594
01:58:09,313 --> 01:58:10,647
I see you're dead now.

1595
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:12,649
Yeah.

1596
01:58:13,358 --> 01:58:15,360
Thank you for looking after my son.

1597
01:58:16,111 --> 01:58:18,655
You are very welcome here,
to the land of the gods.

1598
01:58:23,494 --> 01:58:25,204
Welcome to Valhalla.
