1
00:00:00,985 --> 00:00:03,348
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:06,362
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:10,040
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:12,230
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:15,762
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:22,552
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:25,421
I must be something else.

8
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,028
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:30,565
Blood's trounced every potential
candidate we've focus-tested.

10
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:32,500
You want me to run
against Sebastian Blood?

11
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:35,203
The child of Ra's al Ghul
awaits your return.

12
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:37,672
Tell Ra's al Ghul
that my family is off limits!

13
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:40,091
You've got to come back home.
I can't!

14
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:42,510
If they knew I was alive,
Laurel and mom,

15
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:44,929
they would never
stop looking for me,

16
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:46,614
and that could
get them both killed.

17
00:00:46,616 --> 00:00:50,334
Thea Queen, telling me
enough is enough.

18
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:51,836
Now, that is rich.

19
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,789
Sara?

20
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:10,214
Welcome to
Starling City International Airport.

21
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:11,932
Please have
your passports ready,

22
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:14,301
and your customs forms
filled out.

23
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:16,637
All passengers
with departing flights

24
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:19,056
will need to show
appropriate identification

25
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:21,141
and declaration papers.

26
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:24,395
International passengers
are required to have a passport

27
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:27,031
and an airline
boarding pass to travel.

28
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:30,034
Business or personal,
Miss Raatko?

29
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:31,986
Personal.

30
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:33,954
All passengers are required

31
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:36,574
to pick up their luggage
in the baggage claim area

32
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:39,776
of the international
arrivals and safety.

33
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:43,163
My computer's froze.

34
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:46,450
Can you hold on a sec?
I'll be right back.

35
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,724
Down on the ground,
down, down!

36
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:55,092
Put your hands on your head!

37
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:58,729
I said, hands on your head,

38
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:00,681
lady. I will shoot you.

39
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:08,939
Aaah!

40
00:02:18,395 --> 00:02:20,172
Welcome to Starling City.

41
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:24,173

43
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:31,791
A successful mayoral campaign
isn't about polling,

44
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,126
it isn't about fundraising
or hot button issues.

45
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:35,827
It's about connecting
with people.

46
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,796
That's why right after
we announce tomorrow, Moira,

47
00:02:37,798 --> 00:02:40,749
I want to get you in front
of as many cameras as possible.

48
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:42,134
Morning shows,
talk shows--

49
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:43,635
Mark, I want to help
rebuild the city,

50
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:45,053
not pander to it.

51
00:02:45,055 --> 00:02:47,255
It's not pandering,
Mom. It's campaigning.

52
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:49,391
Let the people get
to know the real Moira Queen,

53
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:50,976
and they are going to fall
in love with you.

54
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,727
Speaking from
experience,

55
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:54,930
this man knows what he's
talking about, Moira.

56
00:02:54,932 --> 00:02:56,481
Hmm.

57
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:01,736
Mr. Steel?

58
00:03:01,738 --> 00:03:03,321
May I talk to you
about something?

59
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:04,773
I'm no longer
your boss, Felicity.

60
00:03:04,775 --> 00:03:06,608
So let's make it
Walter from now on.

61
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,660
- Ok.
- Walter.

62
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:10,612
It's about Tempest.

63
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:14,032
Mrs. Queen's
super sketchy offshore LLC

64
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,567
you asked me
to look into last year.

65
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,902
I remember.

66
00:03:17,904 --> 00:03:19,504
That's right.

67
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:23,041
So, the thing is, I left
an embedded account alert on it

68
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:26,011
so we'd know if anyone
ever accessed it again.

69
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:27,963
A few days ago, there was
a wire transfer made

70
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:31,766
from Tempest to a numbered account
at Starling National Bank.

71
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:34,553
Probably the campaign accountant
shutting it down.

72
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:36,438
Or it could be something else.

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,756
That is the money Mrs. Queen
used to do some really bad things.

74
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:41,359
I mean, you guys did get divorced
for pretty good reasons.

75
00:03:43,312 --> 00:03:45,614
Which is not my business.

76
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:47,983
I'll talk to Moira
first thing.

77
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:50,902
And thank you
for bringing it to my attention.

78
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:53,104
Of course.

79
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:55,240
Well...

80
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:57,375
We're starting a campaign.

81
00:03:57,377 --> 00:03:59,995
Oliver, can I have a word?
Yes.

82
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,548
I know that you
and he are friends,

83
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,501
but you'll need to end your support
for Sebastian Blood.

84
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:08,119
I will speak to Sebastian.

85
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,504
Good.

86
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,759
Hello?

87
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:18,230
I'll be right there.

88
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:24,969
Oliver.

89
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,772
Mrs. Lance.

90
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:29,608
I came back
as soon as I heard.

91
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,313
Thanks for coming.

92
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:38,116
Hey.

93
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:40,769
How you feeling?

94
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:43,338
I've been better.
Don't worry, baby.

95
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,790
We're going to get you
all the help you need.

96
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:47,509
There's a great rehab
outside of Starling,

97
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:48,860
they got a bed
waiting for you--

98
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:51,630
Dad, I already told you.
I didn't OD.

99
00:04:51,632 --> 00:04:53,765
I didn't take
any pills last night.

100
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,051
I swear.
Laurel...

101
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,103
The doctor wants
to check your eye.

102
00:04:58,105 --> 00:04:59,304
What happened
to her eye?

103
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:00,705
Minor subconjunctival
hemorrhaging.

104
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:02,140
Probably
from hitting her head

105
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:04,643
when she lost
consciousness.

106
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,684
You feel better, ok?

107
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:14,352
Thank you.

108
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:20,909
We'll be outside.
Let's go.

109
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:23,027
Dad.

110
00:05:24,664 --> 00:05:26,848
What is it,
sweetheart?

111
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,250
Before I passed out...

112
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:32,971
The strangest thing happened.

113
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:35,006
I saw Sara.

114
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:38,393
I mean, I know I was
hallucinating, but I saw her.

115
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:40,729
She was standing
right over me.

116
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:43,615
I mean, I've dreamt
about her over the years,

117
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:46,050
but this was so much more real.

118
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,306
That's crazy, right?

119
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:56,113
Yeah, it's crazy.

120
00:06:08,343 --> 00:06:10,795
She's been doing that
for like an hour.

121
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,002
You saw Laurel.

122
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,787
Is she going to be ok?

123
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:22,806
You saved her life.

124
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:24,658
Hey, thanks for calling me.

125
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,010
And I never did ask you--

126
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,529
how did you find me?

127
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:32,115
I wasn't going
to lose you again.

128
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:34,318
I should get going.

129
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,217
Hey, so that's it?

130
00:06:36,218 --> 00:06:37,707
You're back in town
for 24 hours,

131
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,170
now you're
just going to take off again?

132
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:41,388
The League of Assassins
is still after me, Ollie,

133
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,557
and staying in town would
put my whole family at risk.

134
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:46,009
I only came because
Laurel's in trouble.

135
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,877
Well, she's still
in trouble, Sara.

136
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,879
Your entire family needs you.

137
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:54,100
So do I.

138
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:03,748
Do me a favor and dig up
a copy of Laurel's bloodwork

139
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:04,862
from the hospital, please.

140
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:06,079
Sure. What are we looking for?

141
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,697
I just want to make
sure of something.

142
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,669
It's for you.

143
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:15,238
Hello, Detective.

144
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,674
Put my daughter on.

145
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:19,742
I know she's there.

146
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,102
Hilton, tell the Lieutenant
that the perp

147
00:07:29,104 --> 00:07:30,637
was practically
lawyering up

148
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,022
when I read him
his Miranda.

149
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:33,857
If we don't get on top
of this situation,

150
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,141
the Lieutenant is not
going to be happy--

151
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:37,027
Oh, it smells amazing, Dad.

152
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,395
Ahh, yeah.

153
00:07:38,397 --> 00:07:39,896
Here, try one of these.
Ok.

154
00:07:39,898 --> 00:07:41,481
Beautiful. No,
I'm talking to Laurel.

155
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:44,601
Quentin, hang up the phone.
Spend time with your family!

156
00:07:44,603 --> 00:07:47,571
Oh, my family. You heard that,
I got to go. Bye, buddy.

157
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:50,490
Sorry, ladies. Our do-er hired
some dirtbag lawyer, and--

158
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:52,709
Says the dad whose daughter
just applied to law school.

159
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:54,828
That is not the kind of lawyer
that you're going to be, young lady,

160
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,663
because you,
you're going to be a judge

161
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:58,215
or you're going to be a professor,
just like your mother.

162
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:01,501
Yeah, come over to academia.
The fun never ends.

163
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:03,670
Dinner is at
a crucial point.

164
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:08,508
- Ahem!
- Hey!

165
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,343
Hi!
Sar-bear!

166
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:12,596
Hey!
Hi!

167
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:13,796
Hi.

168
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:16,066
Sara, what a surprise.
Hi, mom.

169
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:18,518
Please don't tell me
you got kicked out of college.

170
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,687
Oh, well, thank you for
the vote of confidence.

171
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:21,510
I had a three day weekend,

172
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,407
so I figured I'd drive down
and surprise everybody.

173
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,408
Well, you're just
in time to eat. Come here.

174
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,861
Get yourself another
plate. Come on.

175
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:30,947
Here you go.

176
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:41,207
Hi, Dad.

177
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,964
Come here.

178
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:50,332
I only have a minute.

179
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,003
Well, a cup of tea
is all I ask.

180
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,471
Sit down.

181
00:08:57,057 --> 00:08:59,725
Oh, baby.

182
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:02,678
I have missed you so much.

183
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,847
How's Laurel?

184
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:06,532
She saw you.

185
00:09:06,534 --> 00:09:08,251
Right before she passed out.

186
00:09:08,253 --> 00:09:09,902
She thought it was,
I don't know what.

187
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:12,121
A hallucination.
Well, good.

188
00:09:12,123 --> 00:09:15,491
No, baby, you don't understand.
Seeing you, it made her happy.

189
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:19,328
Dad...The league,
they're still hunting me.

190
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,547
So what, you're just going to pop back
every time one of us is in trouble?

191
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:24,634
We can't live like this,
Sara, and you can't.

192
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:27,420
It's time we started
facing things together.

193
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:30,435
I've had better greetings.

194
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:32,537
I'm sorry, I did--
I just--I didn't know

195
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,873
what you were
going to do.

196
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,825
To be honest, neither did I.

197
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:40,996
We should talk.

198
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:42,914
Of course.

199
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,400
Do we need permission
from your boyfriend?

200
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:56,461
I am Nyssa.

201
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:59,014
Daughter of Ra's al Ghul.

202
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:01,767
Heir to the demon.

203
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:03,318
What are you doing here?

204
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,488
Sara swore her allegiance
to the League of Assassins.

205
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,358
It's time for her
to return home.

206
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,744
That...is not going to happen.

207
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:14,729
Nyssa...

208
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:17,165
Please, would you
give us a moment?

209
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,667
Take your time.

210
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:21,403
Good-byes
are never easy.

211
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:24,623
Is that why
I didn't get one?

212
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,265
I can explain.

213
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:34,933
You don't have to.

214
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:37,619
But you're not leaving.

215
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:39,521
I don't trust her.

216
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:41,473
Then trust me.

217
00:11:46,512 --> 00:11:48,029
Mrs. Queen?
Hmm?

218
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:49,715
A Miss Smoak
is here to see you.

219
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:51,199
Who?

220
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:54,536
Uh, me.

221
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:57,239
If you're looking for
Oliver, he's not here.

222
00:11:57,241 --> 00:11:59,541
I know. I'm to see you.

223
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:01,893
Really? What about?

224
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,112
Tempest.

225
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,465
I flagged a large
wire transfer you made.

226
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:07,694
When I mentioned it to Walter,

227
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,243
he said he would
talk to you about it.

228
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:12,504
I could tell in his face
he wouldn't.

229
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,506
British people
are really bad liars.

230
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:15,974
Yes, they are.

231
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:17,392
So I looked into it myself,

232
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:19,895
because--full disclosure--

233
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:22,314
I--I don't trust you.

234
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:26,568
You paid a substantial
sum of money to a Dr. Gill.

235
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,487
He was the doctor
who delivered Thea,

236
00:12:28,489 --> 00:12:30,238
which didn't make any sense to me.
So I went through

237
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,691
like a dozen different theories
until I remembered...

238
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:35,043
Your testimony. At trial.

239
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,096
You had an affair
with Malcolm Merlyn

240
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:42,617
one year before Thea was born.

241
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:45,787
Merlyn is Thea's father.

242
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:49,341
I can see why Walter and Oliver
have such a high appraisal

243
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:52,177
of your capabilities.

244
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,379
So.

245
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:57,132
What are you going to do
with this information?

246
00:12:57,134 --> 00:13:00,035
Felicity.

247
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,671
I don't know.

248
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:05,106
Confronting you
in your living room

249
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:07,142
was as far
as my plan went.

250
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:13,315
I thought you
deserved the chance

251
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:15,850
to tell Oliver yourself. He should
hear it from you.

252
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:18,987
I'm not going to tell
my son anything.

253
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:20,572
And neither are you.

254
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:23,792
If you won't keep my secret
for Oliver's sake,

255
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:27,796
you should keep it
for your own.

256
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:30,248
I see the way you look at him.

257
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,584
If you tell him this,

258
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:35,220
you will rip his world apart.

259
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:38,089
And a part of him
will always blame you.

260
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:41,760
Oh, he'll hate me, for sure.

261
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:43,878
But he will hate you, too.

262
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,817
We all have to keep secrets,
Miss Smoak.

263
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,447
You look different.

264
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:04,399
I'm still me.

265
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:06,451
The Sara I know
wouldn't have betrayed us

266
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:08,587
and fled Nanda Parbat
under the cover of darkness.

267
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,089
I didn't have a choice.
The earthquake--

268
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:14,426
I needed to see my family,
make sure they were safe.

269
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:17,178
And so they are.

270
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,047
Come home.

271
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:21,249
I can't.

272
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,968
Look, I can't
go back, Nyssa.

273
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,136
I don't have
much of a soul left in me,

274
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:28,223
but what there is,
it can't take the killing anymore.

275
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:29,641
You swore an oath.

276
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:33,278
My father sent me here
to make sure you honor it.

277
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,314
One way or another.

278
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:42,070
We both know the real reason
why you came here.

279
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,661
When I found you,

280
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:51,796
you were starving,

281
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:54,716
and alone,
simply waiting to die.

282
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:58,837
The League took you in...

283
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,640
nursed you back to health.

284
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:05,727
The only reason you're alive
today is because of me.

285
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:10,649
Hey, I wasn't with you
because you saved me.

286
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:14,569
I was with you
because I loved you.

287
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:21,943
But not anymore.

288
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:30,502
Ra's listens to you.
And you can ask him to release me.

289
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:33,421
My father has never released
anyone from the League.

290
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:35,040
He released
Malcolm Merlyn.

291
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:38,927
An action he and the citizens
of this city dearly regret.

292
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:52,307
Do what you have to.

293
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:14,329
It's been two hours,

294
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,214
and she should have gotten back
in touch with me by now.

295
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:19,200
Felicity.

296
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:21,503
Felicity!
What?!

297
00:16:21,505 --> 00:16:23,722
Sorry. What?

298
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:25,724
Are you ok?

299
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:27,759
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

300
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:30,595
It's just...
things in here.

301
00:16:30,597 --> 00:16:31,980
The League is never
going to let me go.

302
00:16:31,982 --> 00:16:33,231
At least if I'm halfway
around the world,

303
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,816
then I can keep
my family safe.

304
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:36,484
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

305
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:38,319
Just got a copy of
Laurel's bloodwork.

306
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:40,522
She tested negative
for drugs.

307
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,207
Well, then why did she collapse?

308
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,293
Because they found traces
of snake venom in her blood.

309
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,828
From a Tibetan
pit viper.

310
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,613
Wait.
So Laurel didn't OD?

311
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:50,915
She was poisoned.
She was poisoned by Nyssa,

312
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,450
who did it
to draw you back here.

313
00:16:52,452 --> 00:16:54,902
And it worked.

314
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:56,538
My family's
in danger.

315
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:03,044
Who are you texting?
No one.

316
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,430
Did you meet a boy at school?

317
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:08,166
Cut it out.
Boys at school are lame.

318
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:10,685
Hey, how's everything
with you and Oliver?

319
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:12,937
Great.

320
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:15,974
We decided to start
looking at apartments together.

321
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:19,594
I know it's a big step, but...

322
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:22,764
We're ready. I think we'll
live together for a year,

323
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:25,116
engaged for another,
and then...

324
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:27,202
Mrs. Laurel Queen.

325
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:29,237
Maybe one day.

326
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:33,374
This is kind of assuming
that he's ever ready to settle down.

327
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:35,844
What's that supposed to mean?

328
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,214
Well, we both know at least ten girls
that he's slept with.

329
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:41,699
Can't you just be happy for me?

330
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:44,118
I mean, if you met
some amazing guy

331
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,837
who wanted to spend
the rest of his life with you,

332
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,806
I would be so supportive,
and so happy for you--

333
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:50,625
Ok, Laurel, I wasn't trying
to be a bitch.

334
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:53,178
The title
of your autobiography.

335
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:58,016
I'm going to get
some sleep.

336
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,341
No!

337
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,243
No!

338
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:34,779
No!

339
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,866
Dad, it's my fault,
I'm so sorry.

340
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:49,034
The assassins group that you're
a part of, they took your mother.

341
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:50,019
Not exactly.

342
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,519
Well, what exactly?
A woman.

343
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:53,354
Nyssa. She's a powerful
figure in the League.

344
00:19:53,356 --> 00:19:55,741
And she poisoned Laurel.
She took mom.

345
00:19:55,743 --> 00:19:58,276
To get you to come back
to the League?

346
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:02,381
To get me
to come back to her.

347
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:05,133
Oh.

348
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:08,036
Nyssa,
don't do this.

349
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:11,256
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

350
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:13,341
I thought it would be
instructive

351
00:20:13,366 --> 00:20:14,727
for you to know
what it feels like

352
00:20:14,728 --> 00:20:16,378
to suddenly lose
someone you love.

353
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,398
To have them ripped
from your life without warning.

354
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,066
You do not want
to hurt my mother.

355
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:23,819
You're right.
I don't.

356
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:27,022
You have one day,
ta-er sah-fer.

357
00:20:27,024 --> 00:20:29,941
Make the right choice.

358
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,732
We have 24 hours.

359
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:40,085
Detective...
We'll find her.

360
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:43,004
Ok, Laurel's inside,
she's losing her mind, I got to go.

361
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:45,624
Keep me updated.

362
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,628
Oh, come on!

363
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,714
You ought to buy a ticket
if you're going to play like that!

364
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:56,551
Hey, kiddo. How's
the apartment hunt going?

365
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:59,221
Terribly. I really wanted to find
the perfect place

366
00:20:59,223 --> 00:21:01,306
to show Ollie when he gets back
from his boat trip.

367
00:21:01,308 --> 00:21:03,591
Everything good
was already taken

368
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:05,444
by the time I walked
in the door.

369
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:07,279
Maybe it's a sign that you're not
supposed to move in

370
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:08,730
with the frat boy
that you call a boyfriend.

371
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:10,148
You and mom were my age

372
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,933
when you moved into that
place on Spring Street.

373
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:13,201
You weren't even
engaged yet.

374
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:14,619
Well, that's
'cause your mother

375
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:17,456
kept turning down
all my proposals.

376
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,107
She did?

377
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:21,326
Oh, you know your mother,
free spirit and all.

378
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:23,227
Why do we need rings
when we have love?

379
00:21:23,252 --> 00:21:24,689
You know I spent a year
with that damn ring

380
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,614
burning a hole
in my pocket?

381
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:29,284
A mayday transmission
was heard, but so far there has been

382
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:31,619
no trace
of the "Queen's Gambit."

383
00:21:31,621 --> 00:21:34,506
Among those missing are local residents
Robert and Oliver Queen.

384
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:38,793
Do we have a lead on Dinah?

385
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:41,179
We researched the poison
Nyssa used on Laurel.

386
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:43,064
Luckily for us,
Tibetan pit viper venom

387
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:45,083
is surprisingly
difficult to transport.

388
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:47,853
It starts losing its potency
the moment it leaves the fangs.

389
00:21:47,855 --> 00:21:50,655
Yet another sentence I never
thought I'd actually say out loud.

390
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:52,023
So it was bought locally?

391
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:54,176
Not bought. Stolen.

392
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:55,977
From where?
The zoo.

393
00:21:55,979 --> 00:21:58,330
A local break-in.
The perps didn't steal anything,

394
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:00,866
so the cops chalked it up
to a bunch of kids looking for a thrill.

395
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:03,218
I pulled up the zoo CCTV footage
from the night of the break-in.

396
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,586
I caught a plate.

397
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,538
The car's a rental.

398
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,423
Address
is in the Glades.

399
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:10,208
Sara.
Call your father.

400
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:16,624
Sebastian, I am so sorry.

401
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,675
I have a bad habit
of standing you up.

402
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:21,228
Look, I know you have to pull
your support for my campaign.

403
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,847
Blood is thicker
than politics.

404
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:25,515
And it should be.

405
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:27,484
Well, thank you
for understanding,

406
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:29,319
and I really hope that this
doesn't affect our friendship.

407
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:32,839
It's important to me.
And to me.

408
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:35,025
Can I help you,
alderman?

409
00:22:35,027 --> 00:22:37,244
Oh, I had a meeting
with your son.

410
00:22:37,246 --> 00:22:39,329
I'm sure you can
guess the topic.

411
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:42,399
I hope my decision
to run against you for mayor

412
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:44,368
doesn't affect
your relationship.

413
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,787
Out of respect
for that relationship,

414
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:48,088
can I offer some advice?

415
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,257
Please.
Get out.

416
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:52,843
Now.

417
00:22:52,845 --> 00:22:55,262
The fact that you are
advising me to get out

418
00:22:55,264 --> 00:22:57,631
before I even announce
my candidacy

419
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,800
suggests that you're threatened.

420
00:22:59,802 --> 00:23:02,669
I'm apprehensive about destroying
my friend's mother.

421
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:06,106
I can take care of myself.
Really?

422
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:08,308
During your trial,
you portrayed yourself

423
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,728
as a fragile creature
living under Malcolm Merlyn's thumb.

424
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,113
So which is it?

425
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:15,782
The woman strong enough
to lead this city,

426
00:23:15,784 --> 00:23:19,169
or the one too weak
willed to save it?

427
00:23:19,171 --> 00:23:23,123
The one who should not be
underestimated.

428
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:36,386
So what exactly
is the plan here?

429
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:40,090
We wait. The Arrow
will lead him right to us.

430
00:23:41,642 --> 00:23:43,427
You know,
you never did tell me

431
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:44,895
how you joined up
with the Arrow in the first place.

432
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:46,096
Where did you two
even meet?

433
00:23:46,098 --> 00:23:48,732
Vigilante club.

434
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:50,267
Same old Sara.

435
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:53,854
Well, not exactly
the same.

436
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,940
I loved her, Dad.

437
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:02,496
Are you upset?

438
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:04,998
Honestly, Sara,

439
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,450
to think what
you've been through

440
00:24:06,452 --> 00:24:07,951
these past six years?

441
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:10,587
The pain,
the loneliness...

442
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:14,124
I'm just happy to hear you
had someone that cared for you.

443
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:37,197
What's the matter,
they didn't teach you

444
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:39,366
about right crosses
in assassin school?

445
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:41,985
Where is Nyssa?!
Tell me where my wife is!

446
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,807
What the hell is he saying?
He's praying.

447
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:49,292
No, don't!

448
00:24:49,294 --> 00:24:52,212
Son of a bitch!

449
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:57,217
It's over, Detective.

450
00:24:57,219 --> 00:24:59,920
He's gone.

451
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:12,238
How's Sara
holding up?

452
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,906
Not well.
And I need you

453
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:15,224
to pick up
the trail on Nyssa,

454
00:25:15,226 --> 00:25:16,993
because Mrs. Lance
is running out of time.

455
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:18,778
I'm on it.

456
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,114
Oh, Oliver.

457
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:23,449
Felicity.
Hi, hi.

458
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:26,452
Ohh. Well, I haven't
been this nervous

459
00:25:26,454 --> 00:25:28,237
since my wedding day.

460
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:31,140
Both of them.
Moira, it's time.

461
00:25:31,142 --> 00:25:33,176
Oliver, are you ready to introduce
your mother?

462
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:34,627
With pride.

463
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:43,636
Felicity?

464
00:25:43,638 --> 00:25:45,087
Felicity.

465
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:47,256
What is going on
with you?

466
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:48,474
And don't say--
nothing.

467
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:50,643
Don't say "nothing."

468
00:25:50,645 --> 00:25:54,013
The truth, please.

469
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:57,333
Might have noticed
that I talk a lot.

470
00:25:57,335 --> 00:25:58,918
It has not escaped
my attention.

471
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,970
You might have also noticed
that I don't talk a lot

472
00:26:00,972 --> 00:26:03,623
about my family.
I have noticed that.

473
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:07,026
My mother is...

474
00:26:07,028 --> 00:26:10,213
She's...

475
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:12,165
She's my mother.

476
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,666
And...

477
00:26:13,668 --> 00:26:16,803
I don't really know
what my father is,

478
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:18,504
'cause he abandoned us.

479
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:20,590
I barely remember him.

480
00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:22,341
But I do remember...

481
00:26:22,343 --> 00:26:25,328
How much it hurt
when he left.

482
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,179
And just the thought
of losing someone

483
00:26:28,204 --> 00:26:29,683
that important to me again...

484
00:26:29,684 --> 00:26:31,684
Hey.

485
00:26:31,686 --> 00:26:33,352
You're not going
to lose me.

486
00:26:33,354 --> 00:26:36,189
Whatever it is
that's bothering you...

487
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:39,775
Is it about
your family?

488
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:43,212
No.

489
00:26:43,214 --> 00:26:45,698
It's about yours.

490
00:26:50,053 --> 00:26:51,787
Time's up.

491
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:54,207
Have you made your decision?

492
00:26:57,344 --> 00:27:00,829
Let my mother go.

493
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:03,299
And I will return with you
to Nanda Parbat.

494
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:07,887
You're doing
the right thing, Sara.

495
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:10,273
For both of us.

496
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:22,184
Here you go,
sweetie.

497
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:24,904
Your chamomile,
like you like.

498
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:27,657
Is there anything else
I can get you?

499
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,959
My mother.

500
00:27:31,496 --> 00:27:35,464
Laurel, there's
something I got to tell you.

501
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:40,836
It's about
your sister.

502
00:27:40,838 --> 00:27:43,089
What about her?

503
00:27:52,232 --> 00:27:54,183
Hello?

504
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:55,902
Dad, I found mom.

505
00:27:55,904 --> 00:27:58,187
Meet me at the lower boat
yards in 30 minutes,

506
00:27:58,189 --> 00:27:59,689
and come alone.

507
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:01,357
Don't tell the Arrow.

508
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,891
Copy that.

509
00:28:02,893 --> 00:28:05,444
I got to go.

510
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:07,330
What about Sara, Dad?

511
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:08,948
I'll explain everything
later, all right?

512
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,918
Just sit tight.

513
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:20,343
I say this
with confidence.

514
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:22,678
Because the Moira Queen
that I know is more

515
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,581
than a successful CEO
and philanthropist.

516
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:28,017
She is a loving mother
who has devoted her life

517
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:30,753
to raising
two wonderful children.

518
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:32,772
Just to tell you
how special she is,

519
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:34,590
I'd like to welcome her son.

520
00:28:34,592 --> 00:28:38,394
CEO of Queen Consolidated,
Mr. Oliver Queen.

521
00:28:52,826 --> 00:28:55,378
Phew. Thank you.

522
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,502
Well, I'm here today
to say a few words...

523
00:29:05,422 --> 00:29:08,007
about Moira Queen.

524
00:29:09,977 --> 00:29:12,745
I bet many of you
think that you know her,

525
00:29:12,747 --> 00:29:14,797
because you...

526
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,651
read about her
in the press,

527
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:21,687
or you saw her on TV.

528
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:25,841
But I can promise you...

529
00:29:27,494 --> 00:29:30,579
You don't know my mother.

530
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,705
You don't know her
like I do.

531
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:52,218
And you don't know
what she's capable of...

532
00:29:56,857 --> 00:30:00,309
When it comes to helping

533
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:03,612
the people of Starling City.

534
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:06,198
Ladies and gentlemen...

535
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,034
My mother,

536
00:30:08,036 --> 00:30:09,652
Moira Queen.

537
00:30:11,406 --> 00:30:13,989
I know.

538
00:30:17,077 --> 00:30:20,963
Thank you!

539
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:24,300
Thank you, Starling City.

540
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:25,584
Sara!

541
00:30:25,586 --> 00:30:28,337
The snake venom,
it's gone.

542
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:30,056
She found Nyssa.

543
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:31,540
And she's going
to poison her?

544
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:32,842
We need to stop her
before she does.

545
00:30:32,844 --> 00:30:34,510
Activate her tracer.

546
00:30:34,512 --> 00:30:36,095
You put a tracer on her?

547
00:30:36,097 --> 00:30:37,880
She has a bad habit
of disappearing on me.

548
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:40,266
Oliver, I hate to sound cold,
but why do we care

549
00:30:40,268 --> 00:30:42,735
if Sara kills some bad ass assassin
that wants to get her and her family?

550
00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:45,738
Because, Diggle,
if half of the stories

551
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,008
that I have heard
about Ra's al Ghul are true,

552
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,911
if Sara kills his daughter...

553
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:54,747
We will all pay.

554
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,909
They're coming for you now.

555
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:09,295
Dinah! Move away
from her! Move away!

556
00:31:09,297 --> 00:31:11,597
It's all right,
it's all right.

557
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,599
What's happening?

558
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:18,637
Sara...

559
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:20,055
It's me, Mom.

560
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:21,974
It's me.

561
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:28,214
Oh, my baby!

562
00:31:29,366 --> 00:31:31,117
My baby!

563
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,653
Oh, my baby!

564
00:31:34,655 --> 00:31:38,207
I love you so much, Mom.

565
00:31:38,209 --> 00:31:40,042
I have to go.

566
00:31:40,044 --> 00:31:42,128
What? What
are you doing?

567
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:44,213
Dad, get mom out of here!
What?!

568
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:46,715
We've got to go.
No!

569
00:31:46,717 --> 00:31:49,168
No!

570
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,921
No!

571
00:32:02,232 --> 00:32:04,350
You took the poison.

572
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:07,486
No!

573
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:13,893
No!

574
00:32:13,895 --> 00:32:17,029
No!

575
00:32:19,526 --> 00:32:20,994
I can't go back.

576
00:32:21,855 --> 00:32:23,805
I can't take
the killing anymore.

577
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:26,373
It needs to end.

578
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,825
Sara! Delta Charlie 52,
to Central,

579
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:30,928
need back up at
the lower boat yards.

580
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,296
Ambulance, paramedics...

581
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,167
If you want to be with
your family so badly,

582
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:40,604
they can join you
in eternity.

583
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:45,059
You get the hell away
from my daughter.

584
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,984
Live or die.

585
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:56,287
It's up to you.

586
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:31,405
Sara. I can still save her.

587
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:33,691
Worry more
about saving yourself.

588
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:54,345
Don't kill her.

589
00:33:54,347 --> 00:33:55,930
Please.

590
00:33:55,932 --> 00:33:59,216
Sara...

591
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:04,638
Sara!

592
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,524
Sara, hold on.

593
00:34:07,526 --> 00:34:10,561
Stay with me.
Come on.

594
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,031
Come on, stay.

595
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,569
Not again.

596
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:32,499
No more killing.

597
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:34,084
Nyssa.

598
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:36,220
Please.

599
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,642
Ta-er sah-fer,

600
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:45,679
in the name
of Ra's al Ghul...

601
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:49,149
I release you.

602
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:58,359
Thank God you're ok!

603
00:34:58,361 --> 00:35:00,828
Are you all right?

604
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,247
Oh, I can't believe you.

605
00:35:03,249 --> 00:35:07,835
Look at you.
You're all right, baby.

606
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:10,838
I can't believe it.
Look at you.

607
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,424
You're ok, baby.

608
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:25,693
Because Starling City
is our city.

609
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:29,748
And starting today,
we're going to take it back.

610
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:39,557
I know we need to talk.

611
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:41,058
You need to listen.

612
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:45,179
For the past year,

613
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:48,316
I have stood by your side...

614
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:50,902
And I have fought,

615
00:35:50,904 --> 00:35:54,772
because I wanted to believe
that you weren't this...

616
00:35:56,558 --> 00:35:58,392
Monster.

617
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:02,663
And I needed to believe
that I still had a mother.

618
00:36:02,665 --> 00:36:04,782
You do, Oliver--

619
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:07,635
Oliver, I only lied about Thea
to protect her from Malcolm.

620
00:36:07,637 --> 00:36:11,172
No, you lied
because that is what you do.

621
00:36:11,174 --> 00:36:14,926
And that is who you are, Mom.

622
00:36:14,928 --> 00:36:17,661
Lies.

623
00:36:17,663 --> 00:36:21,682
And now you've made
a liar out of me.

624
00:36:21,684 --> 00:36:25,720
Because Thea could never
find out about Merlyn.

625
00:36:25,722 --> 00:36:29,190
And she could never
know the truth about us.

626
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:34,228
Which is that as of right now,
we have no relationship.

627
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:39,534
I will keep up appearances
for Thea's sake.

628
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:44,288
And publicly, I will
support your campaign.

629
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,707
But privately...

630
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:50,411
You and I are done.

631
00:36:50,413 --> 00:36:52,263
Oliver...

632
00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:53,553
Oliver.

633
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,470
Oliver!

634
00:37:09,815 --> 00:37:12,900
I know you have
a lot of questions.

635
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:15,203
Nope.

636
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:16,904
How could you not
have any questions?

637
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:21,192
Because I already know
all of the answers to them.

638
00:37:21,194 --> 00:37:24,078
How could you still be alive;

639
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,796
where have you been
all this time?

640
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:28,566
Why didn't you call us.

641
00:37:28,568 --> 00:37:32,753
And the answer
to all of them...

642
00:37:32,755 --> 00:37:35,339
Is because it's Sara.

643
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:37,091
Baby, don't do this--

644
00:37:37,093 --> 00:37:39,343
Dad, I swear to God,
if you say one more word.

645
00:37:39,345 --> 00:37:42,096
Laurel, look,
I know you're angry.

646
00:37:42,098 --> 00:37:45,299
And you have
every right to be.

647
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:47,602
But please don't
take this out on dad.

648
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:49,720
If you need someone
to blame, blame me.

649
00:37:49,722 --> 00:37:51,956
Oh, I do blame you, Sara.

650
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:54,308
Every single thing
that's gone wrong in our lives

651
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,861
is your fault.

652
00:37:56,863 --> 00:38:01,148
You got on that stupid boat
with my boyfriend.

653
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,734
You didn't call us to tell us
that you were still alive,

654
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:07,288
even though it probably would
have saved mom and dad's marriage.

655
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:10,541
And you brought some crazy assassin
into Starling City

656
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:14,245
who nearly killed mom
and who poisoned me.

657
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:15,997
You.

658
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:20,001
You stole my whole life
away from me.

659
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:24,972
Now get out.
Laurel...

660
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:27,058
Get out.

661
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:42,023
I'm sorry.

662
00:38:42,025 --> 00:38:43,691
I said get out!

663
00:38:43,693 --> 00:38:46,160
Hold on.

664
00:38:54,453 --> 00:38:56,203
Please, come in.

665
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:04,962
Tell me Oliver is ok!

666
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:07,598
Tell me everything's ok!

667
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,350
I wish I could.

668
00:39:09,352 --> 00:39:12,103
Moira, I'm so sorry about Robert.
About Oliver.

669
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:14,672
I really am.

670
00:39:14,674 --> 00:39:20,094
Yes, um, I need
to tell you both something.

671
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:22,396
What is it?

672
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:30,871
Robert and Oliver
weren't the only ones lost.

673
00:39:30,873 --> 00:39:34,241
Along with the crew,

674
00:39:34,243 --> 00:39:36,210
a friend

675
00:39:36,212 --> 00:39:39,246
invited along by Oliver
at the last minute.

676
00:39:39,248 --> 00:39:41,832
Tommy.
No.

677
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:45,119
It was...

678
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:48,389
It was Sara.

679
00:39:48,391 --> 00:39:50,808
Your Sara.

680
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,844
I'm so sorry, Quentin.

681
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,400
The dock master
saw her sneak on board.

682
00:40:02,854 --> 00:40:04,405
With Moira Queen's
impressive speech

683
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:06,107
earlier today, some pundits

684
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:09,110
are suggesting her candidacy
might not be so far-fetched.

685
00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:11,829
And while Blood's campaign has yet
to issue a public response

686
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:13,364
to Mrs. Queen's announcement...

687
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:16,667
I warned you not
to underestimate Moira Queen.

688
00:40:16,669 --> 00:40:18,536
What do you want me to do?

689
00:40:18,538 --> 00:40:21,372
Thank you!

690
00:40:21,374 --> 00:40:24,291
Thank you, Starling City!

691
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:27,011
Nothing.

692
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,766
I'll take care of it.

693
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:49,033
You've been crying.

694
00:40:49,035 --> 00:40:51,318
Yeah, I was happy
to know I still could.

695
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,254
Are you ok?

696
00:40:53,256 --> 00:40:57,658
Well, Laurel wasn't as thrilled
to see me as you thought.

697
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,544
Give her time.

698
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:04,215
I gave her six years.

699
00:41:06,051 --> 00:41:08,853
What exactly are you
taking out on that dummy?

700
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:13,224
My mother...

701
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:19,430
She's not who
I thought she was.

702
00:41:19,432 --> 00:41:22,566
I guess it's going around.

703
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:26,570
So what now?

704
00:41:26,572 --> 00:41:30,674
I don't know.

705
00:41:30,676 --> 00:41:33,911
I don't, either.

706
00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:37,264
I know one thing.

707
00:41:37,266 --> 00:41:39,594
What's that?

708
00:41:39,595 --> 00:41:42,346
I'm home.

709
00:41:50,523 --> 00:41:55,523
