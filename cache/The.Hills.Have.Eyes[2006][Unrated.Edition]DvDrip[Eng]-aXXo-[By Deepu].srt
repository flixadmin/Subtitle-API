Uh, there's an old fence right in front.

157
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,184
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

158
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,415
Old fence, dirt road,
two miles.

159
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,516
Mm-hmm.
You have a safe trip.

160
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,595
Thank you.

Guys, no.

165
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,068
- Stop!
- [Bob] Imagine the first people
to cross this desert.

166
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,074
They didn't know
where they were.

167
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,339
- [Brenda] Yeah, I can, because neither do we.
- Brenda, the road is here.

168
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:31,007
It exists.
It's got to go somewhere.

169
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:34,381
Besides, look how beautiful it is.
Look at the light on the rocks.

170
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,386
It's gorgeous.

171
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,082
- This is so fucked!
- [Mom] Excuse me?

172
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,319
- Watch your language, young lady.
- [Bob Laughing]

173
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,419
I would like
a little backup here.

174
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,499
- This is such bullshit.
- Hey, watch your fucking mouth!

175
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,161
Can we just calm down here?
We're all a little tired, okay?

176
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:56,105
Yeah, Mom. Didn't you grow up in the '60s?
Why are you so uptight?

177
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,836
Your mom didn't
used to be uptight.

178
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,277
- She was a little hippie chick.
- No.

179
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,849
You should have seen her when she was
your age. She was a little hottie.

180
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,317
- Dad.
- Stop that.

183
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,099
Great vacation.

184
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:27,229
[Bobby] I'm glad you came because
I would have been so fucking bored otherwise.

Oh. Give up on that, man.

188
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,440
I tried for an hour and a half.
Thing's ancient.

189
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,450
Wiring's medieval.
Needs to be replaced.

190
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,214
- There.
- [Air Conditioner Humming]

191
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,452
There.
It's just the, uh, thermostat.

192
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,459
It's disconnected.

193
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,758
Anyway, at least
we can breathe now.

194
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,666
Hey, I thought you quit smoking.

195
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:04,071
- Does my sister know?
- Hey, man.

196
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,337
- Fuck your sister.
- [Chuckles]

197
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,349
You know, uh, Big Bob'd
get pretty pissed off...

198
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,578
if he found out you were smoking
in his newly renovated '88 Airstream.

199
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,586
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

200
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,713
Well, fuck Big Bob too.

201
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,282
Here. Want one?
Go ahead.

202
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,587
Uh-uh.

203
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,166
Your sister would cut my nuts off
if you start smoking.

204
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,828
I think she did that
a long time ago.

205
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,905
- I think you're right.
- [Chuckles]

206
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,904
I think we're somewhere
on this blue road.

207
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,812
[Lynn] Mom, we're not on the blue road
or any other road.

Honey? Where's the baby?

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,214
- She's right here.
- Is she okay?

215
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,284
- She's fine. She's fine.
- What the hell happened?

216
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,945
- The heat must have caused a blowout.
- Are you okay?

217
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,888
- Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just a little scared.

Are you all right, honey? Are you okay?

219
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,997
He's all right.

220
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,328
I knew this wasn't going
to be safe for the baby.

221
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,834
- [Bob] You okay?
- Yeah, we're okay. We're fine.

- No. Nothing.

230
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,840
Ninety-seven percent nationwide coverage,
and we find ourselves in that three percent.

231
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,433
- Yeah.
- Well, your dad wanted to see the desert.

232
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,535
I hope he's enjoying himself.

233
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,048
Doug, don't start.

234
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,812

a rent-a-cop around here.
- Doug!

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,784
- What?
- Come on.

236

Every chance the guy gets, he takes me
down a peg. Can't snap back at him?

It's everybody's fault.

- Get off my back.

General, what's the damage?

241
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,507
The axle is broken,
and it's... totaled.

242
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,077
Can we fix it?

243
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,908
What?
[Chuckles]

244
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,411
No, the frame is twisted to hell.
We can't-

245
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,010
- With what? I mean-
- [Mom] There she is.

246
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,521
Give me your damn cell phone.
I'm gonna call a tow truck.

247
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,683
No signal. I tried.

248
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,729
- Well, we can use the C.B.
- You can try it, but I doubt
you're gonna get anybody.

249
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,857
The freeway's way the hell on the other side
of those hills. You won't get a signal.

250
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,060
So, what are we gonna do?

00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,717
We walk.

- We walk?
- Yep. You and me.

256
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:49,193
We're in the middle of the desert.
We're miles from anywhere.

257
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:53,135
It's either that, or we sit here
and wait for somebody to drive by.

258
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,900
Have you seen anybody drive by
since we got off the freeway?

259
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,942
I haven't seen anyone drive by since
you decided to take the shortcut.

- Honey. Honey, let's go for a walk. Okay?
- Okay.

I'm sure this desert is full of rattlesnakes.
Is that locked?

On the Discovery Channel-
And there's some species...

within like 25 minutes.

how they stack up against this one.

stay locked up, honey.

Hey, Doug. You wanna try?

Oh. Come on, Dougy.
Come here. Just one shot.

It makes you feel kind of powerful.
You might like it.

There's a huge crater out there.
