1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,164
This place is
under new management.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,441
<i>By order of the Peaky Blinders.</i>

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,290
just write down "peace", right,

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,964
between the Jews and the Italians.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,727
And war against the gypsies.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,330
<i>- I love him, Tom.</i>
<i>- I know.</i>

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,570
That's why I'll keep him away
from the old business,

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,165
put him charge of the new.

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,930
<i>Some idiots
at the Marquis of Lorne.</i>

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,647
Tried to stop me and Isaiah
from drinking, but it's all right.

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,000
We fought them off.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,731
The Marquis, eh?

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,251
What do we want with
a 1,000-guinea horse?

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,761
When we make our move
on Sabini's racing pitches,

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,446
<i>a good racehorse is a passport
to the owner's enclosure.</i>

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,041
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,523
<i>I've made arrangements
with men I trust.</i>

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,561
If I should die, then you will die.

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,881
Thanks.

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,080
Would you stop the noise?

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:06,641
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,010
You working tonight?

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,408
Not so much work as pleasure.

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,640
Others are doing my work
for me tonight.

25
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,921
Gentlemen, welcome!

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,161
Welcome!

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,401
Mr Solomon.

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,931
You must be Arthur.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,570
- That is right.
-Arthur!

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,083
- Arthur!
-Pleasure to meet you, sir.

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,844
I've heard so much about you.

32
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,846
Shalom. Let me just say.

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,006
Shalom.

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,446
For luck.

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,805
You understand I'm the commanding
officer on this operation.

36
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,049
You're here purely as an observer.

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,045
Just do your duty.

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,327
Dear Lord,

39
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,325
for what we're about to receive
may the Lord make us truly grateful.

40
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,806
Amen.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,081
Amen.

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,681
Amen.

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,241
Passover started off
way out there in the Far East,

44
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,802
out in the sand, out in the desert,
where me forefathers come from.

45
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,168
You know, the Jews, the brews,
whatever you want to call them.

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,404
It started out
as a little speck on the horizon.

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,521
Arthur, this ain't right.

48
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,285
Billy, don't worry, mate, you know
what I mean? If you want, you can leave.

49
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,961
If you need to go
to the little boys' room, you can leave.

50
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,121
We going to open 'em in a minute.

51
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,322
He's all right, he's all right,
Billy boy.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,447
- Do you want to leave?
-No, you're all right.

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,489
- You want to stay?
-I'll stay.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,525
You stay there, then, treacle.

55
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,526
Okay, so the pharaoh.
Have you heard of him?

56
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,486
He kept my people,
the Jewish people, in slavery,

57
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,006
for thousands and thousands of years.

58
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,491
Persecuted race.

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,724
He did, he persecuted my race.

60
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,962
The killing of the innocent, right?

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,204
<i>Seder, this feast,
that what we is having here.</i>

62
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,651
<i>Seder is basically the day what
when the Jewish angels decided,</i>

63
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,803
<i>you know, that the evil
fucking Egyptians</i>

64
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,689
<i>had pushed their fucking luck!</i>

65
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,921
<i>Right.</i>

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,447
<i>It is part of our tradition
to do with Seder, right,</i>

67
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,327
<i>that in order to make it good
with God to kill a king,</i>

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,482
<i>we have to carry out the Korban Pesach.</i>

69
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,290
- Right.
-That,

70
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,730
is the ritual sacrifice
of the Passover goat.

71
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,162
- It's a goat.
-Yeah, and we're gonna sacrifice it.

72
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,411
<i>Tonight. That's part of the reason
why we have to shut the doors as well.</i>

73
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,442
But this year we thought
we'd give the fucking goat a name.

74
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,530
- You've named it?
-We fucking did, yeah.

75
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,970
- They named the fucking goat.
-The evil fucking Egyptian pharaoh,

76
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,685
-the fucking enemy.
-That's right.

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,603
- You know what we called it?
-What did ya call him?

78
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,727
Tommy Shelby.

79
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,450
- Stay where you are!

80
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,961
You're all fired.

81
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,128
- Fuck you.

82
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,724
- That's right, let's take a load off.

83
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,247
So...

84
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,602
And the evil Egyptian scum...

85
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,809
...was finally cleansed,

86
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,124
with the blood
of the Passover goat, mate.

87
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,490
That's from Sabini.

88
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,723
And tell your gypsy king...

89
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,722
...whoever comes
down south, shall return north

90
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,648
in many fucking pieces. Huh?

91
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,962
This fucking animal. He come in here,
right, with a fucking gun and razor

92
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,963
and he shot him in the face!

93
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,008
And my lads, they restrained him.

94
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,248
Look at him. He's dead. Is he dead?

95
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,211
He's fucking dead!

96
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,528
He wants arresting or something, right?

97
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,284
Surely.

98
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,845
Michael! You can't take him away again,
you can't take my son away!

99
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,369
You come back here! No! No!

100
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,441
Ow!

101
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,564
Don't you fucking touch him!
Get off him!

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,002
Don't say anything!
Tommy will get you out!

103
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,081
Fuck!

104
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,242
I'll be all right...

105
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,487
You should know, that as of this night,
Tommy Shelby is finished.

106
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,764
Mick? This is Thomas Shelby,
he's come to check up on his filly.

107
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,246
Yes, I've heard about you.

108
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,485
Mick is
the best horseman in England.

109
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,122
He likes to waste money, I know that.

110
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,010
According to the reports
I've been given,

111
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,208
you're spending two pound a month
on worming powder.

112
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,085
What? You want a horse with worms?

113
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,129
Horses get worms from the water trough.

114
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,848
Put goldfish in them,
they eat the worm eggs.

115
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,001
Goldfish?

116
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,522
- It'll be a gypsy thing, is it?
-No.

117
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,406
It's an accounting thing.

118
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,324
- Goldfish cost a penny each.
-Or you can win them at the fair.

119
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,483
If you want, I'll dispense
with the vet altogether. Excuse me.

120
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,363
Did you ever consider
a career in diplomacy?

121
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,730
Hello, hello.

122
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,881
How are you, eh?

123
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,361
Goldfish, seriously?

124
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,926
Yup.

125
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,164
You people have a lot to learn.

126
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,722
They asked me if I wanted a fire
in the guest bedroom.

127
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,326
I said no.

128
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,041
Just one fire tonight.

129
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,405
Bold and fearless, eh?

130
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,121
Yes.

131
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,325
Though I'm not really fearless.

132
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,241
- Drink?
-Why not?

133
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,288
- Madam, there is a telephone call.
-I'll take it in the drawing room.

134
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,971
It's for Mr Shelby.

135
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,200
We had a deal.

136
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,646
Hey!

137
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,124
We had a fucking deal.

138
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,322
I would thank you to moderate
your language in a place of worship.

139
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,128
We had a fucking deal.

140
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,566
Mr Shelby.

141
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,724
If you read the papers,

142
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,883
you might have seen that
the Home Secretary has got himself

143
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,965
into a bit of a fizz
about certain moral issues.

144
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,646
Prostitution.

145
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,011
Protection, racketeering, drinking,
cocaine and, of course,

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,411
gambling.

147
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,725
And he's demanded results.

148
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,566
You offered me protection.

149
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,882
You promised me protection.

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,528
Well, no, you see, it was Mr Churchill
that made you that promise.

151
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,282
And the Home Secretary
outranks him, so...

152
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,971
And I can hardly be blamed
if your demented brother

153
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,283
decides to go on some sort
of blood orgy during dinner.

154
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,441
Do not fucking lie to me.

155
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,042
Do not sit here
in your fucking church and lie to me!

156
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,529
You will need to contain your emotions
or this meeting is at an end.

157
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,885
Good.

158
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,005
That's better.

159
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,521
So...

160
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,482
Let us review the new situation.

161
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,723
I have your brother in a prison cell,

162
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,281
charged with the murder
of Billy Kitchen.

163
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,408
The case against him is strong.

164
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,642
And I have no doubt
that his destiny is to hang.

165
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,727
And then there is Polly's son Michael.

166
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,762
He has already admitted to helping
Arthur burn down the Marquis Pub.

167
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,323
Oh, he was
a tough nut to crack, that boy.

168
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,526
But crack he did.

169
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,448
So I have your brother facing the noose.

170
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,091
I have your cousin facing
five years for arson.

171
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,962
And I have
your entire organisation in disarray

172
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,764
in Birmingham and in London.

173
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,001
What do you want?

174
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,686
What do I want?

175
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,280
I don't understand.

176
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,280
I've already agreed

177
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,642
to do your fucking killing for you.

178
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,248
Now what is it you want from me?

179
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,843
Oh. There you go, you see...

180
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,489
An agreement is not the same thing
as an assurance, now, is it?

181
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,281
See, I found that

182
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,083
I wasn't sleeping so well.

183
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,240
And it wasn’t just that...

184
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,171
...the smell and the noise
in that room, no.

185
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,448
It was the nagging doubt.
The knowledge.

186
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,765
The knowledge that...

187
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,325
Tommy Shelby is not afraid to die.

188
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,164
And therefore,

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,844
the threat to your own life
might not be enough

190
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,082
to make it certain that
you will obey me on the given day.

191
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,729
I needed also the power
of life and death over your family

192
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,446
and that I now have.

193
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,766
Your brother, your cousin
and your sister.

194
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:37,083
I've known her address in Primrose Hill
since the day she moved in.

195
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,602
Now she is safe only as long
as I want her to be.

196
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,089
I've been ahead of you,
every step of the way.

197
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,604
And, as my father used to say,

198
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,566
to make sure your dog obeys you,
you have to show it the stick

199
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,804
once in a while.

200
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,489
Tommy, Arthur's in solitary confinement.
Michael's in remand wing...

201
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,166
Yeah, I already know.
Get out, shut the doors.

202
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,241
<i>Tommy?</i>

203
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,161
<i>It's me.</i>

204
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,801
Tommy, can you hear me?

205
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,321
Yes, Grace.

206
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,890
I think you called.

207
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,846
I haven't slept.

208
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,483
Grace, this is not a good time.

209
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,406
<i>I can call you back.</i>

210
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,602
- No, no, it's fine. It's all right.
-Can we meet?

211
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,642
Yes, we'll meet.

212
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,646
When?

213
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,607
Grace, there are some things
I have to do first.

214
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,440
John?

215
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,961
Coppers have lifted
10 of our men in Camden town,

216
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,205
the rest of them on the run.

217
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,283
- Tom, they've taken Michael.
-Business first.

218
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,330
- They took Michael last night.
-Polly, business first!

219
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,681
John?

220
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,680
They took all our whisky.

221
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,443
So no doubt
they'll be supping that for Christmas.

222
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,449
They've impounded all our vans,

223
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,324
put their own locks on the warehouse.

224
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,681
The Eden Club and all our pubs
have been raided by the coppers

225
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,641
and handed back to Sabini and Solomons.

226
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,241
The Black Country boys think
it was Arthur who killed Billy

227
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,163
because that's what
the coppers told them.

228
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,406
So there'll be no more free passes
for our whisky boats.

229
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,084
I don't give a fuck about whisky.

230
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,969
I don't give a fuck about Billy Kitchen.

231
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,369
I want my son out of prison now.

232
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,805
Thomas, I spoke to Johnny Dogs.

233
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,644
This meeting should just be family.

234
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,643
- I can help.
-It's family only, she's not blood.

235
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,722
- Let her speak.
-Tommy! Or is this a business...

236
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,847
Enough!

237
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,724
Enough, Polly.

238
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,600
Esme.

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,128
I spoke to Johnny Dogs.
The Lees are kin.

240
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,362
- The bloody Lees!
-They can give us men.

241
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,249
We don't need more fucking men.

242
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,769
It's men that have done
the damage. It's...

243
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,406
It is men fighting like cockerels that
have put us here in the first place.

244
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,120
Esme, I'll take up their offer.
We need men.

245
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,681
If Michael ever gets out of prison,

246
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,001
I am taking him away
from this family, for good.

247
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,008
This life is bad.

248
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,082
This life is all bad.

249
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,681
- Aunt Pol, what are you doing?
-Shut up and walk.

250
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,085
Thomas.

251
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,201
Should I go and speak
to Queen Mary Lee at the Black Patch?

252
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,646
Yes.

253
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,209
She can give us soldiers
for a few nights.

254
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,566
Mmm, good.

255
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,091
John, go bring up the car.

256
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,489
Imagine riding away, Thomas.

257
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,923
Living the real life, you know?

258
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,089
Your gypsy half is the stronger.

259
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,764
You just want to ride away.

260
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,882
France is the new place
for us, they say.

261
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,408
Lot of metal lying around still.

262
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,487
Guns and trucks
and spent shells and things.

263
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,406
Then you go south.

264
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,006
Saintes Maries.

265
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,605
Where the Black Madonna is.

266
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,089
My brothers go sometimes for the fair.

267
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,851
It's like a home for us.

268
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,208
They still let you get lost there.

269
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,003
I've been to France, Esme.

270
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,371
So has John.

271
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,807
Now get your coat
and go with your husband.

272
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,129
If you ever talk about getting
lost again, I'll cut you

273
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,290
from this family.

274
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,565
What family?

275
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,210
- Come in.

276
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,841
Ah. Polly.

277
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,650
I've come to see my son.

278
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,531
Close the door.

279
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,928
I've just been conducting
an interrogation.

280
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,203
It can be awfully hard on the hands.

281
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,242
My son. Michael. Where is he?

282
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,610
Do you think I need a shave?

283
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,490
It's been a long day.

284
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,810
I need a shave, don't you think?

285
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,602
Well, maybe it can wait till later.

286
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,046
Your son has been having
a hard time of it I'm told.

287
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,160
And that is why I thought
that you and I together,

288
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,483
we should do whatever we can
to get him freed.

289
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,764
Now, I have a form here, a release form.

290
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,325
With my signature,

291
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,761
he can be freed
by tomorrow morning at dawn.

292
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,326
So sign it.

293
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,642
- He didn't do anything.
-"Sign it,

294
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,730
"Mr Campbell. Please, sir."

295
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,691
Something like that. That would be
a way to say that, wouldn't it?

296
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,081
Now,

297
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,206
what would prompt me
to do you such a favour, hmm?

298
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,291
What do you want?

299
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,321
Information?

300
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,241
You mean inside information about
Tommy Shelby's criminal empire?

301
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,531
With respect,

302
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,210
I would say I know more
about Tommy's dealings than you do.

303
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,122
He doesn't trouble the family with
Irish business for instance, does he?

304
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,407
No.

305
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,691
So, no.

306
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,487
It's not information I need.

307
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,488
What else could you give me

308
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,163
in return for my signature?

309
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,520
I'm talking about
a simple transaction here.

310
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,769
I have a great curiosity.

311
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,484
Like a magpie sees something,

312
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,763
something shining in the mud.

313
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,127
Oh, he has no need for the silver,

314
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,650
but he takes it anyway.

315
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,805
Sign the form.

316
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,364
-"Please, sir."
-Please, sir.

317
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,969
I will sign that form with this hand

318
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,449
when I am finished.

319
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,804
- It's a deal?
-It's a deal.

320
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,650
- Don't cry.
-Oh, I can cry.

321
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,766
So...

322
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,929
That is what I want.

323
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,328
I need you to cry.

324
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,565
I will try.

325
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,530
"I need a favour, Mr Campbell, sir.

326
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,930
"And I will do anything,
anything in return."

327
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,287
That's what you might have said. Hmm?

328
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,164
I felt something

329
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,008
when I had you up against that car.

330
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,964
And you felt it too.

331
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,331
Don't tell me you didn't,
Polly, because...

332
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,685
Oh, and now you think you're...

333
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,803
You're so respectable,

334
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,846
with your son and your house

335
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,161
and your maid, but I know
what you are, gypsy Fenian slut.

336
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,691
Do you want to do it on the floor
or on the desk, Mr Campbell?

337
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,729
Now you cry.

338
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,650
You cry!

339
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,767
Get out.
Get out.

340
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,091
Get out!

341
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,564
No. No! I want him free.

342
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,405
I'll get him free.

343
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,005
You don't need to shave.

344
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,844
You don't need to do anything.

345
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,281
A victory is just doing nothing as well.

346
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,364
Doing it soft and gentle.

347
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,482
Should I talk or not talk?

348
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,450
Should it be like
I'm weak and small, yes?

349
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,843
Do you want me to talk or not to talk?

350
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,726
Talk.

351
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,770
You're small and weak.

352
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,966
That's what I am...

353
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,044
Small and weak.

354
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,811
Look.

355
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,603
You made me cry.

356
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,247
No!

357
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,883
We had an agreement, right?

358
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,924
Yes. Yes!

359
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,006
Where have you been?

360
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,202
Went to the Spotted Dog in Digbeth.

361
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,440
A glass or two of rum.

362
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,205
Was it one glass or two?

363
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,040
It was three.

364
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,846
Where's the baby?

365
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,566
Sleeping.

366
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,531
More like five.

367
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,529
It was more like six.

368
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,365
Did you meet the maid?

369
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,885
Talked politics with her and
she got bored and went to bed.

370
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,971
I phoned James.

371
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,244
He talked to the lawyer anyway.

372
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,802
Said he'd take Arthur's case for free,

373
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,570
so we don't need Tommy.

374
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,561
Pol?

375
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,007
We'll get Michael free
as well, I promise.

376
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,728
There's no need,
they'll let him out in the morning.

377
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,126
If the baby wants anything at night,
ring the bell by the bed.

378
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,444
She gets paid to work 24 hours,
that girl. She's getting lazy.

379
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,805
Well...

380
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,804
Take advantage if you're nice.

381
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,728
You need cream on them cuts
or they'll go bad.

382
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,330
The screws told me why I've been freed.

383
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,131
They told me what you did.

384
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,651
They thought it was funny.

385
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,361
Maybe it is.

386
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,849
What are you doing, Tommy?

387
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,162
Shovelling shit, Curly.

388
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,725
Just like you.

389
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,571
Why're you doing that, Tommy?

390
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,689
To remind meself what I'd be

391
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,524
if I wasn't who I am.

392
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,127
Tommy. What's going on?

393
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,851
I think Tommy's lost his mind, Charlie.

394
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,083
Well, it's honest work, Curly.

395
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,448
But I don't want to get used to it.

396
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,000
So I'll need six cans of petrol.

397
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,683
Bring them to the garage.

398
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,442
Put them in the back of the car.

399
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,370
Six cans?

400
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,681
Tommy.

401
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,726
If you ever want a job,
I'll get you your own shovel.

402
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,245
Petrol. Yes. Yeah.

403
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,686
You're far too gorgeous
for some half-blind auntie.

404
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,644
She's my harshest critic.

405
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,410
I have to be perfect.

406
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,922
She's not half-blind,
she's half-deaf.

407
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,083
So what time will you be back?

408
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,526
Before midnight.

409
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,685
I'll be awake.

410
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,251
Is this your house?

411
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,481
Yes.

412
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,485
Have a seat.

413
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,124
Do I not get a drink?

414
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,046
Please.

415
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,122
- You want one?
-Yes.

416
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,521
Still whisky?

417
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,126
Yes.

418
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,809
But other things have changed.

419
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,609
I saw vans with your name on
at the docks.

420
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,205
Yes, some things have changed.

421
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,124
Tommy, I really wasn't sure
about coming tonight.

422
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,248
I lit a fire in the bedroom upstairs.

423
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,325
My plan was

424
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,129
that we'd sit here for a while,

425
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,484
talk about old times,

426
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,925
drink some whisky.

427
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,969
And I was gonna tell you

428
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,606
I hadn't spent a day

429
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,966
without thinking about you.

430
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,530
And then we were gonna go upstairs

431
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,045
and sleep together.

432
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,684
But just now on the way
to opening the door,

433
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,531
I changed me mind.

434
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,570
So just have one drink

435
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,130
tell me how happy you are in New York

436
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,611
and then you can go.

437
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,523
- You changed your mind?
-Mmm.

438
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,721
So you can go.

439
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,131
Well...

440
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,401
As a matter of fact,

441
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,845
I am happy in New York.

442
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,801
And I am married.

443
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,609
Oh, yeah, he's... He's rich. I know.

444
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,966
And he's sweet.

445
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,084
And he's kind to me.

446
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,688
So what makes you think that
I would have gone to bed with you

447
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,366
after one whisky and some conversation?

448
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,124
I was accounting for three whiskys.

449
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,565
How dare you?

450
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,889
It doesn't matter now,
'cause I've changed me mind.

451
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,201
I came here because you asked me.

452
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,449
Even though he's sweet
and he's kind to you?

453
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,965
And now I feel like an idiot.

454
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,371
Well, then, go.

455
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,646
Jesus.

456
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,924
Well, you're still here.

457
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,241
Are you so certain?

458
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,689
That you're still in love with me?

459
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,686
I was.

460
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,006
But I'm not any more.

461
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,884
You're not armed, Grace, are you?

462
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,805
No, I'm not armed.

463
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,324
I don't carry guns.
I don't have to.

464
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,687
You don't have a sense of humour
any more, either.

465
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,450
What are you talking about?

466
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,683
The thing is, I hate reunions.

467
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,602
I didn't want to sit here
for hours talking about nothing

468
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,490
and dancing around
what we really want to say.

469
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,845
So now,

470
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,081
I know you're happy in New York.

471
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,322
I know your husband's rich
and sweet and kind to you.

472
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,402
I know you're unarmed.

473
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,442
And you didn't come here for sex
because you don't love me any more.

474
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,724
And it's only three minutes past.

475
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,371
Another drink?

476
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,484
I'll take that as a yes.

477
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,760
It's good to see you, Grace.

478
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,889
So you didn't light the fire?

479
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,924
You see, my real plan

480
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,884
was that we go out.

481
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,170
I want to impress you.

482
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,360
Now,

483
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,804
do you like Charlie Chaplin?

484
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,971
Yes, I like Charlie Chaplin.

485
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,521
Good.

486
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,047
I bet you've never heard
Charlie Chaplin speak.

487
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,570
I thought you were taking me
to see Charlie Chaplin.

488
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,687
I am.

489
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,650
- This isn't a picture house.
-No, it's not a picture house.

490
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,769
So how will
I see Charlie Chaplin?

491
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,850
You will see him and you will hear him,
just like I promised.

492
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,724
There you go. There's Chaplin.

493
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,404
- Oh, my God. That's him.
-Mmm-hmm.

494
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,005
That's really Charlie Chaplin in person.

495
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,129
Yep. He's in England
promoting his film.

496
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,690
And how the hell
do you know Charlie Chaplin?

497
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,570
I don't.
I know his bodyguard, Wag McDonald.

498
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,844
It's that chap there.

499
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,725
Wag was a bookie in Birmingham,
then he went to Los Angeles.

500
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,368
You see, Wag is also Romani gypsy,

501
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,647
as is Chaplin, but he keeps it a secret.

502
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,483
Chaplin was born on the Black Patch,
a gypsy camp in Birmingham.

503
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,363
That's why he gave Wag the job,
even though Wag was on the run.

504
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,726
Thank you.

505
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,446
Thank you.
See, we all have our secrets, Grace.

506
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,522
Come on. I'll introduce you.

507
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,923
Hello, Wag.
Mr Chaplin, this is Grace.

508
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,562
Hello, Mr Chaplin.

509
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,561
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, Mr Campbell.</i>

510
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,162
<i>Uh, you said you knew
my sister's address in Primrose Hill,</i>

511
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,688
<i>so I expect you have men
watching the house,</i>

512
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,364
<i>see who comes and goes.</i>

513
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,800
Well, tonight your men
will see me return to the house

514
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,484
with a very beautiful woman.

515
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,646
She will stay
until just before midnight.

516
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,287
Of course, I'll close the curtains.

517
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,046
Can you guess who the woman is?

518
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,487
Liar!

519
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,284
Sleep well, Mr Campbell.

520
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,810
Tommy.

521
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,209
Tommy, do you have someone?

522
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,124
It's too late, Tommy.

523
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,685
It's 11:00, Grace.

524
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,444
I mean, it's too late.

525
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,569
If you'd come with me to New York...

526
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,164
I have things to do.

527
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,967
You mean the coin landed the wrong way?

528
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,289
It couldn't have worked.

529
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,524
That was a question.

530
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,881
Hey.

531
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,402
Tommy, do you have someone?

532
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,410
I have a racehorse.

533
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,921
She's gonna win the derby.

534
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,287
I'll drive you.

535
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,525
When do you sail back?

536
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,691
We don't know yet.

537
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,009
You don't have a return ticket?

538
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,044
This wasn't right, Tommy.

539
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,403
When do you go back, Grace?

540
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,364
They're doing tests on us.

541
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,688
I don't know when they'll be finished.

542
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,850
We're having treatment.

543
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,689
A doctor on Harley Street.

544
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,563
Some new thing, a breakthrough.

545
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,809
We're trying for a baby.

546
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,562
Why did you come here tonight?

547
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,645
The doctor believes
it's surely me who's at fault.

548
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,721
I'm sorry.

549
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,641
It's no one's fault.

550
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,848
I'm tired of that, Tommy.

551
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,845
Can I see you again?

552
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,560
Grace.

553
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,087
You're used to working undercover, eh?

554
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,442
I've never lied to him once.

555
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,044
So tell him the truth.

556
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,725
Put your arms up.

557
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,168
Oh, what've we got here then?

558
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,325
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

559
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,771
Oh, here he is.

560
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,843
The King of London Town.

561
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,046
You been enjoying yourself?

562
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,565
Oh, yeah, it's fucking great.

563
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,722
Surrounded by Sabini's men.

564
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,445
Rats everywhere.

565
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,850
Fucking cockneys.

566
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,162
Well, at least you're going
to get what you've always wanted.

567
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,761
And what's that?

568
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,002
Well, you tried to hang yourself twice.

569
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,684
Now the King is gonna do it for you.

570
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,247
- I've been a fuckin' idiot.
-Yeah.

571
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,929
I haven't appreciated nothing, John.

572
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,490
Are you fucking repenting or something?

573
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,925
Drawing.

574
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,841
I used to be good at drawing.

575
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,491
Arthur, please, for God's sake,
I don't need this.

576
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,289
I should have listened more in class.

577
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,806
What fucking class?
You were never there.

578
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,963
I used to draw horses.

579
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,482
- Arthur...
-Stallions.

580
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,410
- Great big ones.
-Arthur.

581
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,966
- They looked real.
-Not stallions. Not now.

582
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,326
I should have done more
with me life, John.

583
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,649
- Good things.
-Arthur, for God's sake...

584
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,960
Even Ada said it wasn't my fault.

585
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,371
Arthur, will you listen?

586
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,250
- They're gonna hang me, John.
-They're not gonna hang you.

587
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,651
Says who?

588
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,925
Tommy.

589
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,006
And how is Houdini
gonna get me out of this?

590
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,971
- Well, we...
-Don't tell me. He's got a plan.

591
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,609
But you don't know
what that plan is, do you, John?

592
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,761
I do...

593
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,569
'Cause we just can't be trusted.

594
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,406
All right.

595
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,371
If he's so fucking clever,
why am I in here?

596
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,566
Well, it's...

597
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,450
Why is all our men
and half our whisky been lifted?

598
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,966
Hmm?

599
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,168
The Jew and the cockney
have run rings round him.

600
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,969
- Will you shut up?
-Look at you. Look.

601
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,089
- A big fucking man...
-Fucking shut up!

602
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,762
He's already told me
what I've got to do.

603
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,682
What business have you got here?

604
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,205
I just pulled over.

605
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,681
I never smoke and drive, you know?

606
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,842
- Where are you from?
-I'm from Ireland,

607
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,807
the beautiful north
where the rocks sing in the wind.

608
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,484
Yeah, in the beautiful north.

609
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,286
You know,
I've just pulled over for a fag.

610
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,169
I want to see some identification!

611
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,841
Hey!

612
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,401
Look.

613
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,007
Come!

614
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,727
See?

615
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,049
Does it really stop the horses
from getting worms?

616
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,403
Yep. It really does.

617
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,361
Anyway, I thought
it would make you smile.

618
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,805
I'm sorry that you had
to drive through the night.

619
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,645
You must be exhausted.
You can go and sleep if you want.

620
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,921
May.

621
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,570
We have to stop.

622
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,361
This.

623
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,167
I came here
to tell you we have to stop.

624
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,721
Why?

625
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:14,002
Because I'm me and you're you,
that old thing?

626
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,406
There's someone.

627
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,210
For a long time.

628
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,049
And I didn't want you to think
anything about how

629
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,202
it's gonna be after the race.

630
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,805
Not many of your people know about me,

631
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,611
so I haven't done
the damage that would come.

632
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,926
"My people?"

633
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,649
Well, the damage isn't done,

634
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,211
is what I mean.

635
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,725
- Right.
-It's...

636
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,044
Even if it's like this,
I want the horse to stay here.

637
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,084
To stay? Yes, of course.

638
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,366
Epsom is close.

639
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,807
I haven't got my outfit yet
so it's all right.

640
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,088
You can still be
with me at the enclosure.

641
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,685
That's very gracious of you, sir.

642
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,681
You can wear something.

643
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,801
It's funny, isn't it?

644
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,645
Because you'll be up there
and I'll be down in the ring.

645
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,449
Sort of upside down, isn't it?

646
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,245
You can still be with me after
and you can still wear something.

647
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,209
I'll be covered in mud from the ring.

648
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,328
May, forget about men like me.

649
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,164
I was going to tell you
how much he's improved.

650
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,440
There are other men, May.

651
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,410
I think she stands
a chance of placing, so...

652
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,761
That's the silly part
of our business done.

653
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,922
Are you going to drive
straight off to Birmingham? Or...

654
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,168
And what if I said, uh,

655
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,330
"All right, I'll stay,"
after what I just said?

656
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,603
Then that would be all right.

657
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,009
You talk about damage.

658
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,406
The damage not yet done.

659
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,720
You don't think that half
of London already thinks

660
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,131
that I'm fucking a racketeer?

661
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,490
Laughing about it. Laying on bets
about when you'll steal the silver.

662
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,931
You think your people are ruthless?
Try mine.

663
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,201
So that's why you carry on, eh?

664
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,723
Because you can't back down.

665
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,370
Amongst many other illogical reasons.

666
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,409
So will you drive straight off or...

667
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,131
I haven't got any petrol in the garage.

668
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,048
Yeah. I have some cans
of petrol in the car.

669
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,849
Good. So you can go.

670
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,530
They look happy in there, eh?

671
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,960
And why wouldn't they be?

672
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,805
Who is she?

673
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,008
Someone who's sailing away.

674
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,651
So let her sail.

675
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,765
You've told me about her
like a gentleman.

676
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,763
Now kindly behave like a gangster again.

677
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,202
Feel sorry for me. It's fine.

678
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,922
Because your horse
will come fifth or sixth.

679
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,530
But I will win you.

680
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,685
Mr Shelby’s just parking his car.
He said for you to wait in here.

681
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,403
Isn't this impressive?

682
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,165
And what is it you exactly do here?

683
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,849
I exactly am a secretary to Mr Shelby.

684
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,207
A secretary? My, my, my.

685
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,085
All that paperwork.

686
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,846
Do you want tea?

687
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,521
No.

688
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,801
I keep everything locked up,
Mr Campbell.

689
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,445
Everything of value.

690
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,524
Take a seat.

691
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,771
How is your company treasurer, Polly?

692
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,045
- Why do you ask?
-Oh, just give her my regards.

693
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,445
You like to play with fire,

694
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,445
don't you, Mr Shelby?

695
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,885
Yesterday in Belgravia,

696
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,890
Field Marshal Russell's
house was burnt out.

697
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,531
An incendiary device was
put through his letterbox,

698
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,886
which means

699
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,811
that he will have to find
somewhere else to live

700
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,764
for at least the next three months.

701
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,486
Hmm.

702
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,806
Which also means that your plan,

703
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,803
for me to break in
and shoot him in his bed,

704
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,121
is now no longer
an operational possibility.

705
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,486
Indeed.

706
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,731
But if you think a wee burn
frees you from your obligations,

707
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,849
-think again.
-I will keep my side of the bargain.

708
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,127
Oh, by God, you will.

709
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,645
I will shoot your field marshal,

710
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,326
but I will do it in a way
that serves my purpose.

711
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,323
The only purpose is my purpose.

712
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,449
I will carry out your assassination
at a place of my choosing.

713
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,091
Listen to me.

714
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,009
All operational detail
must be mutually agreed.

715
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,811
I'm a soldier. I've experience.
I will determine where and when he...

716
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,282
Now that man has 24-hour
armed police protection...

717
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,124
Your plan was full of holes.

718
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,804
My plan was mutually agreed!

719
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,769
Well, now your plan is up in smoke.

720
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,886
And I have formulated
the only viable alternative.

721
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,164
Oh, for God's sake, what do you mean?

722
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,444
How would you get to him?

723
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,207
I won't.
He will come to me.

724
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,723
Now, listen to me, Mr Shelby.

725
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,969
When this meeting is concluded,

726
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,442
I must report directly
to Mr Winston Churchill.

727
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,522
Your relationship with Mr Churchill
is not my concern.

728
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,525
And Mr Winston Churchill
will need to hear detail.

729
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,207
Well, you tell him
he'll have to trust me.

730
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,767
Look, Mr Campbell.

731
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,322
I will carry out my mission.

732
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,001
- Good.
-Good.

733
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,601
But I will do it in a place
where it will be impossible

734
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,810
for you or your men
to have me shot afterwards.

735
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,484
Because that was the plan.

736
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,161
Eh?

737
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,727
Coppers front and back. No way out.

738
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,968
Me shot dead, dumped in the Thames.

739
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,885
I will do the killing,

740
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,601
but at a place
where that will not be an option.

741
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,761
I've recently become
a racehorse owner, Mr Campbell.

742
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,806
It's, uh...

743
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,047
Well, perhaps you can guess
which one is my horse.

744
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,169
Where and when?

745
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,806
Epsom.

746
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,001
Derby Day.

747
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:46,901
