00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,904
<i>...and the night reeks of fornication
and bad consciences.</i>

159
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,936
Huh.

160
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:06,614
<i>Tonight, a comedian died in New York.</i>

161
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,157
<i>Somebody knows why.</i>

162
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,701
Somebody knows.

163
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,501
No, I definitely heard something.

164
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,131
Watch the door.

165
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,991
Shh.

166
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,411
Must've been the wind. Next time you--

167
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:13,181
It all started with the gangs.
You know, people tend to forget that.

168
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,934
Pirate outfits, ghosts.

169
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,729
They thought it was funny:
dress up and pull heists.

170
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,108
As soon as we'd arrest them,
they'd be back on the street.

171
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:28,112
Nobody could pick them out of a lineup
because of the damn masks.

172
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,573
So a few of us cops, we get together...

173
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,076
...and we figure, what the heck,
we'll mask up, too.

174
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,954
We'll finish what the law couldn't.

175
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:41,792
Pretty soon, the papers get wind of it.
They ran with it...

176
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,630
...and oh, boy, we're a national pastime.

177
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:49,300
It was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman...

178
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,845
...Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice...

179
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,224
...Silk Spectre and the Comedian.

180
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,936
Oh, don't get me started on him.

181
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:06,108
I must be drunk already,
telling you this sob story again.

182
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,152
I think you were trying to make a point.

183
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:15,243
Well, my point is that we had it too easy.
It wasn't fair what happened to you guys--

184
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,539
You guys who picked up where we left off.
--with Nixon forcing you out.

185
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:25,044
Nixon, oh, that prick. To think I voted
for that prick five times.

186
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,964
Hey, it was him or the commies, right'?

187
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,554
Oh, wow, it's almost midnight.
Gotta go.

188
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,723
Truth?

189
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,144
You were a better Nite Owl
than I ever was, Danny boy.

190
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:46,023
-Hollis, we both know that's bullshit.
-Hey.

191
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,483
Watch it with the language.

192
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,278
This is the left hook
that floored Captain Axis, remember?

193
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,821
-Yeah.
-<i>This just in:</i>

194
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,906
<i>The masked vigilante
known as Rorschach...</i>

195
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,909
<i>...has assaulted a police officer
in the early-morning hours.</i>

196
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,788
<i>Rorschach is on the FBI's
Ten Most Wanted list...</i>

197
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,750
<i>...for violation of the Keene Act,
which banned masked heroes six years ago.</i>

198
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,169
<i>Rorschach reportedly incapacitated...</i>

199
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,131
Forced everyone out except him.

200
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,841
Oh, he'll quit.

201
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,342
When he's dead.

202
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:16,053
-Next week?
-Well...

203
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,850
...you know, you don't have to
keep humoring me like this.

204
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,185
If you got a hot date or something...

205
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,147
Hey, us retired guys
have to stick together, right?

206
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,775
You ever miss it?

207
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,070
No. You?

208
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,448
Oh, heck, no.

209
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,534
Be seeing you.

210
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,609
Hello, Daniel.

211
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,444
Rorschach.

212
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,783
Helped myself to some beans.
Hope you don't mind.

213
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,411
No, no. Course not.

214
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,581
You want me to heat those up for you?

215
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,291
Fine like this.

216
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,044
How have you been keeping?

217
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,217
Out of prison.

218
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,138
Heard about you on the news.

219
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,974
Say you attacked a cop.

220
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,935
Minor wound.
Won't need hospitalization.

221
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:29,979
Daniel...

222
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,439
...look at this.

223
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,822
-Is this bean juice?
-Human bean juice.

224
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:45,035
Badge belonged to the Comedian.
Blood too. He's dead.

225
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,497
Let's talk downstairs.

226
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,175
It could have been a burglary.

227
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,052
Maybe the killer didn't know
who the Comedian was.

228
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:06,974
An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.

229
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,979
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77...

230
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:15,316
...knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

231
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,402
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

232
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,862
Maybe.

233
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:23,282
Maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

234
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,534
You don't think that's a little paranoid?

235
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,287
That what they say about me now?

236
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,789
Paranoid?

237
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,792
Look, Comedian made
a lot of enemies over the years...

238
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,460
...even among his friends.

239
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,796
Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

240
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:41,634
He wrote that book. Said some bad things
about the Comedian in it.

241
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:45,888
I don't like what you're implying,
and I like being followed even less.

242
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,893
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someone's gunning for masks.

243
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,731
-You were never that sentimental.
-Attack on one is attack on all of us.

244
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,567
What do you suggest we do about it?

245
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,653
Retribution.

246
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,366
-Watchmen are over.
-Says Tricky Dick.

247
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,284
Says me.

248
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,539
Nobody knows who you are.

249
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,667
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

250
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,754
That what you have now?
A normal life?

251
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,092
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies...

252
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,760
...past the human cockroaches...

253
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,680
...talking about their heroin
and child pornography...

254
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,390
...do you really feel normal?

255
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,269
Least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

256
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,438
No.

257
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,234
You're hiding in plain sight.

258
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,779
Be seeing you, Dan.

259
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,740
A maintenance hatch
will let you out two blocks north.

260
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,617
Yeah, I remember.

261
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,872
Came here often,
when we were partners.

262
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,957
Those were great times, huh,
Rorschach?

263
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,669
-What happened?
-You quit.

264
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,319
<i>Rorschach's journal.</i>

265
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,821
<i>First visit of evening fruitless.</i>

266
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,115
<i>Feel slightly depressed.</i>

<i>Soon there will be war.</i>

<i>Millions will perish
in sickness and misery.</i>

269
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,999
<i>Why does one death matter
against so many?</i>

270
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:42,504
<i>Because there is good and evil,
and evil must be punished.</i>

271
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,507
<i>Even in the face of armageddon...</i>

272

273
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,556
<i>But there are so many

274
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,017
<i>...and so little time.</i>

275
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,219
Captain.

276
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,846
-Captain.
-Ridley.

277
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,016
Ridley, have you seen
any other survivors?

278
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,226
No, sir.

279
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:41,855
Captain, my foot is caught
in some of the wreckage.

280
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,401
-It's pulling me under.
-Hold on.

281
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,571
Ridley.

282
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,127
Ridley. Ridley.

283
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,087
No.

284
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,755
No.

<i>More blood, more blood, more blood.</i>

286

<i>Delirious from nearly drowning, I saw it.</i>

287
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,597
<i>The</i> Black Freighter.

288
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:21,186
<i>The hell-bound ship's black sails

289
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:27,693

290
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,614
<i>More blood, more blood, more blood.</i>

291

292

<i>...his mercy and his judgment.</i>

296
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,979
Heh. What do you think, kid?

297
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:07,274
We ought to nuke Russia
and let God sort it out.

298
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,486
Or at the very least,
send Dr. Manhattan over for a visit.

299
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,154
You know what I'm saying?

300
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,240
I mean, I ain't trying to be an asshole
or anything, but they're the ones...

301
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,910
...who are agitating us.
Now this is just my opinion.

302
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,497
But I'm a news vendor, you know,
so I am informed.

303
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,667
Yeah, I know. The <i>New Frontiersman.</i>
Well, it's not here yet.

304
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,669
I'd appreciate if you didn't
stand around waiting...

305
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,339
...because I don't know when
it's going to be here.

306
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,508
I thought you said you was informed.

307
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,638
-Are you gonna buy that?
-No.

308
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:43,352
Oh, Jesus.
Just try again tomorrow, okay?

309
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,822
Mr. Veidt...

310
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,116
...to date,
you're one of only two Watchmen...

311

...ever to reveal their true identity

...the first being Hollis Mason.

313
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,873
And you've certainly profited greatly
by it...

314
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,295
...turning your superhero alter ego,
Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:

315
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,549
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

316
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,759
I understand there's a movie
in the works.

317
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:20,139
-I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth.
-I'm sorry. Do you think--

318
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,891
The Watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

319
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,769
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind...

320
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,981
...some of my old colleagues
might see it that way...

321
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,151
...just as you're clearly aware
that biased journalism...

322
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,903
...sells more magazines.

323
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:40,200
The merchandising arm of Veidt Industries
is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.

324
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,287
We recently expanded our research facility
in Antarctica...

325
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,707
...in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy...

326
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,877
...that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

327
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,462
Now, it doesn't take
a political scientist...

328
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:56,049
...to see that our Cold War
with the Russians isn't ideological...

329
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,720
...it's based upon fear.
Fear of not having enough.

330
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,765
But if we make resources infinite...

331
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,059
...ah...

332
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,312
...we make war obsolete.

333
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:12,983
I would hope the other Watchmen
understand that...

334
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,861
...wherever they may be.

335
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,323
Thanks for your time.

336
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,248
-You look good, Adrian.
-Dan.

337
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,626
It's been too long.

338
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:36,465
So Rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?

339
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,967
You think it's possible?

340
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,887
Statistically, one murder
doesn't equal a trend.

341
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,973
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

342
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,977
And so was the Comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.

343
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,855
You know that better than anyone.

344
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,233
I'm not here because I miss him.

345
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,734
It's occurred to Rorschach...

346
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,862
...that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

347
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,490
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

348
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,701
That's why I'm warning you first.

349
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,332
Thank you, Dan...

350
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:15,712
...but I fear there's something
much more real to worry about...

351
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,507
...than Rorschach's mask killer.

352
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:24,513
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

353
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,350
The Soviets have 51,000
warheads stockpiled.

354
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,687
Even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...

355
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:36,066
...the 1 percent that get through
could still kill every living thing on Earth.

356
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,196
Even Dr. Manhattan
can't be everywhere at once.

Good evening, Rorschach.

378
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,920
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

379
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,505
Yes...

380
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,758
...but you're going to leave disappointed.

381
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:28,637
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

382
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,014
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

383
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,266
I have a real name I've been using.

384
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,476
Try it.

385
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,728
Whatever you say, Laurie.

386
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,146
What are you doing here?

387
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,649
The Comedian is dead.

388
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,901
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

389
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,695
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

390
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,990
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

391
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,037
Even if I wanted to help...

392
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:58,542
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

393
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:03,004
-I cannot see it clearly.
-Interference? Caused by what?

394
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,591
In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

395
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:11,430
If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

396
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,600
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

397
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:20,730
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

398
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,693
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

399
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,903
I must return to my work.

400
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,196
Wait a minute.

401
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,866
What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

402
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,285
So we can't do anything to stop it?

403
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,287
Goodbye, Rorschach.

404
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,706
Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

405
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,207
I'm not leaving--

406
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,836
--till I've had my say.

407
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,263
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days.

408
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,141
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

409
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,729
If Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis,
war may be averted.

410
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,981
But you always say time is simultaneous.

411
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,568
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

412
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:11,740
If only you could perceive time as I do.

413
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,158
Please let me show you.

414
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:24,085
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

415
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,297
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

416
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,925
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

417
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,844
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

418
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,182
-It was a mistake. One time.
-Man tries to rape you--

419
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,850
Stop!

420
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,102
Your mind goes to dark places...

421
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,605
...and you wonder
why I keep the worst from you.

422
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,946
-Say hello to Dan for me.
-What?

423
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,534
You wanna ask me
to go to dinner with you...

424
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,412
...like we used to...

425
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,957
...but you won't.

426
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,001
You know I can't.

427
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,923
So you'll call Dan...

428
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,551
...which is only natural.

429
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,470
You deserve the comfort of an old friend.

430
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,339
Dan Dreiberg's table.

431
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:16,239
Did you know that
he and H.J. were--? I had no idea.

432
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,826
You remember that crazy guy?
What'd he call himself?

433
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,494
Captain Carnage.

434
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,873
Used to pretend he was a supervillain
just so he could get beat up?

435
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,417
Yeah, he tried that on me once.
I just walked away.

436
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,629
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight...

437
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,590
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!"

438
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,384
I'm just saying, "No, get lost."

439
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,971
God, whatever happened to him?

440
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,307
Oh. Um...
He pulled that on Rorschach...

441
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,893
...and Rorschach
dropped him down an elevator shaft.

442
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,735
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.

443
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,946
-It's a little funny.
-Yep.

444
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,825
I'm glad I ordered
the four-legged chicken.

445
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,952
It's really good to see you again.

446
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,747
It's great seeing you too.

447
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,084
Why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?

448
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,546
-No one else would.
-Yeah, but do you remember my costume?

449
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,800
All that tight latex?
I mean, it was awful.

450
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,928
Uh... Yeah, yeah, awful.

451
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,555
But didn't wanna disappoint Mother.

452
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,726
Wanted her little girl to be just like her
and fight bad guys.

453
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:30,980
I think the Keene Act was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

454
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:34,442
Well, we'll live longer anyway.

455
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,280
What?

456
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,744
Jon thinks, unless he can do something
about it...

457
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,622
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.

458
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,582
Soon.

459
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,795
But I don't know what to think.
I mean, it's all...

460
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:57,006
...quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.

461
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,968
I never even know
what universe he's actually seeing.

462
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:04,389
He just keeps getting further away
from me.

463
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,766
Everyone.

464
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,520
I can't even tell
if he actually cares about me anymore...

465
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,731
...or if he's just pretending.

466
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,359
If he's pretending, it means he cares.

467
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,116
Hold on, I'll get the door.

468
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,244
Thanks, Dan.

469
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,663
-Got it?
-Yeah.

470
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,046
You always get
a government escort to dinner?

471
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:41,843
They're making sure I don't do anything to
upset the country's most powerful weapon.

472
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,846
I'm sorry.

473
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:48,892
I invite you out to dinner to catch up
and have a few laughs...

474
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,645
...but there don't seem to be many laughs
around these days.

475
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,608
What do you expect?
The Comedian's dead.

Laurie? Is that you?

497
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,387
Thought you'd be used
to traveling that way by now.

498
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,058
Well, I'm not.
I hate it when Jon teleports me.

499
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,103
Well, it beats flying coach.

500
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,480
Margarita?

501
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,858
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

502
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,029
Mm.

503
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,990
Remember that guy
that writes me letters?

504
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,660
He sent me an item of memorabilia.
It's a Tijuana bible.

505
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,998
This little eight-page porno comic
they did in the '30s and '40s.

506
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:21,210
-He sent you this?
-Sure. They're very valuable, like antiques.

507
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,713
Mother, this is gross.

508
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,174
I think it's kind of flattering.

509
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,593
Why do you always call me Mother
when you're mad?

510
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:34,015
I know why you're here.
I can still read, you know.

511
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,018
I saw it in the paper.

512
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,605
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.

513
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:45,401
Finally got his punchline, I guess.

514
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,696
-Poor Eddie.
-Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?

515
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,949
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.

516
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,660
You don't know.

517
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,578
Things change.

518
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,207
What happened happened 40 years ago.

519
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,627
I'm 67 years old.

520
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:07,006
Every day, the future
looks a little bit darker.

521
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,009
But the past...

522
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,513
...even the grimy parts of it...

523
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,683
...keep on getting brighter.

524
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,024
I've got spots in my eyes.

525
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,155
Stop it, Eddie.

526
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:35,493
-Thank you, Weegee.
-Thank you, Mr. Owl.

527
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:39,914
Tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.

528
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:43,251
-Little place on 21st.
-Sounds good.

529
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:48,006
Wow, a real photo session.
Wonder how my hair will look?

530
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,511
Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five.

531
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,029
Eddie.

532
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:16,159
What the hell are you doing here?
You knew I was changing.

533
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,952
Sure I did.

534
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,164
Come on, baby.

535
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,624
I know what you need.

536
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,837
You gotta have some kind of reason
for dressing in an outfit like this.

537
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,298
I said no, Eddie.

538
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:35,845
-No spelled Y-E-S.
-No spelled N-O.

539
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:39,474
-All right?
-Come on, sweetheart.

540
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,979
Eddie...

541
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,564
You little bastard.

542
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:36,197
This what you like?

543
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,866
-This what makes you hot?
-What?

544
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,547
Things are tough all over, cupcake.

545
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,843
It rains on the just and the unjust alike.

546
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,847
The Comedian was a little bit of both.

547
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,685
And he always thought
he'd get the last laugh.

548
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,272
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

549
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,234
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers...

550
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:17,989
...but spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty...

551
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,242
...O holy and merciful savior.

552
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,620
Thou most worthy judge eternal.

553
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:28,124
Suffer us not at our last hour
for any--

554
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,505
Fireworks. You gotta be kidding me.

555
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:02,426
You know, you'd think this goddamn
country had had enough fireworks.

556
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,930
You know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam...

557
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:11,060
...I think it might have driven us crazy.
You know, as a country.

558
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,523
But we didn't, thanks to you.

559
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:19,443
You sound bitter.

560
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,279
Me? Bitter?

561
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,532
Fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.

562
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,707
Oh, Jesus Christ.

563
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,876
-Mr. Eddie?
-Just what I fucking needed.

564
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:41,090
The war is over now.
We must talk about this baby.

565
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,386
There's nothing to talk about.
See, I'm leaving.

566
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,887
I'm gonna forget about you...

567
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,890
...and your horrible, sweaty,
little piece-of-shit country.

568
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,642
Get the fuck out of here.

569
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,229
-No.
-Get the fuck out of here.

570
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,772
You will remember.

571
00:46:58,566 --> 00:47:01,277
You will remember me and my country...

572
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,779
...forever!

573
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,242
My face!

574
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:11,620
Blake. Don't.

575
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,748
Blake!

576
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,090
She was pregnant...

577
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,093
...and you gunned her down.

578
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,553
That's right...

579
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,638
...and you know what? You watched me.

580
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,808
You could have turned the gun to steam,
the bullets to mercury...

581
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,604
...the bottle into goddamn snowflakes,
but you didn't, did you?

582
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,359
You really don't give a damn
about human beings.

583
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,363
You're drifting out of touch, doc.

584
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,116
God help us all.

585
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,453
Medic!

586
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,463
<i>Most holy and merciful savior.</i>

587
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:08,302
He cometh up and is cut down,
like a flower.

588
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:12,640
In the midst of life, we are in death.

589
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:17,144
Of whom may we seek succor,
but of thee, O Lord?

590
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,610
Welcome. We'll be starting shortly.

591
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,862
We're waiting for one more.

592
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:41,001
I told you, you wouldn't be
the only one dressed up.

593
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,004
Welcome, doctor.

594
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,090
Now we can start.

595
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:50,094
Thank you for coming. Acquaint yourselves
with this map of high-crime areas.

596
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,596
This is all bullshit.

597
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:57,768
For a guy who calls himself the Comedian,
I can never tell when you're joking.

598
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,355
Watchmen. That's the real joke.

599
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,316
It didn't work 15 years ago,
and it ain't gonna work now...

600
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,610
...because you wanna play
cowboys and Indians.

601
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,155
Maybe we should agree
on no drinking at meetings.

602
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,702
Rorschach and I have made headway
on the gang problem by working together.

603
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:19,206
A group this size seems like
a publicity stunt. I'm not in it for the ink.

604
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,167
We can do so much more.

605
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,544
We can save this world...

606
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,299
-...with the right leadership.
-Yeah.

607
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,428
And that'd be you, right, Ozzy?

608
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:35,389
I mean, hell,
you're the smartest man on the planet.

609
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:38,225
It doesn't take a genius
to see the world has problems.

610
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,229
But it takes a room of morons to think
they're small enough for you to handle.

611
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:43,898
You people.

612
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:47,568
You hear Moloch's back in town,
get your panties all in a bunch.

613
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:50,571
-You think catching him matters?
-Justice matters.

614
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,949
Justice.

615
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,577
Justice is coming to all of us.

616
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,245
No matter what the fuck we do.

617
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:02,917
You know, mankind's been trying to kill
each other off since the beginning of time.

618
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:07,922
Now we finally have the power
to finish the job.

619
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,759
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

620
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,931
Then Ozymandias here...

621
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,226
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

622
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,195
<i>For as much as it hath pleased...</i>

623
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:36,325
...almighty God to take onto himself

...pay my respects to the Comedian.

679
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:17,583

-I don't know.

He was upset.

685
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,600
He was crying.

686

I've done some bad things.

696
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:10,636
I did bad things to women. I shot kids.

698

704
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,035
But the truth is...

705
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:40,248
...you're the closest thing to a friend I got.
What the fuck does that say?

706
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,380
Shit.

707
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,549

708
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,260

709
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,765

715
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,711
Sounds unbelievable.

716
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,422
Probably true.

717
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,258
So that's it?

718
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:35,595

Clean?

720
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,146

00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,614
Please don't confiscate that.

724
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,285
I'm trying anything.

725
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,246
I have cancer.

726
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,582
What kind of cancer?

727
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,503
You know the kind
you eventually get better from?

728
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:12,424
That ain't the kind I got.

01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:18,920
Away. Yah!

783
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,714
Yah! Get away.

784
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:26,344
<i>In hell, at least the gulls are contented.</i>

785
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:32,017
<i>For my part,
I begged that they should take my eyes.</i>

786
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,312
<i>Thus sparing me future horrors.</i>

787
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,234
What time do you have to be
at your interview?

788
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:43,028
Don't worry.

789
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:46,156
We've got plenty of time.

790
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,415
Your finger's like licking a battery.

791
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:18,480
God, Jon, stop. What are you doing?

792
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:19,981
Please don't be upset.

793
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:23,818
I always thought you liked this.

794
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,403
No.

795
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:29,866
I don't--No.

796
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,536
I don't want that.

797
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:36,956
I don't know
what stimulates you anymore.

798
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:42,754
Look, I know you were just trying--

799
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,008
Are you working in here
while we're in bed together?

800
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,637
My work with Adrian
is at a critical stage right now.

801
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:54,265
-I didn't think it was necessary to--
-To what?

802
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,977
To what? To tell me which one of you
is giving me a pity fuck?

803
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:09,531
My attention was completely focused
on you.

804
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,409
If you think there's a problem
with my attitude...

805
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,828
...I am prepared to discuss it.

806
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:20,333
You know how everything in this world
fits together except people.

807
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,963
What am I to you?
Another puzzle to be solved?

808
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:28,842
Have your men stand back.
I'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now.

809
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:32,595
You're my only remaining link
to the world.

810
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:42,981
I don't want that responsibility anymore.

811
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,989
He's all yours.

812
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,372
<i>Don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.</i>

813
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:03,042
No, she won't.

814
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:21,728
<i>He's been called
many things: Hero, weapon...</i>

815
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,689
<i>...linchpin of our national security...</i>

816
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:29,402
<i>...deterrent to nuclear war,
or a man to end worlds.</i>

817
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:32,280
<i>Later tonight, Dr. Manhattan...</i>

818
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:37,410
<i>...will answer my questions and yours
in an exclusive interview...</i>

819
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:42,457
<i>...brought to you commercial-free
by Veidt Enterprises.</i>

820
01:06:57,305 --> 01:06:58,598
Who is it?

821
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,725
It's Laurie.

822
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:14,864
Sorry. I just had this new lock installed.

823
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,492
I didn't know where else to go.

824
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:20,828
Oh, it's okay. Come in.

825
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,295
What's wrong?

826
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,257
I left Jon.

827
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:35,260
Oh, God.

828
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,470
I'm so sorry.

829
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:40,473
I don't know why I'm here. I just....

830
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,477
I don't know anybody else.

831
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,606
I don't know anybody
except for goddamn superheroes.

832
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,817
That's okay.

833
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:53,278
You probably just had an argument
or something.

834
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,821
No, Dan.

835
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,032
You don't know what it's been like
living with him.

836
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,327
The way he looks at things now,
it's like he doesn't...

837
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,997
...remember what they are.

838
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,499
<i>It's like this world, this real world...</i>

839
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:10,461
<i>...to him,
it's like walking through mist.</i>

840
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:14,173
And people are just shadows.

841
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,261
<i>Shadows in a fog.</i>

842
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:22,724
<i>God, how did everything
get so tangled up?</i>

843
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,352
I'm sorry, Dan.

844
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:30,064
This is twice now
I've ruined your evening.

845
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,526
Come on. I'm glad you came over.

846
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:37,196
I was just gonna see Hollis
for our weekly beer session.

847
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,365
You're more than welcome to join.

848
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,870
In fact, I insist.

849
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:19,155
Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives
and no one thinks to tell me.

850
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:21,240
-He just--
-We don't have time for makeup.

851
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,701
That blue is too light for television.

852
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,456
Is that dark enough?

853
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:33,169
<i>Yeah, that's dark enough.</i>

854
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:37,006
The weight of the world's on him,
but does he quit? No.

855
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,425
News vendors always cope. They're the--

856
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:43,179
Oh, God, here comes
that homeless guy again.

857
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,432
I told you, this month's issue
still hasn't arrived yet.

858
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:50,269
Why do you care about that right-wing rag?
Those bastards don't give a damn.

859
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,940
Hold up. Here they come.

860
01:09:57,694 --> 01:10:00,238
-Seymour.
-Bernie, how's tricks?

861
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:01,447
Fine, fine.

862
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:04,909
See this guy behind me?
Been bugging me all week.

863
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:11,999
Maybe we should get a cab.
These are bad neighborhoods.

864
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:15,795
Yeah, well, I'm in a bad mood.

865
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,643
-Girl.
-What we got here?

866
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,688
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved
no-go areas.

867
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:36,649
Afghanistan will obviously come up,
but just play it cool...

868
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:39,193
...and try not to get
into any tight corners.

869
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,072
--a renowned nuclear physicist,
who, through a terrible accident...

870
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:48,995
...was gifted with extraordinary powers,
capable of bending matter to his will.

871
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:53,458
Today, the world knows him
as Dr. Manhattan.

872
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:54,959
Welcome.

873
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,174
Thank you.

874
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,301
That's right.

875
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,643
Ms. Black, you have the first question.

876
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:14,228
Dr. Manhattan, as you know...

877
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:17,106
...the Doomsday Clock
is a symbolic clock face...

878
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,860
...analogizing humankind's proximity
to extinction...

879
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:24,197
...midnight representing the threat
of nuclear war.

880
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,533
As of now, it stands at four minutes
to midnight.

881
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,620
Would you agree that we're that close
to annihilation?

882
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:33,372
My father was a watchmaker.

883
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:38,544
He abandoned it when Einstein discovered
that time is relative.

884
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,714
I would only agree
that a symbolic clock...

885
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,883
...is as nourishing to the intellect...

886
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:47,303
...as a photograph of oxygen
to a drowning man.

887
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:51,390
So you're saying there is no danger.

888
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:55,561
<i>Even in a world without nuclear
weapons, there would still be danger.</i>

889
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:03,402
And would you say, as so many claim...

890
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,321
...that you are, in fact, a god...

891
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:08,324
...given you see the past
and future simultaneously?

892
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,785
I can only see my own past...

893
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:15,122
<i>...my own future. I am not omniscient.</i>

894
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,083
Doug Roth, your question?

895
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,002
Speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan...

896
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,922
...do you remember a man
named Wally Weaver?

897
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:28,261
Yes. We were both physicists together
at the Gila Flats Research Base.

898
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:30,304
He died of cancer.

899
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,432
-He was a good man.
-How about Edgar Jacobi...

900
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:36,519
<i>...also known as the supervillain Moloch?</i>

901
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:41,607
<i>You encountered him several times
in the '60s: battles, conflicts.</i>

902
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,277
<i>Did you know that he has cancer as well?</i>

903
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,445
I wasn't told.

904
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,823
<i>And what about
General Anthony Randolph?</i>

905
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:52,451
<i>He was your handler when you first
started working for the government.</i>

906
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:53,870
Cancer.

907
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,706
You're suggesting I was the cause.

908
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,126
<i>From where I'm standing,
it's starting to look pretty conclusive.</i>

909
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,295
<i>Even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.</i>

910
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,298
<i>A live human body
and a deceased human body...</i>

911
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,550
<i>...have the same number of particles.</i>

912
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:12,179
Structurally, there's no difference.

913
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,600
All right. Let's settle down, please.

914
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,690
What about Janey Slater?

915
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:25,818
You think it makes a difference to her?

916
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:28,195
Janey?

917
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,114
Your ex-girlfriend?

918
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:33,910
She was a physicist too.
You saw each other for 11 years.

919
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,620
Doug, one question at a time.

920
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:39,165
She has cancer as well.
Doctors have given her six months.

921
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:41,167
Isn't that right, Miss Slater?

922
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,476
You were the world to me, Jon.

923
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,312
You were my whole life.

924
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:04,857
Do you remember how many times
you said you loved me?

925
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:06,692
Janey, I wasn't told.

926
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:12,531
I stuck by you after the accident.
I gave you everything.

927
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,246
This is how you repay me?

928
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:24,585
-Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know.
-Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.

929
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:26,754
Janey, wait.

930
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,591
-That's it. This interview is over.
-Get up there.

931
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:33,135
Get those cameras off.
Everybody back off.

932
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:37,014
Everybody back off.
I need some backup here. Leave him alone.

933
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:43,270
Please, if everyone
would just go away...

934
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:46,357
...and leave me alone...

935
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:47,900
Do you care to comment?

936
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:51,112
I said, leave me alone!

937
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,639
Jesus.

938
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,350
Us...

939
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:24,103
...getting mugged.

940
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,024
Let's go.

941
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,573
I'm shaking.

942
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,537
You know what?

943
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:45,416
I'm wiped. I'm just gonna call it a night.

944
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:48,794
Oh, are you sure you don't wanna
come by Hollis' with me...

945
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,213
...and shake off the adrenaline?

946
01:15:52,006 --> 01:15:55,134
I think I've had enough hero stuff
for one night.

947
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:58,637
It helped having you listen.

948
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,681
Any time.

949
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,309
Take care, Dan.

950
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:06,395
It's a rough world out there.

951
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,065
Be seeing you.

952
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:16,739
<i>I thought of my family...</i>

953
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,950
<i>...my wife, my daughters.</i>

954
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,119
<i>Vulnerable, unsuspecting.</i>

955
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,248
<i>Awaiting my return,
only to be met by damnation...</i>

956
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,834
<i>...bearing down upon them.</i>

957
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:36,425
Hey!

958
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,052
Over here!

959
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,179
Here!

960
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,436
Ridley.

961
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,079
<i>A sail.</i>

962
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:08,040
<i>Ridley had brought me a sail.</i>

963
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:11,460
<i>Perhaps this could be my route
back to Davidstown.</i>

964
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:17,049
<i>Everything I loved, everything I lived for,
depended on my reaching home...</i>

965
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:20,553
<i>...in advance of that terrible</i> Freighter.

966
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,648
<i>The morning sun found me
no less troubled.</i>

967
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,484
<i>Further down the shore...</i>

968
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:39,155
<i>...some of my crew
had become inflated with gas.</i>

969
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:41,031
Ugh!

970
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:50,207
<i>I shuddered at my own idea,
attempting to banish this repulsive notion.</i>

971
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:01,927
<i>Even in death,
they sought to fulfill their duty...</i>

972
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:04,680
<i>...making our vessel more buoyant.</i>

973
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,184
<i>And I would do my duty to them
in returning them home.</i>

974
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:15,149
<i>Rudely jarring my men from eternal rest,
and laying them in the bed I prepared...</i>

975
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:19,778
<i>...I hoped my wife and daughters
might be tucked in by gentler hands...</i>

976
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:21,655
<i>...when their turn came.</i>

977
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:41,383
We shall get home together, my friend.

978
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:45,804
<i>I waited for the tide.</i>

979
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:50,643
<i>Then, embarking, headed east.</i>

980
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:53,812
<i>East, across the night seas.</i>

981
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:58,442
<i>East, borne on the bodies
of murdered men.</i>

982
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,862
<i>Hope can be a horrible thing.</i>

983
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:10,931
<i>With the dawn came the gulls
looking for breakfast.</i>

984
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:12,224
Ridley.

985
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:16,478
Get out.

986
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,946
<i>I was reminded
that I, myself, had not eaten.</i>

987
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:32,036
I know it is unappetizing,
but it is all we have.

988
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,376
He's gone.

989
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:41,337
-He's gone!
-Who's gone?

990
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,589
-Dr. Manhattan.
-What? What'd you say?

991
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:47,009
Dr. Manhattan's gone. He's left us.

992
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,720
What? Gone where?

993
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:56,935
You're late.

994
01:20:57,102 --> 01:21:00,230
Ah, I know. I know.
You won't believe what happened.

995
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:03,192
Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV.

996
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,069
Wait, what?

997
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,576
I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.

998
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:16,955
She's gonna know soon enough.
The whole world will know.

999
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,875
<i>I said, leave me alone!</i>

1000
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:31,929
<i>I am looking at the stars.</i>

1001
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,431
<i>They're so far away...</i>

1002
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,518
<i>...and their light takes so long
to reach us...</i>

1003
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:44,483
<i>...all we ever see of stars
are their old photographs.</i>

1004
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:51,907
<i>It is July, 1959, and I am in love.</i>

1005
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,410
That's great.

1006
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,203
-You can pick it up tomorrow.
-Okay.

1007
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,122
-Seventy-five cents.
-Okay, thank you.

1008
01:21:58,288 --> 01:21:59,331
Thank you.

1009
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:03,669
Gosh, Jon, I wish he gave us a little notice.
I'm sure I made a face.

1010
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:08,841
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.

1011
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,097
<i>Her name is Janey Slater.</i>

1012
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,600
<i>She is a physicist, like me.</i>

1013
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,645
<i>I am 30 years old.</i>

1014
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:30,279
<i>We were introduced by a good friend
of mine from college, Wally Weaver.</i>

1015
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,035
<i>It is February 12th, 1981.</i>

1016
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:40,956
<i>Wally dies of cancer,
of which they now say I am the cause.</i>

1017
01:22:57,931 --> 01:23:01,351
<i>That night, Janey and I make love
for the first time.</i>

1018
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:12,196
<i>A month from now,
the accident awaits me.</i>

1019
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:23,165
Oh, I'll catch up with you guys.
I think I left my watch inside.

1020
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,084
Hey. Let's just wait a second.

1021
01:23:29,463 --> 01:23:33,884
<i>I cross the room to the
Intrinsic Field Center. I find my watch.</i>

1022
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:41,767
<i>When I get to the door...</i>

1023
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:44,728
<i>...Wally is turning white.</i>

1024
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:48,941
The program's locked in.
We can't override the time lock.

1025
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:52,277
<i>I am terrified.</i>

1026
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:53,570
Jon?

1027
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,577
I'm sorry, Jon...

1028
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:04,081
...but I can't--

1029
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:07,876
Janey, don't leave me!

1030
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:10,420
Don't leave me!

1031
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:47,207
<i>It is May 12th, 1959,
when I'm introduced to Janey.</i>

1032
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,835
<i>She buys me a beer...</i>

1033
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:52,879
<i>...the first time a woman
has done this for me.</i>

1034
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:58,093
<i>As she passes me the cold,
perspiring glass...</i>

1035
01:24:58,719 --> 01:24:59,970
<i>...our fingers touch.</i>

1036
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:15,027
Yes, Jon, good.

1037
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:20,699
Now it's just a question of reassembling
the components in the correct sequence.

1038
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:25,621
<i>I feel fear...</i>

1039
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:28,999
<i>...for the last time.</i>

1040
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:48,226
<i>A token funeral is held.</i>

1041
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,562
<i>There is nothing to bury.</i>

1042
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:53,357
<i>Janey frames the snapshot.</i>

1043
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,693
<i>It's the only photograph of me
anyone has.</i>

1044
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:02,866
<i>A circulatory system is seen
by the perimeter fence.</i>

1045
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,743
<i>A few days later...</i>

1046
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:08,121
<i>...a partially muscled skeleton
stands in a hallway...</i>

1047
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:12,125
<i>...and screams for a moment
before vanishing.</i>

1048
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:39,528
Oh, God.

1049
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,238
Jon?

1050
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,116
Is that you?

1051
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:47,786
Nations around the world
reeling from this morning's announcement...

1052
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:50,622
...possibly the most significant event
in recent history.

1053
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:54,835
We repeat, the superman exists,
and he is American.

1054
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,802
<i>They call me Dr. Manhattan.</i>

1055
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,098
<i>They explain the name
has been chosen...</i>

1056
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:12,477
<i>...for the ominous associations
it will raise in America's enemies.</i>

1057
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:20,444
<i>The marketing boys say I need a logo.</i>

1058
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,621
<i>If I'm to have a symbol...</i>

1059
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:36,209
<i>...it shall be one I respect.</i>

1060
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:49,306
<i>They are shaping me
into something gaudy...</i>

1061
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,517
<i>...something lethal.</i>

1062
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:59,858
<i>In January, 1971...</i>

1063
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:03,987
<i>...President Nixon asks me to intervene
in Vietnam...</i>

1064
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:06,907
<i>...something that his predecessors
would not ask.</i>

1065
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,036
<i>A week later, the conflict ends.</i>

1066
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:15,665
<i>Some of the Vietcong forces
wanna surrender to me personally.</i>

1067
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:22,714
<i>Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero,
writes a book.</i>

1068
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:27,719
<i>In it, he calls my arrival
the dawn of the superhero.</i>

1069
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:31,264
<i>I am not sure if I know what that means.</i>

1070
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:50,867
<i>You see, at the time, I was misquoted.</i>

1071
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:54,204
I never said, "The superman exists
and he is American."

1072
01:28:54,371 --> 01:29:00,335
What I said was, "God exists,
and he is American."

1073
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,296
Now, if you begin to feel an intense...

1074
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:07,384
...and crushing feeling of religious terror
at the concept...

1075
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:09,845
...don't be alarmed.

1076
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:14,516
That indicates only
that you are still sane.

1077
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:20,105
<i>It is Christmas, 1963.</i>

1078
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:24,150
<i>Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried.</i>

1079
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:27,612
<i>She says I am like a god now.</i>

1080
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,448
<i>I tell her I don't think there is a God.</i>

1081
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,285
And if there is, I'm nothing like him.

1082
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,458
<i>I tell her I still want her...</i>

1083
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:43,253
<i>...and that I always will.</i>

1084
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:50,969
<i>As I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970.</i>

1085
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:54,681
<i>I am in a room
full of people wearing disguises.</i>

1086
01:29:56,141 --> 01:30:00,437
<i>A very young girl looks at me and smiles.</i>

1087
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:04,316
<i>She's beautiful.</i>

1088
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:13,742
<i>After each long kiss, she plants a smaller,
gentler one upon my lips...</i>

1089
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,493
<i>...like a signature.</i>

1090
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:19,998
<i>Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.</i>

1091
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:25,795
<i>She bursts into angry tears,
asking if it's because she's getting older.</i>

1092
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:27,797
<i>It's true.</i>

1093
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,886
<i>She's aging more noticeably every day...</i>

1094
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:42,312
<i>...while I am standing still.</i>

1095
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:45,899
<i>I prefer the stillness here.</i>

1096
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,985
<i>I am tired of Earth.</i>

1097
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:50,820
<i>These people.</i>

1098
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:55,075
<i>I'm tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.</i>

1099
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:21,226
<i>They claim their labors
are to build a heaven...</i>

1100
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:25,271
<i>...yet their heaven is populated
with horrors.</i>

1101
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:28,400
<i>Perhaps the world is not made.</i>

1102
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:31,403
<i>Perhaps nothing is made.</i>

1103
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:35,824
<i>A clock without a craftsman.</i>

1104
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,743
<i>It's too late.</i>

1105
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:41,079
<i>Always has been...</i>

1106
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:45,166
<i>...always will be too late.</i>

1107
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:50,296
And you have no idea
where he would've gone.

1108
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:51,756
How would I know?

1109
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:54,676
Probably on the other side
of the world studying molecules.

1110
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:57,387
Our satellites have done
a sweep of the planet.

1111
01:31:57,554 --> 01:31:59,848
There's no trace of his
energy signature anywhere.

1112
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,307
Really?

1113
01:32:01,474 --> 01:32:04,894
Miss Jupiter, did you and
Dr. Manhattan have a fight today?

1114
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:06,563
None of your fucking business.

1115
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:10,066
It is when you're on government payroll
and you're not doing your job.

1116
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:14,696
That's as close to the word "whore"
as you're gonna get with me, Agent Forbes.

1117
01:32:22,829 --> 01:32:24,330
Smoke?

1118
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:27,125
My apologies, Miss Jupiter.

1119
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:30,628
You know how important Dr. Manhattan
is to our national security.

1120
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,465
You can imagine our concern.

1121
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:35,175
I can only imagine.

1122
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:45,435
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.

1123
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:48,438
Then Ozymandias here...

1124
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:51,649
...will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

1125
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:12,921
Laurel? Laurel Jane?

1126
01:33:14,464 --> 01:33:16,257
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

1127
01:33:17,175 --> 01:33:19,385
You're the Comedian, right?

1128
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,054
You were pretty cool in there.

1129
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:25,600
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

1130
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:31,106
You got her eyes, you know.
You even have that same funny little mole.

1131
01:33:31,564 --> 01:33:33,483
Take your hands off her.

1132
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,735
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1133
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:39,531
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

1134
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:43,076
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1135
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:47,080
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

1136
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:49,499
...you know, old friend's daughter?

1137
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,793
I mean, what the hell do you think I am?

1138
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,628
We found him!

1139
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:58,758
-We found him.
-Where is he?

1140
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:03,513
Mars.

1141
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:11,563
Mr. President...

1142
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:16,359
...the Soviets have moved their tanks
just short of the Afghan border.

1143
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:19,154
They are testing us...

1144
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:23,741
...to see if we manufactured
Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...

1145
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:26,995
...to coax a move out of them.

1146
01:34:27,162 --> 01:34:31,124
If they realize it's not a hoax,
they'll probably start with air strikes.

1147
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:35,378
If they do, they'll have Afghanistan
under control in a matter of days.

1148
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:40,466
A watchdog group of nuclear scientists
has moved the Doomsday Clock...

1149
01:34:40,633 --> 01:34:42,886
...to two minutes until midnight.

1150
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:46,222
Get this shit off the screen.

1151
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:49,434
Who are these assholes to say
when doomsday approaches?

1152
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:52,061
I say when doomsday is approaching.

1153
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,319
Now, then.

1154
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,864
What about the rest
of the Warsaw Pact countries?

1155
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:07,243
Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany
have mobilized their forces.

1156
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,580
But no movement yet.
They're playing a wait-and-see.

1157
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:12,373
Letting the Russians take the lead.

1158
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:19,923
Bold moves, Henry.
That's what's needed right now.

1159
01:35:20,089 --> 01:35:22,842
We can't let these fuckers
think we're weak.

1160
01:35:23,009 --> 01:35:27,305
Yes. They must fear the madman
Richard Nixon.

1161
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:35,813
How soon can we be ready
for a preemptive strike?

1162
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:38,024
Two days.

1163
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:42,320
We have a 54 percent chance
of wiping out the entire U.S.S.R...

1164
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:44,530
...before they get their missiles airborne.

1165
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:47,742
What would our losses be?

1166
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,786
Assuming conservative projections...

1167
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:53,331
...of how many Soviet warheads
are destroyed beforehand...

1168
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:55,333
...we'll lose all of the East Coast.

1169
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:57,335
The last gasp...

1170
01:35:58,169 --> 01:36:00,672
...of the Harvard establishment.

1171
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:04,342
Let's see them think their way
out of fission.

1172
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:08,137
With anticipated wind patterns,
the fallout drift would head south.

1173
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:10,515
Mexico would catch the worst of it.

1174
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:12,767
Most of the farm belt
might remain unaffected.

1175
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:14,644
Not so bad...

1176
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,563
...all things considered.

1177
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:21,985
Mr. President...

1178
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:23,778
...what would you like to do?

1179
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,414
Take us to DEFCON two.

1180
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,582
Begin fueling the bombers.

1181
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,086
Dr. Manhattan has two days.

1182
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:42,338
After that...

1183
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:46,134
...humanity is in the hands
of a higher authority than mine.

1184
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:49,721
Let's just hope he's on our side.

1185
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:53,057
-There must be a way to reach him.
-Excuse me.

1186
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:54,892
Radio transmission, space shuttles--

1187
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:56,269
-Excuse me.
-What?

1188
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:58,730
I need to use the restroom.

1189
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:21,919
Don't you understand?

1190
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:24,756
The only thing that can
bring Jon back is Jon.

1191
01:37:24,922 --> 01:37:26,883
If he wants to find me, he will.

1192
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:29,510
I've been a prisoner in my life
long enough.

1193
01:37:29,886 --> 01:37:31,596
Without Dr. Manhattan around...

1194
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:34,640
...to bully the Russians into peace,
Mr. Veidt...

1195
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:39,228
...people are going to need good,
old-fashioned energy to rely on.

1196
01:37:39,395 --> 01:37:41,064
You can understand.

1197
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:46,319
The world can't just quit on oil
and nuclear power cold turkey.

1198
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:48,738
You'll dismantle
our entire economy overnight.

1199
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:51,657
You're right, Lee. And why free energy?

1200
01:37:51,824 --> 01:37:54,744
Well, "free" is just another word
for "socialist."

1201
01:37:54,911 --> 01:37:56,871
We might have to
make a public inquiry...

1202
01:37:57,038 --> 01:38:00,291
...into any past communist affiliations
you might have had.

1203
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:03,586
Mr. Iacocca, gentlemen...

1204
01:38:04,754 --> 01:38:06,964
...I respect your position...

1205
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:11,052
...and what you've accomplished
as captains of industry. I do.

1206
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,971
You wanna know my past? Hm?

1207
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:17,475
Okay. Happily.

1208
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:21,145
It's a matter of public record that by 17,
both my parents were dead...

1209
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,147
...leaving me alone.

1210
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:27,485
I guess you could say
I've always been alone.

1211
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:32,573
They say I'm the smartest man in the world,
but the truth is I've often felt stupid...

1212
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:36,244
...at being unable to relate to anyone.

1213
01:38:36,411 --> 01:38:39,831
Well, anyone living, that is.

1214
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:41,958
The only person
with whom I felt kinship...

1215
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:45,253
...died 300 years
before the birth of Christ.

1216
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:50,800
Alexander of Macedonia,
or Alexander the Great, as you know him.

1217
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:54,011
His vision of a united world was...

1218
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:59,016
Well, it was unprecedented.

1219
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:00,852
I wanted...

1220
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:03,354
...needed to match
his accomplishments...

1221
01:39:03,521 --> 01:39:06,691
...so I resolved to apply antiquity's
teachings to our world today.

1222
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:10,361
And so began my path to conquest.

1223
01:39:10,528 --> 01:39:13,781
Conquest not of men...

1224
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:16,784
...but of the evils that beset them.

1225
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:21,914
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power...

1226
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:24,917
...are like a drug, and you,
along with foreign interests...

1227
01:39:25,084 --> 01:39:26,711
-...are the pushers.
-Now, listen.

1228
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:28,921
No.

1229
01:39:31,257 --> 01:39:33,050
You listen.

1230
01:39:34,302 --> 01:39:36,804
The world will survive...

1231
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:40,433
...and it deserves more
than you've been able to provide.

1232
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:43,227
So let's cut to it, shall we?

1233
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:45,938
I'm worth more
than all of your corporations combined.

1234
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:49,734
I could buy and sell you, something
you should factor into your decision...

1235
01:39:49,901 --> 01:39:56,199
...should you choose
to make our disagreement public.

1236
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:00,077
I think you know the way out.

1237
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,581
Gentlemen.

1238
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:09,587
The toy people wanna talk to you about
new villains for the Ozymandias line.

1239
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:13,216
-Seems all the old villains are dead.
-Mr. Veidt?

1240
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:16,928
-I think I have some ideas.
-Mr. Veidt?

1241
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:19,931
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1242
01:40:58,928 --> 01:41:00,638
He's got a poison capsule.

1243
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:05,768
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch.
Who sent you? I want a name.

1244
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:07,019
Give me a name!

1245
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:20,449
<i>Suicide pill.</i>

1246
01:41:21,534 --> 01:41:24,495
Potassium cyanide.
Guy was dead before he hit the ground.

1247
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:26,497
Thanks, hon.

1248
01:41:26,998 --> 01:41:29,000
Then Rorschach was right.

1249
01:41:29,166 --> 01:41:31,335
This wasn't some lone nut.

1250
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:35,673
It's an organization:
well-funded, well-equipped.

1251
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:38,551
But who'd wanna kill us now?

1252
01:41:39,844 --> 01:41:43,014
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.

1253
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:50,521
So no word from Jon?

1254
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:53,107
No.

1255
01:41:53,482 --> 01:41:55,359
Well, listen...

1256
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,570
...why don't you come stay with me?

1257
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:01,907
Oh, no.
That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.

1258
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:05,745
Oh, no. No.
Think of it as doing me a favor.

1259
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,915
I wouldn't have to worry about you
being out there.

1260
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:14,545
Okay.

1261
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:23,054
<i>Rorschach's journal, October 21st, 1985.</i>

1262
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:27,350
<i>On 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg
and Jupiter leaving diner.</i>

1263
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:30,686
<i>They didn't know me without my mask.</i>

1264
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,189
<i>An affair?</i>

1265
01:42:33,356 --> 01:42:36,233
<i>Did she break Manhattan's heart
to engineer his exile...</i>

1266
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,403
<i>...to make room for Dreiberg?</i>

1267
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:43,032
<i>Does Manhattan even have a heart
to break?</i>

1268
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:47,078
<i>The alley was cold, deserted.</i>

1269
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:51,832
<i>My things were where I left them,
waiting for me.</i>

1270
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:56,379
<i>My coat, my shoes, my spotless gloves.</i>

1271
01:42:57,922 --> 01:42:59,840
<i>My face.</i>

1272
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:04,011
<i>Putting them on,
I abandoned my disguise...</i>

1273
01:43:04,178 --> 01:43:06,305
<i>...became myself.</i>

1274
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:09,934
<i>Free from fear or weakness...</i>

1275
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:11,185
<i>...or lust.</i>

1276
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:14,605
<i>Down alley...</i>

1277
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:16,649
<i>...heard woman scream.</i>

1278
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:20,820
<i>First bubbling note
of city's evening chorus.</i>

1279
01:43:20,986 --> 01:43:22,780
<i>Attempted rape.</i>

1280
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:24,115
<i>Mugging.</i>

1281
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:25,783
<i>Both.</i>

1282
01:43:27,284 --> 01:43:28,953
<i>The man turned...</i>

1283
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:32,289
<i>...and there was something
rewarding in his eyes.</i>

1284
01:43:33,249 --> 01:43:35,710
<i>Sometimes the night is generous to me.</i>

1285
01:43:41,799 --> 01:43:46,137
<i>Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife
named Roy Chess.</i>

1286
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:49,473
<i>At his apartment, I found clues.</i>

1287
01:43:50,683 --> 01:43:53,769
<i>Seems he worked
at Pyramid Transnational.</i>

1288
01:43:53,936 --> 01:43:56,480
<i>I've seen the logo before...</i>

1289
01:43:56,897 --> 01:43:58,983
<i>...at Moloch's.</i>

1290
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:32,266
Someone tried to shoot
the world's smartest man today, Moloch.

1291
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,895
Guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.

1292
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:38,189
More than a just delivery service,
I take it.

1293
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:42,318
Last time I was here, I saw a pension check
written from the same company.

1294
01:44:42,485 --> 01:44:45,988
I'm guessing it's a front set up
by whoever wants us masks dead.

1295
01:44:46,155 --> 01:44:49,742
Now, no more lies, Moloch.
Who runs Pyramid?

1296
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:56,248
Rorschach.

1297
01:44:56,415 --> 01:44:58,793
This is the police.
We know you're in there.

1298
01:44:58,959 --> 01:45:00,836
No. No!

1299
01:45:01,003 --> 01:45:04,131
If there's anybody in there with you,
send them out unharmed.

1300
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:07,218
No. No, no, no!

1301
01:45:07,384 --> 01:45:11,806
Framed. Walked right into it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

1302
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,599
Never, never surrender.

1303
01:45:13,766 --> 01:45:16,769
All right.
I hope you're ready, hero.

1304
01:45:16,936 --> 01:45:17,978
When you are.

1305
01:45:40,668 --> 01:45:41,710
One...

1306
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:47,758
...two...

1307
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:52,847
...three.

1308
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,609
Come on.

1309
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:58,829
Son of a bitch.

1310
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:02,207
-Christ, he stinks.
-Get that mask off him.

1311
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:05,210
-I got it.
-No.No!

1312
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:08,088
My face! Give me back my face!

1313
01:47:08,923 --> 01:47:11,550
<i>The masked vigilante Rorschach
was apprehended...</i>

1314
01:47:11,717 --> 01:47:15,554
<i>...and identified
as Walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.</i>

1315
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:18,807
<i>Little's known about Kovacs,
but he was charged with the murder...</i>

1316
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:22,811
<i>...of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head
in his home in the Bronx.</i>

1317
01:47:22,978 --> 01:47:26,023
<i>Police officers were injured
and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...</i>

1318
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,734
<i>...during the violent course
of the capture.</i>

1319
01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:33,864
Rorschach!

1320
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:37,743
I'm gonna fuck you
like I fucked your mother!

1321
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:47,336
Come on out, Rorschach!

1322
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:52,883
I knew this guy was a kook.

1323
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:54,843
But Rorschach....

1324
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:57,763
Usually I got an intuition
about these kind of things.

1325
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:00,349
-Thought the dude would be bigger.
-It goes to show you, kid...

1326
01:48:00,516 --> 01:48:02,351
-...you never know.
-Hey, let me get a <i>Gazette.</i>

1327
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:06,355
Yeah. Hey, you see this?
He was a customer of mine.

1328
01:48:06,522 --> 01:48:09,483
-Used to come here all the time.
-No shit?

1329
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:14,071
Hey, Bernie. Any good news?

1330
01:48:23,872 --> 01:48:27,251
<i>Whoever we are, wherever we reside...</i>

1331
01:48:27,418 --> 01:48:30,254
<i>...we exist on the whim of murderers.</i>

1332
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:37,886
<i>I hardly recognized my old friend Ridley.</i>

1333
01:48:38,053 --> 01:48:41,181
<i>I could not bring myself to tell him
he was a horrible reflection...</i>

1334
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:43,267
<i>...of his former self.</i>

1335
01:48:43,559 --> 01:48:48,105
<i>I really must get him home before...
Before he gets any worse.</i>

1336
01:48:48,272 --> 01:48:50,399
<i>Before he succumbs.</i>

1337
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:56,363
<i>I've heard that on less than a pint daily,
a man might survive drinking saltwater.</i>

1338
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:57,865
Captain?

1339
01:48:58,032 --> 01:48:59,491
What are you doing, captain?

1340
01:49:02,036 --> 01:49:04,872
I'm headed for Davidstown. That's what.

1341
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:08,042
I need to warn everyone.

1342
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:14,048
You think you'll reach Davidstown
in advance of the <i>Black Freighter</i>?

1343
01:49:14,423 --> 01:49:18,594
Isolation has made you mad, captain.
Mad, indeed.

1344
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:20,929
But we must try.

1345
01:49:21,096 --> 01:49:22,306
You are a fool.

1346
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:24,975
You alone survived the <i>Freighter's</i> attack.

1347
01:49:25,142 --> 01:49:29,354
Fortune has smiled upon you,
and you spit in its face.

1348
01:49:29,521 --> 01:49:34,902
Turn your wretched craft around
and go far away, as far away as you can.

1349
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:40,949
No. No, my family. I must protect them.

1350
01:49:42,201 --> 01:49:43,994
The <i>Black Freighter</i> is already there.

1351
01:49:44,787 --> 01:49:46,413
Your wife, dead.

1352
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:49,208
-Your children, dead.
-Shut your mouth.

1353
01:49:49,374 --> 01:49:53,712
You have failed your family,
like you have failed your crew.

1354
01:50:15,067 --> 01:50:18,529
You'll end up dead like them.
You give your life in vain.

1355
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:20,906
I give my life in nobility.

1356
01:50:23,784 --> 01:50:26,870
Even if I fail in my attempt,
I take solace in the fact that I will see...

1357
01:50:27,037 --> 01:50:28,580
...my family again in heaven.

1358
01:50:28,747 --> 01:50:30,082
Heaven?

1359
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:32,334
Oh, there is no heaven, captain.

1360
01:50:32,876 --> 01:50:34,962
Believe me, sir.

1361
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:37,297
I would know by now.

1362
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:45,681
<i>Walter Kovacs.</i>

1363
01:50:45,848 --> 01:50:48,559
Is that your name? Walter?

1364
01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:52,771
Well, let me explain
your situation here, Walter.

1365
01:50:52,938 --> 01:50:54,523
You cooperate with me...

1366
01:50:54,690 --> 01:50:59,194
...and I may be able to convince them
that you should be treated medically.

1367
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:02,906
In a hospital. I believe
that would be good for you.

1368
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:09,121
But the authorities wanna put you
with the general population.

1369
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:13,083
-Prison's a prison.
-Uh-huh. Yes.

1370
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:17,087
But the difference is, down there...

1371
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:19,047
...you'd be eaten alive.

1372
01:51:20,007 --> 01:51:24,261
You're responsible for a lot of them
being in prison here, Walter.

1373
01:51:27,306 --> 01:51:28,765
Tell me what you see.

1374
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:35,606
A pretty butterfly.

1375
01:51:39,443 --> 01:51:41,278
What about now? What do you see here?

1376
01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:47,451
Mom?

1377
01:51:47,784 --> 01:51:49,161
Is he hurting you?

1378
01:51:49,328 --> 01:51:52,206
You got a fucking kid in here.
I get that at home.

1379
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:55,918
Bastard.
I should have had that abortion.

1380
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:07,471
Some nice flowers.

1381
01:52:13,185 --> 01:52:14,853
<i>I heard this guy's mom's a whore.</i>

1382
01:52:17,147 --> 01:52:19,900
Did you catch any diseases from her?

1383
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:24,863
Huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.

1384
01:52:26,156 --> 01:52:29,409
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick
for a dollar?

1385
01:52:48,011 --> 01:52:49,179
Clouds.

1386
01:52:54,101 --> 01:52:56,853
Tell me about Rorschach.
Will you do that, Walter?

1387
01:52:57,020 --> 01:53:00,524
You keep calling me Walter.
I don't like you.

1388
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:05,821
You don't like me.
All right, why is that, exactly?

1389
01:53:05,988 --> 01:53:07,364
You're fat.

1390
01:53:07,948 --> 01:53:11,076
Wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.

1391
01:53:11,243 --> 01:53:13,245
What you call compassion.

1392
01:53:13,412 --> 01:53:15,706
Wanting to protect
and understand the guilty.

1393
01:53:15,872 --> 01:53:19,793
This rotting society,
what it calls rehabilitation.

1394
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:21,420
Nothing short of compromise.

1395
01:53:21,586 --> 01:53:24,172
Is it a compromise
to want to make you well?

1396
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:28,552
There are other men in here with behavior
more extreme than mine, doctor.

1397
01:53:29,219 --> 01:53:32,222
Of course, they're not famous, are they?

1398
01:53:32,597 --> 01:53:35,309
You wanna know about Rorschach?

1399
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,562
I'll tell you about Rorschach.

1400
01:53:39,855 --> 01:53:42,357
Once a man has seen society's
black underbelly...

1401
01:53:42,524 --> 01:53:45,152
...he can never turn his back on it.

1402
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:47,904
Never pretend, like you do...

1403
01:53:48,196 --> 01:53:52,409
...that it doesn't exist, no matter who
orders him to look the other way.

1404
01:53:52,701 --> 01:53:56,246
We don't do this thing...

1405
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:58,540
...because it's permitted.

1406
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:01,752
We do it because we have to.

1407
01:54:02,461 --> 01:54:04,755
We do it because we're compelled.

1408
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:09,009
<i>I was investigating a kidnap case.</i>

1409
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:12,596
<i>Blaire Roche.</i>

1410
01:54:12,763 --> 01:54:16,224
<i>Six-year-old girl. I was young then.</i>

1411
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,436
<i>Too soft on criminals.</i>

1412
01:54:20,354 --> 01:54:21,980
<i>I let them live.</i>

1413
01:54:23,273 --> 01:54:28,987
<i>Broke a man's arm to get a tip.
Led me to the missing girl's location.</i>

1414
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:39,039
<i>I knew the girl was here...</i>

1415
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:42,751
<i>...but when I searched the place,
I saw nothing.</i>

1416
01:54:43,627 --> 01:54:46,046
<i>And then I found her.</i>

1417
01:55:35,387 --> 01:55:37,264
Fred.

1418
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:39,975
Barney.

1419
01:55:40,142 --> 01:55:42,853
Who's gonna bark for Daddy?

1420
01:55:48,316 --> 01:55:51,570
<i>It was dark when the murderer got back.</i>

1421
01:55:53,321 --> 01:55:54,906
<i>As dark as it gets.</i>

1422
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:38,408
Oh, God.
Who's out there? Who is it?

1423
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:41,369
Who is it?

1424
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:55,509
What? What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

1425
01:56:55,675 --> 01:57:00,180
What the fuck do you want?
You killed my dogs, man!

1426
01:57:05,185 --> 01:57:09,731
You think I had something to do
with that girl? I found that.

1427
01:57:09,898 --> 01:57:12,359
What evidence have you got?
That's nothing.

1428
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:23,078
Okay. I confess.

1429
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:26,957
I kidnapped her. I killed her.

1430
01:57:27,749 --> 01:57:29,125
Arrest me.

1431
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:31,670
What? Arrest me!

1432
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:35,257
I did it! I said I did it!

1433
01:57:35,423 --> 01:57:36,841
Christ.

1434
01:57:37,008 --> 01:57:41,304
Look, I've got a problem, man.
Fucking take me in. I need help.

1435
01:57:42,138 --> 01:57:48,853
No, don't. Don't do that.
Take me in. Don't! No!

1436
01:57:53,817 --> 01:57:57,320
Men get arrested.

1437
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:00,782
Dogs get put down.

1438
01:58:08,873 --> 01:58:11,042
<i>Tremors of impact shook my arm.</i>

1439
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:14,796
Warm blood splashed my face.

1440
01:58:16,006 --> 01:58:20,135
Whatever was left of Walter Kovacs
died that night with that little girl.

1441
01:58:21,136 --> 01:58:23,346
From then on, there was only Rorschach.

1442
01:58:24,889 --> 01:58:27,684
See, doctor, God didn't kill that little girl.

1443
01:58:28,143 --> 01:58:32,314
Fate didn't butcher her
and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.

1444
01:58:33,481 --> 01:58:36,901
If God saw what any of us did that night,
he didn't seem to mind.

1445
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:40,655
From then on, I knew:

1446
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:44,326
God doesn't make the world this way.

1447
01:58:46,328 --> 01:58:47,829
We do.

1448
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:56,546
I can't help him.

1449
01:59:08,642 --> 01:59:10,435
Hey, Rorschach.

1450
01:59:11,436 --> 01:59:13,438
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?

1451
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,066
Rorschach, I heard your mother
was a whore.

1452
01:59:16,232 --> 01:59:19,819
Hey, you know what?
I'm pretty famous too.

1453
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:22,530
-Ain't that right? That's right.
-That's right.

1454
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:27,410
Maybe I can give you an autograph.
What you say, big boy?

1455
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:46,179
None of you seem to understand.
I'm not locked in here with you.

1456
01:59:46,346 --> 01:59:48,431
All right, that's it!

1457
01:59:49,265 --> 01:59:51,726
You're locked in here with me.

1458
02:01:10,472 --> 02:01:11,514
Laurie!

1459
02:01:12,724 --> 02:01:14,058
Shit.

1460
02:01:15,059 --> 02:01:16,978
-Hold on.
-Fuck.

1461
02:01:20,231 --> 02:01:21,733
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1462
02:01:26,404 --> 02:01:29,824
I'm so sorry. I was snooping
and must have hit the wrong button.

1463
02:01:29,991 --> 02:01:31,409
-Are you hurt?
-No, no.

1464
02:01:31,576 --> 02:01:34,704
-Okay.
-I'm fine. I just feel so bad.

1465
02:01:34,871 --> 02:01:36,873
No, don't worry.

1466
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:40,335
It's happened before.
Comedian did it back in '77.

1467
02:01:41,419 --> 02:01:43,254
Archie survived that.

1468
02:01:43,713 --> 02:01:45,048
Archie?

1469
02:01:45,757 --> 02:01:49,219
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...

1470
02:01:49,385 --> 02:01:50,929
...Merlin's pet owl.

1471
02:01:52,055 --> 02:01:53,723
Stupid nickname.

1472
02:01:54,766 --> 02:01:57,519
How did you ever afford
all this stuff, anyway?

1473
02:01:57,685 --> 02:02:03,233
Well, my clad was in corporate banking
and left me a lot of money when he died...

1474
02:02:03,942 --> 02:02:07,278
...which always surprised me.
I mean, he was...

1475
02:02:07,946 --> 02:02:10,573
I think he was disappointed
I went into crime fighting...

1476
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:12,450
...instead of following him.

1477
02:02:13,243 --> 02:02:20,250
Guess I was just more interested in
birds and airplanes, mythology and....

1478
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:24,671
Plus, there were enough other guys
doing this so that I didn't feel ridiculous.

1479
02:02:25,588 --> 02:02:26,798
Like Hollis.

1480
02:02:26,965 --> 02:02:28,466
Yeah.

1481
02:02:29,259 --> 02:02:32,011
Yeah, he was my hero.

1482
02:02:33,054 --> 02:02:36,432
Man, I remember the first time
that I met him...

1483
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:40,270
...I just felt so connected, you know?

1484
02:02:40,436 --> 02:02:42,772
To something that mattered.

1485
02:02:45,608 --> 02:02:48,278
Must be nice having a secret identity.

1486
02:02:48,945 --> 02:02:51,114
A secret place that nobody knows about.

1487
02:02:51,281 --> 02:02:56,286
You can just come down here and hang out
without anyone checking up on you.

1488
02:02:57,745 --> 02:03:00,081
Nobody watching you.

1489
02:03:03,418 --> 02:03:04,460
Wanna try those on?

1490
02:03:15,263 --> 02:03:16,931
There we go.

1491
02:03:20,101 --> 02:03:22,103
Wow, these rock.

1492
02:03:24,939 --> 02:03:27,233
They amplify the spectral range.

1493
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,527
Thermal imaging.

1494
02:03:31,195 --> 02:03:33,197
They work even better in the dark.

1495
02:03:38,119 --> 02:03:39,871
You can see me, right?

1496
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,709
I can see everything.

1497
02:03:47,462 --> 02:03:50,965
I remember, no matter how black it got...

1498
02:03:51,299 --> 02:03:55,428
...whenever I looked through those goggles,
everything was as clear as day.

1499
02:03:57,722 --> 02:04:00,058
This must be the way Jon sees the world.

1500
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,396
We should probably head up.
Food's getting cold.

1501
02:04:05,647 --> 02:04:07,732
Put those away when you're done.

1502
02:04:16,699 --> 02:04:19,035
<i>Soviet ambassador
to the U.N. had no comment...</i>

1503
02:04:19,202 --> 02:04:21,496
<i>...when asked if Dr. Manhattan's
disappearance...</i>

1504
02:04:21,663 --> 02:04:23,998
<i>...has fueled Soviet aggression
in Afghanistan.</i>

1505
02:04:24,165 --> 02:04:25,875
Dan.

1506
02:04:26,584 --> 02:04:28,336
Jon sees a lot of things...

1507
02:04:30,713 --> 02:04:33,049
...but he doesn't see me.

1508
02:04:40,181 --> 02:04:41,724
Well, uh....

1509
02:04:59,909 --> 02:05:01,494
Oh.

1510
02:05:35,319 --> 02:05:36,654
Sorry.

1511
02:05:38,656 --> 02:05:39,991
Come here.

1512
02:05:45,955 --> 02:05:47,206
What's the matter?

1513
02:05:47,373 --> 02:05:49,792
-If you could just move a little...
-Okay.

1514
02:05:49,959 --> 02:05:52,211
Yeah. There you go.

1515
02:05:58,718 --> 02:06:01,345
Dan, what's wrong?

1516
02:06:03,014 --> 02:06:04,140
Sorry, l....

1517
02:06:06,309 --> 02:06:08,519
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.

1518
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:12,648
Oh, hell.

1519
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,235
It's okay.

1520
02:06:17,653 --> 02:06:22,075
Maybe we were just moving too fast.

1521
02:06:25,661 --> 02:06:28,289
We've got all the time in the world.

1522
02:06:29,791 --> 02:06:31,793
We'll take it slow.

1523
02:06:45,765 --> 02:06:48,101
It's been a long time, Rorschach.

1524
02:06:48,768 --> 02:06:50,269
Big Figure.

1525
02:06:50,603 --> 02:06:52,438
Small world.

1526
02:06:53,773 --> 02:06:55,274
I like that.

1527
02:06:56,025 --> 02:06:58,444
But you know, it is a small world in here.

1528
02:06:58,861 --> 02:07:01,656
And I've been in it for,
how long now, Lloyd?

1529
02:07:01,823 --> 02:07:03,950
Almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.

1530
02:07:04,283 --> 02:07:05,618
That's right.

1531
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:10,123
Fifteen years since you
and that Owl fella put me away.

1532
02:07:13,126 --> 02:07:14,293
So...

1533
02:07:14,794 --> 02:07:19,549
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying.
Could go any minute.

1534
02:07:19,715 --> 02:07:24,929
You know, by my count, there are more
than 50 people in here that you put away.

1535
02:07:25,096 --> 02:07:29,433
I been talking to every one of them
and they're all dying to get a piece of you.

1536
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:32,895
This place is gonna explode!

1537
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:37,150
Then, you die by inches.

1538
02:07:38,067 --> 02:07:39,735
Tall order.

1539
02:07:39,986 --> 02:07:42,488
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.

1540
02:07:43,156 --> 02:07:46,159
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.

1541
02:07:46,993 --> 02:07:48,327
Come on.

1542
02:09:22,213 --> 02:09:24,298
<i>Know this, my friends.</i>

1543
02:09:24,465 --> 02:09:25,549
<i>Hades is wet.</i>

1544
02:09:26,884 --> 02:09:28,469
<i>Hades is lonely.</i>

1545
02:09:44,318 --> 02:09:48,072
<i>And in that instant, we knew each other.</i>

1546
02:10:24,483 --> 02:10:26,736
I'm sorry, my friend.

1547
02:10:46,964 --> 02:10:49,884
<i>My raft had grown
increasingly grotesque...</i>

1548
02:10:50,468 --> 02:10:53,512
<i>...reflecting my own transformation.</i>

1549
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:11,155
<i>Adrift, my darkest imaginings
welled up unchecked...</i>

1550
02:11:11,322 --> 02:11:14,450
<i>...spilling from brain to heart
like black ink...</i>

1551
02:11:14,617 --> 02:11:17,078
<i>...impossible to remove.</i>

1552
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:28,923
<i>The vessel had surely reached
Davidstown already.</i>

1553
02:11:29,757 --> 02:11:34,136
<i>I pictured quiet streets overrun
by the fiends from the</i> Black Freighter.

1554
02:11:34,303 --> 02:11:37,556
<i>My wife, my children,
most certainly dead.</i>

1555
02:11:37,723 --> 02:11:39,725
<i>My crew, dead.</i>

1556
02:11:39,892 --> 02:11:43,562
<i>The beast I ride on, dead.</i>

1557
02:11:52,488 --> 02:11:55,449
<i>More blood, more blood, more blood.</i>

1558
02:12:09,755 --> 02:12:11,090
Father?

1559
02:12:11,257 --> 02:12:13,717
It can't be. Oh, Lord, it can't be.

1560
02:12:13,884 --> 02:12:17,138
Father, help us. Please.

1561
02:12:17,304 --> 02:12:18,347
Wait.

1562
02:12:20,015 --> 02:12:21,058
I'm coming.

1563
02:12:21,851 --> 02:12:23,185
Hurry, my dear.

1564
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:26,856
Wait. Anyone but them.

1565
02:12:27,022 --> 02:12:28,649
Anyone.

1566
02:12:28,899 --> 02:12:30,484
Anyone.

1567
02:12:34,738 --> 02:12:36,991
<i>I'd swallowed too much seawater.</i>

1568
02:12:37,158 --> 02:12:39,994
<i>I'd swallowed too much horror.</i>

1569
02:12:43,456 --> 02:12:44,707
<i>God has damned me.</i>

1570
02:12:45,875 --> 02:12:48,502
<i>God has damned us all.</i>

1571
02:12:48,669 --> 02:12:54,592
<i>Truly, life is hell, and death's rough hand
our only deliverance.</i>

1572
02:12:55,342 --> 02:12:57,470
<i>I can endure no more.</i>

1573
02:12:57,636 --> 02:13:01,557
<i>I want to join my family desperately.</i>

1574
02:13:09,356 --> 02:13:11,192
<i>Yo, man.</i>

1575
02:13:11,734 --> 02:13:13,569
What you reading?

1576
02:13:14,737 --> 02:13:16,238
Nothing, man.

1577
02:13:17,615 --> 02:13:20,201
-Nothing, huh?
-Hey, hey! You leave that kid alone!

1578
02:13:20,367 --> 02:13:22,077
Shut up, old man!

1579
02:13:30,878 --> 02:13:33,589
You're reading a comic book?
What are you, retarded'?

1580
02:13:40,888 --> 02:13:43,933
Aw, hey, where you going, short bus?

1581
02:13:54,193 --> 02:13:55,528
Dan?

1582
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:04,036
Is everything all right?

1583
02:14:06,372 --> 02:14:09,291
I'm tired of being afraid.

1584
02:14:10,376 --> 02:14:12,753
Afraid of war...

1585
02:14:13,546 --> 02:14:17,132
...afraid of the mask killer...

1586
02:14:18,717 --> 02:14:21,929
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...

1587
02:14:22,096 --> 02:14:24,056
...and how much I need it.

1588
02:14:24,890 --> 02:14:26,559
Me too.

1589
02:14:28,060 --> 02:14:29,353
So to hell with it.

1590
02:14:30,229 --> 02:14:31,564
Let's take Archie out.

1591
02:14:37,486 --> 02:14:38,654
You're serious.

1592
02:14:38,821 --> 02:14:41,323
I used to be a masked avenger too,
remember?

1593
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:44,743
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning
and doing something stupid.

1594
02:15:46,472 --> 02:15:48,557
<i>Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.</i>

1595
02:15:48,724 --> 02:15:51,310
<i>Tenement fire at 5th and Grand.
Rapid burner.</i>

1596
02:15:51,477 --> 02:15:52,811
Let's go.

1597
02:15:57,566 --> 02:15:59,943
-I can see it.
-All right, hold on.

1598
02:16:10,788 --> 02:16:12,247
Dan, there are kids in there.

1599
02:16:12,414 --> 02:16:14,583
Everyone, stay where you are
and remain calm.

1600
02:16:14,750 --> 02:16:16,919
We're gonna get you out of there.

1601
02:16:17,086 --> 02:16:19,254
The roof's starting to cave.
Get me in there.

1602
02:16:19,421 --> 02:16:20,923
I'm gonna get you close.

1603
02:17:19,648 --> 02:17:21,024
Let's go.

1604
02:17:21,191 --> 02:17:22,359
Come on.

1605
02:17:22,526 --> 02:17:24,153
All right, let's move it, people.

1606
02:17:30,868 --> 02:17:35,664
Mom, is that guy in the space rocket...?

1607
02:17:36,123 --> 02:17:38,333
Is that Jesus?

1608
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:40,335
No, baby.

1609
02:17:41,253 --> 02:17:43,380
-Watch your step.
-All right.

1610
02:17:45,716 --> 02:17:46,759
We're all set.

1611
02:17:47,801 --> 02:17:49,470
Is that everyone?

1612
02:18:13,535 --> 02:18:15,829
-Bye.
-Bye!

1613
02:18:19,416 --> 02:18:21,001
I can't believe we did that.

1614
02:18:22,961 --> 02:18:25,422
-They'll lock us up with Rorschach.
-Who cares?

1615
02:18:25,589 --> 02:18:27,549
World War III could start tomorrow.

1616
02:18:29,676 --> 02:18:31,011
Right?

1617
02:18:32,679 --> 02:18:34,014

Come back here!

1647
02:21:03,622 --> 02:21:05,332
He's dead, Rorschach.

1648
02:21:05,499 --> 02:21:09,711
While everyone's distracted, we thought
we'd bring you a housewarming gift.

1649
02:21:09,878 --> 02:21:12,047
Something from the machine shop.

1650
02:21:13,674 --> 02:21:15,300
Hey, boss, you notice?

1651
02:21:15,467 --> 02:21:18,512
None of that "small world,
tall order" crap.

1652
02:21:18,679 --> 02:21:21,890
He knows once we slice open his lock,
he's next on the block.

1653
02:21:22,349 --> 02:21:23,475
Fat chance.

1654
02:21:24,184 --> 02:21:25,310
You're dead, Rorschach!

1655
02:21:25,477 --> 02:21:29,147
We got a prison full of killers out here.
What do you got?

1656
02:21:32,067 --> 02:21:34,528
Your hands, my pleasure.

1657
02:21:36,530 --> 02:21:38,532
Can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?

1658
02:21:38,699 --> 02:21:41,994
This riot won't last.
I been waiting 15 years for this.

1659
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:46,498
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way
of my revenge.

1660
02:21:50,210 --> 02:21:51,920
Nothing personal, big guy.

1661
02:21:53,380 --> 02:21:55,382
Boss! Wait!

1662
02:22:09,521 --> 02:22:11,314
Now you find out what the score is.

1663
02:22:11,773 --> 02:22:14,901
One-nothing. Come and get me.

1664
02:22:20,949 --> 02:22:22,617
Come on.

1665
02:22:22,784 --> 02:22:24,411
<i>So I've been thinking.</i>

1666
02:22:25,328 --> 02:22:29,499
I feel that we have an obligation
to our fraternity.

1667
02:22:30,333 --> 02:22:33,420
-I think we ought to spring Rorschach.
-What'?

1668
02:22:33,587 --> 02:22:35,338
Someone set him up.

1669
02:22:36,173 --> 02:22:39,801
And this whole cancer thing with Jon,
it just doesn't make sense.

1670
02:22:39,968 --> 02:22:41,887
You didn't get it.

1671
02:22:42,179 --> 02:22:44,639
Yeah, but breaking
into a maximum-security prison...

1672
02:22:44,806 --> 02:22:48,477
-...is a little different than putting out a fire.
-Yeah, you're right.

1673
02:22:49,352 --> 02:22:51,188
It'll be more fun.

1674
02:22:55,358 --> 02:22:58,361
Hurry, Lloyd. I wanna
smell this son of a bitch cooking.

1675
02:23:03,658 --> 02:23:05,368
Yes.

1676
02:23:10,123 --> 02:23:11,166
No.

1677
02:23:25,055 --> 02:23:29,893
Never disposed of sewage
with a toilet before. Obvious, really.

1678
02:23:30,727 --> 02:23:34,022
Two-nothing. Your move.

1679
02:23:37,359 --> 02:23:39,027
Get out of the way!

1680
02:24:05,929 --> 02:24:07,806
How do we know he's still alive?

1681
02:24:10,058 --> 02:24:11,268
He's alive.

1682
02:24:23,029 --> 02:24:24,573
No. No.

1683
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:26,616
Where's my face?

1684
02:24:29,161 --> 02:24:30,912
Don't kill me.

1685
02:24:34,583 --> 02:24:35,959
Your turn, doctor.

1686
02:24:36,126 --> 02:24:39,337
Tell me, what do you see?

1687
02:26:05,507 --> 02:26:07,217
Don't move!

1688
02:26:15,517 --> 02:26:17,269
Rorschach.

1689
02:26:17,769 --> 02:26:20,563
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.

1690
02:26:20,730 --> 02:26:24,150
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.

1691
02:26:24,693 --> 02:26:26,653
Oh, for chrissake.

1692
02:27:03,857 --> 02:27:05,984
Good to see you in uniform, Daniel.

1693
02:27:06,151 --> 02:27:09,571
Should've known all you needed
was nice pair of legs to motivate you.

1694
02:27:09,738 --> 02:27:13,992
-You're such an asshole, Rorschach.
-Spare me indignation.

1695
02:27:15,243 --> 02:27:18,246
Picked hell of a time
to be unfaithful to Jon.

1696
02:27:18,413 --> 02:27:21,249
Get tired of being patriotic,
or someone put you up to it?

1697
02:27:21,416 --> 02:27:24,085
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

1698
02:27:24,252 --> 02:27:28,089
Hey! Would you two stop?
You can argue later.

1699
02:27:28,256 --> 02:27:32,010
I had to turn the screechers off,
so we'll be drawing fire soon.

1700
02:27:36,014 --> 02:27:38,391
Stop! Stop or we will shoot!

1701
02:28:17,263 --> 02:28:19,391
Are you all right?

1702
02:28:20,809 --> 02:28:23,019
Yeah. Just...

1703
02:28:23,478 --> 02:28:24,729
...heavy, you know?

1704
02:28:25,522 --> 02:28:27,649
War, jailbreak.

1705
02:28:28,149 --> 02:28:33,029
Don't worry about it. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

1706
02:28:38,034 --> 02:28:41,079
-Hello, Laurie.
-Jon.

1707
02:28:41,246 --> 02:28:44,874
-TV said you were on Mars.
-I am on Mars.

1708
02:28:45,458 --> 02:28:47,836
You and I are about
to have a conversation there.

1709
02:28:48,002 --> 02:28:49,504
What are you talking about?

1710
02:28:49,671 --> 02:28:52,340
You're going to try to convince me
to save the world.

1711
02:28:58,221 --> 02:29:01,224
-Laurie, don't.
-Dan, trust me.

1712
02:29:01,391 --> 02:29:03,059
I have to go.

1713
02:29:08,731 --> 02:29:10,733
Beautiful, isn't it?

1714
02:29:15,572 --> 02:29:18,533
Forgive me. These things sometimes
slip my mind.

1715
02:29:19,909 --> 02:29:21,744
It won't happen again.

1716
02:29:23,413 --> 02:29:25,415
That's comforting.

1717
02:29:27,750 --> 02:29:29,419
Oh, my God.

1718
02:29:30,086 --> 02:29:31,921
I'm on Mars.

1719
02:29:35,925 --> 02:29:39,804
-Hey. Nice ass.
-Hey, asshole.

1720
02:29:39,971 --> 02:29:42,557
Hey, let's see if that comic-book
retard's up here.

1721
02:29:43,391 --> 02:29:45,310
Hey, hey, hey. Yo.

1722
02:29:45,477 --> 02:29:50,190
You all hear? Some super-owl dude
just busted Rorschach out of prison.

1723
02:29:50,356 --> 02:29:52,066
-Rorschach?
-Yeah.

1724
02:29:52,233 --> 02:29:54,110
That fool put my cousin in a wheelchair.

1725
02:29:54,277 --> 02:29:57,155
You mean Nite Owl.
Him and Rorschach used to be partners.

1726
02:29:57,322 --> 02:29:59,991
-Yeah.
-Maybe he messed your cousin up too.

1727
02:30:00,158 --> 02:30:02,410
-Didn't he write a book or something?
-Yeah.

1728
02:30:02,577 --> 02:30:06,414
You know, he lives over a garage
right near here.

1729
02:30:06,581 --> 02:30:09,250
-Yeah?
-Does he, now?

1730
02:30:12,003 --> 02:30:13,171
<i>Hello?</i>

1731
02:30:14,172 --> 02:30:16,174
Sally?

1732
02:30:16,341 --> 02:30:19,260
<i>-Hollis?</i>
-Yeah.

1733
02:30:19,511 --> 02:30:23,431
Yes, Hollis Mason. Jesus.

1734
02:30:24,224 --> 02:30:28,853
All this time you've had my number and
you wait until our sunset years to use it?

1735
02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:31,814
Well, it seemed like
a special occasion, Sal.

1736
02:30:31,981 --> 02:30:33,107
<i>What?</i>

1737
02:30:33,274 --> 02:30:37,529
The TV is reporting there was
a tenement fire last night.

1738
02:30:38,404 --> 02:30:41,199
<i>There were trapped people
rescued by airship...</i>

1739
02:30:41,366 --> 02:30:46,955
<i>...and they say the pilot
was dressed like an owl.</i>

1740
02:30:47,121 --> 02:30:49,290
<i>And it seems he had
a sexy woman with him.</i>

1741
02:30:49,457 --> 02:30:52,085
Laurie? My daughter, Laurie?

1742
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:56,798
I can't get over Laurie back in costume.

1743
02:30:56,965 --> 02:31:00,468
Maybe she'll finally thank me
for getting her started in the first place.

1744
02:31:00,635 --> 02:31:04,222
You know, Sal,
by the sound of your voice...

1745
02:31:04,389 --> 02:31:06,140
...you're sounding younger than ever.

1746
02:31:06,307 --> 02:31:08,601
<i>Oh. Why, bless you, Hollis.</i>

1747
02:31:09,269 --> 02:31:11,312
But that's probably just senility.

1748
02:31:14,065 --> 02:31:16,985
Well, it's been great talking to you, Sal...

1749
02:31:17,151 --> 02:31:19,529
...but someone's knocking.

1750
02:31:20,071 --> 02:31:25,076
Well, don't get too misty-eyed
thinking about old times.

1751
02:31:25,952 --> 02:31:27,787
You take care now, Hollis.

1752
02:31:27,954 --> 02:31:29,247
<i>Ah, you too.</i>

1753
02:31:29,414 --> 02:31:30,665
Bye.

1754
02:31:31,207 --> 02:31:32,709
Bye.

1755
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:38,464
We're looking for Mr. Owl.

1756
02:31:39,340 --> 02:31:41,509
Yeah. Hold your horses.

1757
02:31:41,676 --> 02:31:43,261
Mr. Owl, you there?

1758
02:31:43,845 --> 02:31:45,221
Trick or treat.

1759
02:31:46,848 --> 02:31:48,433
You should've stayed retired, Owl.

1760
02:32:53,665 --> 02:32:55,249
<i>I hate this.</i>

1761
02:32:55,416 --> 02:32:59,629
Cowering in cave,
hiding from authorities.

1762
02:32:59,879 --> 02:33:03,091
Cops are out there hunting us.
Unless you wanna go back to prison...

1763
02:33:03,257 --> 02:33:05,718
...we'd be stupid to expose ourselves
without a plan.

1764
02:33:05,885 --> 02:33:08,137
And what would that be?

1765
02:33:08,471 --> 02:33:12,183
Once we've established a pattern...

1766
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:14,727
...we can break into Pyramid,
see what we find.

1767
02:33:14,894 --> 02:33:17,313
Did that. Dead end.

1768
02:33:17,480 --> 02:33:22,110
I think it's a front company for whoever's
really behind it, but can't prove it.

1769
02:33:25,029 --> 02:33:29,367
We need to hit up underworld contacts,
squeeze people.

1770
02:33:29,534 --> 02:33:32,286
Sure, why don't we just pick names
out of a phone book?

1771
02:33:32,453 --> 02:33:34,580
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.

1772
02:33:34,747 --> 02:33:39,210
You've gone too soft. Too trusting.
Especially with women.

1773
02:33:39,377 --> 02:33:41,462
Okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.

1774
02:33:41,629 --> 02:33:43,673
God, who do you
think you are, Rorschach?

1775
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:45,967
You live off people
while insulting them...

1776
02:33:46,134 --> 02:33:49,929
...and no one complains because they think
you're a goddamn lunatic.

1777
02:34:01,899 --> 02:34:03,735
I'm sorry.

1778
02:34:06,404 --> 02:34:08,573
I shouldn't have said that, man.

1779
02:34:10,575 --> 02:34:11,909
Daniel...

1780
02:34:13,411 --> 02:34:15,872
...you are a good friend.

1781
02:34:18,750 --> 02:34:21,919
I know it can be difficult
with me sometimes.

1782
02:34:28,426 --> 02:34:29,927
Forget it.

1783
02:34:31,095 --> 02:34:32,764
It's okay, man.

1784
02:34:34,015 --> 02:34:35,641
Let's do it your way.

1785
02:34:50,985 --> 02:34:53,914
♪ Plays it with
finesse and grace

1786
02:34:54,702 --> 02:34:55,995
Oh, God.

1787
02:34:56,162 --> 02:34:59,739
Pyramid Transnational.
Anyone heard of it?

1788
02:35:00,336 --> 02:35:02,146
♪ Pickin' the bass
And singin' the blues ♪

1789
02:35:08,007 --> 02:35:09,509
Oh, you bastards.

1790
02:35:09,675 --> 02:35:12,762
I buy everyone a round
and you sell me out like this?

1791
02:35:13,971 --> 02:35:17,266
Back off, or I'll stick this glass
in your squidgy face.

1792
02:35:18,976 --> 02:35:21,896
Everybody stay calm.
We'll try to keep this brief.

1793
02:35:24,023 --> 02:35:26,192
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.

1794
02:35:26,359 --> 02:35:30,863
Tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now.
Did you know him?

1795
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:32,698
No.

1796
02:35:34,075 --> 02:35:35,326
Yeah, yeah!

1797
02:35:35,493 --> 02:35:38,412
-I hired him. I knew him from the inside.
-You're a felon.

1798
02:35:38,579 --> 02:35:41,582
I was. I've been straight
ever since I got out, I swear.

1799
02:35:41,749 --> 02:35:45,461
I barely knew Chess that well,
but I was told to hire from the old life.

1800
02:35:45,628 --> 02:35:49,257
-Told by whom?
-My contact, Miss Slater.

1801
02:35:49,423 --> 02:35:52,009
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?

1802
02:35:52,176 --> 02:35:56,138
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring
ex-cons was part of the company program.

1803
02:35:56,305 --> 02:36:00,017
Give people a second chance.
God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!

1804
02:36:04,146 --> 02:36:07,400
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.

1805
02:36:07,567 --> 02:36:10,278
Adrian might help us
find out who's underwriting Pyramid.

1806
02:36:10,444 --> 02:36:11,487
Follow the money.

1807
02:36:11,654 --> 02:36:14,949
<i>--former member of the

1812
02:36:30,590 --> 02:36:33,593
-Who did it?
-I knew you were gonna victimize me, man.

1813
02:36:33,759 --> 02:36:35,887
What about my civil rights?
Just because I'm wearing--

1814
02:36:36,053 --> 02:36:39,140
-Tell me who did it!
-A lot of people dress like this.

1815
02:36:40,474 --> 02:36:42,351
Who murdered Hollis Mason?

1816
02:36:48,024 --> 02:36:50,318
You tell your friends they're dead.

1817
02:36:50,484 --> 02:36:54,030
I'm gonna take out this entire
rathole neighborhood.

1818
02:36:54,196 --> 02:36:56,699
I'll break your neck!

1819
02:36:57,283 --> 02:37:00,286
Daniel, not in front of the civilians.

1820
02:37:00,870 --> 02:37:03,664
Oh, goddamn. Goddamn, Hollis.

1821
02:37:13,716 --> 02:37:16,886
This is where we hold our conversation.

1822
02:37:17,511 --> 02:37:21,390
In it, you reveal to me that you and
Dreiberg have been sleeping together.

1823
02:37:22,558 --> 02:37:25,937
-You know about me and Dan'?
-Not yet.

1824
02:37:26,228 --> 02:37:29,065
But in a few moments
you're going to tell me.

1825
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:36,447
If you already know the future, then why
were you surprised when I left you?

1826
02:37:36,614 --> 02:37:38,824
Or when that reporter ambushed you?

1827
02:37:38,991 --> 02:37:42,620
Why even argue about it
if you already know how this is gonna end?

1828
02:37:43,788 --> 02:37:46,040
I have no choice.

1829
02:37:47,375 --> 02:37:50,294
Everything is preordained.

1830
02:37:50,461 --> 02:37:52,797
Even my responses.

1831
02:37:53,756 --> 02:37:57,385
And you're just going through
the motions.

1832
02:37:57,551 --> 02:38:00,930
The most powerful thing in the universe
is still just a puppet.

1833
02:38:04,058 --> 02:38:06,727
We are all puppets, Laurie.

1834
02:38:07,687 --> 02:38:10,189
I'm just a puppet
who can see the strings.

1835
02:38:10,356 --> 02:38:12,066
And what if you're wrong?

1836
02:38:12,233 --> 02:38:16,737
Why does my perception of time
distress you so?

1837
02:38:16,904 --> 02:38:18,781
Because it's inhuman.

1838
02:38:18,948 --> 02:38:21,367
Because it makes me insane.

1839
02:38:21,534 --> 02:38:25,413
You always say you wanna comfort me.
Well, it isn't working.

1840
02:38:32,837 --> 02:38:35,339
Look, I don't wanna fight.

1841
02:38:36,841 --> 02:38:39,593
I'm sorry I slept with Dan.

1842
02:38:40,136 --> 02:38:42,179
You slept with Dan?

1843
02:38:43,889 --> 02:38:46,892
You just said that you already
knew about that.

1844
02:38:47,601 --> 02:38:51,605
I said often...

1845
02:38:52,273 --> 02:38:56,610
...that you were my only
remaining link to humanity.

1846
02:38:59,030 --> 02:39:00,531
Why would I save a world...

1847
02:39:00,698 --> 02:39:02,825
...I no longer have any stake in?

1848
02:39:04,952 --> 02:39:06,996
Then do it for me.

1849
02:39:07,872 --> 02:39:09,290
If you really care.

1850
02:39:09,457 --> 02:39:12,877
When you left me, I left Earth.

1851
02:39:13,044 --> 02:39:15,963
Does that not show you that I care?

1852
02:39:19,133 --> 02:39:22,094
My red world here, now...

1853
02:39:23,095 --> 02:39:25,973
...means more to me than your blue one.

1854
02:39:26,766 --> 02:39:28,476
Let me show you.

1855
02:39:46,619 --> 02:39:49,538
<i>Bombers are fueled and ready, sir.</i>

1856
02:39:58,881 --> 02:40:01,133
It's time, gentlemen.

1857
02:40:03,219 --> 02:40:05,638
Take us to DEFCON one.

1858
02:40:12,895 --> 02:40:16,023
Not in penthouse. Not in office.

1859
02:40:16,190 --> 02:40:19,068
What nocturnal proclivities
entice a man with everything...

1860
02:40:19,235 --> 02:40:21,028
...out into the night at this hour?

1861
02:40:23,072 --> 02:40:24,949
Daniel?

1862
02:40:26,200 --> 02:40:27,952
You with me?

1863
02:40:28,744 --> 02:40:31,872
-Yeah.
-Then what are you doing?

1864
02:40:33,999 --> 02:40:35,751
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.

1865
02:40:35,918 --> 02:40:38,712
Maybe he keeps on file.

1866
02:40:43,217 --> 02:40:45,678
-Something's not right.
-Agreed.

1867
02:40:45,845 --> 02:40:50,599
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess
all work for Pyramid.

1868
02:40:50,766 --> 02:40:55,396
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list
with his and Slater's name on it.

1869
02:40:55,563 --> 02:40:58,899
Whoever owns Pyramid
could be giving these people cancer.

1870
02:40:59,066 --> 02:41:01,527
Setting Manhattan up.

1871
02:41:15,666 --> 02:41:16,834
Funny.

1872
02:41:17,001 --> 02:41:20,504
Ancient pharaohs looked forward
to the end of the world.

1873
02:41:20,671 --> 02:41:25,718
Believed cadavers would rise,
reclaim hearts from golden jars.

1874
02:41:26,343 --> 02:41:28,971
Must currently be holding breath
in anticipation.

1875
02:41:29,138 --> 02:41:30,389
Pharaohs?

1876
02:41:37,271 --> 02:41:39,273
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.

1877
02:41:39,940 --> 02:41:42,401
See what the corporate head-peepers say.

1878
02:41:44,445 --> 02:41:46,947
"Subject continues
to retreat emotionally.

1879
02:41:49,283 --> 02:41:52,328
If the only remaining ties
were to be severed...

1880
02:41:52,953 --> 02:41:56,916
...we predict total detachment
from the human condition."

1881
02:42:01,003 --> 02:42:02,796
I'm in.

1882
02:42:31,659 --> 02:42:32,993
No.

1883
02:42:35,162 --> 02:42:40,918
Congratulations, Mr. Veidt.
Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.

1884
02:42:41,085 --> 02:42:44,964
Your support and your enthusiasm...

1885
02:42:45,130 --> 02:42:47,424
...is what has led to this triumph.

1886
02:42:47,591 --> 02:42:51,637
On behalf of the research team,
we salute you.

1887
02:42:51,804 --> 02:42:54,223
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1888
02:42:55,015 --> 02:42:59,144
What in life
does not deserve celebrating?

1889
02:43:00,062 --> 02:43:04,191
This is the new Karnak.

1890
02:43:04,358 --> 02:43:07,945
This represents the culmination of a dream
more than 2000 years old...

1891
02:43:08,112 --> 02:43:14,368
...a dream now assured
because of your unquestioning assistance.

1892
02:43:16,537 --> 02:43:18,205
And for this...

1893
02:43:19,039 --> 02:43:21,375
...I am ashamed...

1894
02:43:22,543 --> 02:43:26,880
...ashamed that you must now share
such inadequate a reward.

1895
02:43:28,549 --> 02:43:30,551
To the pharaohs...

1896
02:43:31,468 --> 02:43:34,471
...their greatest secrets
entrusted to their servants...

1897
02:43:35,097 --> 02:43:39,435
...buried alive with them
in sand-floored chambers.

1898
02:43:40,311 --> 02:43:42,730
Sleep well, gentlemen.

1899
02:43:43,397 --> 02:43:46,734
Our new, peaceful world
will be indebted...

1900
02:43:47,067 --> 02:43:49,611
...to your great sacrifice.

1901
02:43:50,571 --> 02:43:52,740
Bubastis.

1902

<i>Rorschach's journal. Final entry.</i>

1903
02:44:00,247 --> 02:44:02,750
<i>Veidt's behind everything.</i>

1904
02:44:02,916 --> 02:44:04,543
<i>Why?</i>

1905
02:44:04,710 --> 02:44:06,754
<i>What's his endgame?</i>

1906
02:44:06,920 --> 02:44:10,591
<i>I cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent.</i>

1907
02:44:10,799 --> 02:44:14,261
<i>Used to joke he was fast enough
to catch a bullet.</i>

1908
02:44:14,428 --> 02:44:17,306
<i>He could kill us both alone in the snow.</i>

1909
02:44:17,473 --> 02:44:21,185
<i>That's where we're going now:
Antarctica.</i>

1910
02:44:21,352 --> 02:44:24,104
<i>Whether I'm alive or dead
upon this reading...</i>

1911
02:44:24,271 --> 02:44:28,567
<i>...I hope the world survives long enough
for this journal to reach you.</i>

1912
02:44:28,734 --> 02:44:31,278
<i>I live my life free of compromise...</i>

1913
02:44:31,445 --> 02:44:35,407
<i>...and step into the shadow
without complaint or regret.</i>

<i>Rorschach, November 1st.</i>

1915
02:44:44,792 --> 02:44:47,211
Oh, God help us.

1916
02:44:50,297 --> 02:44:52,716
-It's a little early for you, huh?
-Yeah.

1917
02:44:52,883 --> 02:44:55,135
I wanted to finish
the story before school.

1918
02:45:00,599 --> 02:45:04,061
Listen, now you just keep it, okay?

1919
02:45:05,187 --> 02:45:07,815
-Huh?
-It's yours.

1920
02:45:07,981 --> 02:45:10,901
I mean, life's too short, right?

1921
02:45:11,151 --> 02:45:12,486
Yeah.

1922
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:14,154
Uh....

1923
02:45:14,321 --> 02:45:15,906
Thanks, man.

1924
02:45:41,348 --> 02:45:43,684
Why does death pass me by?

1925
02:45:46,770 --> 02:45:48,439
Davidstown?

1926
02:45:49,690 --> 02:45:51,400
Davidstown.

1927
02:45:51,692 --> 02:45:54,111
<i>I was only miles away.</i>

1928
02:45:54,278 --> 02:45:56,029
<i>By now the town was overrun.</i>

1929
02:45:56,572 --> 02:45:59,616
<i>The fiends imagined themselves
safe from me.</i>

1930
02:45:59,783 --> 02:46:01,160
<i>But now I was home.</i>

1931
02:46:01,326 --> 02:46:03,704
<i>And revenge would be mine.</i>

1932
02:46:11,378 --> 02:46:14,089
<i>No, not the brigands
from the</i> Black Freighter.

1933
02:46:14,256 --> 02:46:17,384
<i>The man I recognized,
a moneylender from Davidstown.</i>

1934
02:46:17,759 --> 02:46:19,887
<i>With Davidstown certainly captured...</i>

1935
02:46:20,053 --> 02:46:23,223
<i>...why would this scoundrel
and his Wench be allowed free passage...</i>

1936
02:46:23,390 --> 02:46:24,641
<i>...for this midnight tryst?</i>

1937
02:46:24,808 --> 02:46:26,059
<i>Had he collaborated?</i>

1938
02:46:26,226 --> 02:46:27,644
<i>Had he betrayed my people?</i>

1939
02:46:28,061 --> 02:46:30,814
<i>-My family?</i>
-Come and get it, babe.

1940
02:46:31,273 --> 02:46:32,483
Here.

1941
02:46:41,575 --> 02:46:43,744
<i>My heart grew cold.</i>

1942
02:46:43,911 --> 02:46:47,080
<i>Was my wife comforted
before her execution...</i>

1943
02:46:47,247 --> 02:46:51,293
<i>...while this collaborator
and his pirate masters sneered?</i>

1944
02:46:51,752 --> 02:46:54,087
<i>My decision was hurried,
but not difficult.</i>

1945
02:46:54,254 --> 02:46:55,589
Who are you? What?

1946
02:46:58,258 --> 02:47:01,762
<i>His head burst,
as if pressurized by the guilt within.</i>

1947
02:47:11,313 --> 02:47:13,899
<i>A buccaneer's whore deserves no pity.</i>

1948
02:47:18,028 --> 02:47:20,197
<i>Two figures had ridden here.</i>

1949
02:47:20,364 --> 02:47:23,200
<i>Two must ride back.</i>

1950
02:47:27,329 --> 02:47:29,748
<i>A pirate sentry.</i>

1951
02:47:29,915 --> 02:47:34,002
<i>I trotted unhurriedly to avoid suspicion.</i>

1952
02:47:34,962 --> 02:47:38,090
<i>Their violation did not stop
with the good people of Davidstown...</i>

1953
02:47:38,257 --> 02:47:42,427
<i>...but had cut deeply,
infecting my beloved homeland.</i>

1954
02:47:42,594 --> 02:47:45,889
<i>My Davidstown was not as I last saw it.</i>

1955
02:47:46,056 --> 02:47:49,977
<i>Already it was afflicted
with the curse of the</i> Black Freighter.

1956
02:47:50,143 --> 02:47:56,483
<i>Soon, I would venture amongst evil men,
butchers who now reside in my home...</i>

1957
02:47:56,650 --> 02:47:58,318
<i>...and make them fear me.</i>

1958
02:48:00,904 --> 02:48:05,826
<i>Upon my return home,
I found the streets conspicuously silent.</i>

1959
02:48:07,828 --> 02:48:10,664
<i>I entered my former residence
noiselessly.</i>

1960
02:48:11,331 --> 02:48:17,170
<i>Careful not to rouse the pirate butchers
occupying it from their debauched slumber.</i>

1961
02:48:23,010 --> 02:48:25,012
<i>Unaware that death was amongst them...</i>

1962
02:48:25,345 --> 02:48:30,434
<i>...they would know its dark embrace
without ever understanding why.</i>

1963
02:48:30,601 --> 02:48:33,645
<i>One, however, was awake. Frantic.</i>

1964
02:48:33,812 --> 02:48:35,188
<i>Lest he should raise alarms...</i>

1965
02:48:35,355 --> 02:48:39,151
<i>...I set upon him as he entered
the night-wrapped chamber.</i>

1966
02:48:39,860 --> 02:48:41,903
<i>No pirates come, but something worse.</i>

1967
02:48:43,572 --> 02:48:44,615
Father?

1968
02:48:44,781 --> 02:48:49,411
<i>I look up into faces familiar,
save for their terror.</i>

1969
02:48:49,703 --> 02:48:53,040
<i>Through puffed and bloodied lips,
she mouthed my name.</i>

1970
02:48:53,206 --> 02:48:56,501
My love, why?

1971
02:49:01,006 --> 02:49:06,511
<i>There came an understanding so large
it left no room for sanity.</i>

1972
02:49:07,304 --> 02:49:09,014
<i>So I ran.</i>

1973
02:49:09,514 --> 02:49:11,391
What's happened to her?

1974
02:49:12,267 --> 02:49:13,727
You.

1975
02:49:15,062 --> 02:49:20,817
<i>The knowledge of my damnation paced me,
shouting, celebrating its awful victory.</i>

1976
02:49:20,984 --> 02:49:22,736
<i>My deduction was flawless.</i>

1977
02:49:22,903 --> 02:49:24,988
<i>The</i> Black Freighter
<i>was heading to Davidstown.</i>

1978
02:49:25,155 --> 02:49:28,033
<i>-It should have arrived.</i>
-He went that way!

1979
02:49:28,825 --> 02:49:32,371
<i>Can't you just tell me how
this ends and save us the trouble?</i>

1980
02:49:33,330 --> 02:49:35,248
It ends with you in tears.

1981
02:49:35,415 --> 02:49:39,002
Tears? So you don't come back to Earth.

1982
02:49:39,169 --> 02:49:42,589
At some point, yes.

1983
02:49:43,674 --> 02:49:46,593
The streets are filled with death.

1984
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:48,845
Jon, please.

1985
02:49:49,012 --> 02:49:53,600
You have to stop this. Everyone will die.

1986
02:49:53,767 --> 02:49:58,105
And the universe will not even notice.

1987
02:50:00,524 --> 02:50:04,778
In my opinion, the existence of life...

1988
02:50:05,612 --> 02:50:08,615
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.

1989
02:50:10,534 --> 02:50:12,828
Just look around you.

1990
02:50:15,580 --> 02:50:19,918
Mars gets along perfectly well
without so much as a microorganism.

1991
02:50:20,544 --> 02:50:25,132
Here, it's a constantly changing
topographical map...

1992
02:50:25,298 --> 02:50:31,221
...flowing and shifting around the pole
in ripples 10,000 years wide.

1993
02:50:32,055 --> 02:50:33,557
So tell me...

1994
02:50:33,724 --> 02:50:38,103
...how would all of this be greatly improved
by an oil pipeline?

1995
02:50:38,562 --> 02:50:40,564
By a shopping mall?

1996
02:50:44,901 --> 02:50:49,197
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?

1997
02:50:49,364 --> 02:50:51,491
Miracles, by their definition,
are meaningless.

1998
02:50:51,658 --> 02:50:53,160
Oh, God, Jon!

1999
02:50:53,326 --> 02:50:58,415
-Only what can happen does happen.
-Just stop your bullshit.

2000
02:50:59,499 --> 02:51:02,002
Land this thing. Now.

2001
02:51:02,169 --> 02:51:04,755
As you wish.

2002
02:51:10,343 --> 02:51:11,428
You know what?

2003
02:51:11,595 --> 02:51:14,306
You can send me back to Earth
to fry with Dan and my mom...

2004
02:51:14,473 --> 02:51:16,850
...and all the other worthless humans.

2005
02:51:17,017 --> 02:51:20,437
But know that you were wrong.
You said this ended with me in tears...

2006
02:51:20,604 --> 02:51:24,775
...and look: nothing.
Maybe you were wrong about everything.

2007
02:51:24,941 --> 02:51:30,197
You complain that I refuse to see life
on life's terms...

2008
02:51:30,947 --> 02:51:34,701
...yet you continuously refuse
to see things from my perspective.

2009
02:51:34,868 --> 02:51:39,289
-You shut out what you're afraid of.
-I'm not afraid.

2010
02:51:39,456 --> 02:51:44,503
You want me to see things your way?
Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.

2011
02:51:51,635 --> 02:51:56,723
Magic. Dreams. That is what I had before.
I was a hero, goddamn it!

2012
02:51:56,890 --> 02:51:59,976
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

2013
02:52:00,143 --> 02:52:02,270
I put food on the table
for you and your child.

2014
02:52:02,437 --> 02:52:05,232
Call your friend Eddie.
Maybe he can give you a better life.

2015
02:52:05,982 --> 02:52:08,693
Even the grimy parts of it...

2016
02:52:09,069 --> 02:52:11,279
...keep on getting brighter.

2017
02:52:11,613 --> 02:52:15,242
You know, your mom, she was one

-Take your hands off her.

2019
02:52:19,996 --> 02:52:22,123
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

2020
02:52:22,290 --> 02:52:25,085
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

2021
02:52:25,585 --> 02:52:27,420
Now.

2022
02:52:28,421 --> 02:52:30,423
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

2023
02:52:30,590 --> 02:52:34,427
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

2024
02:52:35,095 --> 02:52:36,805
...you know, old friend's daughter?

2025

<i>It was a mistake. One time.</i>

2027
02:52:49,568 --> 02:52:52,737
Guy tries to rape you, and years later,
you let him finish the job?

2028
02:52:52,946 --> 02:52:55,657
What? Were you drunk or just lonely?

2029
02:52:55,824 --> 02:52:58,785
Am I ever gonna live this down'?

2030
02:53:02,122 --> 02:53:03,290
Laurie.

2031
02:53:08,128 --> 02:53:09,462
No.

2032
02:53:11,464 --> 02:53:13,967
No, not him.

2033
02:53:14,134 --> 02:53:16,261
The Comedian...

2034
02:53:16,636 --> 02:53:18,763
...was your father.

2035
02:53:20,223 --> 02:53:21,933
No.

2036
02:53:25,228 --> 02:53:30,942
No! No! No!

2037
02:54:03,516 --> 02:54:05,518
My life is just...

2038
02:54:06,186 --> 02:54:08,355
...one big joke.

2039
02:54:08,521 --> 02:54:11,066
I don't think your life is a joke.

2040
02:54:12,692 --> 02:54:14,694
Yeah, well...

2041
02:54:16,529 --> 02:54:20,700
...I'm sorry if I don't
trust your sense of humor.

2042
02:54:28,875 --> 02:54:30,543
Will you smile...

2043
02:54:32,212 --> 02:54:34,714
...if I admit I was wrong?

2044
02:54:37,550 --> 02:54:39,552
About what?

2045
02:54:41,554 --> 02:54:43,056
Miracles.

2046
02:54:44,724 --> 02:54:47,894
Events with astronomical odds
of occurring...

2047
02:54:48,728 --> 02:54:51,231
...like oxygen turning into gold.

2048
02:54:51,398 --> 02:54:56,236
I've longed to witness such an event,
and yet I neglect...

2049
02:54:56,903 --> 02:54:59,280
...that in human coupling...

2050
02:55:00,073 --> 02:55:03,952
...millions upon millions of cells
compete to create life...

2051
02:55:04,411 --> 02:55:07,247
...for generation after generation...

2052
02:55:08,081 --> 02:55:11,167
...until finally, your mother...

2053
02:55:11,543 --> 02:55:12,752
...loves a man...

2054
02:55:13,378 --> 02:55:16,965
...Edward Blake, the Comedian,
a man she has every reason to hate...

2055
02:55:17,132 --> 02:55:21,136
...and out of that contradiction,
against unfathomable odds...

2056
02:55:21,803 --> 02:55:23,722
...it's you--

2057
02:55:25,432 --> 02:55:26,766

--that emerged.

2060
02:55:31,604 --> 02:55:36,109
To distill so specific a form...

2061
02:55:36,276 --> 02:55:38,570
...from all that chaos...

2062
02:55:40,447 --> 02:55:43,450
...is like turning air into gold.

2063
02:55:47,787 --> 02:55:49,789
A miracle.

2064
02:55:53,293 --> 02:55:54,794
And so...

2065

So...

...I had to kill him.

2107
03:00:44,584 --> 03:00:48,379
Then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.

2108
03:00:48,546 --> 03:00:51,007
I put roughly $2 billion
into tachyon research...

...to block Jon's vision of the future.

2110

You used his psych profile
to manipulate him.

<i>Got him to leave the planet.</i>

2112
03:00:57,764 --> 03:01:01,184
I've known Jon long enough
to see he isn't devoid of emotion.

2113
03:01:01,351 --> 03:01:05,271
His subtle facial twitches wouldn't be
noticed by the layman, but to me...

2114
03:01:05,438 --> 03:01:07,273
<i>...he might as well have been sobbing.</i>

2115
03:01:07,607 --> 03:01:10,777
<i>All I needed to do was tug on the thread.</i>

2116
03:01:10,943 --> 03:01:12,820
<i>The sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...</i>

2117
03:01:12,987 --> 03:01:16,616
<i>...when he came to believe
he'd given cancer to the people he loved...</i>

2118
03:01:16,783 --> 03:01:18,910
<i>...was all the excuse he needed
to leave Earth.</i>

2119
03:01:19,077 --> 03:01:22,914
<i>Your bullshit assassin.
You paid him to throw us off.</i>

<i>Mr. Chess gave his life
in the service of a higher cause, Dan.</i>

2121
03:01:29,879 --> 03:01:32,965
<i>I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...</i>

<i>...leaving only one loose end:</i>

2123
03:01:36,344 --> 03:01:39,806
You, and your mask-killer theory...

2124
03:01:39,972 --> 03:01:43,101
<i>...one you followed
with the tenacity of a true sociopath.</i>

2125
03:01:43,267 --> 03:01:44,977
<i>I tipped off the police.</i>

2126
03:01:45,144 --> 03:01:47,522
Once you were in prison,
I was able to move forward.

2127
03:01:47,688 --> 03:01:50,316
Sorry to disappoint you.

2128
03:02:03,496 --> 03:02:05,998
We were supposed to make the world
a better place.

2129
03:02:06,165 --> 03:02:07,875
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.

2130
03:02:08,042 --> 03:02:09,377
Nuclear war?

2131
03:02:09,544 --> 03:02:11,712
Human extinction?

2132
03:02:21,347 --> 03:02:26,269
Of course, my moral safeguards
gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.

2133
03:02:26,436 --> 03:02:29,397
A few key regions around the globe--

2134
03:02:29,564 --> 03:02:35,027
New York, Los Angeles, Moscow,
Hong Kong.

2135
03:02:35,194 --> 03:02:36,863
--disintegrated in an instant.

2136
03:02:37,613 --> 03:02:40,950
Fifteen million people killed...

2137
03:02:41,117 --> 03:02:43,202
...by Dr. Manhattan himself.

2138
03:02:44,370 --> 03:02:47,206
The world's punishment
for flirting with World War III.

2139
03:02:47,373 --> 03:02:48,499
Jon wouldn't do that.

2140
03:02:49,041 --> 03:02:51,752
A fact no one outside this room
ever has to know.

2141
03:02:52,378 --> 03:02:56,215
The energy breakthrough I was working on
just came to fruition.

2142
03:02:56,799 --> 03:03:00,803
All these years, Jon was helping me
replicate his power...

2143
03:03:00,970 --> 03:03:03,514
...unaware of how I planned to use it.

2144
03:03:03,681 --> 03:03:05,683
You see...

2145
03:03:06,559 --> 03:03:08,978
...the Comedian was right.

2146
03:03:09,687 --> 03:03:14,692
Humanity's savage nature
will inevitably lead to global annihilation.

2147
03:03:14,859 --> 03:03:17,653
So in order to save this planet...

2148
03:03:17,904 --> 03:03:19,989
...I had to trick it...

2149
03:03:20,364 --> 03:03:24,410
...with the greatest practical joke
in human history.

2150
03:03:24,660 --> 03:03:28,080
-Killing millions.
-To save billions.

2151
03:03:28,581 --> 03:03:30,583
A necessary crime.

2152
03:03:30,750 --> 03:03:32,919
You know we can't let you do that.

2153
03:03:34,337 --> 03:03:36,464
"Do that," Rorschach?

2154
03:03:36,631 --> 03:03:38,257
I'm not a comic-book villain.

2155
03:03:39,091 --> 03:03:41,385
Do you think
I'd explain my masterstroke to you...

2156
03:03:41,552 --> 03:03:45,723
...if there were even the slightest possibility
you could affect the outcome?

2157
03:03:48,434 --> 03:03:51,270
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.

2158
03:04:15,419 --> 03:04:20,841
<i>Eventually, I came to a dismal
black ocean stretching endlessly before me.</i>

2159
03:04:21,592 --> 03:04:24,971
<i>How had I reached
this appalling position with love...</i>

2160
03:04:25,137 --> 03:04:28,140
<i>...only love, as my guide?</i>

2161
03:04:29,767 --> 03:04:32,853
<i>The moneylender floated at my feet.</i>

2162
03:04:33,020 --> 03:04:35,815
<i>Noble intentions had led me to atrocity.</i>

2163
03:04:35,982 --> 03:04:42,196
<i>The righteous anger fueling my ingenious,
awful scheme was but delusion.</i>

2164
03:04:42,363 --> 03:04:44,323
<i>Where was my error?</i>

2165
03:04:44,740 --> 03:04:49,829
<i>Planning to resume my flight,
I raised my head and saw her.</i>

2166
03:04:52,123 --> 03:04:56,544
<i>The vessel seemed to be waiting,
not hovering to strike.</i>

2167
03:04:56,711 --> 03:05:00,881
<i>And, gradually, I understood
what innocent intent had brought me to...</i>

2168
03:05:01,799 --> 03:05:04,510
<i>...and waded out beyond my depth.</i>

2169
03:05:05,678 --> 03:05:08,681
<i>The unspeakable truth
loomed unavoidably before me...</i>

2170
03:05:08,848 --> 03:05:11,726
<i>...as I swam
towards the anchored</i> Freighter.

2171
03:05:11,892 --> 03:05:16,230

filled all my vision.</i>

2172
03:05:16,397 --> 03:05:19,358
<i>All my well-meaning plans
had come to this.</i>

2173
03:05:19,525 --> 03:05:23,321
<i>The world I tried to save
was lost beyond recall.</i>

2174
03:05:24,196 --> 03:05:26,032
<i>A rope snaked down.</i>

2175
03:05:26,198 --> 03:05:28,367
<i>Sputtering, I grabbed it.</i>

2176
03:05:28,534 --> 03:05:31,203
<i>And from the decks above,
a cheer went up...</i>

2177
03:05:31,370 --> 03:05:35,750
<i>...both gross and black,
its stench affronting heaven.</i>

2178
03:05:38,544 --> 03:05:40,921
<i>There had been no plan
to capture Davidstown.</i>

2179
03:05:41,756 --> 03:05:45,801
<i>They'd come to wait until they could collect
the only prize they valued.</i>

2180
03:05:47,011 --> 03:05:50,139
<i>Claim the only soul they truly wanted.</i>

2181
03:05:56,145 --> 03:05:58,230
<i>I was a horror.</i>

2182
03:05:59,065 --> 03:06:02,401
<i>Amongst horrors must I dwell.</i>

2183
03:06:11,911 --> 03:06:15,915
-Man, this shit don't make no sense.
-You're telling me.

2184
03:06:17,249 --> 03:06:20,586
Sorry, but you can keep this garbage.
Wasting all my damn time.

2185
03:06:20,753 --> 03:06:23,923
Hey, hey. You know, all this time
you've been coming here...

2186
03:06:24,090 --> 03:06:25,591
...I never caught your name.

2187
03:06:27,301 --> 03:06:30,304
-Bernard.
-Bernard? You're kidding.

2188
03:06:30,471 --> 03:06:34,558
That's--Heh. That's my name too.

2189
03:06:35,184 --> 03:06:38,437
Not that big a deal.
There's lots of people called Bernard.

2190
03:08:03,647 --> 03:08:06,650
Jesus Christ, Henry.

2191
03:08:06,817 --> 03:08:09,028
Why the hell
didn't we get a launch detection?

2192
03:08:10,905 --> 03:08:15,367
It's not the Soviets, sir.

2193
03:08:15,910 --> 03:08:19,079
Intel indicates the energy signature...

2194
03:08:19,246 --> 03:08:21,707
...was generated by...

2195
03:08:22,666 --> 03:08:25,085
...Dr. Manhattan.

2196
03:08:27,922 --> 03:08:29,507
Jon.

2197
03:08:32,510 --> 03:08:33,636
Interference.

2198
03:08:34,220 --> 03:08:36,138
Cataclysmic interference.

2199
03:08:45,856 --> 03:08:48,609
I can't believe it happened.

2200
03:08:49,610 --> 03:08:53,113
This wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.

2201
03:08:57,201 --> 03:08:58,494
It was me.

2202
03:09:00,538 --> 03:09:02,122
I...

2203
03:09:02,706 --> 03:09:03,749
...did this.

2204
03:09:04,375 --> 03:09:07,837
-What do you mean, you did this?
-Not directly.

2205
03:09:08,796 --> 03:09:11,507
It was made to look like I did it.

2206
03:09:14,552 --> 03:09:15,970
Adrian.

2207
03:09:22,268 --> 03:09:24,270
Speak of the devil.

2208
03:09:27,398 --> 03:09:28,440
Jon--
-I know.

2209
03:09:28,607 --> 03:09:30,776
Must stop him.
Killed Blake, killed millions.

2210
03:09:30,943 --> 03:09:32,278
Wait here.

2211
03:09:43,414 --> 03:09:45,791
Adrian, stop this.

2212
03:09:47,251 --> 03:09:49,128
The tachyons were clever...

2213
03:09:50,254 --> 03:09:54,592
...but even if I can't predict where you are,
I can turn the walls to glass.

2214
03:09:55,926 --> 03:09:58,387
I should thank you.

2215
03:09:59,555 --> 03:10:02,766
I'd almost forgotten the excitement
of not knowing...

2216
03:10:03,767 --> 03:10:06,770
<i>...the delights of uncertainty.</i>

2217
03:10:10,941 --> 03:10:12,610
Forgive me, girl.

2218
03:10:35,549 --> 03:10:37,259
You're such an asshole.

2219
03:11:11,210 --> 03:11:13,128
Veidt, you bastard.

2220
03:11:13,295 --> 03:11:15,756
-If you've hurt her, I'll--
-Dan...

2221
03:11:17,508 --> 03:11:22,096
...grow up. My new world
demands less obvious heroism.

2222
03:11:22,262 --> 03:11:24,264
Your...

2223
03:11:24,431 --> 03:11:29,395
...schoolboy heroics are redundant.
What have they achieved?

2224
03:11:31,021 --> 03:11:33,899
Failing to prevent Earth's salvation...

2225
03:11:34,858 --> 03:11:37,236
...is your only triumph.

2226
03:11:37,444 --> 03:11:39,363
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

2227
03:11:40,155 --> 03:11:43,659
I'm very disappointed.

2228
03:11:56,046 --> 03:11:59,216
Reassembling myself
was the first trick I learned.

2229
03:11:59,883 --> 03:12:02,261
It didn't kill Osterman.

2230
03:12:04,888 --> 03:12:07,266
Did you really think it would kill me?

2231
03:12:08,559 --> 03:12:11,729
I have walked across the surface
of the sun.

2232
03:12:12,229 --> 03:12:15,399
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast...

2233
03:12:15,566 --> 03:12:18,610
...they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all...

2234
03:12:18,777 --> 03:12:22,448
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.

2235
03:12:23,574 --> 03:12:26,076
The world's smartest man...

2236
03:12:26,368 --> 03:12:28,787
...poses no more threat to me...

2237
03:12:28,954 --> 03:12:32,124
...than does its smartest termite.

2238
03:12:34,376 --> 03:12:35,836
What's that?

2239
03:12:36,253 --> 03:12:38,130
Another ultimate weapon?

2240
03:12:38,756 --> 03:12:40,466
Yes.

2241
03:12:42,092 --> 03:12:43,552
You could say that.

2242
03:12:47,097 --> 03:12:49,016
<i>--came under attack.</i>

2243
03:12:49,850 --> 03:12:53,187
<i>Millions of lives were suddenly ended...</i>

2244
03:12:53,520 --> 03:12:58,734
<i>...in an act of evil
perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.</i>

2245
03:13:00,527 --> 03:13:04,490
<i>Since the attacks,
I have been in constant contact...</i>

2246
03:13:04,656 --> 03:13:07,659
<i>...with the premier of the U.S.S.R.</i>

2247
03:13:08,035 --> 03:13:10,871
<i>Putting aside our past differences...</i>

2248
03:13:11,205 --> 03:13:13,373
<i>...we have both pledged to unite...</i>

2249
03:13:13,707 --> 03:13:17,044
<i>...against this common enemy.</i>

2250
03:13:17,544 --> 03:13:19,546
<i>With the rest of the world...</i>

2251
03:13:20,005 --> 03:13:22,007
<i>...we will prevail.</i>

2252
03:13:24,551 --> 03:13:27,554
<i>This is a day we shall never forget.</i>

2253
03:13:27,721 --> 03:13:31,934
<i>And yet we go forward
to defend the human race...</i>

2254
03:13:32,101 --> 03:13:36,730
<i>...and all that is good
and just in our world.</i>

2255
03:13:38,065 --> 03:13:42,319
<i>Thank you. God bless us all.</i>

2256
03:13:42,694 --> 03:13:44,488
Do you see?

2257
03:13:46,698 --> 03:13:49,159
Two superpowers retreating from war.

2258
03:13:50,744 --> 03:13:53,205
I've saved the earth from hell.

2259
03:13:53,372 --> 03:13:55,332
We both have.

2260
03:13:55,791 --> 03:13:58,001
This is as much your victory as it is mine.

2261
03:14:02,798 --> 03:14:04,299
Now we can return...

2262
03:14:05,717 --> 03:14:07,302
...do what we were meant to.

2263
03:14:07,553 --> 03:14:10,430
We were meant to exact justice.

2264
03:14:10,764 --> 03:14:14,101
-Everyone's gonna know what you've done.
-Will they?

2265
03:14:14,268 --> 03:14:19,064
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

2266
03:14:19,231 --> 03:14:22,693
-Peace based on a lie.
-But peace...

2267
03:14:22,860 --> 03:14:25,070
-...nonetheless.
-He's right.

2268
03:14:25,612 --> 03:14:29,575
Exposing Adrian would only doom the world
to nuclear destruction again.

2269
03:14:29,741 --> 03:14:32,619
No. We can't do this.

2270
03:14:32,786 --> 03:14:34,580
On Mars...

2271
03:14:36,081 --> 03:14:37,916
...you taught me the value of life.

2272
03:14:38,876 --> 03:14:41,295
If we hope to preserve it here...

2273
03:14:42,087 --> 03:14:44,131
...we must remain silent.

2274
03:14:47,968 --> 03:14:49,928
Keep your own secrets.

2275
03:14:56,768 --> 03:14:57,978
Don't even think about it.

2276
03:15:00,606 --> 03:15:02,316
Rorschach.

2277
03:15:04,109 --> 03:15:05,611
Wait.

2278
03:15:06,653 --> 03:15:08,780
Never compromise.

2279
03:15:09,114 --> 03:15:11,992
Not even in the face of armageddon.

2280
03:15:12,409 --> 03:15:15,412
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

2281
03:15:26,465 --> 03:15:29,968
I've made myself feel every death...

2282
03:15:31,470 --> 03:15:37,351
...see every innocent face
I've murdered to save humanity.

2283
03:15:42,940 --> 03:15:46,652
-You understand, don't you?
-Without condoning...

2284
03:15:48,320 --> 03:15:50,197
...or condemning...

2285
03:15:54,618 --> 03:15:56,536
...I understand.

2286
03:16:03,961 --> 03:16:07,089
Out of my way. People have to be told.

2287
03:16:07,965 --> 03:16:09,883
You know I can't let you do that.

2288
03:16:11,134 --> 03:16:14,137
Suddenly you discover humanity?

2289
03:16:15,555 --> 03:16:17,391
Convenient.

2290
03:16:26,108 --> 03:16:30,696
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

2291
03:16:34,449 --> 03:16:37,411
I can change almost anything...

2292
03:16:41,999 --> 03:16:44,334
...but I can't change human nature.

2293
03:16:45,669 --> 03:16:49,047
Of course
you must protect Veidt's new utopia.

2294
03:16:50,340 --> 03:16:53,677
What's one more body
amongst foundations?

2295
03:16:59,850 --> 03:17:01,727
Well, what are you waiting for?

2296
03:17:05,188 --> 03:17:07,024
Do it.

2297
03:17:13,113 --> 03:17:14,156
Do it!

2298
03:17:16,867 --> 03:17:20,245
No!

2299
03:17:37,721 --> 03:17:43,477
<i>I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.</i>

2300
03:17:43,643 --> 03:17:46,146
<i>I thought you said you cared
about life again.</i>

2301
03:17:46,313 --> 03:17:47,731
<i>I do.</i>

2302
03:17:49,066 --> 03:17:51,943
I think maybe I'll create some.

2303
03:17:56,073 --> 03:17:58,408
Goodbye, Laurie.

2304
03:18:33,652 --> 03:18:34,820
Come on.

2305
03:18:37,280 --> 03:18:38,865
Come on!

2306
03:18:43,286 --> 03:18:44,621
Dan...

2307
03:18:45,080 --> 03:18:47,833
...a world united and at peace.

2308
03:18:48,708 --> 03:18:49,918
There had to be sacrifice.

2309
03:18:50,085 --> 03:18:54,464
No! You haven't idealized mankind,
you've deformed it.

2310
03:18:54,631 --> 03:18:56,383
You've mutilated it.

2311
03:18:56,758 --> 03:18:58,927
That's your legacy.

2312
03:19:07,477 --> 03:19:10,272
That's the real practical joke.

2313
03:20:02,866 --> 03:20:06,870
<i>We repeat, there is
nothing wrong with your television set.</i>

2314
03:20:07,037 --> 03:20:10,499
<i>You are about to participate
in a great adventure.</i>

2315
03:20:10,665 --> 03:20:13,835
<i>You are about to experience
the awe and mystery...</i>

2316
03:20:14,002 --> 03:20:19,799
<i>...which reaches from the inner mind
to the outer limits.</i>

2317
03:20:21,009 --> 03:20:23,220
Sure you don't want a drink?

2318
03:20:24,221 --> 03:20:25,263
I'm okay.

2319
03:20:26,306 --> 03:20:27,557
Cheers.

2320
03:20:28,975 --> 03:20:32,103
There's something I need
to get off my chest.

2321
03:20:33,396 --> 03:20:35,899
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

2322
03:20:38,902 --> 03:20:40,654
Laurel.

2323
03:20:41,655 --> 03:20:43,990
What you must think of me.

2324
03:20:44,824 --> 03:20:47,369
I'm sorry I never told you.

2325
03:20:47,536 --> 03:20:49,329
I should have...

2326
03:20:49,496 --> 03:20:53,625
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed.
I felt stupid.

2327
03:20:53,792 --> 03:20:55,752
It doesn't matter.

2328
03:20:56,586 --> 03:21:01,841
People's lives take them strange places.
They do strange things...

2329
03:21:02,425 --> 03:21:05,345
...and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

2330
03:21:05,512 --> 03:21:07,847
I know how that is...

2331
03:21:08,598 --> 03:21:11,184
...but I just want you to know...

2332
03:21:11,768 --> 03:21:14,604
...that you never did anything wrong
by me.

2333
03:21:18,775 --> 03:21:23,029
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

2334
03:21:24,614 --> 03:21:27,117
Because he gave me you.

2335
03:21:32,122 --> 03:21:33,206
Thanks, Mom.

2336
03:21:35,959 --> 03:21:37,752

-Oh, Sally, please.

2338
03:21:51,141 --> 03:21:55,729
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
I'll be right back.

2339
03:22:06,239 --> 03:22:10,410
-So how's it going up here?
-Good. How's it going down there?

2340
03:22:10,577 --> 03:22:14,080
Good. I think I've got everything working.

2341
03:22:14,247 --> 03:22:18,877
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now...

2342
03:22:19,044 --> 03:22:21,296
...so all we gotta do is take her out.

2343
03:22:21,463 --> 03:22:24,549
Well, that sounds like a date.

2344
03:22:35,852 --> 03:22:38,104
Are we gonna be all right?

2345
03:22:40,190 --> 03:22:44,486

still watching us, we'll be all right...

2346
03:22:44,694 --> 03:22:46,571
...in the end.

2347
03:22:48,198 --> 03:22:50,367
I know what Jon would say:

2348
03:22:50,533 --> 03:22:52,577

2349
03:22:54,454 --> 03:22:57,082

03:23:44,421 --> 03:23:48,174
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

2351
03:23:48,341 --> 03:23:49,718
Everyone in the country...

2352
03:23:49,884 --> 03:23:52,137
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

2353
03:23:52,303 --> 03:23:55,598
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

2354
03:23:56,099 --> 03:23:58,977

be running for president in '88.

2356

We could run a piece on that.

2357
03:24:05,233 --> 03:24:08,403

with coverage.

Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

2359

Crank file.

2361
