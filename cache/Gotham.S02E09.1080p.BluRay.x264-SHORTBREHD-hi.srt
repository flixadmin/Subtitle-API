I was told to order a Highsmith Royale.

Bit early, don't you think?

35
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:01,873
I said "Highsmith Royale."

Why come to us?

00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:05,061
Had an accident. My aim is off.

Is this business? Personal?

A cop.

Seems personal to me.
Anyhow, cops also cost extra.

Fine. I want it done today.

MALE DOCTOR: Ms. Kean has yet
to regain consciousness.

60

With this kind of trauma, we have no
idea when she might wake up.

But the medical wing at Arkham

- Was I snoring?
- No.

00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:16,567
Are you sure?
My big, loud, rumbling, barnyard snore.

82
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,153
I've heard complaints.
Neighbors. Airplanes.

You don't snore.

for everything he's done.

I'm on my way to meet Barnes

Hopefully, we can find some evidence
to corroborate Aubrey James' testimony.

I got a call.
They're transferring Barbara to Arkham.

00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:41,592
I know. I stopped by Gotham General.

90
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,639
You went to see her?

91
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:49,642
She's a witness against Galavan.
I wanted to check on her condition.

92
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:51,602
"Her condition" is she's in a coma.

93
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:55,732
We never talked about what happened

94
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,483
with you and Barbara in
that interrogation room.

95

I know. Tonight?

00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,612
Sure. Tonight. Or right now.

97
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,323
Lee, I went over to see her as part
of the case against Galavan.

That is it.

How do I put this?

102
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,874
She's the devil. No, she is.
She's the devil.

103
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,502
Lee, do you think I wanted things
to go the way they did?

104
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,047
I had to play her game.

Can we please just not
talk about this right now?

111

I'm late to meet Barnes.

112
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:39,942
I'll be fine.

113
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:51,245
I wasn't sure
you'd ever want to see me again.

114
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,997
When you called...

115
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,918
You don't believe
what they're saying about my uncle,

116
00:06:58,336 --> 00:06:59,337
do you?

117
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,256
No. Of course not.

118
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,551
Silver, I asked you here
because I need your help.

119
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,011
Anything.

120
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:12,517
Before he was arrested, your uncle
made me an offer. I want--

121
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,185
Right, Master Bruce! On your feet!

122
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,187
Bought us a lovely couple of rakes
from the ironmongers.

123
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,814
I suggest we get outside and get...

124
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,943
Hello, Ms. St. Cloud.

125
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,363
Did not expect to see you here.

126
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:26,864
Hello, Alfred.

127
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:30,034
That must have been your car
I saw idling on the main road.

128
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,580
Now, in light of recent events,
I suggest you get in it and you leave.

129
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,541
Immediately.

130
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,877
I invited her and I want her to stay.

131
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,129
And I'm ordering her to leave.

132
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,630
And it's my house, and I give the orders!

133
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:43,798
Oh, is that so?

134
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:48,177
It's okay.
I don't want to cause any trouble.

135
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:50,221
Smart girl. Off you pop.

136
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,728
I'm at the Kane Hotel.

137
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,905
You had no right to do that.

138
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:09,407
I had every right.

139
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,910
What were you thinking,
asking her up here?

140
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:18,958
Wait, you think she was gonna
tell you something?

141
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:23,171
If Galavan really has the name of my
parents' killer in that envelope,

142
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,422
it's worth a shot.

143
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,091
Well, my guess is, there was
absolutely nothing in that envelope.

144
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,218
It was just a ruse
to get you to sign away the company.

145
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:30,636
Galavan is smart.

146
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,599
He wouldn't enter a multi-billion dollar
offer without his end of the bargain.

147
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,934
He has the name.

148
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,937
And you think that little minx is
gonna tell you something, do you?

149
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,273
We're friends.

150
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,566
No you're not.

151
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,944
Getting information
out of a girl like that

152
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:50,948
requires a level of deception that you
do not yet possess, Master Bruce.

153
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,202
It is too dangerous.

154
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,369
It's worth the risk.

155
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,913
No.

156
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,083
You will not see Ms. St. Cloud again

157
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,461
or pursue Galavan's wild claims.

158
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,379
You have no right to make
that decision for me.

159
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,672
Well, someone has to.

160
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,342
If you force me to be your jailer,

161

649
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,826
Why the hell are you with me?

650
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:13,913
Beats me.

651
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:26,342
Just tell me the truth. Always.

652
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:33,182
I promise.

Uh-uh.

656
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:51,033
Detective James Gordon's phone.
This is Lee Thompkins speaking.

657
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:53,369
Hi, Alvarez.

(SIGHS)

659
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:58,666
I'll tell him.

660
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:06,715
Eduardo Flamingo killed Officer Parks
before they could get him into lockup.

661
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:27,486
THEO: Hit men?

662
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:33,492
You sent hit men after Jim Gordon?

663
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:38,622
After I expressly told you to do
nothing until I gave you orders?

664
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,082
Nothing.

665
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,461
Tell me this isn't about Barbara.

667
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:51,594
I'm disappointed that you let a
woman like that get in your head.

668
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:55,097
If you're feeling upset,
find yourself a nice librarian to torture.

669
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:56,432
That always cheers you up.

670
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,684
Everything is ready.

671
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,021
The brothers' arrival is imminent.

672
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:04,273
Bruce Wayne will die,

673
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:07,109
and his company
and this city will be mine.

674
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,444
Ours.

675
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:16,368
Everything that we have worked for,
for so long, will be ours.

676
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:21,123
Endanger that prize again,
and though it breaks my heart,

677
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:25,294
I will cut your throat.

678
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,020
Welcome, brothers. Welcome.
