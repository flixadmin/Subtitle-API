Um, Starlight. [chuckles]

314
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,031
Listen, Starlight, I-I... [sighs]

315
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,284
...hate to direct you, but, um,
we're gonna need a little more

316
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:59,246
"JFK just got rimmed out by Marilyn"
version.

317
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:03,333
It's got to fit with the routine.
A-Actually, show her the routine.

318
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,503
[laughing] You're gonna fucking love this.

319
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,755
[band playing "Happy Birthday"]

320
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,095
- That's your backup.
- Okay...

321
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,930
[Starlight] Okay, uh, hold on, everybody.

322
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,349
Okay, ladies, thank you.
Just stand down, okay?

323
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,558
Real quick.

324
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,353
Can I talk to Roger?

325
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,438
- [stage manager] Uh, yeah, sure, abso...
- Problem?

326
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:31,152
I have... concerns.

327
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,404
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,739
Oh, okay, well, uh, what are they?

329
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,825
- It's demeaning.
- It's demeaning

330
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:39,035
to sing your friend "Happy Birthday"?

331
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,330
Are you gonna sing all sexy for me
on my birthday?

332
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,791
Starlight, where... wh-what's
with all this animosity?

333
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,086
Hey, um, can we just have
one minute, please?

334
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:50,964
- Yes. Go.
- Thank you.

335
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,592
Hey, um... Okay.

336
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,304
- For the record...
- Mm-hmm.

337
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,681
I know you don't care
whether I sing or not.

338
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,975
This is a juvenile attempt

339
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,895
to get me to look like a sex doll
instead of a cocaptain.

340
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,772
[chuckling]

341
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,065
I'm not doing it.

342
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,442
I have an idea.

343
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,235
Why don't you lighten the fuck up?

344
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,529
Come on, you're gonna sing
the shit out of this song.

345
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,697
Ready? Let's hit it.

346
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,326
[Edgar] If Starlight doesn't want to sing,
she doesn't sing.

347
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,203
Stan. What a surprise.

348
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:26,958
[Edgar] Our testing shows
that 76% of likely viewers

349
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,419
will make every effort to watch tonight
for Starlight.

350
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,340
As for you, 53% might DVR.

351
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:37,510
I think that that means that she can
call her own shots. Don't you?

352
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,138
So how about I just walk, Stan?
How would that rate?

353
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,224
After the PR hole you dug
for yourself this past year,

354
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,852
I'd say you're lucky
we're putting on this farce at all.

355
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,314
But hey, it's your party.
You can cry if you want to.

356
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,126
- Damn, Annie.
- Hmm.

357
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,087
What happened to you in New York?

358
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,838
I started making waves.

359
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:17,634
[Ashley] <i>Thank you so much for coming in.</i>

360
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,469
Have you met my new development exec?

361
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,971
Hi. I'm also Ashley.

362
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:23,848
Uh-huh.

363
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,434
We are super curious to hear
what you have for us today.

364
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,853
- Mm-hmm. So curious.
- [A-Train] I've been thinking a lot

365
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,773
about all the ways
that I can contribute around here.

366
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,650
Maybe I can't run as fast as I used to,

367
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,236
but I've never just been
the world's fastest man.

368
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,531
There's a lot of layers to the A-Train
that people haven't seen yet.

369
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:40,782
Such as?

370
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,411
Well, I'm also a-a strong,
very proud Black man.

371
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,413
Right, Seth?

372
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,333
Seth, come on, man.

373
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,293
Tell them.

374
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,921
Right. Um... [clears throat]

375
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,924
The Seven have been dipping
in the African American demo.

376
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,343
Our numbers for <i>Dawn of The Seven</i>
have been soft.

377
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:03,138
People of color don't tend
to react well to Nazis.

378
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,514
Facts.

379
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,642
We thought a rebranding of A-Train
maybe could change that.

380
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,728
If done tastefully.

381
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,148
- A rebranding. [chuckles]
- [A-Train] So, listen,

382
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:17,110
we start with a docuseries on Vought Soul.

383
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:20,405
<i>A-Train to Africa.</i>

384
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,990
Boom. [laughs]

385
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,200
The art's, uh, just a mock-up.

386
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,994
It'll trace his family's journey

387
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,872
from the plains of Africa
all the way to Vought Tower.

388
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,791
Yeah, like, I want to get back
in touch with my roots.

389
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,210
Like in <i>Roots.</i>

390
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,796
And for the Gen Z's,

391
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,008
a state-of-the-art interactive
learning experience.

392
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,269
Is that a video game
about the slave trade?

393
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,229
It's some powerful stuff.

394
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,940
It's really something.

395
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,026
I even had LJ redesign the suit.

396
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,612
You know, for the culture.

397
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,405
- I want to introduce it tonight.
- Oh, yeah, no.

398
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:06,284
Let's have a beat on that
and think about that.

399
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,203
- Okay. Wow.
- Okay.

400
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:11,372
Thank you so much for that pitch.

401
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,334
That was so well told.

402
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,668
Mm-hmm. So well told.

403
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,629
All right. Yeah.

404
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,342
We're gonna discuss with the team
and-and get back to you.

405
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,260
- Cool. Yeah. Thanks.
- [laughs softly]

406
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,262
See you tonight.

407
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:29,516
- [exhales]
- [door closes]

408
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,935
I'm kind of surprised
that they didn't buy it in the room.

409
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,144
She hated it.

410
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,979
What? No.

411
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,397
Man, she said it was "well told."

412
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,441
Yeah, that's code
for she fucking hated it.

413
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,152
Look, man, she didn't buy it
because it's total bullshit.

414
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,820
You couldn't care less
about your African roots.

415
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,740
You know it, and she knows it,
and frankly, Africa knows it.

416
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:47,367
Yeah?

417
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:49,953
You don't have a fucking dick.

418
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,502
[birds cawing]

419
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,838
So, uh, where at Vought do you work?

420
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:04,884
Um, uh, the Tower,
social media, up on 47th.

421
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:08,096
Um, I'm sorry, you said you don't get
many potential parents?

422
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,306
Well, you know what kind
of a home we are, right?

423
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,850
Yeah, no, of course, it's a group home...

424
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,604
for the s-super-abled.

425
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,108
Mason, please get down from there.

426
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,943
Yeah, uh, so many tragic stories,

427
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,153
but, uh, with the right attention,

428
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,114
uh, they can bounce back so quickly.

429
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:27,198
[grunts]

430
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:29,325
Yeah, they're little treasures.

431
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,535
[clears throat]

432
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,412
Geez. [gasps]

433
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,873
Teddy Stillwell, we don't teleport.

434
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,751
- Can I play with my toys?
- Yeah.

435
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:42,422
So, their... their parents, they're, uh...

436
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,883
[Vanessa] Well, uh, some of the kids,
they discovered their gifts quite early,

437
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,719
before they were able to control them.

438
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,929
But listen, I-I'm sure
you'd be perfectly safe.

439
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,222
[laughs softly]

440
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:55,810
Hey, can you... can you, uh...
Can you show me the rest of the place?

441
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,313
- Uh, what did you want to see?
- Anything. Whatever you got.

442
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,772
- Oh.
- [whimpers]

443
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,399
Sorry, what, uh... what is it, Teddy?

444
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,864
Hey, wait a minute. I know you.

445
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,782
You're Starlight's boyfriend?

446
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,493
- Uh...
- And you work at the bureau.

447
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,537
- Uh... No, no, I can...
- This is highly irregular.

448
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,122
Hey, hey, I-I-I can explain.

449
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,708
Um, okay, the-the truth is...

450
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,836
[softly] Starlight is-is the one
that sent me here.

451
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,214
I'm completely sterile.
Doctor says my sperm are bad.

452
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:26,758
Like, really, really bad,

453
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,260
like a bunch of fat, dead tadpoles.

454
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:33,806
But we-we want a kid, and, um,
she wanted to keep it quiet,

455
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,684
so she sent me here to cover for her.
I-I was never here, by the way.

456
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:40,188
We just want to keep it
about love and not publicity.

457
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,356
You know?

458
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,486
[Vanessa] This is fantastic.
With a superhuman mother,

459
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,072
there is far less chance
of parental fatality.

460
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,741
Oh, yeah. That's great.
[clears throat] That's great news.

461
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,786
[Vanessa] So I have a few standouts
I think you'll be pretty thrilled with.

462
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,872
You mind if I, uh,
just kind of flip around a bit?

463
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,500
Oh.

464
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,086
Thank you. Thank you.
Sorry. Move this over.

465
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,253
Sorry. [clears throat]

466
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,923
[Vanessa] Is there anything in particular

00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,746
It's my... It's my birthday.

626
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,039
She...

627
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,169
- [high-pitched ringing]
- [stammering]

628
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,462
She...

629
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,147
You probably don't know this
because, you know, Jew,

630
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,568
but Jesus wasn't born
on the 25th of December.

631
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:14,613
That was piggybacked
off a pagan festival, and guess what.

632
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,532
Today is not my birthday, either.

633
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,076
Nope.

634
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,246
Don't know when it is,
but sure as hell ain't today.

635
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,917
This was just chosen for me
by a marketing department.

636
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,046
I mean, I can't even
have a birthday at all.

637
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,339
I wasn't born.

638
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,718
I was just poured
out of a fucking test tube.

639
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,221
Immaculate conception.

640
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:43,684
I know exactly how he must have felt.

641
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:44,893
Jesus.

642
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,105
[exhales] You give and you give...

643
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,734
[stammering] You give
your whole fucking life,

644
00:35:53,444 --> 00:35:56,155
and what happens?
People just tear you down.

645
00:35:57,448 --> 00:35:59,533
Why do people destroy their gods?

646
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,036
H-How is it fair that you get saved,

647
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:05,539
while a beautiful, perfect god
gets killed?

648
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,716
You know what, Chelsea?

649
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:19,970
I think you should jump.

650
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,723
I-I don't think I want to.

651
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:23,932
You don't want to?

652
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:26,101
Why don't you show a little
follow-through, Chelsea?

653
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:29,355
- Jump.
- Please, I... I just want to get down.

654
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,440
I'm not suggesting anymore.

655
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:33,776
Jump.

656
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,612
No. No, please.

657
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,030
[crying] Oh, God, oh, God.

658
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,323
No, no, no.

659
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,909
No God.

660
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:47,122
The only man in the sky is me.

661
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,584
How the fuck did she bite off
her own tongue?

662
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,336
Stormfront <i>Million Dollar Babied</i> herself.

663
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,504
- That's horrible.
- Oh, so...

664
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:56,298
[people screaming]

665
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,639
[sirens wailing in distance]

666
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,279
[Janine] Daddy? It smells smoky.

667
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:21,365
[alarm beeping]

668
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,618
It's okay, baby, I got it.

669
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:29,998
[grunting]

670
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,003
Fucking piece of shit.

671
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,505
Shut the fuck up!

672
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,090
[alarm stops]

673
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,384
[panting]

674
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,350
I'm sorry.

675
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:51,311
Baby, I'm sorry.

676
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:08,495
I'm sorry.

677
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,330
[sniffles]

678
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,754
[chattering]

679
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,509
- Hey.
- Hey.

680
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:27,473
- [Victoria] Hughie.
- [chuckles] Hi.

681
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:29,975
- Hey, where you been?
- Uh...

682
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,936
You know, just, um, working from home.

683
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,730
Oh, my God, your hand.

684
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:38,442
Yeah. Yeah, no, that's...
It's nothing. I'm fine.

685
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,195
- So, who's Nadia?
- Nadia?

686
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,031
Yeah, Scotty said some guy
came in yesterday, asking for Nadia.

687
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,658
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, there was, there was a guy,

688
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:50,037
um, and he...
he was looking at your picture,

689
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,039
he said your name was Nadia,
said he knew you

690
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:54,333
- from, like, way back when.
- You weren't gonna tell me?

691
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:57,169
Uh, no, I mean, it was just some guy
off his meds, seemed like, yeah.

692
00:38:58,504 --> 00:39:02,090
I'm sorry, I-I mean,
you're missing work, your hand.

693
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,009
- Lot going on.
- Hmm.

694
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,303
Is there something I should know?

695
00:39:07,221 --> 00:39:08,805
[footsteps approaching]

696
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:10,015
He was with me.

697
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,893
I'm sorry for stealing him
away from you, but...

698
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,104
we had some things
that we needed to discuss.

699
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,941
- Very loudly, actually.
- [both chuckle]

700
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,026
- We made quite the scene at Panera.
- Oh.

701
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,070
I mean, it's a miracle
nobody recognized me.

702
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:26,156
Yeah, sorry, I was, I was trying
to preserve just a tiny,

703
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,160
little shred of my dignity,
but, uh, we had a fight.

704
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:33,497
We didn't leave things in the greatest
place, so I thought I would come by and...

705
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,707
- Check up on me?
- Well, I was worried about you.

706
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,001
Yeah, well, you know I can
handle some things by myself, right?

707
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:39,753
Okay, I'm just trying to help.

708
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,922
I don't always need your help.
You don't have to treat me like I'm a kid.

709
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,549
Here I was thinking
that I was treating you like my boyfriend.

710
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:44,675
Well, you...

711
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:47,302
This is actually none of my business,
so I'm just, I'm gonna go.

712
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,012
Good-good luck with all of that.

713
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:51,765
- Oh, and Hughie?
- Yeah.

714
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,058
Cut her some slack.

715
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,561
You shouldn't be afraid
of a powerful woman.

716
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:57,854
[laughs softly]

717
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:05,862
Oh... my God.

718
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,700
Uh, thanks for the save, by the way.

719
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,829
What are you doing here?

720
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,747
What am I doing here?

721
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:18,625
Well, uh, Alex said
that you were acting weird,

722
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,128
and I've been calling you
literally every five minutes.

723
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,754
- So...
- [sighs] Right.

724
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,965
Shit. Sorry, I left
my phone off at Red River.

725
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:27,426
I thought we were gonna
handle that together.

726
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:28,635
I know.

727
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:31,430
I'm sorry.

728
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,433
And you're bleeding.

729
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,226
I know,
because I can't open a fucking jar,

730
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,978
because I can't do anything fucking right.

731
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,521
Hughie.

732
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,732
- [Hughie sighs]
- What's going on?

733
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,942
Vicky was my friend.

734
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,361
I know her daughter.

735
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:49,823
She-she-she surprised me
in the office on my birthday.

736
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:53,660
We used to roll through that office
like we were the fucking Untouchables.

737
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:57,164
I thought things were finally,
finally going my way.

738
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,376
God, what a goddamn joke I am.

739
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,046
Hey, that's not true, Hughie.

740
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,889
Oh, um...

741
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:17,059
I may have signed us up to adopt a child.

742
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,069
[doorbell rings]

743
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,323
[Todd] Hey, look at that.

744
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,201
- There you go.
- [grunts] Seven Tower.

745
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,535
- [Todd] Amazing.
- Bye, Dad.

746
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:36,745
[Mother's Milk] I love you, baby.

747
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,121
- I love you, too.
- Mmm.

748
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:39,831
All right.

749
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,625
Is Monique here?

750
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,418
Uh, Monique, Marvin's here.

751
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,463
Hey, you gonna stay
for Homelander's birthday special?

752
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,964
I got some brats on the grill.

753
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:51,593
Think I'll pass, but thanks.

754
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,680
Oh. [laughs]

755
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,980
[Mother's Milk] You know
I've been trying, Monique.

756
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,360
Been trying to stay away from all of it.

757
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:09,653
The Supes.

758
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:11,738
Butcher.

759
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:13,740
For Janine.

760
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,953
- And for you.
- I know.

761
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,246
But this...

762
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:22,332
This Soldier Boy thing came up,

763
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,794
and you know the baggage there, I...

764
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,716
I tried upping my meds, just...

765
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,052
You're having bad thoughts again.

766
00:42:34,136 --> 00:42:37,055
And the tics and the compulsions.

767
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:39,516
Monique, I lost my shit
in front of Janine.

768
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,936
It's like, Soldier Boy, he's like this...

769
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:46,690
this steel sliver
inside of my brain, after he...

770
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,485
I don't know what to do.

771
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,578
You need to go back to Butcher.

772
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:03,123
That's what.

773
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,960
I never wanted to try to turn you
into something you're not.

774
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,880
I-I hate that you're making yourself
sick over it.

775
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:17,012
Maybe I can't be with you anymore, Marvin,

776
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,097
and I am so sorry for that.

777
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:24,519
But you should go do what you have to do.

778
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,398
Face this shit down.

779
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,321
Please don't tell Janine about this.

780
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,783
About any of it. My pops, none of it.

781
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,994
I just want to leave her out of it.

782
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,873
Janine will be right here, waiting.

783

00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:48,786
All my life, people
have tried to control me.

943
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:50,538
<i>My whole life.</i>

944
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,957
<i>Rich people, powerful people</i>

945
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,293
<i>have tried to muzzle me, cancel me,</i>

946
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:59,338
<i>keep me impotent and obedient,
like I'm a fucking puppet.</i>

947
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:01,132
<i>You know what? It worked.</i>

948
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,384
<i>Because I allowed it to work.</i>

949
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:05,887
<i>And guess what. If they can control me,</i>

950
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,055
then you can bet your ass
they can control you.

951
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,224
They already do.
You just don't realize it.

952
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:13,019
I'm done.

953
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:16,022
I am done apologizing.

954
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:18,691
I am done being persecuted
for my strength.

955
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:21,986
You people should be thanking Christ

956
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,239
that I am who and what I am,
because you need me.

957
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:28,201
You need me to save you.

958
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,161
You do.

959
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:36,626
I am the only one who possibly can.

960
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,796
You're not the real heroes.

961
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:44,467
I'm the real hero.

962
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,098
I'm the real hero.
