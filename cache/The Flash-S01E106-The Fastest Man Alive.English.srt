1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,838
Help!

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,465
-Mom.
-Barry, no!

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:09,134
-I can't--
-Mom!

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,678
GUSTIN:
Well, Barry isn't really sure what he saw.

5
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:15,181
It was just a bunch of lightning
Circling his mom.

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:18,184
And as a kid, he had no idea what it was...

7
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,851
...other than his mom was in danger...

8
00:00:20,018 --> 00:00:22,020
...she was screaming,
she was in a lot of trouble.

9
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:24,189
All of a sudden he was transported
from his house.

10
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:25,732
There was no way of explaining it.

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,902
Mom?

12
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:32,363
GUSTIN:
And then he comes back to his home...

13
00:00:32,696 --> 00:00:36,116
...and his mother's been murdered
and his father's getting put into a police car.

14
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:41,205
So he doesn't know what happened
other than it wasn't his father that did this.

15
00:00:41,372 --> 00:00:43,415
And he's determined to...

16
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:45,668
...find out who did.

17
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:49,505
Mom.

18
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:52,216
JOE: Barry.
-Mom.

19
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,386
MARTIN:
Well, initially when it first happened...

20
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:57,762
...we weren't aware at all
what Barry saw.

21
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:00,722
He just kept saying, "I saw yellow...

22
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:02,724
...and red lightning."

23
00:01:03,475 --> 00:01:07,938
And honestly, there's a Reverse-Flash,
the yellow piece of lightning...

24
00:01:08,105 --> 00:01:11,441
...and a red Flash, our Flash, Barry.

25
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:15,654
But that red Flash is actually Barry
from the future.

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,951
Which I guess could be kind of confusing,
but we're trying to figure it out.

27
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:39,011
KREISBERG: One of the things
I always loved about the Flash was that...

28
00:01:39,177 --> 00:01:41,513
...you know, he was just a guy
who got hit by lightning.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,767 X1:0
And when you look at the DC Comics
characters, they all tend to be gods.

30
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,439
Superman's an alien,
and Diana's an Amazon.

31
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:52,398
Aquaman is from Atlantis.

32
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,527 X1:0
Barry was always like if it had happened to us
and we got to be part of the Justice League.

33
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:03,699
He was funny, but he was a hero sort of
of the people and for the people.

34
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:07,578
I think that combination of, you know,
the fun of his powers...

35
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:12,666
...combined with his innate vulnerability,
both physically and emotionally...

36
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,502
...always made him one of the most
appealing characters for me.

37
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,464
The Flash is the fastest man alive.
And you just--

38
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:23,010
As a kid, and as an adult,
you dream of that ability and that capacity.

39
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:26,305
You know, and it's our job as storytellers
to come up with...

40
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:29,683
...what are the pros and the cons
of having that ability.

41
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,229
Even though he was really fast, he could
be shot, you know, and he could be killed.

42
00:02:34,396 --> 00:02:36,732
And he was, in fact, killed, you know,
famously.

43
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:41,945
BERLANTI: <i>The Flash</i> was the first comic book
that I cried when I read it as a kid.

44
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:46,492
He died in a series of books
called <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths.</i>

45
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:49,160
And he died sacrificing his life.

46
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:52,413
We deal with that in the show a lot
in terms of sacrifice.

47
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,668
I mean, I think as kids, it was really one of the
first sort of deaths that we had dealt with.

48
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,463
If you were reading the comics,
you know, in the '80s...

49
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,548
...you know,
things started to get much tougher.

50
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:07,178
Certainly with Crisis and, you know,
we actually borrow a little bit...

51
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:09,514
...of the iconography
of Barry's face melting...

52
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:11,849
...in episode 123, "Fast Enough," because...

53
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:14,727
...you know, again that--
Those images meant so much to us.

54
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,063
And usually you're used to like,
"They'll figure out a way to do it in the end."

55
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,607
And at the end of the day,
Barry realized:

56
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:24,236
"I'm willing to give my life to save the world
and to save my friends."

57
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:27,656
Barry's guilt drives him.
He knows that his father's innocent.

58
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:32,577
The fact that he can't prove it is killing him
and driving him at the same time.

59
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:36,123
He thinks he needs to take care
of the whole city now.

60
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,542
Even though we haven't had
Barry Allen die on our show...

61
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,877
...that level of courage
and that level of sacrifice...

62
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:44,548
...and that level of love that he has,
you know, not just for his friends...

63
00:03:44,715 --> 00:03:48,092
...but for everybody,
certainly permeates our version of the show.

64
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:52,220
BERLANTI: It was always
my sort of secret dream, I think...

65
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:56,266
...to be a part of launching
a Flash anything, really.

66
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:58,351
To me, what was so exiting about
sort of doing...

67
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:01,103
...a <i>Flash</i> television show
at this particular moment...

68
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:06,859
...was really sort of, I think, we're kind of all
in this era of everything moves so quickly.

69
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:11,447
You know, we can be in touch with people
and our friends all throughout the day...

70
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:15,993
...and I think people can really kind of
finally identify emotionally with the Flash.

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,744
FLASH:
Whoo-hoo!

72
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,873
JOHNS: Speed can be a bit addictive, right?
It's kind of the modern day vice, right?

73
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:24,416
We're all trying to go faster.
We want things faster.

74
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,127
We want downloads faster.
We want information faster.

75
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:31,423
We want everything faster,
and life is designed to speed up everything.

76
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,967
The heart and soul of the show
really kind of gets at that...

77
00:04:34,134 --> 00:04:36,470
...which is fast isn't always enough,
you know.

78
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:39,181
Sometimes it's about
all the other elements too.

79
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:41,099
Even the fastest man alive
could be late.

80
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:42,558
Sorry I'm late, Captain Singh.

81
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:45,603
What was it this time, Mr. Allen?
Did you forget to set your alarm clock?

82
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:49,064
KREISBERG: I think the biggest thing
that we had to do was really settle on...

83
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:51,400
...who our version of Barry Allen was.

84
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:55,654
And, you know, in some ways
we kind of cherry-picked...

85
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:57,281
...from a lot of different versions.

86
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:01,117
There's certainly the Barry Allen
that we all know from the <i>Silver Age</i>...

87
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:03,578
...but he's got a little bit
of Wally West in him.

88
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:05,997
What we really wanted
the audience to invest in...

89
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:08,625
...as far as Barry was concerned
was his vulnerability.

90
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:12,377
So that was sort of the biggest decision
we had to make and our biggest challenge.

91
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,630
And as soon as we saw Grant...

92
00:05:14,797 --> 00:05:19,176
...we knew that we had found
our Barry Allen or our Flash.

93
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:27,976 X1:0
You're gonna have to revise your definition
of lightning fast.

94
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:32,064 X1:0
KREISBERG: And what we were looking for
in our Barry Allen, in our Flash...

95
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:36,485 X1:0
...was somebody who didn't necessarily
look like the standard superhero.

96
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:40,781 X1:0
And certainly didn't look like the, you know,
6-foot tall, blond-haired muscular guy...

97
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:42,366 X1:0
...that Flash is in the comic books.

98
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:45,118 X1:0
And once people saw his screen test,
and definitively...

99
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:49,081
...when people saw those two episodes
of <i>Arrow</i> that Grant guested on...

100
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,792
...you know, I think we'd, you know--

101
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,544
We'd introduced Flash
for a new generation of people.

102
00:05:55,503 --> 00:05:58,965
You're also gonna have to revise
your definition of possible.

103
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:02,844
KREISBERG: We worked with David Nutter
on the <i>Arrow</i> pilot...

104
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,594
...and he did such an amazing job there.

105
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,888
There really was no question
of who we would get.

106
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:08,098 X1:0
Are you ready?

107
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:10,308 X1:0
BERLANTI:
I've worked with David Nutter many times...

108
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:12,936 X1:0
...over many years.
And I think what's so exciting is...

109
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:16,731 X1:0
...he doesn't just get a story in terms
of a filmic level, he gets it emotionally.

110
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,902
And I thought what would be exciting
about this in contrast to something like <i>Arrow</i>...

111
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:24,030
...it had this real emotional underpinning...

112
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:26,908
...that I knew would--
I hoped that David would respond to...

113
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:29,369
...and then be able to sort of translate
to the actors.

114
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:33,081
KREISBERG: You know, David was there
every step of the way...

115
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:36,334
...helping us to mold this,
helping us to find this character...

116
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:40,254
...helping us to, you know,
realize the visual effects.

117
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:42,590
But also finding the heart of the character.

118
00:06:42,756 --> 00:06:44,758
BARRY:
<i>I’m so proud...</i>

119
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:46,926
<i>...to be your son.</i>

120
00:06:47,093 --> 00:06:49,554
BERLANTI: We use the words
"heart," "humor," and "spectacle"...

121
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:51,431
...whenever we're talking about the show...

122
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:53,975
...that the best episodes
have all of those things.

123
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:56,935
And I think that's where--
One of the great things about the show...

124
00:06:57,102 --> 00:07:00,772
...is it actually hopefully feels like
you're actually reading a comic book.

125
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:03,734
When I watch a great episode of the show,
it makes me feel the way...

126
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,903
...the books used to make me feel
when I was a kid.

127
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,448
Which is it's sort of larger than life,
anything's possible...

128
00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:12,618
...but a totally emotional, relatable
sort of story.

129
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:15,787
That at the end of the day
is the most important thing for us.

130
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:18,957
Um, Barry Allen is a character.
What Barry's going through...

131
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,543
...what the audience is going to feel
as they're watching it.

132
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,670
And David is one of those directors...

133
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:26,548
...who is equally as adept at staging
an amazing car chase...

134
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:28,508
...or the tornado sequence...

135
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:30,761
...as he is having a scene between,
you know...

136
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:33,055
...Barry and Iris in Jitters
or, you know...

137
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:36,058
...Barry and his dad at the end,
you know, and I think it's--

138
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:40,687
You know, the skill that David has
in elevating all of those things...

139
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:44,858
...is what makes <i>The Flash</i> so special and
makes it feel like more than just a comic book.

140
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:46,443
[WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON TV]

141
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,403
WOMAN [ON TV]: <i>--enthusiasm here
as no one seems ready to leave.</i>

142
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,446
<i>Those outside are finding cover....</i>

143
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:54,115
MARTIN:
It seems that every hero...

144
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:55,950
...is born out of some tragedy.

145
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:58,869
And, of course,
the same is true with Barry.

146
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:02,205 X1:0
His father ends up in jail
for, seemingly, life...

147
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:04,624 X1:0
...and his mom, of course, dies.

148
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,460 X1:0
Um, and much later...

149
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:09,170 X1:0
...you know, does the hero emerge.

150
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:16,761
JOHNS: Having him experience tragedy
in his life, like his mother dying...

151
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:20,640
...but having him not go dark about it--
Like there's a darkness within him...

152
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:21,975
...and he's haunted by it...

153
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:25,520
...but he's still moving forward, he's still smiling,
he's still trying to help people.

154
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,690
Geoff Johns said it to me best
early on...

155
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:31,109
...that I think this is the way
Barry handled his past:

156
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:33,069
"Your past is like an anchor.

157
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:37,156
And you don't cut off an anchor
and leave it at the bottom of the ocean.

158
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:41,076
You pull it up with you and you carry on."
And I think...

159
00:08:41,243 --> 00:08:44,663
...better than most superheroes,
Barry does a good job of...

160
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,999
...you know, this is what happened to me.
I'm gonna find out why this happened...

161
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:50,292
...and how, but I'm gonna
move toward with my life...

162
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,836
...and I'm not gonna let this
define me or ruin me.

163
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:56,673
I don't know if I can be some vigilante.

164
00:08:57,215 --> 00:09:00,010
-You can be better.
KREISBERG: We talk a lot about Barry...

165
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:01,886
...obviously, in contrast to Oliver.

166
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:05,515
Oliver's getting hit by lightning
was being marooned on the island.

167
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:07,851
And he was not a hero before that.

168
00:09:08,018 --> 00:09:13,314 X1:0
He was actually, you know, very selfish
and manipulative and not a good guy.

169
00:09:13,982 --> 00:09:17,318
When you have, like,
Bruce Wayne or any of these characters...

170
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:21,698
...when they've had a dark tragedy happen
in the past, it's made them very cold adults.

171
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:24,284
It almost would have been better
if both his parents had died.

172
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:27,828
But losing one parent and then have the other
one be accused of murdering them...

173
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:30,956
...um, you know, it's the stuff of nightmares...

174
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:33,584
...and yet Barry still found a way to dream.

175
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:37,712
He had the heart of a hero,
but now he finally had the feet to match.

176
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:44,927
The power itself of the Flash...

177
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:47,889
...you know, has a great deal of appeal.

178
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:51,309
There's something much more grounded
about enjoying the Flash's powers...

179
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:54,395
...because who wouldn't wanna
get to where you're going faster?

180
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:58,523
Who wouldn't want to move faster? You know,
there's never enough time in the day.

181
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,943
Barry can get seduced by that speed,
we all could.

182
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,489
And he can get over-confident
and think he has time to do everything.

183
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:09,701
You know, but it's still time.
It's still gonna take time to do anything.

184
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:12,496
There's a great scene in a comic book...

185
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,873
...where the Flash is running...

186
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,835
...he's trying to save people, as many people
as he can, he gets to a car wreck...

187
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:21,587
...he's like, "I'm gonna save everybody,"
and he opens the door...

188
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,506
...and the person inside is already dead.

189
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:30,471
It's too late. And I think the most frustrating
thing that Barry has to deal with now is that...

190
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:34,642
...as a forensic scientist, he's always
at a crime scene that's already happened.

191
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:37,477

192
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:42,439
Everybody's out.
What else you got for me, Cisco?

193
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:43,732
Barry, it's Caitlin.

194
00:10:45,275 --> 00:10:47,694
Hey, Caitlin.

195
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:50,823
-How's your day?
KREISBERG: One of the other things that...

196
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,492
...we wanted to imbue this show with
was joy.

197
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,119
And the joy of being the Flash.

198
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:59,540
And, you know, sometimes that joy
leads Barry to, you know, um....

199
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:01,208
You know, be a little full of himself.

200
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,128
FLASH:
Cisco, are you gonna bring it or what?

201
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:06,797
Bring it.

202
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:09,967
BERLANTI: I think Barry can get a little cocky
sometimes because he's...

203
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:13,387
...you know, got this new ability
and it feels good.

204
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:16,139
And it feels good to be great at something.

205
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:18,141
And it feels good to save people.

206
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:21,060
GUSTIN: I'm the one with these powers
at the end of the day...

207
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:25,815
...so you can't really tell me how to use them,
they're mine. Um....

208
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:28,818
But yeah, and I think that stems
from he's a 25-year-old...

209
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:34,657
...that now has these
just unbelievable powers.

210
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:37,910
And no one can really stop him
from doing what he wants to do.

didn't just medal, pal, you Michael Phelps'ed.

then I'm gonna shoot you.

Two.

218
00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:00,975
I don't see Barry being seduced by power,
I don't see Barry giving into...

219
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:03,561
...that power and doing bad things with it,
I think...

220
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:06,022
...if anything, Barry's gonna
over-extend himself...

221
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:09,566
...and he's gonna try too hard,
and he's going to...

222
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:13,195
...maybe even believe he can do it,
which might hurt him.

And, uh.... And that's it.
But I just don't, you know--

As far as, like, enhancing flaws...

225
00:12:19,242 --> 00:12:23,580
...I think it only really enhances goodness
in him and his intentions are good...

226
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:25,916
...but ultimately,
it might lead to something bad.

227
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:27,918
You know, as far as his bravado's concerned...

228
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,879
...that's something we're certainly talking
a lot about for season two.

229
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:33,548
You know, season one was about
Barry becoming a hero.

230
00:12:33,715 --> 00:12:37,969
Season two is really going to be about:
Now that you're a hero, what does that mean?

231
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:40,263
And the responsibilities of being a hero.

232

00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:58,989
BERLANTI: I think with all these shows,
you know, the hero's only as good as the villain.

238
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:02,284
We spend a lot of time thinking about
what are the match-ups that week.

239

Who's the Flash going up against?

240
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:09,749
<i>The Flash</i> comic books always had a little bit
of that great sci-fi, science element.

241
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,418
So you were kind of getting a science lesson
along with the fun.

[SNARLS]

247
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,096
KREISBERG: So for us, the villains
are just as important as the hero.

248
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,766
And it's not just a question
of the visual effects, you know...

249
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,977
...what's a compelling, you know...

...visceral opponent for the Flash

...you know, special effects-wise.

...it happened to me too.

But it didn't just give us abilities...

If he'd been struck by lightning and had been
a different kind of damaged soul...

00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,260
...you know, the terror and havoc
he could wreak with these powers....

263
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,347
And in some ways, Barry has had it worse
than some of these other villains.

264
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:14,477
Um, and how can, you know, Barry's journey
be mirrored in their journey?

265
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:19,815
And how can we see how Barry's heroism
is not just in defeating the villain physically...

266
00:14:19,982 --> 00:14:21,400
...but also in a way...

267
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:24,320
...overcoming the emotional damage
that the villain has experienced...

268
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:27,489
...that the villain wasn't able
to overcome, but Barry has.

that we've been really lucky to have this year...

attracted for that has also made the show...

Captain Cold is my all-time favorite villain.

282
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,355
I don't know why. I think it's because...

283
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:06,900
...one of the very first <i>Flash</i> comics
I ever read, he was on the cover.

284
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:09,402
And he had these goggles that were so cool
and, like--

285
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:13,656 X1:0
He kind of looked almost like a gangster
and he had this cold gun.

286
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:16,576 X1:0
He said, "Wait till you see what I did
to the Flash," and it's, like--

287
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:20,538 X1:0
It says "censored" over the Flash's body,
and I was like, "Oh, my God, what did he do?"

288
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:25,709
BERLANTI: Yeah, I mean, we wanted Cold
because in the history of the Flash...

289
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:27,544
...he's the archrival.

290
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:31,798
He's got a cold gun,
which obviously is working...

00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,966 X1:0
...in direct opposite
to what the Flash can do. Um--

292

But he had his own moral code.

a back-story as Barry did.

that Wentworth said to us...

306

...when we were talking about the character,
that he feels that what separates Snart...

307

...and what makes him, like,
not quite fully evil is that...

308
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:16,294
...Snart always says to himself...

00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:41,486
...but also to the Flash
and the people of Central City...

318
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:44,489
...and we're not quite there yet.
You're starting to see glimpses of it.

319
00:16:44,656 --> 00:16:47,200
And, you know,
the fact that he's kept Barry's secret...

320
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:48,951
...that he discovered Barry was the Flash...

321
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:53,205
...midway through the season and hasn't told
anybody, even his sister and his partners...

322
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:55,166
...speaks to that, you know, burgeoning code.

323
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:57,668
And I think it's what makes him
such a fascinating villain.

324
00:16:57,835 --> 00:17:00,044
I guess your secret's safe...

325
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:01,754
...Flash.

326
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,304
Oh, I don't suppose you'd give me
a ride back to town, would you?

327
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,978
The Rogues.

328
00:17:17,979 --> 00:17:19,063
Cute.

329
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,734
I've been going over unsolved cases
from the past nine months...

330
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:27,779
...and there's been a sharp increase
in unexplained deaths and missing people.

331
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,530
Your metahumans have been busy.

332
00:17:29,697 --> 00:17:33,159 X1:0
I'm not blaming you. I know you didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

333
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:34,534
I know you all lost something.

334
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:39,122
But I need your help to catch Mardon
and anyone else out there like him.

335
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:40,581
But I can't do it without you.

336
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:44,668
MARTIN:
I think it's kind of important to surround...

337
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:47,338 X1:0
...your lead character, your superhero...

338
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:51,217 X1:0
...with people who might actually
be super humans.

339
00:17:51,383 --> 00:17:56,263 X1:0
And what I mean by that is people who are just
really, really concerned about the humanity...

340
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,351
...that this person should have
and should seek out.

341
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:03,979
I mean, because when you become
a superhero, a lot of things become physical.

342
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,066
You know, were you can physically
save the world.

343
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:12,862
But emotionally, you might not be there.

344
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,241
So he needs some really "super" humans...

345
00:18:16,407 --> 00:18:19,285
...around him in order for him to have, like...

346
00:18:19,452 --> 00:18:21,371
...a stable, emotional life.

347
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:24,457
BERLANTI:
What's great about Team Flash is that...

348
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:28,086
...they're all really discovering the hero
within themselves this year.

349
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:33,925
Everybody really was affected by that
particle accelerator's explosion that night.

350
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:37,387
And so much of their journey
for the year is discovering...

351
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:40,598
...the best that's in each of themselves
and how they work well...

352
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:43,726
...independently and together as a team.

353
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:47,730
And there's all sorts of challenging things
about working with a group of people.

354
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:50,066
You know, there's times
you work smartly together...

355
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,442
...and there's times that you're in conflict.

356
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:54,236
But there's a real familial sense.

357
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:57,155
You can tell they all really like
and admire each other.

358
00:18:57,322 --> 00:19:00,117
This isn't even
remotely anatomically correct.

359
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:02,035
That's not the point, Dr. Snow.

360
00:19:03,453 --> 00:19:04,913
Then what is the point?

361
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:06,957
To have fun.

362
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:09,293
GUSTIN:
Barry has a huge support system...

363
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:12,129
...for somebody that is kind of a loner.

364
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:15,673
I mean, he's got multiple father figures
in his life now.

365
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,678
Joe, who essentially is Barry's father
since he was 11...

366
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:22,888
...he's been there for him every day.

367
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:24,139
Joe is probably...

368
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:28,184
...Barry's biggest go-to support system.

369
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:31,354
And Iris obviously, but he can't be
fully honest with Iris right now...

370
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:34,566
...about multiple things and that
kind of eats at Barry so it's--

371
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:37,736 X1:0
Their relationship
is kind of a roller coaster...

372
00:19:37,902 --> 00:19:40,238 X1:0
...throughout this first season. Um....

373
00:19:40,405 --> 00:19:42,532 X1:0
But Caitlin and Cisco as well...

374
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:46,411 X1:0
...I think are Barry's
first true, like, friends.

375
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,206
We've been trying to track Snart...

376
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:53,126
...but he must have disconnected
the signal somehow.

377
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,294
[BARRY SIGHS]

378
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:56,253
We'll find him, Cisco.

379
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,047
Together.

380
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:00,966
VALDES: I think Cisco as a character
has a lot of optimism.

381
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,427
He sees Barry and he sees what he can do.

382
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:08,682
And it's not just his comic-book
fanboy fervor that allows him...

383
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:11,727
...to train him and push him...

384
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:14,313
...and fervently develop this technology
for him.

385
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,734 X1:0
It's also something that he sees in Barry.
He sees a lot of potential in him.

386
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:21,153 X1:0
And so I think when he sees that potential...

387
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,115 X1:0
...he goes and he commits
to being a part of this team.

388
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:28,202
PANABAKER: I think each character
has a different reason...

389
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:31,497
...for showing up to work every day
and fighting the universe...

390
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,792
...and making it a better world, you know.

391
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,086
Caitlin does wanna change the world.
She's a doctor...

392
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,212
...she does wanna change
the world for the better.

393
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:42,632 X1:0
Everybody has their own take
on how the loss has affected them...

394
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,675 X1:0
...and how it propels them forward.

395
00:20:44,841 --> 00:20:48,178
I think, again, that's Barry Allen's
great strength is that he--

396
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:52,098
Not only is he a hero himself, but he's able
to make other people heroes around him.

397
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:57,436
When we put our minds to it, dude,
nothing can stop us.

398
00:20:57,603 --> 00:20:59,939
GUSTIN:
He doesn't take that for granted, Barry....

399
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:02,566
It's really important to Barry
that he has this team.

400
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:05,277
And then Harrison Wells who is...

401
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,530
...this new father figure in Barry's life.

402
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:17,373
CAVANAGH: In many ways,
Barry Allen and Harrison Wells...

403
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:22,211
...are joined at the hip, you know, they....

404
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:25,464
There's no television show <i>The Flash</i>
without the Flash.

405
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:29,384
There's no Flash without Harrison Wells
and Harrison Wells' ability...

406
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:31,469
...to find someone worthy.

407
00:21:31,636 --> 00:21:32,928 X1:0
Um....

408
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:37,349 X1:0
And Barry Allen is that guy.

409
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:44,356
Barry does not pick up on the fact that
some shady things are going on with Wells...

410
00:21:44,523 --> 00:21:46,734
...as the audience finds out pretty early on.

411
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,902
But Barry's a little late...

412
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:52,156
...to pick up on all of those clues.

413
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:54,116
What's important is you!

414
00:21:54,992 --> 00:21:56,034
Not me.

415
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:59,121
I lost everything. I lost my company.

416
00:21:59,288 --> 00:22:02,583
I lost my reputation. I lost my freedom.

417
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,668
And then you broke your arm...

418
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:07,171
...and it healed in three hours.

419
00:22:07,337 --> 00:22:10,424
We always had a notion that, uh....
That Wells...

420
00:22:10,591 --> 00:22:13,260
...you know, was ultimately Barry's...

421
00:22:13,427 --> 00:22:15,137
...you know, big bad rival.

422
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:19,683
Uh, and would be in his midst the whole time,
and we would develop that dynamic.

423
00:22:20,726 --> 00:22:23,937
We certainly didn't know or didn't think
that it would be executed...

424
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:26,982
...to the level that it was
in the sense that Tom Cavanagh...

425
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:29,610
...was just so brilliant in the part.

426
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:32,070
The dynamic between Barry and Wells...

427
00:22:32,237 --> 00:22:34,448
...knowing, and then as we let
the audience know...

428
00:22:34,615 --> 00:22:37,451
...who Wells really was
and where he came from.

429
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:40,871
You know, and the irony
that he would be the one...

430
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:43,957
...to give Barry back his faith
so many times...

431
00:22:44,124 --> 00:22:45,500
...because at the end of the day...

432
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,627
...he needed Barry to go fast enough
so that he could go home.

433
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:51,254
And so you had the villain, you know...

434
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:53,131
...teaching the good guy...

435
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:55,300
...how to be a better good guy.

436
00:22:55,467 --> 00:23:00,222
And that dynamic, I think, was really fresh
and original for a show like this.

437
00:23:00,388 --> 00:23:03,892
And certainly, again, with Grant and Tom
in those scenes...

438
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:06,644
...was just terrific to see.

439
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,315
MARTIN:
Initially with Joe West...

440
00:23:12,482 --> 00:23:15,651
...I think part of Joe was really...

441
00:23:15,818 --> 00:23:18,237
...jealous of the fact that Barry...

442
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:22,449
...idolized and seemingly loved
Wells so much.

443
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:29,248
I'm waiting on you, Dr. Wells.

444
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:33,794
KREISBERG: One of our favorite films
is <i>Searching for Bobby Fischer.</i>

445
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:37,840
And we talk a lot about how that film,
you know, the main character had sort of a--

446
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:39,674
He had three father figures...

447
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:42,343
...and it was about a boy looking for fathers...

448
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,804
...and, in a way,
finding this sort of ultimate father...

449
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:48,182
...by taking the best of the three fathers
that he was presented with.

450
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:51,352
It doesn't matter
that you didn't believe in me...

451
00:23:53,521 --> 00:23:55,730
...because you always believed in my son.

452
00:23:56,147 --> 00:23:59,860
KREISBERG: If Joe and Henry sort of represent
the heart and the soul of him...

453
00:24:00,026 --> 00:24:02,863
...you know, Wells represents
everything he can be.

454
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:05,490
You keep working like you are,
you stay focused like you are...

455
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:08,368
...you will be ready the next time
your man in the yellow suit comes around.

456
00:24:08,535 --> 00:24:11,162
I think you mean the Reverse-Flash.

457
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:13,623
KREISBERG:
It's like you don't want him to be--

458
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:15,667
You don't want him to be the villain.

459
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,710
It's not that you can look past it...

460
00:24:17,877 --> 00:24:20,379
...but you wish that the awful part
wasn't true.

461
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:24,049
What if the man who killed my mom
was like me?

462
00:24:24,216 --> 00:24:28,304
I think I can say unequivocally,
you are one of a kind.

463
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,601
That fact that he was able to still be
a father figure to this man that he hated...

464
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:36,186
...and that Barry was able
to sort of see him as a father...

465
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:41,358
...even though, you know, not knowing
his true identity, but the audience did...

466
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:44,570
...it just made all of the scenes work
on a whole other level.

467
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:48,655
KREISBERG: When you have a show like this,
you have a big bad...

468
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:53,118
...but the big bad is part of the team,
and the big bad is in some ways...

469
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,245
...the most likable character
on the show.

470
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:58,290
Um, we just thought it was such
an interesting way to go.

471
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,750
That's gonna have an impact on him.

472
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,086
And I think as the years go on
and we see future seasons...

473
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,673
...you know, the events of this year
are in some ways as...

474
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,800
...you know, um...

475
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,261
...seismic and permanent
as the events of his childhood.

476
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,264
And this is a very personal opponent
and it's--

477
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,392
That's gonna get in the way for Barry, I think...

478
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,270
...and he just-- He needs to focus...

479
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,856
...and psych himself up
and believe that he can handle this...

480
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,317
...and kind of put all
the personal stuff aside...

481
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:30,029
...or harness it in the right way
and let them drive him...

482
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:34,075
...but he also needs to study everything
that happened that night...

483
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,201
...and make sure it doesn't happen
the same way.

484
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,921
CAITLIN: You can't be running around the city
like some supersonic fireman.

485
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,923
Why not?
This is what we talked about.

486
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,009
Me using my speed to do good.

487
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,974
BERLANTI: It's not an easy answer to
sort of say kind of what makes Flash a hero...

488
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,142
...because it's so many great qualities,
I think...

489
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,645
...and he has to sort of--
Certainly in the show...

490
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,648
...has to rediscover that
about himself many times.

491
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,983
I think like most of us...

492
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,068
...he has his good days and his bad days...

493
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,655
...and they're just more extreme
because of his abilities and his capacities.

494
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,864
But his heart's in the right place...

495
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:18,575
...and he's always trying to do
the right thing.

496
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:21,161
Barry's attachment to people...

497
00:26:21,328 --> 00:26:23,580
...people he cares about...

498
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,001
...is actually the key
to getting him up to speed.

499
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,670
He's overcome, even in childhood,
this great tragedy.

500
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:33,298
And it's-- It hasn't darkened him or made him
someone you don't wanna be around.

501
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:34,967
In fact, it's just the opposite.

502
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:38,429
And I think that reminds us all
about what's the best in all of us.

503
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:42,808
That really is his superpower,
is that ability to, you know...

504
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:45,894
...despite everything that's happened to him,
to keep marching forward...

505
00:26:46,061 --> 00:26:48,939
...and not just for himself, but be able
to share that with other people.

506
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:52,776
[PEOPLE CHATTERING]

507
00:26:54,862 --> 00:26:58,115
PANABAKER: I think seeing a real human
helps us all empathize and say:

508
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:00,867
"I could be that person,"
and believe that, "I could be the Flash.

509
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:03,619
I could get struck by lightning
and my world could be changed."

510
00:27:03,786 --> 00:27:07,123
And, yes, he has the power to do
great and incredible things...

511
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,459
...but, you know, he isn't perfect...

512
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:12,503
...he is flawed and he's figuring it out
as he goes along.

513
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,633
He makes some mistakes and that also
makes him really human and relatable.

514
00:27:19,177 --> 00:27:22,305
COSNETT:
Everyone else around him realizes...

515
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:24,807
...that anything's possible after this...

516
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:27,894
...and I think that's a wonderful thing
about the show, is that we all....

517
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:32,273 X1:0
Um, we can all believe in the impossible,
we all believe that...

518
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,859 X1:0
...something we thought
was not possible is possible.

519
00:27:39,405 --> 00:27:41,157
Barry?

520
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:50,708
MARTIN:
I-- That's why I'm not so sure where Barry's--

521
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:53,753
What Barry's destiny could possibly be.

522
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:57,507
Hopefully, it doesn't....

523
00:27:57,673 --> 00:28:03,471
It doesn't actually occur till many,
many, many years from now.

524
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:06,766
So we can still keep telling this story.
Because, I mean...

525
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:09,894
...as you know, the Flash universe is vast.

526
00:28:10,061 --> 00:28:11,979
He's gonna be staying with us for a while.

527
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:19,278
GUSTIN: It's amazing. It's--
I really have, I think, slowly but surely...

528
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:22,323
...slipped more into the skin and I--

529
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,617
It's been a nice parallel actually with--

530
00:28:24,784 --> 00:28:26,119
I can't believe this--

531
00:28:26,452 --> 00:28:28,996
I have this opportunity
and this is happening to me...

532
00:28:29,163 --> 00:28:31,290
...just as Barry can't believe
this happened to him...

533
00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:33,960
...and he's now this superhero
and he has this responsibility.

534
00:28:34,127 --> 00:28:35,586
He's growing with the character.

535
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:40,967
And I feel like I'm-- You know, I was
super awkward Barry Allen at the beginning...

536
00:28:41,134 --> 00:28:43,094
...and as Barry's become the Flash...

537
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:46,139
...I've become more confident with Barry
and with being the Flash...

538
00:28:46,305 --> 00:28:50,893
...and it's been kind of a nice journey
for Barry and myself...

539
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,105
...to kind of have a little parallel journey.
It's been fun.

540
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:56,357
FLASH:
<i>Every kid dreams of being a superhero.</i>

541
00:28:56,524 --> 00:28:58,651
<i>Having powers, saving people.</i>

542
00:28:58,818 --> 00:29:01,027
<i>Truth is, not much else changes.</i>

543
00:29:01,194 --> 00:29:03,488
<i>You still hurt, you still love...</i>

544
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:06,032
<i>you still wish and hope and fear things...</i>

545
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:08,535
<i>...and you still need people
to help you with all of it.</i>

546
00:29:09,202 --> 00:29:11,997
<i>In some ways, that's the best part.</i>

547
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:17,002
Supersonic punch, baby! Whoo!

548
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:19,421
FLASH:
<i>Actually, the best part is this:</i>
