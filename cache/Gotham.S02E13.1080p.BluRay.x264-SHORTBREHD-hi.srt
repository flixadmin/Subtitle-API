he's gonna come to us,

So, I should wake up one day,
with you in prison?

472
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:05,657
Or dead?
A life alone isn't one that I want.

473
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:09,953
I'll be there when you wake up.
I'll be there, I'll find a way, I will.

474
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:11,704
There's always hope.

475
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:15,041
As long as you're alive,
there's hope, right?

476
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,713
Yes, there's hope.

477
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,259
Okay.

478
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:31,599
My necklace, the one that you gave me
on our first anniversary,

479
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,145
it's on the night stand.
Would you get it for me please, dear?

480
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,651
Go. I'm strong enough to use it
if I need to.

If you hurry, you can make it out
before he gets back.

I'm not leaving you.

483
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,791
This must be very stressful
for you and your baby.

We're fine.

- I will.

for my part in this.

Alfred went to the city.

514
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:51,507
This is the man that Silver told us about.
Alfred tracked him down.

515
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:57,346
Patrick Malone.
I thought his name started with M?

516
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,515
The M stands for "Matches,"
that's a nickname.

517
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:01,434
That's a lame nickname.

518
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,980
So, you found him.
What do you need me for?

519
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:08,649
I need you to get me a gun.

- So, you're gonna kill him?
- Yes.

Your butler know?

522

Alfred thinks
he's gonna be the one to kill him,

- that's why I'm asking you.

You couldn't even push that guy
out of the window.

So, how do you expect to do this?

526
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:29,462
Because this man killed my parents.

Yeah, sure, the guy deserves it.

But doing this,
you won't ever, ever be the same.

That was you, it's all you.

573
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:44,592
Arkham was actually Barnes' idea,
but it made sense,

574
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,927
- it was good police work.
- What about Galavan?

575
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,221
Was that good police work, too?

576
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,183
- What about him?
- The way he died.

it's not what you told me.

And you know what?
If anybody deserves to die, it's Galavan.

<i>My guess is that you absorbed some of
your own formula over the past months.</i>

Your body underwent

when you were brought in here,
you were actually overheating.

Now look there, at the thermometer.

603
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:52,386
It's negative 20 degrees
and I'm not even cold.

The formula appears to have lowered
your core body temperature.
