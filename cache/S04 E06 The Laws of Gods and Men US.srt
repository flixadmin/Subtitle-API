1
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,962
Your Grace, if you'd like to sit,
I'm sure that--

2
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,881
We've been here since midday.

3
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,893
Easterners have a different sense
of time, I've often found.

4
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:09,022
Once, I was waiting for Salladhor Saan
here in Braavos.

5
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,693
Together, we were going to run
three shiploads of the finest...

6
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,556
Welcome to the Iron Bank.

7
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,684
Please... sit.

8
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:12,126
What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?

9
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,589
This is Stannis of the House Baratheon,
King of the Andals and the First Men,

10
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,008
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
and Protector of the Realm.

11
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,433
The Iron Throne is currently occupied
by Tommen of the House Baratheon,

12
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,227
King of the Andals and the First Men,

13
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,896
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
and Protector of the Realm.

14
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:34,524
He shares no blood with me.

15
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,069
He is a bastard, born of incest.

16
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,571
-As was his brother before him.
-Yes.

17
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:45,451
-We have heard this story.
-It's not a story. It's the truth.

18
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,496
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

19
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,249
A story about a jealous uncle

20
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,960
whose attempts to usurp the throne
from the rightful king

21
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,423
cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly
in blood and gold.

22
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,049
Gold you loaned him.

23
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,512
And you feel your blood
gives you a claim on our gold?

24
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,015
More than any man living.

25
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,143
Across the Narrow Sea,
your books are filled

26
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:15,440
with words like "usurper"
and "madman" and "blood right."

27
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:21,029
Here, our books are filled with numbers.
We prefer the stories they tell.

28
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:22,822
More plain.

29
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,409
Less open to interpretation.

30
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,748
How many fighting men remain loyal to you?

31
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,834
-Four thousand.
-And how many ships do you have?

32
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,672
The ones still afloat, Ser Davos,
not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

33
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,761
-Thirty-two.
-And how much wheat, and barley,

34
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,680
and beef, and pork
do you produce on Dragonstone

35
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:52,101
to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?

36
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,897
None.

37
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,401
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending

38
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,236
from our perspective.

39
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,825
I'm afraid we must respectfully
decline your request.

40
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,288
But we thank you for paying us
the honor of your visit.

41
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,384
-My lord.
-I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth.

42
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,930
You would not be either here.
In Braavos...

43
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,350
thieves are not rewarded with titles.

44
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,393
Well, strictly speaking,
I didn't do the thieving.

45
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,062
That would be the pirates.

46
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,940
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

47
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,403
This is the payment that was demanded
by King Stannis for my crimes.

48
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,116
I consider it an honest accounting.
He's an honest man,

49
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,619
and he's your best chance to get back
the money you've sunk into Westeros,

50
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:54,539
which is a lot, I imagine.
Wars are expensive.

51
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,706
The war is over.

52
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,209
As long as Stannis lives,
the war is not over.

53
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,753
Who's the real power in King's Landing?

54
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,547
-Ser Davos--
-Humor me.

55
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,259
-Tywin Lannister.
-How old is Tywin Lannister?

56
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,844
-Sixty-seven.
-Sixty-seven.

57
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,303
And when he dies, who's in command?

58
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,015
A half-grown boy, the product of incest?

59
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,894
Cersei Lannister,
a queen whose people despise her?

60
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,855
Jaime Lannister, a man best known

61
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,440
for killing the king
he was sworn to protect?

62
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:25,403
When Tywin's gone... who do you back?

63
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,156
That is a problem for another time.

64
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,366
Begging your pardon,
I think it's a problem for now.

65
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:36,038
There's only one reliable leader
left in Westeros. Stannis.

66
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,458
He's got the birthright.
He's in his prime.

67
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,336
He's a tried and tested battle commander.

68
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,423
And he doesn't just talk
about paying people back, he does it.

69
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,346
The lookout sees a pirate ship
sailing their way.

70
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,893
The captain shouts to his first mate,
"Bring me my red shirt."

71
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,812
The first mate brings the red shirt,
and the captain puts it on.

72
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,606
And when the pirates try to board,

73
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,941
the brave captain
leads his men to victory.

74
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:09,030
A few days later, the lookout screams,
"Two pirate ships!"

75
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,201
The crew is shivering like scared mice.

76
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,829
But the courageous captain hollers,
"Bring me my red shirt!"

77
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,332
After the battle, the first mate asks,

78
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,252
"Captain, why do you call
for your red shirt before battle?"

79
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,587
The captain replies,

80
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,424
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

81
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:34,764
The next morning, the lookout screams...
"Ten pirate ships! We are surrounded!"

82
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,808
The crew goes silent.

83
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,605
They all look to their brave captain,
waiting for his usual command.

84
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,941
Calm as ever, the captain bellows,
"Bring me--"

85
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,734
-"Bring me my brown pants!"
-"Bring me my brown pants!"

86
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,282
Do you think they ever met a pirate
who didn't tell them that joke?

87
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:55,952
Davos.

88
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,330
I heard you were rotting
in a dungeon in Dragonstone.

89
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,414
Only half rotted.

90
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,504
Join us, my friend. Join us.

91
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,798
This is Lhara.

92
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,008
-And this is--
-I am Lhara.

93
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,349
-She's an artist, this one, truly.
-No time, I'm afraid.

94
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,184
We sail at sunrise.

95
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,354
-We?
-You, me. We.

96
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:32,405
Once I thought this man loved me.
Now, I know he despises me.

97
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,535
He wants to see me die poor and alone
on some cold...

98
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,506
You won't be alone...
and you won't be poor.

99
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,225
There's a chest of the good stuff
left back at your house.

100
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,185
I gave it to your wife.

101
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:07,898
You're not my friend, my friend.

102
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,194
I'll see you at sunrise.

103
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,616
"I give you until the full moon

104
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,162
to order all ironborn scum
out of the North

105
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,415
and back to those shit-stained rocks
you call home."

106
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,876
"On the first night of the full moon,

107
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,130
I will hunt down every islander
still on our lands and flay them living,

108
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,551
the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum
I found at Winterfell."

109
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,639
"In the box, you'll find a special gift."

110
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,600
"Theon's favorite toy."

111
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,187
"He cried when I took it away from him."

112
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:51,776
"Leave the North now, or more boxes
will follow with more Theon."

113
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,695
"Signed Ramsay Snow,

114
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,157
natural born son of Roose Bolton,

115
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,453
Lord of the Dreadfort
and Warden of the North."

116
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,622
Yes!

117
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,249
They skinned our countrymen,

118
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,796
and they mutilated my brother,
your prince.

119
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,256
Your prince.

120
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:20,012
Everything they've done to him,
they've also done to you.

121
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,850
As long as they can hurt
our prince with impunity,

122
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,521
the word ironborn means nothing.

123
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,712
Go left.

124
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,850
-Theon Greyjoy.
-I don't know--

125
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,477
I'm here for Theon Greyjoy.
Take me to the dungeons.

126
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,271
He's not in the dungeons.

127
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,881
-Last cage on the right.
-Thank you.

128
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:41,886
This way!

129
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,234
We're going home.

130
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,112
No!

131
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:04,700
It's all right.

132
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,911
It's me, Yara.

133
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:11,373
You can't trick me. Tell him.
Tell him you couldn't trick me.

134
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,584
I'm not tricking you, Theon.
I'm saving you.

135
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,252
-Not Theon! Reek!
-They're here.

136
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,587
Reek! My name is Reek!

137
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,131
-If they catch us in here, we're trapped.
-Help me with him.

138
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,677
-No, you can't! You can't!
-You're Theon Greyjoy.

139
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:28,057
No, I don't believe her! I know who I am!

140
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:34,104
I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek!
Good Reek! I've always been Reek!

141
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,951
This is turning into a lovely evening.

142
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,136
I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!

143
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,522
Theon!

144
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,705
Give me my brother,
and no more of your men will die.

145
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,040
You've got bigger balls than he ever did.

146
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,422
But with those big balls of yours...

147
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,304
how fast can you run?

148
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,068
-Make for the ship now.
-But your brother.

149
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,279
My brother is dead.

150
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,247
I have a treat for you.

151
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,750
A reward.

152
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,127
Reward?

153
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,507
Yes, Reek.
Those creatures who came in the night,

154
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,843
they wanted to take you away.

155
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,054
And you didn't let them.

156
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,681
You remained loyal.

157
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,894
I... I didn't want them to take me.

158
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,857
-I was so scared. I didn't want them--
-Yes, yes, Reek.

159
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,618
It's a bath.

160
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,828
For you.

161
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,292
Remove those rags.

162
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,088
Now.

163
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,316
The britches, too, Reek. Take them off.

164
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,988
Do you love me, Reek?

165
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,497
Yes, of course, my lord.

166
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,167
Good.

167
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:09,922
Because I need you to do something for me.
Something very important.

168
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,633
There's a castle, you see.

169
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,136
Some bad men hold this castle.

170
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,057
I need your help to take this castle back.

171
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,354
But how can...

172
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,108
I need you to play a role.

173
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,112
To pretend to be someone you're not.

174
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,660
Pretend to be who?

175
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,663
Theon Greyjoy.

176
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:30,812
He is a goatherd.

177
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,316
He says he prayed for your victory
against the slave masters.

178
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,902
I thank him for his prayers.

179
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,711
It was your dragons, he says.

180
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,381
They came this morning for his flock.

181
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,764
He hopes he has not offended Your Grace,
but now he has nothing.

182
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,979
Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.
I cannot bring back his goats.

183
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:17,734
But I will see he is paid their value
three times over.

184
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,669
Send the next one in.

185
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,041
Queen Daenerys. Tales of your beauty
were not exaggerated.

186
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,293
I thank you.

187
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:19,212
Mine is one of the oldest
and proudest families in Meereen.

188
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,049
Then it is my honor to receive you.

189
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,177
My father, one of Meereen's most respected

190
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,929
and beloved citizens,
oversaw the restoration

191
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,683
and maintenance of its greatest landmarks.
This pyramid included.

192
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,021
For that, he has my gratitude.
I should be honored to meet him.

193
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,732
You have, Your Grace. You crucified him.

194
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,403
I pray you'll never live to see

195
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,614
a member of your family
treated so cruelly.

196
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,700
Your father crucified innocent children.

197
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,412
My father spoke out
against crucifying those children.

198
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,540
He decried it as a criminal act,
but was overruled.

199
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,835
Is it justice to answer one crime
with another?

200
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,588
I am sorry you no longer have a father,

201
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,674
but my treatment of the masters
was no crime.

202
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,469
You'd be wise to remember that.

203
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,639
What's done is done.

204
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:14,017
You are the queen,
and I am a servant of Meereen.

205
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,687
A servant who does not wish
to see its traditions eradicated.

206
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,484
-And what traditions do you speak of?
-The tradition of funeral rite.

207
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,112
Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.

208
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:31,701
My father and 162 noble Meereenese
are still nailed to those posts,

209
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,788
carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.

210
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,259
Your Grace, I ask that you order
these men taken down

211
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,511
so that they might receive proper burials.

212
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,223
And what of the slave children
these noble Meereenese crucified?

213
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,809
They were rotting in the sun as well.

214
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,646
Would you have begged me
for their right to a proper burial?

215
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:02,774
Your Grace, I cannot defend
the actions of the masters.

216
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,236
I can only speak to you as a son
who loved his father.

217
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,238
Let me take his body down.

218
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,951
Let me have him brought to the temple,
and buried with dignity,

219
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,287
so that he might find peace
in the next world.

220
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,002
Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.

221
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,009
Thank you... my queen.

222
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,272
How many more?

223
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,650
There are 212 supplicants waiting,
Your Grace.

224
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,069
Two hundred and twelve?

225
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,787
Send the next one in.

226
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,168
These meetings aren't always
going to be this early, are they?

227
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,128
I was up late last night.

228
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:10,425
So, does this mean
I am a master of something now?

229
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:14,471
-Coins, ships?
-Lord Tywin and I already determined

230
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,390
that I shall be the Master of Ships
long before you...

231
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,814
Lord Tywin, it's a great honor

232
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,192
to have been granted a seat
on this council. I--

233
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,110
The trial begins this afternoon.

234
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,489
We only have the morning
for affairs of state. So, shall we begin?

235
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,701
Sandor Clegane has been spotted
in the Riverlands, my lord.

236
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,204
A coward and a traitor.

237
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,916
My birds tell me the Hound
slaughtered five of our soldiers.

238
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,336
I believe the phrase
"fuck the king" was uttered.

239
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,837
Disgraceful.

240
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,423
What would it take to make
the common soldier stupid enough

241
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:54,594
-to try his luck with the Hound?
-Ten silver stags seems a generous bounty.

242
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,555
Make it 100. What else?

243
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,601
-More whispers from the east, my lord.
-The Targaryen girl?

244
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,604
Daenerys has taken up residence
in Meereen.

245
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,191
She has conquered the city,
and rules as its queen.

246
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,693
Conquered with what?

247
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:13,655
She commands an army of Unsullied,
my queen. Some 8,000 strong.

248
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,492
She has a company of sellswords,
the Second Sons.

249
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:23,373
She has two knights advising her,
Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.

250
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,668
-And she has three dragons.
-Baby dragons.

251
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:32,549
-Larger every year, Your Grace.
-Mormont is spying on her for us.

252
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,552
No longer.
He appears to be fully devoted to her.

253
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,888
As for Ser Barristan, it would seem

254
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,308
he took his dismissal
from the Kingsguard

255
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,394
-a bit harder than anticipated.
-He's an old man.

256
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:49,065
-He wasn't fit to protect my son.
-Joffrey didn't die on his watch.

257
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,694
Dismissing him was as insulting
as it was stupid.

258
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,488
Don't tell me you're worried
about a child halfway across the world.

259
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,534
A child with two seasoned warriors
counseling her

260
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,287
and a powerful army at her back,
Your Grace.

261
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,371
Lord Varys is right.

262
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,167
I have been to Essos
and seen the Unsullied firsthand.

263
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,836
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

264
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,172
Less so in the bedroom.

265
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:17,260
Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years.
Armies win them all the time.

266
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:23,350
-She must be dealt with.
-How, my lord? By force?

267
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,226
Eventually, if it comes to that.

268
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,732
Can your little birds find
their way into Meereen?

269
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,859
Most certainly, my Lord Hand.

270
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,113
Lord Tyrell, be a good man.
Fetch my quill and paper.

271
00:27:58,802 --> 00:27:59,761
Prince Oberyn.

272
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,722
Lord Varys.

273
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,474
Only Varys.

274
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,853
I'm not actually a nobleman. No one
is under obligation to call me lord.

275
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,271
And yet everyone does.

276
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,693
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

277
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,696
-Did you spend much time in Essos?
-Five years.

278
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,825
May I ask why?

279
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,577
'Tis a big and beautiful world.

280
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:29,165
Most of us live and die
in the same corner where we were born

281
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,167
and never get to see any of it.

282
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,589
-I don't want to be most of us.
-Most of us aren't princes.

283
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,719
You... are from Essos.

284
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,431
Where? Lys?

285
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,394
-I have an ear for accents.
-I've lost my accent entirely.

286
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,770
I have an ear for that as well.

287
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,357
How did you get here?

288
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:58,486
-It's a long story.
-One you don't like telling people.

289
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,781
People I trust.

290
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,368
My paramour Ellaria,
she would find you very interesting.

291
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,162
You should come to the brothel
and meet her.

292
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,748
We brought our own wine,
not the swill they serve here.

293
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,460
We have some lovely boys
on retainer, but...

294
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,132
You did like boys before?

295
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,803
Really? Girls?

296
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,891
I hope you won't be offended
when I say I never would have guessed.

297
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:32,353
Not at all. But I was never interested
in girls either.

298
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,355
-What then?
-Nothing.

299
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,193
-Everybody is interested in something.
-Not me.

300
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,864
When I see what desire does to people,
what it's done to this country,

301
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,950
I am very glad to have no part in it.

302
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:53,333
Besides, the absence of desire
leaves one free to pursue other things.

303
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:54,876
Such as?

304
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,706
Let me guess, I've been pardoned.

305
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,349
Really?

306
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:58,356
-Father's orders.
-Well... we mustn't disappoint Father.

307
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,118
Kingslayer!

308
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,709
I, Tommen of the House Baratheon...

309
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:04,005
First of my Name,
King of the Andals and the First Men,

310
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:09,761
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
do hereby recuse myself from this trial.

311
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,891
Tywin of the House Lannister,
Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm

312
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,435
will sit as judge in my stead.

313
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,606
And with him, Prince Oberyn,
of the House Martell

314
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,275
and Lord Mace, of the House Tyrell.

315
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,153
And if found guilty...

316
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,074
may the gods punish the accused.

317
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,986
Tyrion of the House Lannister...

318
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:13,074
you stand accused
by the Queen Regent of regicide.

319
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,786
Did you kill King Joffrey?

320
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,041
-No.
-Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?

321
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,252
Not that I know of.

322
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,130
How would you say he died then?

323
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,882
Choked on his pigeon pie.

324
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:36,139
-So, you would blame the bakers?
-Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.

325
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,561
The crown may call its first witness.

326
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:46,065
Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away
from the mob, the Imp rounded on him.

327
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,903
He slapped the king across the face,
and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.

328
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,116
It wasn't the first time
the Imp threatened Joffrey.

329
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,868
Right here, in this throne room,

330
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,787
he marched up those steps,
and called our king a halfwit.

331
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,875
Compared His Grace to the Mad King,
and suggested he'd meet the same fate.

332
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,795
And when I spoke in the king's defense,
he threatened to have me killed.

333
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,590
Why don't you tell them
what Joffrey was doing?

334
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,759
-Silence!
-Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark

335
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,594
while you tore at her clothes,
and beat her.

336
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,636
Silence!

337
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,808
You will not speak unless called upon.

338
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,312
You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.

339
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,571
"Basilisk venom...

340
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,573
widow's blood...

341
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,076
wolfsbane...

342
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,787
essence of nightshade...

343
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,622
sweetsleep...

344
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,208
tears of Lys...

345
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,585
demon's dance...

346
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,382
-blind eye--"
-I think you have made your point,

347
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,135
Grand Maester.
You have a lot of poison in your store.

348
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,096
Had, Prince Oberyn.

349
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,933
-My stores were plundered.
-By whom?

350
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:07,605
By the accused, Tyrion Lannister,
after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.

351
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:09,273
Grand Maester...

352
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,944
you examined King Joffrey's corpse.

353
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,281
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

354
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,867
Without question.

355
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:27,125
This was found on the body
of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool.

356
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:33,297
He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark,
the wife of the accused,

357
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,132
away from the feast.

358
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:40,346
She wore this necklace
the day of the wedding.

359
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:48,604
Residue of the most rare
and terrible poison was found inside.

360
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,400
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

361
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,111
It was. The strangler.

362
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,532
A poison
few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.

363
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,953
And used to strike down
the most noble child

364
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,831
the gods ever put on this good earth.

365
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,340
"I will hurt you for this."

366
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:20,011
"A day will come when you think
you are safe and happy,

367
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,763
and your joy will turn to ashes
in your mouth,

368
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,515
and you will know the debt is paid."

369
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,977
Your own brother said this to you?

370
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,148
Shortly
before the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

371
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,277
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

372
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,073
As it turned out, when the attack came,

373
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,367
Joff insisted
on remaining at the battlements.

374
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,787
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

375
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,002
Tyrion said...
"And you will know the debt is paid."

376
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,254
What debt?

377
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,592
I discovered he'd been keeping whores
in the Tower of the Hand.

378
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,346
I asked him to confine
his salacious acts to the brothel

379
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,097
where such behavior belongs.

380
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,266
He wasn't pleased.

381
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,773
Thank you, Your Grace,
for the courage of your testimony.

382
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,667
Do you remember
the precise nature of this threat?

383
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,086
I'm afraid I do, my lord.

384
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,714
He said, "Perhaps you should speak
more softly to me then."

385
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,636
"Monsters are dangerous.
And just now, kings are dying like flies."

386
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,889
And he said this to you at a meeting
of the small council?

387
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:51,310
Yes... after we received word
of Robb Stark's death.

388
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:56,065
He didn't seem gladdened by the news.
Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark

389
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,567
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

390
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,657
You're excused, Lord Varys.

391
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,704
Father, may I ask the witness
one question?

392
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,461
One.

393
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:26,012
You once said, that without me this city
would have faced certain defeat.

394
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:30,141
You said the histories
would never mention me,

395
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,393
but you would not forget.

396
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,689
Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?

397
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,779
Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing.

398
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,000
We will adjourn for now.

399
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,464
-Toll the bells in an hour's time.
-Clear the court!

400
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,029
You'd condemn your own son to death?

401
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,406
I've condemned no one.
The trial is not over.

402
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,033
This isn't a trial. It's a farce.

403
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,202
Cersei has manipulated everything,
and you know it.

404
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:33,996
-I know nothing of the sort.
-You've always hated Tyrion.

405
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,915
-He killed his king.
-As did I.

406
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,752
Do you know the last order
the Mad King gave me?

407
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,337
To bring him your head.

408
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,257
I saved your life
so you could murder my brother?

409
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,551
-It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
-Justice?

410
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:51,097
I'm performing my sworn duty
as Hand of the King.

411
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,849
If Tyrion is found guilty,
he will be punished accordingly.

412
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,352
-He'll be executed.
-No, he'll be punished accordingly.

413
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:03,818
Once you said, "Family is what lives on.
All that lives on."

414
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,571
You told me about a dynasty
that would last 1,000 years.

415
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,282
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

416
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:15,830
I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath
to carry on the family line.

417
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,833
-I'm well aware of your oath.
-What happens to your name?

418
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,253
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

419
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,130
Your nephews?

420
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,717
Lancel Lannister? Others
whose names I don't even remember?

421
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:32,847
What happens to my dynasty if I spare
the life of my grandson's killer?

422
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,890
It survives through me.

423
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,311
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

424
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,690
I'll take my place as your son and heir

425
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,985
-if you let Tyrion live.
-Done.

426
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,949
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

427
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,868
Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.

428
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,621
He'll plead for mercy.
I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch.

429
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,293
In three days' time,
he'll depart for Castle Black

430
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,044
and live out his days at the Wall.

431
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,463
You'll remove
your white cloak immediately.

432
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:11,051
You will leave King's Landing to assume
your rightful place at Casterly Rock.

433
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:16,390
You will marry a suitable woman,
and father children named Lannister.

434
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:20,060
And you'll never turn your back
on your family again.

435
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,319
-You have my word.
-And you have mine.

436
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,221
Not going well, is it?

437
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,556
-You're going to be found guilty.
-You think so?

438
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,392
When you are, you need to enter
a formal plea for mercy,

439
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,894
and ask to be sent to the Wall.

440
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,271
Father's agreed to it.

441
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,483
He'll spare your life,
and allow you to join the Night's Watch.

442
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,862
Ned Stark was promised the same thing,
and we both know how that turned out.

443
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,281
Father is not Joffrey.
He'll keep his word.

444
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,407
How do you know?

445
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,080
Do you trust me?

446
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,127
Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts.

447
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,088
This will all be over soon.

448
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,023
The crown may call its next witness.

449
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,476
State your name.

450
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,981
-Shae.
-Do you swear by all the gods

451
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,400
that your testimony
will be true and honest?

452
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,779
-I swear it.
-Do you know this man?

453
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,749
Yes. Tyrion Lannister.

454
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:52,087
-Now, how do you know him?
-I was handmaiden to his wife, Lady Sansa.

455
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,175
This man stands accused
of murdering King Joffrey.

456
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,635
What do you know of this?

457
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,389
I know that he's guilty.

458
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,101
He and Sansa planned it together.

459
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,187
Silence!

460
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:11,940
Continue.

461
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:16,528
She wanted revenge for her father,
her mother, her brother.

462
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,739
She blamed their deaths on the king.

463
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,492
Tyrion was happy to help.

464
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:25,496
He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen.

465
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,664
He hated you, my lord.

466
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,044
He stole poison
from the Grand Maester's chamber

467
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,420
to put in Joffrey's wine.

468
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,839
How could you possibly know all this?

469
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,010
Why would he reveal such plans
to his wife's maid?

470
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,722
I wasn't just her maid.

471
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:48,894
I was his whore.

472
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,773
I beg your pardon?
You said you were his...?

473
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,067
His whore.

474
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,532
-How did you come to be in his service?
-He stole me.

475
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,035
I was with another man,
a knight in your lordship's army.

476
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,371
But when Tyrion arrived at the camp,

477
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,124
he sent one of his cutthroats
into our tent.

478
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,211
He broke the knight's arm,
and brought me to Lord Tyrion.

479
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,547
"You belong to me now," he said.

480
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,884
"I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world."

481
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,390
Silence. Silence!

482
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:28,934
And did you?

483
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,395
Did I what?

484
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,523
Fuck him
like it was his last night in this world.

485
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,944
I did everything he wanted.

486
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:43,198
Whatever he told me to do to him.
Whatever he felt like doing to me.

487
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,952
I kissed him where he wanted.
I licked him where he wanted.

488
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:51,957
I let him put himself where he wanted.
I was his property.

489
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:56,170
I would wait in his chambers for hours
so he could use me when he was bored.

490
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,007
He ordered me to call him
"my lion," so I did.

491
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:06,805
I took his face in my hands, and said,
"I am yours and you are mine."

492
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,352
Shae.

493
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:16,940
Please don't.

494
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:21,945
I am a whore.

495
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,156
Remember?

496
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:31,413
That was before he married Sansa.
After that, all he wanted was her.

497
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,082
But she wouldn't let him into her bed.

498
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,961
So, he promised
to kill King Joffrey for her.

499
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:48,805
Father,

500
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,600
I wish to confess.

501
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,230
I wish... to confess.

502
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,400
You wish to confess?

503
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,530
I saved you.

504
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,991
I saved this city...

505
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,578
and all your worthless lives.

506
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:15,958
I should have let Stannis kill you all.

507
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,043
Tyrion.

508
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,674
Do you wish to confess?

509
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,515
Yes, Father... I'm guilty.

510
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:37,563
-Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?
-You admit you poisoned the king?

511
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,107
No, of that, I'm innocent.

512
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:47,739
I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime.
I am guilty of being a dwarf.

513
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,410
You are not on trial for being a dwarf.

514
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,537
Yes, I am.

515
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,875
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

516
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,004
-Have you nothing to say in your defense?
-Nothing but this.

517
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,256
I did not do it.

518
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:10,846
I did not kill Joffrey,
but I wish that I had.

519
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,432
Watching your vicious bastard die

520
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:17,686
gave me more relief
than 1,000 lying whores.

521
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:24,943
I wish I was the monster you think I am.

522
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,073
I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

523
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:34,536
I would gladly give my life
to watch you all swallow it.

524
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:39,041
Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn.
Escort the prisoner back to his cell.

525
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:45,505
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

526
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:51,428
And I know I'll get no justice here.
So, I will let the gods decide my fate.

527
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,308
I demand a trial by combat.
