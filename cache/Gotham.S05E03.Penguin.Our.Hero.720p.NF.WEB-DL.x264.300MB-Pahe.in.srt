Production is steady, Mr. Cobblepot.

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,910
Our stores contain 512 loaves of bread,

23
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,790
2,001 liters of filtered water,

24
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,490
400,232 bullets,

25
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,980
and...

26
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,690
Penn, why is my countertenor out cold?

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,970
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

28
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,380
Uh... everyone was working
through the night

29
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,790
in the bullet factory.

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,990
We've been, uh, shorthanded,

31
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,190
since people started defecting.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,500
Defecting?

33
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,240
You've been holding out on me, Penn.

34
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,720
A thousand apologies.
I-I simply couldn't stand

35
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,580
seeing you upset while
you were recovering.

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,320
Just tell me everything!

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,150
Rumor is they've fled to a place

38
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,820
called Haven,

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,540
in Jim Gordon's sector.

40
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,040
My subjects are fleeing to Jim Gordon?

41
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,640
After he shot me?!

42
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,520
What about the bounty on Gordon's head?

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,320
We've had trouble finding takers.

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,080
The gangs are too disorganized,

45
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,500
and-and ordinary people, well...

46
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,600
they love him, sir.

47
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,110
They should love me.

48
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,720
Without me,

49
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,500
this entire island
would sink into chaos!

50
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,010
It's not just us.

51
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,940
People from every territory
are fleeing to Haven.

52
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,320
Finally. Breakfast.

53
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,050
Ha!

54
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,220
The Street Demonz!

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,960
To what do I owe this honor?

56
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
You hit our stronghold
and killed our men.

57
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,310
Not just us.

58
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,220
You hit the Lo Boyz and the Undead, too.

59
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,580
Did I, now?

60
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,470
You tagged the scenes with graffiti

61
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,240
that said "Penguin was here."

62
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,580
You dolt.

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,710
If I wanted to start a gang war,

64
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,900
you'd all be dead.

65
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,720
I wouldn't leave a few and sign my name.

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,420
Someone wanted you to attack me.

67
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,010
- That's a good point.
- Mm-hmm.

68
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,540
We didn't really think this through.

69
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,800
No. Well, there will be
plenty of time for thinking

70
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,740
when my men are ripping
out your fingernails.

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,880
Chain him up.

72
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,840
Wait! No!

73
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,340
Tighten our borders.

74
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,080
No one in or out, or it's your head.

75
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,240
That's right, Edward.

76
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,060
It's Mr. Penn's head!

77
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,450
It's his head!

78
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,540
You're a good dog, aren't you?

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,960
Word of this place is spreading

81
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,220
like a bad case of the
clap. We got refugees

82
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,050
coming in from every
territory in Gotham.

83
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,190
Can you blame 'em?

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,540
You saw what it was like out there.

85
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,920
People being starved and terrorized,

86
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,940
used by the gangs as slave labor.

87
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,500
You think those same gangs
aren't gonna want 'em back?

88
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,120
Sooner or later, they're
gonna come looking for us.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,230
Let 'em.

90
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,240
Hey, I get it,

91
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,900
but after our excursion through
nightmareville last week,

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,180
we hardly have any ammo left... sorry...

93
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,080
and we barely have any food.

94
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,400
Okay, all right.

95
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,250
This is the only safe
place left in Gotham.

96
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,660
I'm not turning people away.

97
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,020
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

98
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,360
- Hey, how you feeling? How, is uh...
- I'm fine.

99
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,500
You getting any sleep?

100
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,300
You've been going full tilt for months,

101
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,540
carrying the weight of everyone.

102
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,100
Share the load. We can't
have you fall apart.

103
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,980
Thanks. I'm okay.

104
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,040
Please tell me some good news.

105
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,160
Water purification system repurposed

106
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,700
from Wayne Enterprises tech.

107
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,300
I know it's a drop in the
bucket, but every bit helps.

108
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,370
That's the last can of beans!

109
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,080
- I ain't had my rations yet!
- Think I have?

110
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,710
Hey, break it up. Break it up!

111
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,080
Break it up.

112
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,970
For all the new people here...

113
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,020
everyone is welcome in
Haven, but there are rules.

114
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,360
And one of them is we leave
the fighting outside.

115
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,810
Government already thinks
we don't deserve help.

116
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,330
We have to show otherwise.

117
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,640
Gangs want to tear
themselves apart outside,

118
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,820
that's their business.

119
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,010
In here, in Haven...

120
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,200
... we help each other survive.

121
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,890
Your speech worked.

122
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,760
For now.

123
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,460
What happens when they find out
the government abandoned them?

124
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,860
Sorry.

125
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,780
For what?

126
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,070
Jim, you're holding this place together.

127
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,120
You're giving these people hope.

128
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,540
Hope can only go so far.

129
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,300
Not to put more on your plate,

130
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,620
but the kid whose friends you
saved from the slavers...

131
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,880
his bunkmates say he's
been having nightmares.

132
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,800
Last night he fell off his bed
half-asleep, broke his arm.

133
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,250
Maybe you can talk to him.

134
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,010
Hey.

135
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,940
You don't feel like
joining the other kids?

136
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,100
We can't even begin to imagine
what you've been through.

137
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,760
But it's over. You're safe now.

138
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,440
I promise I will never let
anyone hurt you ever again.

139
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,900
Okay?

140
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,700
I got something for you.

141
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,660
From my rations.

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,960
Little pineapple.

143
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,800
Hang in there.

144
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,850
I'll come check on you later, okay?

145
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,560
Selina?

146
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,030
One second.

147
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,480
What are you doing out of bed?

148
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,760
The doctor said you need rest.

149
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,620
Does it look like I need rest?

150
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,380
No, but...

151
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,630
Look, whatever Ivy's root did to me...

152
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,280
I've never felt better.

153
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,880
So now I have to find
the freak who shot me.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've been looking for Jeremiah
since the bridges blew.

155
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,050
I haven't found a thing.

156
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,280
Right, but there have
never been refugees

157
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,320
in the Green Zone before.

158
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,380
These people come from
all over Gotham, Bruce.

159
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,500
Someone has to know something.

160
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,070
I want to find Jeremiah
just as much as you do.

161
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,090
But even if we find him, he's
had months to fortify himself.

162
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,340
We can't go after him alone.

163
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,840
You scared, Bruce?

164
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,030
Of course I'm scared.

165
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,140
Jeremiah shot you to get to me.

166
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
He almost killed you.

167
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,740
I won't lose you.

168
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,720
I'm not yours to lose.

169
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,280
You can't stop me from
going after Jeremiah.

170
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,440
But I am asking you for help.

171
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,520
We take him down, we do it right.

172
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,860
We bring him back here,

173
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,620
and he stands trial for turning
Gotham into a madhouse.

174
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,460
What?

175
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,400
I was hoping I could count on you.

176
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,560
I heard rumors about
Jeremiah in the Dark Zone,

177
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,300
but who knows if they're true.

178
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,800
The Dark Zone?

179
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,420
On the other end of the island.

180
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,300
It's chaos,

181
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,360
ruled by those who've lost their minds

182
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,010
since the bridges went down.

183
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,430
They said Jeremiah is there,

184
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,300
gathering followers.

185
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,960
Sounds like a lead.

186
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,520
No. You can't go there.

187
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,760
You'll die.

188
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,460
We fought Jeremiah before.

189
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,860
You don't understand.

190
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,340
If you go to the Dark Zone,

191
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,660
Jeremiah is the least of your worries.

192
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,940
Everyone there is insane.

193
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,940
Look at what they did to my friend.

194
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,160
_

195
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,280
Penn, where the...

196
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,280
♪ Penguin, my hero ♪

197
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,590
♪ He having no fear-o... ♪

198
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,150
- Stop.
- ♪ He bringing joy and cheer-o. ♪

199
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,170
Stop!

200
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,800
Where is my staff? Where is Mr. Penn?

201
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,280
Um, they're having to, um...

202
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,640
defected to Haven.

203
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,150
And my guards didn't stop them?

204
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,190
My guards, too?

205
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,530
Edward?

206
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,030
Edward! Edward!

207
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,230
They took my dog?

208
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,490
Rumors say pup went willingly.

209
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,550
Lies!

210
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,300
You're in luck, my friend.

211
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,700
Jim Gordon is luring people
from every territory in Gotham

212
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,270
including yours.

213
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,140
As our interests are now aligned,

214
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,740
I have decided that you may live.

215
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,260
He's been dead since yesterday.

216
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,520
Contact the Lo Boyz and the Undead.

217
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,420
You have men, vehicles and gas.

218
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,300
I have the bullets.

219
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,840
It's time we paid a
visit to this Haven...

220
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,500
right after I put on some clothes.

221
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,020
Jim! Border guards just radioed.

222
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,960
Penguin broke through the barricades.

223
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,580
Street Demonz, other
gangs rolling with him.

224
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,180
They're heading for Haven.

225
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,950
We can beat them there. Load up!

226
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,040
What the hell are we gonna do?

227
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,050
We don't have more than a
dozen bullets between us.

228
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,070
You're right.

229
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,900
We get in a firefight and we're dead.

230
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,240
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to go get some help.

231
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,060
I'm not sure we got any friends left.

232
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,620
I'm hoping we still have one.

233
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,100
So, this is the Dark Zone.

234
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,460
They should call it the Dull Zone.

235
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,960
Place is dead.

236
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,720
What?

237
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,980
You seem yourself again.

238
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm glad.

239
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,220
Wait, I know this block.

240
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,540
Used to be the posh part of town.

241
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,440
Everyone with money got out.

242
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,480
You didn't.

243
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,860
I had a reason to stay.

244
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,740
Oh, God!

245
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,580
Help me, please.

246
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,040
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- Come on.

247
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,780
Oh, God.

248
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,080
Get down.

249
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,040
Now we know who carved "kill"
into that guy's chest.

250
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,520
Do you think they know
anything about Jeremiah?

251
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,940
Let's find someone else to ask.

252
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,240
Let's go before they see us.

253
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,280
Kill!

254
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,890
We're not here for you.

255
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,480
We're looking for Jeremiah Valeska.

256
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,540
Kill you. Kill Jeremiah.

257
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,260
I don't think this guy is
much of a talker, Bruce.

258
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,760
What do you want to do?

259
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,920
Easy.

260
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,190
Find the schoolyard's biggest bully...

261
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,600
... and kick his teeth in.

262
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,460
The chicky-chick is mine.

263
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,290
Selina.

264
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,730
♪ Mine eyes have seen the glory ♪

265
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,070
♪ Of the coming of the Lord ♪

266
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,370
♪ He is trampling out the vintage ♪

267
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,370
♪ Where the grapes of
wrath are stored... ♪

268
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,330
Everyone inside. Inside.

269
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,210
Let's go. Get inside.

270
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,510
What's going on, Captain Gordon?

271
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,150
Inside, go.

272
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,650
Hold your fire.

273
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,810
Hold your fire.

274
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,250
Well, if it isn't my old friend Mr. Penn

275
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,030
and the Gertrud Kapelput Memorial Choir.

276
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:09,890
Oh, it is so nice to see
some familiar faces!

277
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,750
You shouldn't have come here, Oswald.

278
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,700
Oh, well, perhaps you shouldn't
have stolen my people

279
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,290
or my dog.

280
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,890
Every refugee is here
of their own free will

281
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,080
and under the protection of the GCPD.

282
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,330
Edward!

283
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,790
Edward!

284
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,730
Come here!

285
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,570
Right now!

286
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,170
I will make this very simple, Jim.

287
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:36,890
You return our people and
Edward and an apology

288
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,770
or we will destroy this
little commune of yours

289
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,190
and salt the earth on which it stands.

290
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
The answer is no.

291
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,240
Now turn around unless
you want a bloodbath.

292
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,160
Let me explain something, Jim.

293
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,190
I heard about your little excursion

294
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,430
through the territories.

295
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,710
So, whatever ammo you stole from me,

296
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,730
I'm betting you used it up,

297
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,670
which means you're bluffing.

298
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,300
You want to test us, Oswald?

299
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,410
I'm sure my men could use
the target practice.

300
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,430
Slice and dice, little chicky.

301
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,470
You look soft.

302
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,870
You look like 300 pounds of ugly.

303
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,470
Kill and kill.

304
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,350
Where's Jeremiah?

305
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,750
- Where is Jeremiah?
- Jeremiah?

306
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,670
Tell me where Jeremiah is or my face

307
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,750
is going to be the last
thing you ever see.

308
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,410
Old Town North, okay?

309
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,810
We don't mess with him.

310
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,470
Old Town North?

311
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,190
You wouldn't lie to me, would you?

312
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
It's the truth.

313
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,200
Selina, he's had enough.

314
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,590
He's had enough

315
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,690
when I say he's had enough.

316
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,570
What the hell?

317
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,020
You won.

318
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,220
It's over.

319
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,350
Old Town North. See?

320
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,470
That was easy.

321
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,310
What are we waiting for?

322
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,410
You said they'll be out of bullets.

323
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,760
He's bluffing, you idiot.

324
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,890
How do you know?

325
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,390
I know Jim Gordon.

326
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,830
But if you require a demonstration,

327
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,610
three of you, march.

328
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,590
But, uh, they have guns.

329
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,170
So do I

330
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,850
and mine is most certainly loaded.

331
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,450
On my mark.

332
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,610
Make them count.

333
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,090
Ah.

334
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,910
Well, Jim,

335
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,630
it seems you are out of ammo, after all.

336
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,600
Now, if you don't want your men

337
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,710
to die in a hail of bullets,
you know what to do.

338
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,210
Fine. On the count of three.

339
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,110
- One, two...
- All right.

340
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,210
All right. Put them down.

341
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,870
Put them down.

342
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,000
Selina, what was that back there?

343
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,340
They had to know I was serious.

344
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,160
You didn't have to hurt him like that.

345
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,060
He was trying to kill me, Bruce,

346
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,600
just like Jeremiah tried to kill me.

347
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,140
So as far as I'm concerned...

348
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,820
he got off easy.

349
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,540
Whose side are you on, Bruce?

350
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,340
Yours. Always.

351
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,910
Then let's do what we came here to do.

352
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,720
Looks like we're close.

353
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,990
When I see him,

354
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,660
I'm gonna tear his throat out.

355
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,020
Selina.

356
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,240
Welcome, pilgrims,

357
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,860
to The Church of Jeremiah Valeska.

358
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,960
The only place where
you faithful pilgrims

359
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,260
can become your very best selves.

360
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,050
Who the hell is that?

361
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,520
I don't know.

362
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,760
I bet she knows where
Jeremiah is, though.

363
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,320
Stay here. I'm gonna get a closer look.

364
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,840
No. We do this together, Selina.

365
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,880
That was the deal.

366
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,930
Funny, I don't remember saying that.

367
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,660
Now, I know you've
come from far and wide

368
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,440
to meet the man himself.

369
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,620
But first, he requires a show of faith.

370
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,340
Don't be shy.

371
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,800
Jeremiah awaits.

372
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,180
Who is ready?

373
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,160
Lovely.

374
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,690
Jeremiah will be so happy.

375
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,020
But remember:

376
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,680
he wants only the most
faithful followers.

377
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,140
And you all have a chance
to prove yourself,

378
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,880
right up those stairs.

379
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,860
And the rest of you, get out!

380
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,100
Selina.

381
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,660
Wait.

382
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,620
I want to meet Jeremiah.

383
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,960
You don't look like one
of Jeremiah's worshipers.

384
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:03,460
I have witnessed his work firsthand.

385
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,050
I will never forget it.

386
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,060
Then right this way.

387
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,970
You're gonna regret this.

388
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,360
Strong words,

389
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,080
for someone who is out of options.

390
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,740
First, I'm gonna make you
watch while I destroy Haven.

391
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,660
Then, I'm gonna shoot you

392
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,610
and leave you for dead,
just like you did to me.

393
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,780
Sound fair?

394
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,010
If the government liberates the
city and finds out about this,

395
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,660
you'll be at the top of their list.

396
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,000
Wake up, Jim.

397
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,080
The government has abandoned us.

398
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,350
The only law in Gotham is power,

399
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,110
and that power belongs to me.

400
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,460
We have children here. Families.

401
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,040
What happens when the gangs take them?

402
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,770
Hmm.

403
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,000
They probably go back to
being slaves, I guess.

404
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,860
My people, on the other hand,

405
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,850
will go back to their regular lives,

406
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,660
with their bellies full of
gruel and their heads full

407
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,800
of wonderful thoughts about
their grand protector, me.

408
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,980
If this is about revenge
against me, do your worst.

409
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,980
But leave the refugees out of it.

410
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,780
So heroic.

411
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,080
Almost tempting.

412
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,990
But I think I'm gonna stick
to my original plan.

413
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,300
Uh, Jim's gonna die, isn't he, boy?

414
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,920
Oh, you're a good dog, yes, you are.

415
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,920
Mr. Cobblepot.

416
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,680
Stop. That one belongs to me.

417
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,030
No can do.

418
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,760
You sacrificed one of my guys
calling the cop's bluff.

419
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,220
So what?

420
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,240
I said he's mine.

421
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,760
Oh, thank you, Mr. Cobblepot.

422
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,970
Then how about we take your territory?

423
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,580
And your bullet factory.

424
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,700
Penn! Penn!

425
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,220
I'm sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

426
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,920
You fool!

427
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,440
This never would have happened
if you stayed with me.

428
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,040
Why did you leave?

429
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,180
Everyone hated you.

430
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,760
You will pay for this!

431
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,580
Hey, Penguin, you got
something on your face.

432
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,700
Let me go! We had a deal!

433
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,460
Shut your mouth...

434
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,120
... or the next thing that comes
out your mouth is a bullet.

435
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,300
Man, you are on fire!

436
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,420
I take it that didn't work
out the way you'd hoped.

437
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,750
Barbara?

438
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,730
Barbara?

439
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,730
Hey, you in here?

440
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,730
You've gotten good at that.

441
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,950
Haven't you heard, Harvey?

442
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,920
No men in the Sirens past midnight.

443
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,200
Sorry to bust up ladies' night,

444
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,420
but Jim Gordon needs your help.

445
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,750
Oh, perhaps it's time Golden
Boy learned to save himself.

446
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,620
And aren't you tired
of playing sidekick?

447
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,720
See, I don't see it that way.

448
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,370
Me and Jim are friends.

449
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,270
We're fighting for the same thing.

450
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,610
It seemed like you got that.

451
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,290
You know, I remember when
you first partnered up.

452
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,510
He, the idealistic rookie.

453
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,720
You, the cynical veteran.

454
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,810
You were sane.

455
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,910
Now you carry his laundry.

456
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,730
Do you ever wonder what your life

457
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,470
might've been like if you'd
never met Jim Gordon?

458
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,530
I'd be dead, or wishing I was.

459
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,990
You're delusional, Harvey.

460
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,890
Just like all the sad saps
who think the government

461
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,170
is just gonna sail in and save them.

462
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,740
Maybe. And look,

463
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,750
I know you've had your
differences with Jim,

464
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,810
but if you don't help him now,

465
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,770
- Penguin and the other gangs...
- Penguin?

466
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,710
You should've opened with that.

467
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,640
Let's move!

468
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,560
It's not working.

469
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,360
We need to find a way
to cut these bindings.

470
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,030
Well, I'm not helping you, Jim.

471
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,780
You are the reason I'm
in this predicament.

472
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,040
You have taken everything from me.

473
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,440
Keep your voice down.

474
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,720
I kept people safe. I
protected them from chaos.

475
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,460
They should have loved me.

476
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,160
Instead, they came here, to this pigsty,

477
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,000
to be covered in fleas and filth.

478
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,240
Why? What makes this place so special?

479
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,620
Well, for one thing,
it's far away from you.

480
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,500
Oh, that's rich, Jim.

481
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,860
You should be proud of
yourself for that one.

482
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,860
Quiet.

483
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,280
I think I saw someone place a stash...

484
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,990
there.

485
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,770
- Who is that?
- A friend.

486
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,910
Just act normal.

487
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,320
I know it's a stretch.

488
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,860
Hey.

489
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,970
Bingo.

490
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,580
I'm gonna get out of here, Jim.

491
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,000
And I'm gonna watch these animals

492
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,680
tear this place to the ground.

493
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,940
So you make your way back to
your territory. Then what?

494
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,720
Hmm? You don't think that eventually,

495
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,340
these gangs are gonna come after you?

496
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,660
We need to take them out.

497
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,520
Right here, right now.

498
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,000
Now, how do we pick it up?

499
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,860
I'll have to have a word
with the cleaning lady.

500
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,200
Mind your step, pilgrims.

501
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,300
But first,

502
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,740
the main attraction.

503
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,860
Six-shooters.

504
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,280
Bang, bang.

505
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,500
Each of you get one gun.

506
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,660
And one bullet.

507
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,980
What is this?

508
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,600
Like I said, a show of faith.

509
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,580
But if you're ch-ch-ch-chicken...

510
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,540
Try me.

511
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,540
Oh, my little pilgrims.

512
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,140
This will make Jeremiah so happy.

513
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,810
Now,

514
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,060
on the count of three.

515
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,120
One...

516
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,760
Two...

517
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,540
Chicken poo.

518
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,780
Just seeing if y'all were listening.

519
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,450
Three!

520
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,140
Well, well, well.

521
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,860
You disappoint me, curls.

522
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,570
I had such high hopes for you.

523
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,200
What, with that

524
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,080
cocky little swagger and all.

525
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,530
I'm just not a mindless idiot

526
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:33,400
who's willing to get shot
in the head for nothing.

527
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,900
Hear that?

528
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:41,080
Curls is here to judge all of us,

529
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,120
to judge Jeremiah and his methods.

530
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,140
What a fitting reminder.

531
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,140
To outsiders,

532
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,590
Jeremiah's methods may
look like madness,

533
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,360
but we believers know:

534
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,610
his methods will be our salvation.

535
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,200
Now,

536
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,700
I need to have a word with our friend.

537
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,100
The rest of you

538
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,720
get straight A's.

539
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,740
Please proceed

540
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,500
and be reborn.

541
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,260
What's the matter?

542
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,000
Don't you want to meet Jeremiah?

543
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,100
I do.

544
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,040
I'm just not willing to play
your little psychotic game.

545
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,600
But, baby, it's so fun.

546
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
If it's so fun,

547
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,640
why don't you play?

548
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,140
Don't you get it?

549
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,610
I have.

550
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,420
The bullet's still inside.

551
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:27,620
Rattling around this old noggin of mine.

552
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,380
Ping. Ping.

553
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,180
Ping.

554
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,160
Boy, do I feel it when
the nights get cold.

555
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,740
You're insane.

556
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,220
No.

557
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,980
I was willing to look death in the face,

558
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,160
to allow the old me to die.

559
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,720
It's the gift Jeremiah's
brother Jerome gave him.

560
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,260
And the gift he wants
for all his followers.

561
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,560
Don't you want to experience
this gift for yourself?

562
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,220
I know I want you to.

563
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,280
Selina.

564
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,540
You know me.

565
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,750
There isn't a single part
of Bruce Wayne's life

566
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,400
that we don't know about.

567
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:29,260
His joys, his disappointments,

568
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,000
his desires.

569
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:36,300
But just like Bruce wasn't ready
to embrace his true self,

570
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,840
looks like you aren't either.

571
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,040
Maybe.

572
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,560
But one thing

573
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,920
Jeremiah did teach me is I...

574
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,180
hate

575
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,040
having a gun pointed at my face.

576
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,300
Oh, puddin', aren't you delicious.

577
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,660
Don't call me puddin'.

578
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,070
There you go, Selina.

579
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,120
I knew you had it in you.

580
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,170
All it took was a little

581
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,700
kick in the pants.

582
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,940
Where's Jeremiah?

583
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,920
Selina, drop the gun.

584
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,340
Oh-oh, your boyfriend's worried.

585
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,860
But I still don't think
you have what it takes.

586
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,150
Yeah?

587
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,370
Well, let's see what happens
when someone deserves

588
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,900
to get shot in the head.

589
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,920
Selina, stop!

590
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,400
Wait. You're bleeding.

591
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,130
If you know what's good for you,

592
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,700
you will let me go.

593
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,540
We need to get you patched up.

594
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,240
What are you doing?

595
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,820
I have been doing it your way.

596
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,220
I'm gonna do it my way.

597
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,420
Selina!

598
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,700
Selina!

599
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,950
Ha, ha, look at those biceps.

600
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,930
Whoa, I need him to build barricades.

601
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:46,980
Nah, homie.

602
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,530
This guy's got cage match
written all over him.

603
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,410
I'll give you two of mine in exchange.

604
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,730
How about this.

605
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,090
Drop your guns, and I won't shoot you.

606
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,500
How the hell did he get free?

607
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,770
Don't matter. He's bluffing again.

608
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,330
I'm afraid he's not.

609
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,350
Neither am I.

610
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,520
Come on out, boys.

611
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:24,190
Yes, Edward, I killed the bad men.

612
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,820
Penguin shot the gang leader.

613
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,080
Penguin! Penguin! Penguin!

614
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,990
Penguin! Penguin! Penguin!

615
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,450
Penguin! Penguin!

616
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,670
Penguin! Penguin!

617
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,420
Penguin! Penguin! Penguin!

618
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,430
Penguin! Penguin!

619
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,710
You'd said we'd be safe here.

620
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,250
We were better off where we came from.

621
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,270
Give it a rest, he saved us!

622
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,990
All right, listen up.

623
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,550
- Listen to me.
- For what?

624
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,150
Listen to me!

625
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,790
I know today was a hard day.

626
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,730
And I can't say there won't be others.

627
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,570
But we won.

628
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:17,230
We got Penguin's guns, his ammunition.

629
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,890
We survived.

630
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,350
And as long as we survive,

631
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,270
hope survives in Gotham.

632
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,190
I think that's worth fighting for.

633
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,430
So do I.

634
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,310
There's work to be done,

635
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,230
wounded to be cared for,

636
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,670
food, water to be doled out.

637
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,010
Tomorrow's another day.

638
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,500
Go to.

639
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:01,590
Captain, we've got Penguin outside.

640
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,550
All right, give me a minute.

641
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,890
Hey.

642
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,230
That was a brave thing you did there.

643
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,350
We wouldn't have escaped without you.

644
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:17,400
You saved me and my friends.

645
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,910
I wanted to help.

646
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,190
I can't be everywhere at once.

647
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,790
I'm gonna need people I can
trust watching over this place.

648
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:29,730
Maybe...

649
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,730
you could be my deputy here in Haven.

650
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,210
Thanks.

651
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,970
Because, honestly, I'm
allergic to pineapple.

652
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,630
Go get 'em, Deputy.

653
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,550
Jim, is this really necessary?

654
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,110
I did just save, I don't
know, hundreds of people.

655
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,190
After endangering them to begin with.

656
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,360
Forgive me if I wanted to play it safe.

657
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,530
Still, I do hope that there
are no hard feelings.

658
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:08,250
You did the right thing today, Oswald.

659
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:11,290
You're free to go, just
don't make me regret it.

660
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,060
Jim!

661
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,460
Harvey.

662
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,330
- Hi, Pengy.
- Jim!

663
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,890
- Hold your fire.
- Bye, Pengy.

664
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,660
- Barbara, no. No.
- Get out of the way! Now!

665
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:25,290
Outside of the Green Zone,
he's fair game, but not here.

666
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,340
Last chance.

667
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,830
Move now or you get my first bullet.

668
