According to Captain Baxter's intel,

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,264
Savage makes an appearance
in this quaint little hamlet.

55

63
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,532
That sounds like Savage's MO.

64
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,992
Yeah, but serial killing isn't.

67
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:23,347
Clearly, we have to assume that Savage

68
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,914
has a larger, more nefarious plan

69
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:26,916
but since we've jumped back in time,

70
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,323
Savage isn't expecting us here.

71
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:32,088
Savage is pretty good at hiding
even in a small town,

72
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,798

it's enough to make one nostalgic.

it'd still be creepy as hell.

139
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,966
I used to watch all these

and they all started off
in places like this.

See, first it's all perfect,

00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:52,955
and then, boom,
some alien monster beast thing

143
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,433
starts killing kids on Lovers' Lane.

144
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,958
- Ooh.
- I'm telling you, man.

An unhappy cheerleader.
Now, that is scary.

00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,428
That girl was from the newspaper
articles Rip showed us.

148
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,639
She knows the guys that went missing.

149
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:11,926
Perhaps she can illuminate us
as to their whereabouts.

150
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,685
Dude, can you not just say,

151
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,687
"Hey, Jax, why don't you go talk to her

152
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,054
"and find out what she knows?"

153
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,357
Like a normal person?

154
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,859
Hey, Jax, why don't you just go do that?

155
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,445
All right, we mustn't dawdle.

156
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,372
I believe our lunch hour

Come along, Nurse.

158
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:30,952
Just so you know,

159
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,871
Ra's al Ghul taught me how to
kill someone slowly

160

00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,928
What is up with them?

163
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,265
Um...

164
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,375
I don't think they've seen anyone--

165
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:57,198
Dip their fries in their milkshake before?

166
00:07:58,646 --> 00:07:59,647
Oh.

167
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:02,042
Uh-uh. Don't knock it
till you tried it, girl.

168
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,401
No.

169
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:05,403
Okay.

(SOFT CHUCKLING)

171
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:11,993
Okay, that's really good.

172
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,619
- Right?
- (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

173
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:15,955
- I'm Jax.
- Betty.

174
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,082
Nice to meet you, Betty.

175
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:22,211
Hey, Betty, just because
your boyfriend went AWOL

176
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,298
doesn't mean you have to slum it
with this loser.

177
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,301
Why don't you do yourself a favor, Biff?

178
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:32,180
Keep walking before you really,
really embarrass yourself.

179
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,307
(SLURPS)

180
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,605
What? You want to take a swing at me?

181
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,568
Hey, let's go.

182
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,112
This isn't over.

183
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,781
(CHUCKLES)

184
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,285
I'm so sorry about that.
Uh, where were we?

185
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,453
No, that was amazing.

186
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:57,705
(CHUCKLES)

187
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,477
Do you want to hang out tomorrow night?

188
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:04,337
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

189
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,796
- It's a date.
- Okay.

190
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,614
Well, now that we're done moving in...

191
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,805
Care to dance?

192
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,475
Sure.

193
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,567
So, yesterday we kissed
and now today we're married.

194
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:27,961
Okay, I know it seems
like we're moving fast,

195
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,111
but this is all pretend.

196
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,698
As soon as we get a divorce,
we'll figure us out.

197
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:37,161
In the meantime, doesn't mean
we can't have fun with it.

198
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:38,663
(CHUCKLES)

199
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,457
This is a waste of time.

200
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,064
We should be out there looking
for Savage, not playing doctor.

201
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,211
You know what I mean.

202
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:46,379
I'd like to think that

203
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,632
in a town with multiple murders
and missing teenagers,

204
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,843
the local insane asylum would be
a fertile ground for clues.

205
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,553
Let's start by reviewing the files

206
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,400
of every inmate
with a history of violence.

207
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:01,519
If you wouldn't mind getting me
those files, Nurse?

208
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,690
Literally, four days.

209
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,205
MALE DOCTOR: <i>Is that
a new perfume I smell?</i>

210
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,475
You know, if you're trying to
drive everyone crazy,

211
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,376
I have to tell you, it's working.

212
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:26,794
I'm very busy right now.

213
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,161
You know what your problem is?

214
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:30,214
<i>You don't know how to have a good time.</i>

215
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:33,676
Now, what you need is a man
who can show you--

216
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,220
Uh...

217
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,596
Oops.

220
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,813
Thank you. That was incredible.

221
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,399
Well, maybe next time he'll take
no for an answer.

222
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,403
Uh, it's not just him.

223
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,656
Most of the doctors here
are looking for a good time,

224
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,700
and most of the nurses all say yes

225
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,387
'cause they're looking to get married.

226
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,912
Hmm. Not you, though?

227
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:05,416
I'm not really looking for a husband.

228
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:11,005
Today is my first day.
Care to give the new girl a tour?

229
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,262
The files you asked for, Doctor.

230
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:19,847
Excellent, Nurse.

231
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:22,016
I could also go for a cup of coffee.

232
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,269
Me, too. Black. Two sugars.

233
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,149
(LAUGHS) And the cafeteria is over there.

234
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:32,716
It's better than what we serve
the patients, but not by much.

235
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:33,778
- Mmm.
- Oh.

236
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,322
And what's down there?

237
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,492
Oh, that's Hall H, the restricted ward.

238
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,454
It's for Dr. Knox's patients.
Violent psychotics.

239
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,208
That part of the tour is worth skipping.

from way out of town.

What a surprise! Tuna surprise.

00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,128
So many surprises.

258
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,921
Well, another reason why we dropped by

259
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,024
was to let you know that
we're having a soiree tonight.

260
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,329
Stop by any time after 8:00,
we're just across the street.

Don't bother to ring the bell.

262

No, you just walk right on in.

263
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:26,765
It's that kind of neighborhood.

264
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,517
Savage doesn't think I recognize him,

265
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,686
which means he won't try to kill me.

266
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,230
He can't steal my powers
before I found them.

267
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,791
Don't forget, we also have to figure out

268
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,275
why he's killing the townsfolk.

Are you really eating that?

270

Say what you want about Savage,

271
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:40,807
he makes one hell of a casserole.

272
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:41,945
Yes, well, Mr. Snart and I

273
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,700

Which reveal nothing

00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:50,206
except Savage is very good
at making people disappear.

276

That's something you both have in common.

like none of this happened?

00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:29,672
I'm gonna get back in my car,

482
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,090
and I'm gonna take her to the hospital.

483
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:32,115
(GRUNTS)

484
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:51,218
Gideon traced Jax's last
bio-signature to this location.

485
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,000
<i>Well, it seems you had good reason</i>

486
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,393
to be concerned for Mr. Jackson's safety.

487
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,104
Yeah, sucks being right all the time.

488
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,944
GIDEON: <i>She has suffered several
severe lacerations.</i>

489
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,654
<i>I'm attempting to cauterize the wound.</i>

490
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:12,322
- What happened?
- I don't know,

491
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,949
but I'm guessing Jax and Peggy Sue

492
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,700
had a pretty lousy first date.

493
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,160
Where is Jefferson?

494
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,454
(SIGHS) There was no sign of him
in the car.

495
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:23,208
These wounds don't appear
consistent with a knife.

496
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,003
GIDEON: <i>Correct. I believe these
lacerations were made by talons.</i>

497
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:28,755
It's Tommy.

498
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,716
Tommy Fuller,
one of the missing teenagers.

499
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,843
He's like a bird, he...

500
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,137
Like a bird monster.

501
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,515
GIDEON: <i>Captain, analysis of
Ms. Seaver's blood</i>

502
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,517
<i>reveals traces of silicate minerals.</i>

503
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,020
Ms. Seaver, do you recall

504
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:48,191
Tommy coming into contact
with a meteor of some kind?

505
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,026
The car crash.

506
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:52,028
It was...

507
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:53,363
It was glowing.

508
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,532
She's talking
about an Nth metal meteorite.

509
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,076
Say something that makes sense.

510
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,803
It seems Mr. Fuller's come into contact

511
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:02,205
with a meteorite
with mutagenic properties.

512
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,581
Try again.

513
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,108
Apparently, Ms. Seaver's boyfriend

514
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,888
has been exposed to
the same type of meteor

515
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,170
<i>that Kendra came into contact with.</i>

516
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:10,880
Me?

517
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:14,592
Well, you and Carter, 4,000 years ago.

518
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,803
The meteorite which gave you your powers

519
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,430
appears to be of the same variety

520
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,223
that mutated Tommy Fuller.

521
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,225
And I'm guessing it's not curable.

522
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,854
(STAMMERS) I suppose if the talons
which lacerated her

523
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,230
left some mutagenic residue

524
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,232
- I could--
- Yes or no?

525
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,192
Perhaps.

526
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,039
Why don't you get to work on that, Martin?

527
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,574
Okay, so if Savage isn't the one
doing the killing,

528
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,367
what is he doing in town?

529
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,702
Doesn't matter.

530
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,122
We can take him down.

531
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:45,609
The Amon Dagger. Where did you...

532
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:46,916
RAY: <i>Savage's house.</i>

533
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,419
All right. We need to
proceed on two fronts.

534
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:53,048
Locate Jefferson and make
an all-out assault on Savage.

535
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,342
A full-on attack only plays
to Savage's strengths.

536
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:56,968
If we want to get him...

537
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:58,553
We need to target his weaknesses.

538
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:00,930
Sadly, very few come to mind.

539
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,224
I can think of one.

540
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:05,769
Me.

541
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,438
He wants me and he always has.

542
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,274
So, if I can get
close enough to him, then--

543
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,650
Then he'll kill you.

544
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,779
Thank you for the vote of confidence,

545
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,447
but I don't need your protection.

546
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,574
There's no reason to go alone.

547
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,201
We're a part of a team for a reason.

548
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:25,038
Yes, and the team seems
comfortable with me doing this.

549
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:26,790
So, that makes it about you and me.

550
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,757
- Any updates?
- We're making progress.

551
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,301
In the meantime, we need to
get ready to back Kendra up.

552
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,512
She's going into the asylum
to meet Savage tonight.

553
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,348
Another opportunity for you
to see Nurse Carlisle.

554
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,268
(SIGHS) Yeah, and apologize.

555
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,772
I warned you, Ms. Lance.

556
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,441
Rushing a repressed woman from the 1950s

557
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,819
into the freewheeling sexual mores

558
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,278
of the 21st century--

559
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,045
Actually, I was the one who freaked out.

560
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,116
Oh.

561
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:04,119
Ever since I got brought back to life,

562
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:08,832
I haven't really experienced
much in the way of feelings,

563
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,001
and then when Lindsey kissed me--

564
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:15,004
It was like you were
being kissed for the first time.

565
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,091
How romantic.

566
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:19,509
It was more like terrifying.

567
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,846
That's the thing
that sucks about feelings,

568
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:26,224
is you realize how much
you can hurt someone

569
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,310
or get hurt.

570

Do the words "police brutality"
mean anything to you?

573
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,697
You think this is brutal?

574
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,199
You'll be begging for me
after he gets through with you.

575
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:47,704
That's enough, Sheriff.
Thank you. Leave us be.

576
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:52,083
This young man
and I have a lot to discuss.

577
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,961
Forgive my friend for his ignorance.

You will learn that
I'm much more enlightened.

579

Well, I'll take racist
over crazy any day.

580
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:05,555
Oh, I'd hardly describe
what I'm doing here as crazy.

581
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:09,893
Therapy is nothing more than
a process of self-discovery.

582
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:14,063
And you are about to experience
an extraterrestrial power.

We didn't get to finish

What of your
square-jawed husband Raymond?

00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,981
I didn't come here
to talk about my husband,

Nurse, I keep hearing voices in my head.

610
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,543
My wife with another man,

611
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:00,795
and it's driving me crazy.

612
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:03,673
Maybe you should learn to trust
your wife a little bit more.

613
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:07,719
Orderly. Show our new patient
to his room.

614
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:10,485
And don't hesitate to give him a sedative

share a psychic connection.

But for some inexplicable reason
I can't seem to reach him.

620
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,289
(SIGHS) I've grown so accustomed
to our partnership,

621
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:38,791
to suddenly be without him is disquieting.

622
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,251
I know the feeling.

623
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,717
So, have you tried psychoanalysis before?

No.

And what do we do in those dreams?

you could play out this little charade.

You show up on my doorstep

- actually end Savage by myself.

Whoa, whoa. Just slow down.

738
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,493
I made a mistake, too.

739
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,079
I got so caught up playing house

740
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:35,291
that I forgot about
why we were really here.

And you will end Savage someday.

a 4,000-year-old demi-goddess needs

is an over-protective husband.

enough about being a monster

it makes you a part of this team.

If we merge on the <i>Waverider,</i>

we could destroy the entire ship!
