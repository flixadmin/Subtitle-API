1
00:00:48,444 --> 00:00:51,864
<i>- Is everything in place?
- You're not to relieve me.</i>

2
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:54,742
<i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>

3
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:57,662
<i>You like him, don't you?
You like watching him.</i>

4
00:00:57,912 --> 00:01:00,915
<i>- Don't be ridiculous.
- We're going to kill him.</i>

5
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:03,626
<i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>

6
00:01:03,793 --> 00:01:04,836
<i>Do you?</i>

7
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:06,838
<i>It doesn't matter what I believe.</i>

8
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:08,714
<i>You don't, do you?</i>

9
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:11,050
<i>- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?</i>

10
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:12,885
<i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>

11
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:15,137
<i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>

12
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:16,931
<i>I better go.</i>

13
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:56,680
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

14
00:01:57,222 --> 00:01:58,307
Do it! Do it now!

15
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:22,331
- Lieutenant.
- Oh, shit.

16
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:26,376
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.

17
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:28,337
I'm just doing my job.

18
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:33,383
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

19
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:36,345
The orders were for your protection.

20
00:02:37,846 --> 00:02:40,057
I think we can handle one little girl.

21
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:46,939
I sent two units!

22
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,774
They're bringing her down now!

23
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:52,152
No, lieutenant, your men
are already dead.

24
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:22,307
Shit.

25
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:27,312
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

26
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:29,189
<i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>

27
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:31,566
<i>There's no time.
Get to another exit.</i>

28
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:34,236
- Are there any agents?
<i>- Yes.</i>

29
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:35,613
Goddamn it.

30
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,407
<i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>

31
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:40,034
<i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>

32
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,078
<i>You can make it.</i>

33
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:43,997
- All right.
<i>- Go.</i>

34
00:04:46,142 --> 00:04:47,185
That's impossible.

35
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:24,181
Get up, Trinity. Just get up.

36
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:26,058
Get up.

37
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:13,438
She got out.

38
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,023
It doesn't matter.

39
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,443
- The informant is real.
- Yes.

40
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,362
We have the name of their next target.

41
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:22,281
The name is Neo.

42
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,077
We'll need a search running.

43
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,288
It has already begun.

44
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:25,261
What?

45
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,518
What the hell?

46
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:42,111
"Follow the white rabbit."

47
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,124
Who is it?

48
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,668
It's Choi.

49
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,633
Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:11,349
You're two hours late.

51
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,685
I know. It's her fault.

52
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:14,936
You got the money?

53
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,231
Two grand.

54
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:20,233
Hold on.

55
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,294
Hallelujah.

56
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:42,422
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

57
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:44,549
You get caught using that...

58
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,926
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

59
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:50,138
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

60
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:52,432
You look a little whiter than usual.

61
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:55,727
My computer, it...

62
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:03,277
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

63
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:06,822
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

64
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:09,450
It's the only way to fly.

65
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:12,828
It just sounds like you
need to unplug.

66
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,581
Get some R and R?

67
00:09:15,998 --> 00:09:19,752
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

68
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:22,963
Definitely.

69
00:09:23,213 --> 00:09:26,300
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

70
00:09:26,925 --> 00:09:28,052
Come on.

71
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,929
It'll be fun. I promise.

72
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,937
Yeah.

73
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:41,607
Sure. I'll go.

74
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:10,302
Hello, Neo.

75
00:10:11,637 --> 00:10:12,805
How do you know that name?

76
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,349
I know a lot about you.

77
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,310
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

78
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,479
Trinity.

79
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:23,273
The Trinity?

80
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:25,442
That cracked the IRS D-base?

81
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,152
That was a long time ago.

82
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:29,321
- Jesus.
- What?

83
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,573
I just thought...

84
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:34,493
you were a guy.

85
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:36,203
Most guys do.

86
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:39,623
That was you on my computer.

87
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,333
How did you do that?

88
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,711
Right now, all I can tell you...

89
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:46,881
is that you're in danger.

90
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,759
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

91
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:52,011
They're watching you, Neo.

92
00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:55,014
- Who is?
- Please just listen.

93
00:10:58,518 --> 00:11:00,353
I know why you're here, Neo.

94
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:03,106
I know what you've been doing.

95
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:05,233
I know why you hardly sleep...

96
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:08,653
why you live alone and why,
night after night...

97
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:11,239
you sit at your computer.

98
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:13,950
You're looking for him.

99
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,745
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

100
00:11:18,246 --> 00:11:20,373
And when he found me...

101
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:24,085
he told me I wasn't really
looking for him...

102
00:11:25,003 --> 00:11:26,754
I was looking for an answer.

103
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,508
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

104
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:33,845
It's the question
that brought you here.

105
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,307
You know the question...

106
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:39,058
just as I did.

107
00:11:40,602 --> 00:11:42,228
What is the Matrix?

108
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,939
The answer is out there, Neo.

109
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:47,609
It's looking for you.

110
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:50,069
And it will find you...

111
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,363
if you want it to.

112
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:00,121
Shit.

113
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:01,498
Shit, shit.

114
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:14,594
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.

115
00:12:14,844 --> 00:12:18,890
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.

116
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,601
Obviously, you are mistaken.

117
00:12:24,562 --> 00:12:27,440
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...

118
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,069
because employees understand
they are part of a whole.

119
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:35,950
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

120
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:41,413
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

121
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:46,168
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

122
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:49,380
or you choose to find another job.

123
00:12:50,256 --> 00:12:51,590
Do I make myself clear?

124
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,260
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

125
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:03,602
Thomas Anderson?

126
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:07,273
Yeah, that's me.

127
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:09,275
Okay.

128
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:16,448
Great.

129
00:13:17,866 --> 00:13:19,034
Have a nice day.

130
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:35,551
Hello?

131
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:39,179
<i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>

132
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:43,183
- Morpheus.
<i>- Yes.</i>

133
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:45,436
<i>I've been looking for you.</i>

134
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:48,856
<i>I don't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.</i>

135
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:52,276
<i>But unfortunately, you and I
have run out of time.</i>

136
00:13:52,526 --> 00:13:56,238
<i>They're coming for you, and I don't know
what they're going to do.</i>

137
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:57,823
Who's coming for me?

138
00:13:58,073 --> 00:14:00,159
<i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>

139
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,910
What? Right now?

140
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:04,705
<i>Yes. Now.</i>

141
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:07,458
<i>Do it slowly.</i>

142
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,084
<i>The elevator.</i>

143
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:15,758
- Oh, shit!
<i>- Yes.</i>

144
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,514
What do they want?

145
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:25,018
<i>I don't know. If you don't want
to find out, get out of there.</i>

146
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:26,227
How?

147
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:29,606
<i>I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.</i>

148
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:32,484
- Okay.
<i>- The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>

149
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:37,739
- But what if they...
<i>- Go. Now.</i>

150
00:14:44,496 --> 00:14:46,873
<i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>

151
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:56,841
<i>When I tell you,
go to the end of the row...</i>

152
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:59,052
<i>to the office
at the end of the hall.</i>

153
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:01,680
<i>Stay as low as you can.</i>

154
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:05,100
<i>Go. Now.</i>

155
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:23,034
<i>Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.</i>

156
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:28,081
- How do you know this?
<i>- We don't have time.</i>

157
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:31,167
<i>To your left there's a window.
Go to it.</i>

158
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,963
<i>Open it.</i>

159
00:15:35,797 --> 00:15:37,590
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

160
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:40,427
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

161
00:15:40,677 --> 00:15:43,054
<i>There are two ways
out of this building.</i>

162
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:47,100
<i>One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.</i>

163
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,562
<i>You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.</i>

164
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:55,900
This is insane!

165
00:15:57,068 --> 00:15:58,945
Why is this happening to me?

166
00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:00,864
What'd I do?

167
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:03,992
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

168
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:06,035
I'm gonna die.

169
00:16:15,838 --> 00:16:16,881
Shit!

170
00:16:37,151 --> 00:16:38,277
Oh, shit!

171
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,034
I can't do this.

172
00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:58,714
Shit.

173
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:52,810
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

174
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:56,773
It seems that you've been living...

175
00:17:57,023 --> 00:17:59,150
two lives.

176
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:03,071
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

177
00:18:03,321 --> 00:18:06,658
program writer for
a respectable software company.

178
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:10,996
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

179
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:12,706
And you...

180
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,919
help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

181
00:18:20,422 --> 00:18:23,550
The other life is lived in computers...

182
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:26,803
where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

183
00:18:27,053 --> 00:18:31,850
and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

184
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:35,103
One of these lives...

185
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:37,188
has a future.

186
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:39,524
And one of them does not.

187
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:47,073
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

188
00:18:48,074 --> 00:18:49,409
You're here...

189
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:51,995
because we need your help.

190
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:58,627
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

191
00:18:58,877 --> 00:19:00,670
individual.

192
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:05,634
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

193
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:10,639
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

194
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:13,308
He is considered by many authorities...

195
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:16,603
to be the most dangerous man alive.

196
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:20,523
My colleagues...

197
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:23,902
believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

198
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:27,614
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

199
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:31,409
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

200
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:33,912
give you a fresh start.

201
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:37,332
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

202
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:41,086
in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

203
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:43,713
Yeah.

204
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,093
That sounds like a really good deal.

205
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,471
But I got a better one.

206
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:52,223
How about...

207
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,642
I give you the finger...

208
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:59,230
and you give me my phone call.

209
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,275
Mr. Anderson...

210
00:20:07,446 --> 00:20:08,489
you disappoint me.

211
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:11,367
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

212
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:12,994
I know my rights.

213
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:14,745
I want my phone call.

214
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:17,498
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

215
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:19,792
what good is a phone call...

216
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:23,629
if you're unable to speak?

217
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:59,623
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

218
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:02,293
whether you want to or not.

219
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:03,980
<i>This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.</i>

220
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:08,527
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

221
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:10,612
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

222
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,864
<i>you would probably be dead.</i>

223
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:17,577
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

224
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:22,666
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...</i>

225
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,877
<i>looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...</i>

226
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:27,629
<i>looking for you.</i>

227
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:31,341
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

228
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,178
- Yes.
<i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

229
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,606
Get in.

230
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,703
What's this?

231
00:22:59,953 --> 00:23:02,497
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

232
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:04,916
- From what?
- From you.

233
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:07,919
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

234
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,254
Stop the car.

235
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:15,010
Listen, coppertop.

236
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,262
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

237
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:20,141
Right now, there's only one rule:

238
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,767
Our way...

239
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,186
or the highway.

240
00:23:29,734 --> 00:23:30,818
Fine.

241
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:35,156
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

242
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,367
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

243
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,328
You know that road.

244
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:42,955
You know exactly where it ends.

245
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,418
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

246
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,142
Apoc, lights.

247
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,813
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

248
00:24:09,732 --> 00:24:11,984
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

249
00:24:19,742 --> 00:24:21,202
Try and relax.

250
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,668
Come on.

251
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,753
Come on.

252
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:33,506
It's on the move.

253
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:36,509
Come on, you shit.

254
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,596
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

255
00:24:40,763 --> 00:24:41,847
Clear!

256
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,566
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

257
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,644
This is it.

258
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:33,442
Let me give you one piece of advice.

259
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:36,069
Be honest.

260
00:25:37,654 --> 00:25:39,865
He knows more than you can imagine.

261
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:49,916
At last.

262
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,544
Welcome, Neo.

263
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,672
As you no doubt have guessed...

264
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,174
I am Morpheus.

265
00:25:58,216 --> 00:25:59,801
It's an honor to meet you.

266
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,303
No...

267
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:03,180
the honor is mine.

268
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:06,600
Please, come. Sit.

269
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:23,325
I imagine...

270
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:26,495
that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

271
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:30,624
tumbling down the rabbit hole?

272
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:32,542
You could say that.

273
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,088
I can see it in your eyes.

274
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:39,966
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

275
00:26:40,217 --> 00:26:42,469
because he's expecting to wake up.

276
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:46,473
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

277
00:26:47,182 --> 00:26:49,559
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

278
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:50,811
No.

279
00:26:51,228 --> 00:26:52,270
Why not?

280
00:26:52,521 --> 00:26:55,316
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

281
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:59,737
I know exactly what you mean.

282
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:06,411
Let me tell you why you're here.

283
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:08,996
You know something.

284
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,165
What you know,
you can't explain.

285
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:13,251
But you feel it.

286
00:27:13,835 --> 00:27:15,753
You felt it your entire life:

287
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:20,508
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

288
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:23,219
Like a splinter in your mind...

289
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:25,346
driving you mad.

290
00:27:26,264 --> 00:27:29,016
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

291
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:33,396
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

292
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:36,566
The Matrix?

293
00:27:39,068 --> 00:27:40,736
Do you want to know...

294
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:43,197
what it is?

295
00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:47,452
The Matrix is everywhere.

296
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:49,412
It is all around us.

297
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:51,622
Even now, in this very room.

298
00:27:52,457 --> 00:27:54,667
You can see it when you
look out your window...

299
00:27:54,917 --> 00:27:57,253
or when you turn on your television.

300
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,214
You can feel it when you go to work...

301
00:28:01,757 --> 00:28:03,426
when you go to church...

302
00:28:03,843 --> 00:28:05,928
when you pay your taxes.

303
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:09,974
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

304
00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:11,809
to blind you from the truth.

305
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,271
What truth?

306
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:21,068
That you are a slave.

307
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,864
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

308
00:28:25,114 --> 00:28:29,785
born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

309
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:31,370
A prison...

310
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:32,747
for your mind.

311
00:28:39,754 --> 00:28:42,089
Unfortunately, no one can be...

312
00:28:42,423 --> 00:28:44,801
told what the Matrix is.

313
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:50,140
You have to see it for yourself.

314
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,944
This is your last chance.

315
00:29:02,194 --> 00:29:04,530
After this, there is no turning back.

316
00:29:04,988 --> 00:29:06,448
You take the blue pill...

317
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:09,826
the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

318
00:29:10,077 --> 00:29:11,870
whatever you want to believe.

319
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,455
You take the red pill...

320
00:29:13,705 --> 00:29:15,666
you stay in Wonderland...

321
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,877
and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

322
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:29,972
Remember...

323
00:29:30,806 --> 00:29:33,850
all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

324
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:49,491
Follow me.

325
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:53,704
Apoc, are we on-line?

326
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:55,330
Almost.

327
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,711
Time is always against us.

328
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:02,588
Please take a seat there.

329
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:22,482
- You did all this?
- Mm-hm.

330
00:30:26,612 --> 00:30:28,614
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

331
00:30:29,364 --> 00:30:33,995
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

332
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:35,580
What does that mean?

333
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:38,333
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

334
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,001
because Kansas...

335
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:41,294
is going bye-bye.

336
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:20,583
Did you...?

337
00:31:31,594 --> 00:31:35,682
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

338
00:31:37,141 --> 00:31:39,727
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

339
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:42,480
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

340
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:44,524
and the real world?

341
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,318
This can't be.

342
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:48,528
Be what?

343
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:50,738
Be real?

344
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:56,119
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

345
00:31:56,327 --> 00:31:57,328
Still nothing.

346
00:31:57,912 --> 00:31:59,122
It's cold.

347
00:31:59,372 --> 00:32:00,748
It's cold!

348
00:32:04,627 --> 00:32:06,295
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

349
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:10,466
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

350
00:32:10,717 --> 00:32:12,176
Targeting almost there.

351
00:32:15,471 --> 00:32:16,889
He's going into arrest.

352
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,643
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

353
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:17,989
Welcome...

354
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:20,241
to the real world.

355
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,494
We've done it, Trinity.

356
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:25,288
We found him.

357
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:28,333
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

358
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,501
I know it.

359
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:36,716
Am I dead?

360
00:35:37,216 --> 00:35:39,385
Far from it.

361
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:54,777
He still needs a lot of work.

362
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,404
What are you doing?

363
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,865
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

364
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,992
Why do my eyes hurt?

365
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:04,578
You've never used them before.

366
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,375
Rest, Neo.

367
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,293
The answers are coming.

368
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,453
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

369
00:37:28,078 --> 00:37:29,163
What is this place?

370
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:32,082
More important than "what" is "when."

371
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,625
"When"?

372
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,878
You believe it's the year 1999...

373
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,380
when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

374
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:42,260
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

375
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,137
because we honestly don't know.

376
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,474
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

377
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,477
Come with me.
See for yourself.

378
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,771
This is my ship.

379
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:55,982
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
It's a hovercraft.

380
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,570
This is the main deck.

381
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,577
This is the core...

382
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,833
where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

383
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,381
Most of my crew you already know.

384
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,805
This is Apoc...

385
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,932
Switch...

386
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,684
- and Cypher.
- Hi.

387
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,647
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

388
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,942
The little one behind you is Mouse.

389
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:46,533
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

390
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,785
Trinity.

391
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,391
Try to relax.

392
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,106
This will feel a little weird.

393
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,453
This...

394
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,330
is the Construct.

395
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:35,875
It's our loading program.

396
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,586
We can load anything, from clothing...

397
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:40,212
to equipment...

398
00:39:40,504 --> 00:39:41,839
weapons...

399
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,300
training simulations...

400
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:47,219
anything we need.

401
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:52,433
Right now we're inside
a computer program?

402
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:54,643
Is it really so hard to believe?

403
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:57,771
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

404
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:01,066
Your hair has changed.

405
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:04,778
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

406
00:40:05,487 --> 00:40:08,115
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

407
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,122
This isn't real?

408
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:16,916
What is "real"?

409
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,543
How do you define "real"?

410
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,754
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

411
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:24,423
what you can smell, taste and see...

412
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:28,552
then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

413
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:35,142
This is the world that you know.

414
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,605
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

415
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:46,320
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

416
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,821
that we call the Matrix.

417
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:55,162
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

418
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:57,289
This is the world...

419
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,333
as it exists today.

420
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:15,349
Welcome to "the desert...

421
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:17,811
of the real."

422
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:23,566
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

423
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:27,612
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century...

424
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:31,116
all of mankind was united
in celebration.

425
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:36,121
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

426
00:41:36,913 --> 00:41:38,039
AI.

427
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,458
You mean artificial intelligence.

428
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:45,130
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

429
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:49,426
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

430
00:41:49,843 --> 00:41:53,054
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

431
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,891
They were dependent on solar power...

432
00:41:57,142 --> 00:42:00,478
and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

433
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:04,316
without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

434
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:09,446
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

435
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:15,118
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

436
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:22,751
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

437
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:27,130
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

438
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:31,217
Combined with a form of fusion...

439
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:36,389
the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

440
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:44,189
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

441
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:47,692
where human beings
are no longer born.

442
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:50,236
We are grown.

443
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:58,870
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

444
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,790
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

445
00:43:03,124 --> 00:43:04,752
watched them liquefy the dead...

446
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:08,339
so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

447
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:13,135
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

448
00:43:13,386 --> 00:43:16,305
I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

449
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:20,726
What is the Matrix?

450
00:43:21,936 --> 00:43:22,978
Control.

451
00:43:24,355 --> 00:43:27,733
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

452
00:43:28,526 --> 00:43:31,612
built to keep us under control...

453
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,950
in order to change a human being...

454
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,743
into this.

455
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,246
No.

456
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:43,457
I don't believe it.

457
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,042
It's not possible.

458
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:50,214
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

459
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:51,757
Stop!

460
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:53,509
Let me out!

461
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:56,137
Let me out! I want out!

462
00:43:58,097 --> 00:44:00,766
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

463
00:44:01,016 --> 00:44:02,685
Get this thing out of me!

464
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:05,980
Don't touch me!

465
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,857
Stay away from me!

466
00:44:08,274 --> 00:44:09,775
I don't believe it.

467
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:11,694
I don't believe it.

468
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:13,446
I don't believe it.

469
00:44:13,696 --> 00:44:15,739
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

470
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:17,199
Just breathe.

471
00:44:35,593 --> 00:44:37,386
I can't go back, can I?

472
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,638
No.

473
00:44:40,473 --> 00:44:41,682
But if you could...

474
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:44,018
would you really want to?

475
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,897
I owe you an apology.

476
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:49,857
We have a rule.

477
00:44:50,316 --> 00:44:53,570
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

478
00:44:53,737 --> 00:44:54,821
It's dangerous.

479
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,240
The mind has trouble letting go.

480
00:44:57,491 --> 00:44:59,784
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

481
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:02,913
I did what I did because...

482
00:45:03,622 --> 00:45:05,081
I had to.

483
00:45:13,507 --> 00:45:17,594
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

484
00:45:18,094 --> 00:45:21,890
who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

485
00:45:22,265 --> 00:45:25,185
to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

486
00:45:26,937 --> 00:45:30,398
It was he who freed the first of us...

487
00:45:31,274 --> 00:45:32,901
taught us the truth.

488
00:45:34,361 --> 00:45:37,447
As long as the Matrix exists...

489
00:45:37,781 --> 00:45:39,866
the human race will never be free.

490
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,622
After he died...

491
00:45:46,373 --> 00:45:49,084
the Oracle prophesied his return...

492
00:45:49,626 --> 00:45:52,837
and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

493
00:45:53,088 --> 00:45:54,756
end the war...

494
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,341
bring freedom to our people.

495
00:45:57,676 --> 00:46:02,305
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

496
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:04,224
looking for him.

497
00:46:06,643 --> 00:46:08,728
I did what I did because...

498
00:46:10,355 --> 00:46:12,482
I believe that search is over.

499
00:46:17,571 --> 00:46:18,989
Get some rest.

500
00:46:19,614 --> 00:46:21,408
You're going to need it.

501
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:25,161
For what?

502
00:46:28,206 --> 00:46:29,416
Your training.

503
00:46:47,727 --> 00:46:49,437
Morning. Did you sleep?

504
00:46:50,313 --> 00:46:51,522
You will tonight.

505
00:46:51,897 --> 00:46:53,441
I guarantee it.

506
00:46:54,942 --> 00:46:56,861
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

507
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,739
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.

508
00:47:00,656 --> 00:47:05,369
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

509
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,829
Born free right here...

510
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:08,706
in the real world.

511
00:47:08,956 --> 00:47:10,625
Genuine child of Zion.

512
00:47:11,459 --> 00:47:13,919
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

513
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,671
Zion's where the party would be.

514
00:47:16,088 --> 00:47:17,381
It's a city?

515
00:47:17,632 --> 00:47:20,801
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

516
00:47:22,386 --> 00:47:23,638
Where is it?

517
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:28,809
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

518
00:47:30,436 --> 00:47:32,313
You live long enough,
you might see it.

519
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:39,403
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

520
00:47:39,654 --> 00:47:41,405
if Morpheus is right and all.

521
00:47:41,906 --> 00:47:44,659
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

522
00:47:44,909 --> 00:47:46,327
if you are...

523
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:49,413
it's a very exciting time.

524
00:47:50,456 --> 00:47:53,167
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

525
00:47:57,088 --> 00:48:00,007
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

526
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:04,470
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

527
00:48:04,804 --> 00:48:06,263
How about...

528
00:48:07,848 --> 00:48:09,600
combat training?

529
00:48:15,648 --> 00:48:17,108
"Jujitsu"?

530
00:48:17,983 --> 00:48:19,652
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

531
00:48:30,997 --> 00:48:32,207
Holy shit!

532
00:48:32,457 --> 00:48:34,793
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

533
00:48:35,127 --> 00:48:36,420
How about some more?

534
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:37,963
Hell, yes.

535
00:48:40,048 --> 00:48:41,091
Hell, yeah.

536
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:54,354
How is he?

537
00:48:54,604 --> 00:48:56,773
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

538
00:49:07,993 --> 00:49:09,369
I know kung fu.

539
00:49:11,037 --> 00:49:12,038
Show me.

540
00:49:13,832 --> 00:49:15,584
This is a sparring program...

541
00:49:15,834 --> 00:49:18,628
similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

542
00:49:18,879 --> 00:49:21,214
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

543
00:49:21,465 --> 00:49:24,926
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

544
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:26,970
Some of them can be bent.

545
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:29,639
Others can be broken.

546
00:49:30,182 --> 00:49:31,266
Understand?

547
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,393
Then hit me...

548
00:49:33,977 --> 00:49:35,103
if you can.

549
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,143
Good!

550
00:50:15,895 --> 00:50:17,063
Adaptation.

551
00:50:17,355 --> 00:50:18,564
Improvisation.

552
00:50:18,856 --> 00:50:20,191
But your weakness...

553
00:50:20,441 --> 00:50:21,818
is not your technique.

554
00:50:28,783 --> 00:50:30,868
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

555
00:51:43,149 --> 00:51:44,317
How did I beat you?

556
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:51,991
You're too fast.

557
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:53,868
Do you believe that...

558
00:51:54,243 --> 00:51:56,746
my being stronger or faster...

559
00:51:56,996 --> 00:52:00,666
has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

560
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:06,506
You think you're breathing air?

561
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,229
Again!

562
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:35,118
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

563
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:37,579
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

564
00:52:43,043 --> 00:52:44,503
What are you waiting for?

565
00:52:44,753 --> 00:52:46,713
You're faster than this.

566
00:52:48,924 --> 00:52:51,134
Don't think you are.

567
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:53,053
Know you are.

568
00:53:03,438 --> 00:53:06,233
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

569
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,911
I don't believe it.

570
00:53:19,454 --> 00:53:21,581
I know what you're trying to do.

571
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,419
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

572
00:53:25,752 --> 00:53:27,838
But I can only show you the door.

573
00:53:28,422 --> 00:53:30,257
You have to walk through it.

574
00:53:32,634 --> 00:53:34,761
Tank, load the jump program.

575
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:49,067
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

576
00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:51,779
doubt and disbelief.

577
00:53:52,947 --> 00:53:55,658
Free your mind.

578
00:54:03,916 --> 00:54:05,043
Whoa.

579
00:54:11,841 --> 00:54:13,551
Okey-dokey.

580
00:54:15,636 --> 00:54:16,804
Free my mind.

581
00:54:17,263 --> 00:54:18,389
What if he makes it?

582
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:21,350
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.

583
00:54:22,685 --> 00:54:25,146
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

584
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:26,814
Come on.

585
00:54:27,065 --> 00:54:28,232
All right.

586
00:54:28,691 --> 00:54:30,735
No problem. Free my mind.

587
00:54:31,527 --> 00:54:34,322
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

588
00:54:53,716 --> 00:54:55,384
What does that mean?

589
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,595
It doesn't mean anything.

590
00:54:58,179 --> 00:55:00,765
Everybody falls the first time.

591
00:55:01,224 --> 00:55:02,517
Right, Trin?

592
00:55:23,204 --> 00:55:25,832
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

593
00:55:29,085 --> 00:55:31,337
If you're killed in the Matrix...

594
00:55:31,504 --> 00:55:32,547
you die here?

595
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:35,633
The body cannot live without the mind.

596
00:56:06,123 --> 00:56:09,501
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

597
00:56:12,588 --> 00:56:15,424
There is something about him,
isn't there?

598
00:56:16,049 --> 00:56:17,676
You're a believer now?

599
00:56:18,677 --> 00:56:19,887
I keep wondering...

600
00:56:20,137 --> 00:56:23,807
if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

601
00:56:24,725 --> 00:56:27,644
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

602
00:56:37,446 --> 00:56:38,989
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

603
00:56:40,741 --> 00:56:42,034
That system is our enemy.

604
00:56:42,659 --> 00:56:44,995
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

605
00:56:45,245 --> 00:56:49,041
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

606
00:56:49,499 --> 00:56:52,085
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

607
00:56:52,336 --> 00:56:55,297
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

608
00:56:55,547 --> 00:56:57,466
and that makes them our enemy.

609
00:56:57,633 --> 00:56:58,842
You have to understand...

610
00:56:59,092 --> 00:57:02,429
most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

611
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:04,264
And many of them are so inert...

612
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:06,934
so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

613
00:57:07,184 --> 00:57:09,895
that they will fight to protect it.

614
00:57:11,396 --> 00:57:15,150
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

615
00:57:15,317 --> 00:57:17,069
- I was...
- Look again.

616
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,404
Freeze it.

617
00:57:26,036 --> 00:57:27,664
- This isn't the Matrix?
- No.

618
00:57:29,457 --> 00:57:33,294
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

619
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,339
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

620
00:57:36,881 --> 00:57:39,676
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

621
00:57:40,426 --> 00:57:44,722
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

622
00:57:45,098 --> 00:57:48,476
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

623
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:50,144
is potentially an agent.

624
00:57:51,104 --> 00:57:52,939
Inside the Matrix...

625
00:57:53,523 --> 00:57:55,233
they are everyone...

626
00:57:55,566 --> 00:57:57,277
and they are no one.

627
00:57:57,527 --> 00:58:00,655
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

628
00:58:00,905 --> 00:58:02,532
but they are the gatekeepers.

629
00:58:02,782 --> 00:58:05,743
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

630
00:58:05,994 --> 00:58:08,830
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

631
00:58:08,997 --> 00:58:10,206
Someone?

632
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,958
I won't lie to you, Neo.

633
00:58:12,417 --> 00:58:17,255
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

634
00:58:17,505 --> 00:58:19,882
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

635
00:58:20,049 --> 00:58:21,134
Why?

636
00:58:21,384 --> 00:58:23,678
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

637
00:58:23,928 --> 00:58:27,515
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

638
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:32,395
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

639
00:58:32,645 --> 00:58:33,771
Because of that...

640
00:58:34,022 --> 00:58:37,400
they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

641
00:58:41,696 --> 00:58:43,573
What are you telling me?

642
00:58:44,282 --> 00:58:45,742
That I can dodge bullets?

643
00:58:47,744 --> 00:58:49,120
No, Neo.

644
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,540
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

645
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:54,751
you won't have to.

646
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,089
<i>We got trouble.</i>

647
00:59:19,026 --> 00:59:21,487
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

648
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,033
Shit.

649
00:59:26,283 --> 00:59:29,161
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

650
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:32,581
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

651
00:59:32,831 --> 00:59:34,041
Search and destroy.

652
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:36,543
Set her down there.

653
00:59:57,815 --> 00:59:59,316
How are we doing, Tank?

654
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:09,201
Power off-line.

655
01:00:09,701 --> 01:00:11,662
EMP armed...

656
01:00:12,204 --> 01:00:13,747
- and ready.
- EMP?

657
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:15,916
Electromagnetic pulse.

658
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:19,044
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

659
01:00:19,211 --> 01:00:21,505
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

660
01:00:27,302 --> 01:00:30,431
- Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

661
01:00:31,682 --> 01:00:32,808
Sewers.

662
01:00:33,016 --> 01:00:35,727
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

663
01:00:36,228 --> 01:00:38,147
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

664
01:00:38,397 --> 01:00:39,731
Quiet.

665
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:21,774
Whoa! Neo.

666
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,778
You scared the bejesus out of me.

667
01:01:26,863 --> 01:01:28,781
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

668
01:01:31,284 --> 01:01:32,535
Is that...?

669
01:01:32,785 --> 01:01:34,370
The Matrix?

670
01:01:34,537 --> 01:01:35,747
Yeah.

671
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:40,710
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

672
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,047
The image translators work
for the construct program.

673
01:01:44,297 --> 01:01:47,717
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

674
01:01:47,967 --> 01:01:50,929
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

675
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:54,599
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

676
01:01:55,767 --> 01:01:57,143
Do you...

677
01:01:57,435 --> 01:01:58,520
want a drink?

678
01:01:58,770 --> 01:01:59,812
Sure.

679
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:04,817
You know...

680
01:02:05,735 --> 01:02:07,278
I know what you're thinking.

681
01:02:07,529 --> 01:02:09,614
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

682
01:02:09,948 --> 01:02:13,284
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

683
01:02:15,203 --> 01:02:18,206
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?

684
01:02:30,593 --> 01:02:32,512
Good shit, huh?

685
01:02:32,845 --> 01:02:34,055
Dozer makes it.

686
01:02:34,514 --> 01:02:35,682
It's good for two things:

687
01:02:35,932 --> 01:02:39,018
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

688
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:42,230
So can I ask you something?

689
01:02:45,233 --> 01:02:46,859
Did he tell you why he did it?

690
01:02:49,488 --> 01:02:51,323
Why you're here?

691
01:02:54,994 --> 01:02:56,745
Jesus!

692
01:02:57,955 --> 01:02:59,873
What a mind job.

693
01:03:01,292 --> 01:03:04,086
So you're here to save the world.

694
01:03:05,588 --> 01:03:07,673
What do you say
to something like that?

695
01:03:12,845 --> 01:03:14,221
A little piece of advice.

696
01:03:16,015 --> 01:03:17,433
You see an agent...

697
01:03:17,766 --> 01:03:20,060
you do what we do:

698
01:03:20,394 --> 01:03:21,937
Run.

699
01:03:22,271 --> 01:03:24,023
You run your ass off.

700
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,990
Thanks for the drink.

701
01:03:37,703 --> 01:03:38,871
Sweet dreams.

702
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:46,295
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

703
01:03:46,962 --> 01:03:48,088
You know...

704
01:03:49,506 --> 01:03:51,967
I know this steak doesn't exist.

705
01:03:52,968 --> 01:03:55,721
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

706
01:03:55,971 --> 01:03:59,058
the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

707
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:00,476
juicy...

708
01:04:00,768 --> 01:04:02,478
and delicious.

709
01:04:05,397 --> 01:04:06,649
After nine years...

710
01:04:07,691 --> 01:04:09,234
you know what I realize?

711
01:04:17,076 --> 01:04:18,285
Ignorance is bliss.

712
01:04:23,332 --> 01:04:25,167
Then we have a deal.

713
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:29,588
I don't want to remember nothing.

714
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:32,341
Nothing. You understand?

715
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:38,223
And I want to be rich.

716
01:04:39,557 --> 01:04:42,268
You know, someone important.

717
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:44,896
Like an actor.

718
01:04:46,106 --> 01:04:49,234
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

719
01:04:51,403 --> 01:04:52,946
Okay.

720
01:04:53,321 --> 01:04:55,740
You get my body
back in a power plant...

721
01:04:56,116 --> 01:04:57,867
reinsert me into the Matrix...

722
01:04:58,201 --> 01:04:59,619
I'll get you what you want.

723
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:01,871
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

724
01:05:02,122 --> 01:05:04,290
No. I told you, I don't know them.

725
01:05:07,252 --> 01:05:09,254
I can get you the man who does.

726
01:05:10,004 --> 01:05:11,798
Morpheus.

727
01:05:21,891 --> 01:05:25,353
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

728
01:05:26,688 --> 01:05:29,482
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

729
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:31,401
Or a bowl of snot.

730
01:05:31,943 --> 01:05:33,528
You know what it reminds me of?

731
01:05:35,363 --> 01:05:37,699
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

732
01:05:38,324 --> 01:05:40,034
No, but technically,
neither did you.

733
01:05:40,285 --> 01:05:42,328
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

734
01:05:42,579 --> 01:05:43,955
Because you have to wonder...

735
01:05:44,205 --> 01:05:47,459
how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

736
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:49,127
Maybe they got it wrong.

737
01:05:49,377 --> 01:05:52,589
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

738
01:05:52,881 --> 01:05:54,883
oatmeal or tuna fish.

739
01:05:55,258 --> 01:05:58,094
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

740
01:05:58,344 --> 01:06:00,384
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

741
01:06:00,597 --> 01:06:02,640
which is why it tastes
like everything.

742
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:04,684
- And maybe they...
- Shut up.

743
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:07,771
It's a single-celled protein...

744
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:11,065
combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

745
01:06:11,316 --> 01:06:12,567
Everything the body needs.

746
01:06:12,817 --> 01:06:15,695
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

747
01:06:18,448 --> 01:06:21,534
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

748
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:24,621
You know, I wrote that program.

749
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,207
Here it comes.

750
01:06:26,457 --> 01:06:28,417
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

751
01:06:28,793 --> 01:06:31,837
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

752
01:06:32,171 --> 01:06:34,924
She doesn't talk very much...

753
01:06:35,174 --> 01:06:39,136
but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

754
01:06:39,386 --> 01:06:40,763
The digital pimp hard at work.

755
01:06:41,013 --> 01:06:43,265
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

756
01:06:44,558 --> 01:06:46,393
To deny our own impulses...

757
01:06:46,644 --> 01:06:49,772
is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

758
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:53,067
Dozer, when you're done...

759
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:54,875
bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

760
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:56,779
We're going in.

761
01:06:57,488 --> 01:06:58,906
I'm taking Neo to see her.

762
01:07:02,827 --> 01:07:04,078
See who?

763
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:06,330
The Oracle.

764
01:07:11,836 --> 01:07:13,379
Everyone please observe...

765
01:07:13,712 --> 01:07:16,423
the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.

766
01:07:16,924 --> 01:07:20,302
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

767
01:07:44,743 --> 01:07:45,744
We're in.

768
01:08:01,385 --> 01:08:02,553
We'll be back in an hour.

769
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:19,321
Unbelievable...

770
01:08:19,571 --> 01:08:20,906
isn't it?

771
01:08:24,492 --> 01:08:26,328
- God!
- What?

772
01:08:26,995 --> 01:08:28,371
I used to eat there.

773
01:08:30,624 --> 01:08:32,250
Really good noodles.

774
01:08:37,047 --> 01:08:39,549
I have these memories from my life.

775
01:08:42,010 --> 01:08:43,678
None of them happened.

776
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:45,639
What does that mean?

777
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:48,099
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

778
01:08:49,017 --> 01:08:50,226
But an oracle can?

779
01:08:50,685 --> 01:08:51,895
That's different.

780
01:08:56,608 --> 01:08:57,859
Did you go to her?

781
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:00,570
Yes.

782
01:09:01,071 --> 01:09:02,447
What did she tell you?

783
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,202
She told me...

784
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:09,412
What?

785
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:14,542
We're here.

786
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:17,212
Neo, come with me.

787
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:39,609
So is this the same oracle
that made...

788
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:41,027
the prophecy?

789
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:45,615
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

790
01:09:46,074 --> 01:09:48,076
- The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

791
01:09:50,328 --> 01:09:52,706
And she knows what? Everything?

792
01:09:54,749 --> 01:09:56,668
She would say she knows enough.

793
01:09:57,794 --> 01:09:59,587
And she's never wrong.

794
01:10:01,799 --> 01:10:04,969
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

795
01:10:05,302 --> 01:10:06,887
She is a guide, Neo.

796
01:10:07,263 --> 01:10:09,140
She can help you to find the path.

797
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,891
She helped you?

798
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,643
Yes.

799
01:10:13,394 --> 01:10:14,729
What did she tell you?

800
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:19,400
That I would find the One.

801
01:10:32,538 --> 01:10:34,665
I told you I can only
show you the door.

802
01:10:35,374 --> 01:10:37,460
You have to walk through it.

803
01:10:41,255 --> 01:10:42,339
Hello, Neo.

804
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,258
You're right on time.

805
01:10:52,183 --> 01:10:55,978
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

806
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:03,235
These are the other Potentials.

807
01:11:03,486 --> 01:11:05,029
You can wait here.

808
01:11:45,861 --> 01:11:48,406
Do not try and bend the spoon.

809
01:11:48,782 --> 01:11:50,909
That's impossible.

810
01:11:51,743 --> 01:11:55,747
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

811
01:11:56,289 --> 01:11:57,666
What truth?

812
01:11:57,916 --> 01:11:59,584
There is no spoon.

813
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:03,505
There is no spoon?

814
01:12:03,755 --> 01:12:08,218
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

815
01:12:24,276 --> 01:12:25,735
The Oracle will you see now.

816
01:12:36,454 --> 01:12:37,998
I know you're Neo.

817
01:12:38,623 --> 01:12:39,791
Be right with you.

818
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:43,211
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

819
01:12:45,922 --> 01:12:48,800
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

820
01:12:49,843 --> 01:12:52,012
Almost done.

821
01:12:54,514 --> 01:12:56,141
Smell good, don't they?

822
01:12:57,392 --> 01:12:58,643
Yeah.

823
01:12:58,894 --> 01:13:00,729
I'd ask you to sit down...

824
01:13:00,979 --> 01:13:03,356
but you're not going to anyway.

825
01:13:03,857 --> 01:13:06,735
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

826
01:13:09,863 --> 01:13:11,031
That vase.

827
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:13,033
I'm sorry.

828
01:13:13,283 --> 01:13:15,160
I said, don't worry about it.

829
01:13:16,328 --> 01:13:18,288
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

830
01:13:18,914 --> 01:13:20,123
How did you know?

831
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:25,962
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

832
01:13:26,296 --> 01:13:29,257
would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

833
01:13:34,054 --> 01:13:35,973
You're cuter than I thought.

834
01:13:39,018 --> 01:13:41,270
I can see why she likes you.

835
01:13:42,146 --> 01:13:43,231
Who?

836
01:13:43,481 --> 01:13:45,316
Not too bright, though.

837
01:13:48,611 --> 01:13:51,697
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

838
01:13:53,824 --> 01:13:54,992
So...

839
01:13:55,952 --> 01:13:57,328
what do you think?

840
01:13:59,163 --> 01:14:00,915
Do you think you are the One?

841
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:03,918
I don't know.

842
01:14:07,338 --> 01:14:08,756
You know what that means?

843
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:10,758
It's Latin.

844
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:13,344
Means, "Know thyself."

845
01:14:14,804 --> 01:14:16,764
I'll let you in on a little secret.

846
01:14:19,016 --> 01:14:22,853
Being the One is just
like being in love.

847
01:14:23,562 --> 01:14:26,440
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

848
01:14:26,691 --> 01:14:27,817
through and through.

849
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:30,194
Balls to bones.

850
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:33,572
Well...

851
01:14:35,533 --> 01:14:37,618
I'd better have a look at you.

852
01:14:38,953 --> 01:14:40,454
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

853
01:14:54,844 --> 01:14:56,512
Okay...

854
01:14:57,138 --> 01:15:02,101
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

855
01:15:02,601 --> 01:15:03,728
Then you say:

856
01:15:04,395 --> 01:15:05,604
But what?

857
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:09,817
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

858
01:15:11,235 --> 01:15:14,196
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

859
01:15:15,823 --> 01:15:17,825
You got the gift...

860
01:15:18,743 --> 01:15:21,037
but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

861
01:15:25,709 --> 01:15:26,752
What?

862
01:15:27,002 --> 01:15:29,880
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

863
01:15:30,464 --> 01:15:32,716
That's the way these things go.

864
01:15:33,592 --> 01:15:36,178
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

865
01:15:39,639 --> 01:15:41,350
He almost had me convinced.

866
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,726
I know.

867
01:15:44,269 --> 01:15:46,396
Poor Morpheus.

868
01:15:48,774 --> 01:15:51,902
Without him, we're lost.

869
01:15:53,445 --> 01:15:55,614
What do you mean, "without him"?

870
01:15:59,618 --> 01:16:01,536
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

871
01:16:03,747 --> 01:16:06,500
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

872
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:10,379
And no one, not you, not even me...

873
01:16:10,629 --> 01:16:12,881
can convince him otherwise.

874
01:16:13,256 --> 01:16:15,634
He believes it so blindly...

875
01:16:15,926 --> 01:16:20,263
that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

876
01:16:20,472 --> 01:16:21,640
What?

877
01:16:21,807 --> 01:16:24,476
You're going to
have to make a choice.

878
01:16:25,102 --> 01:16:28,688
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

879
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:32,067
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

880
01:16:33,485 --> 01:16:35,779
One of you is going to die.

881
01:16:37,864 --> 01:16:41,159
Which one will be up to you.

882
01:16:42,536 --> 01:16:44,454
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

883
01:16:44,704 --> 01:16:46,373
You have a good soul.

884
01:16:47,457 --> 01:16:50,168
And I hate giving
good people bad news.

885
01:16:53,296 --> 01:16:54,756
Don't worry about it.

886
01:16:55,006 --> 01:16:57,426
As soon as you
step outside that door...

887
01:16:57,676 --> 01:16:59,803
you'll start feeling better.

888
01:17:00,512 --> 01:17:04,307
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

889
01:17:05,142 --> 01:17:07,894
You're in control of your own life.

890
01:17:08,728 --> 01:17:10,021
Remember?

891
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:12,900
Here...

892
01:17:14,777 --> 01:17:16,320
take a cookie.

893
01:17:16,863 --> 01:17:20,199
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...

894
01:17:21,159 --> 01:17:23,536
you'll feel right as rain.

895
01:17:32,753 --> 01:17:34,088
What was said...

896
01:17:34,714 --> 01:17:36,174
was for you...

897
01:17:36,716 --> 01:17:38,551
and for you alone.

898
01:18:01,491 --> 01:18:02,575
They're on the way.

899
01:18:32,396 --> 01:18:33,439
What is that?

900
01:18:48,204 --> 01:18:49,622
Oh, déjà vu.

901
01:18:53,125 --> 01:18:54,210
What did you just say?

902
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:55,962
Nothing.
Just déjà vu.

903
01:18:56,212 --> 01:18:57,838
- What did you see?
- What happened?

904
01:18:59,258 --> 01:19:01,426
A black cat went past us...

905
01:19:01,677 --> 01:19:03,303
then another just like it.

906
01:19:03,554 --> 01:19:05,097
Was it the same cat?

907
01:19:06,056 --> 01:19:08,892
- I'm not sure.
- Switch, Apoc.

908
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,189
What is it?

909
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:18,860
A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the
Matrix when they change something.

910
01:19:21,822 --> 01:19:23,073
Oh, my God.

911
01:19:24,866 --> 01:19:25,867
Let's go.

912
01:19:31,123 --> 01:19:32,916
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

913
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:39,631
Oh, no.

914
01:20:19,921 --> 01:20:22,382
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.

915
01:20:22,633 --> 01:20:24,509
Be calm. Give me your phone.

916
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,303
They'll be able to track it.

917
01:20:26,553 --> 01:20:27,971
We have no choice.

918
01:20:29,389 --> 01:20:30,599
Operator.

919
01:20:30,932 --> 01:20:33,769
<i>Find a structural drawing of
this building. Find it fast.</i>

920
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:44,196
- Got it!
<i>- I need the main wet-wall.</i>

921
01:20:47,033 --> 01:20:48,284
Eighth floor.

922
01:20:48,493 --> 01:20:50,078
<i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>

923
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:51,829
Switch, straight ahead.

924
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:53,748
Neo...

925
01:20:59,879 --> 01:21:02,006
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.

926
01:21:10,306 --> 01:21:11,808
<i>Now left. That's it.</i>

927
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,142
Good.

928
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,153
Where are they?

929
01:22:24,589 --> 01:22:25,757
They're in the walls.

930
01:22:27,216 --> 01:22:28,384
In the walls!

931
01:22:49,782 --> 01:22:51,450
It's an agent!

932
01:22:58,749 --> 01:23:00,083
Morpheus!

933
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,502
You must get Neo out!

934
01:23:01,752 --> 01:23:03,587
He's all that matters!

935
01:23:03,879 --> 01:23:06,089
- No, Morpheus! Don't!
- Trinity, go!

936
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:08,383
Go!

937
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,558
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

938
01:23:40,874 --> 01:23:42,668
Cypher, come on!

939
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:51,426
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

940
01:23:51,969 --> 01:23:53,095
And you are?

941
01:23:53,345 --> 01:23:55,097
A Smith.

942
01:23:55,347 --> 01:23:56,640
Agent Smith.

943
01:23:57,224 --> 01:23:59,268
You all look the same to me.

944
01:24:54,908 --> 01:24:56,200
Take him.

945
01:25:02,832 --> 01:25:04,292
No!

946
01:25:09,422 --> 01:25:11,257
- Operator.
<i>- I need an exit, fast.</i>

947
01:25:13,343 --> 01:25:16,262
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.

948
01:25:16,596 --> 01:25:18,389
<i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>

949
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,016
Somebody up there still likes me.

950
01:25:20,266 --> 01:25:21,517
I got you.

951
01:25:22,018 --> 01:25:23,937
<i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>

952
01:25:24,187 --> 01:25:26,856
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

953
01:25:27,106 --> 01:25:28,149
Right.

954
01:25:31,277 --> 01:25:32,862
- Operator.
<i>- Tank, it's me.</i>

955
01:25:33,112 --> 01:25:34,280
Is Morpheus alive?

956
01:25:34,656 --> 01:25:35,949
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

957
01:25:36,366 --> 01:25:38,284
<i>Yes. They're moving him.
I don't know where.</i>

958
01:25:38,493 --> 01:25:40,787
He's alive. We need an exit.

959
01:25:41,037 --> 01:25:42,121
You're not far from Cypher.

960
01:25:42,288 --> 01:25:43,539
<i>- Cypher?</i>
- I know.

961
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:45,875
<i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i>
- Got it.

962
01:25:54,968 --> 01:25:56,177
Got him.

963
01:26:07,105 --> 01:26:08,147
Where are they?

964
01:26:08,398 --> 01:26:09,650
Making the call.

965
01:26:10,317 --> 01:26:11,485
Good.

966
01:26:24,623 --> 01:26:25,874
You first.

967
01:26:29,086 --> 01:26:30,295
Shit!

968
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:35,259
Tank!

969
01:26:35,426 --> 01:26:37,052
No!

970
01:26:38,971 --> 01:26:41,140
I don't know. It just went dead.

971
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:09,168
<i>Hello, Trinity.</i>

972
01:27:09,585 --> 01:27:10,919
Cypher? Where's Tank?

973
01:27:16,508 --> 01:27:17,551
You know...

974
01:27:19,261 --> 01:27:21,388
for a long time...

975
01:27:22,598 --> 01:27:25,476
I thought I was in love with you.

976
01:27:26,268 --> 01:27:28,312
<i>I used to dream about you.</i>

977
01:27:29,396 --> 01:27:32,107
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

978
01:27:32,357 --> 01:27:34,735
<i>Too bad things had to
turn out this way.</i>

979
01:27:35,277 --> 01:27:36,320
You killed them.

980
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:38,322
- What?
- Oh, God.

981
01:27:38,572 --> 01:27:39,990
I'm tired, Trinity.

982
01:27:41,408 --> 01:27:43,285
I'm tired of this war...

983
01:27:43,577 --> 01:27:46,413
tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship...

984
01:27:46,747 --> 01:27:51,376
of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

985
01:27:53,587 --> 01:27:54,713
But most of all...

986
01:27:55,297 --> 01:27:58,676
<i>I'm tired of that jackoff
and all of his bullshit.</i>

987
01:27:59,803 --> 01:28:01,096
Surprise, asshole!

988
01:28:01,638 --> 01:28:03,848
I bet you never saw this coming...

989
01:28:04,099 --> 01:28:05,141
did you?

990
01:28:07,435 --> 01:28:09,813
God, I wish I could be there...

991
01:28:10,396 --> 01:28:11,898
when they break you.

992
01:28:12,941 --> 01:28:16,111
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...

993
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:18,530
so right then...

994
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:20,115
you'd know it was me.

995
01:28:20,615 --> 01:28:21,783
You gave them Morpheus.

996
01:28:22,033 --> 01:28:23,493
<i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>

997
01:28:24,077 --> 01:28:25,578
He tricked us!

998
01:28:26,121 --> 01:28:28,123
If you had told us the truth...

999
01:28:28,373 --> 01:28:31,251
we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

1000
01:28:31,501 --> 01:28:33,628
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.

1001
01:28:33,878 --> 01:28:36,756
"Free." You call this free?

1002
01:28:39,175 --> 01:28:41,678
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1003
01:28:43,263 --> 01:28:46,182
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

1004
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:48,560
I choose the Matrix.

1005
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:50,478
The Matrix isn't real.

1006
01:28:50,728 --> 01:28:52,147
<i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>

1007
01:28:52,397 --> 01:28:54,649
I think the Matrix...

1008
01:28:54,983 --> 01:28:57,569
can be more real than this world.

1009
01:28:59,737 --> 01:29:02,240
All I do is pull the plug here.

1010
01:29:02,615 --> 01:29:03,825
But there...

1011
01:29:04,367 --> 01:29:06,661
<i>you have to watch Apoc die.</i>

1012
01:29:07,662 --> 01:29:08,913
Trinity.

1013
01:29:14,419 --> 01:29:17,380
<i>- Welcome to the real world.</i>
- But you're out, Cypher.

1014
01:29:17,630 --> 01:29:20,049
<i>- You can't go back.</i>
- That's what you think.

1015
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:21,801
<i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>

1016
01:29:22,051 --> 01:29:25,680
<i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,
I won't remember a thing.</i>

1017
01:29:25,889 --> 01:29:26,931
By the way...

1018
01:29:27,182 --> 01:29:30,143
if you have anything important
to say to Switch...

1019
01:29:30,643 --> 01:29:31,728
<i>say it now.</i>

1020
01:29:31,978 --> 01:29:35,023
- No, please don't.
- Not like this.

1021
01:29:36,733 --> 01:29:38,359
Not like this.

1022
01:29:42,822 --> 01:29:43,865
Too late.

1023
01:29:44,616 --> 01:29:45,910
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1024
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,037
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1025
01:29:48,412 --> 01:29:50,289
I'm just a messenger.

1026
01:29:50,706 --> 01:29:53,876
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.

1027
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,629
If Morpheus was right...

1028
01:29:57,171 --> 01:29:59,048
there's no way
I can pull this plug.

1029
01:29:59,632 --> 01:30:01,133
<i>If Neo's the One...</i>

1030
01:30:01,634 --> 01:30:03,469
<i>then there'd have to be...</i>

1031
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:06,305
some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1032
01:30:06,472 --> 01:30:07,681
Right?

1033
01:30:08,307 --> 01:30:10,392
I mean, how can he be the One...

1034
01:30:10,559 --> 01:30:11,644
if he's dead?

1035
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:15,272
<i>You never did answer me before...</i>

1036
01:30:15,564 --> 01:30:17,900
<i>if you bought into
Morpheus' bullshit.</i>

1037
01:30:18,275 --> 01:30:21,487
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.

1038
01:30:22,863 --> 01:30:25,199
Look into his eyes...

1039
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:27,451
<i>those big, pretty eyes...</i>

1040
01:30:30,204 --> 01:30:31,538
and tell me...

1041
01:30:32,248 --> 01:30:33,499
<i>yes...</i>

1042
01:30:33,832 --> 01:30:35,209
<i>or no.</i>

1043
01:30:36,502 --> 01:30:38,045
- Yes.
<i>- No!</i>

1044
01:30:38,212 --> 01:30:39,380
I don't believe it.

1045
01:30:40,798 --> 01:30:45,552
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1046
01:31:03,821 --> 01:31:05,197
You first.

1047
01:31:13,414 --> 01:31:15,708
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1048
01:31:18,502 --> 01:31:19,670
Dozer?

1049
01:31:37,939 --> 01:31:40,317
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1050
01:31:41,192 --> 01:31:44,321
Marveled at its beauty...

1051
01:31:44,696 --> 01:31:46,948
its genius?

1052
01:31:48,116 --> 01:31:49,993
Billions of people...

1053
01:31:50,243 --> 01:31:52,996
just living out their lives.

1054
01:31:54,039 --> 01:31:55,707
Oblivious.

1055
01:32:00,295 --> 01:32:03,173
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1056
01:32:03,423 --> 01:32:08,094
was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1057
01:32:08,595 --> 01:32:11,514
where everyone would be happy.

1058
01:32:12,057 --> 01:32:13,558
It was a disaster.

1059
01:32:13,808 --> 01:32:18,146
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1060
01:32:19,022 --> 01:32:20,774
Some believe that...

1061
01:32:21,024 --> 01:32:25,403
we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1062
01:32:25,653 --> 01:32:27,197
But I believe that...

1063
01:32:27,364 --> 01:32:28,531
as a species...

1064
01:32:28,782 --> 01:32:32,619
human beings define
their reality through misery...

1065
01:32:32,869 --> 01:32:34,245
and suffering.

1066
01:32:34,496 --> 01:32:37,207
So the perfect world was a dream...

1067
01:32:37,457 --> 01:32:42,295
that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1068
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:47,300
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1069
01:32:47,759 --> 01:32:49,260
The peak...

1070
01:32:49,511 --> 01:32:50,929
of your civilization.

1071
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:53,431
I say, "your civilization"...

1072
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:57,811
because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1073
01:32:58,061 --> 01:33:01,147
which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1074
01:33:02,482 --> 01:33:05,068
Evolution, Morpheus.

1075
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,694
Evolution.

1076
01:33:08,988 --> 01:33:10,865
Like the dinosaur.

1077
01:33:13,034 --> 01:33:14,661
Look out that window.

1078
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:17,497
You had your time.

1079
01:33:18,206 --> 01:33:22,128
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1080
01:33:22,461 --> 01:33:24,839
The future is our time.

1081
01:33:29,093 --> 01:33:30,261
There could be a problem.

1082
01:33:31,178 --> 01:33:34,557
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1083
01:33:34,807 --> 01:33:36,976
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1084
01:33:37,226 --> 01:33:38,436
How much time?

1085
01:33:38,686 --> 01:33:41,814
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1086
01:33:42,064 --> 01:33:46,485
and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1087
01:33:46,735 --> 01:33:49,697
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1088
01:33:49,947 --> 01:33:50,990
What do they want?

1089
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:55,286
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1090
01:33:55,536 --> 01:33:58,456
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1091
01:33:58,706 --> 01:34:01,792
they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1092
01:34:01,959 --> 01:34:04,211
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1093
01:34:04,378 --> 01:34:05,546
or you...

1094
01:34:05,713 --> 01:34:07,006
or even Morpheus.

1095
01:34:10,801 --> 01:34:12,470
There has to be
something we can do.

1096
01:34:12,887 --> 01:34:14,889
There is. We pull the plug.

1097
01:34:17,975 --> 01:34:19,727
You're going to kill him?

1098
01:34:19,977 --> 01:34:21,145
Kill Morpheus?

1099
01:34:21,770 --> 01:34:23,397
We don't have a choice.

1100
01:34:30,196 --> 01:34:33,115
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1101
01:34:33,365 --> 01:34:35,117
If the insider has failed...

1102
01:34:35,367 --> 01:34:38,579
they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless...

1103
01:34:38,829 --> 01:34:40,539
They're dead. In either case...

1104
01:34:40,789 --> 01:34:44,335
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1105
01:34:44,585 --> 01:34:45,669
Immediately.

1106
01:34:50,925 --> 01:34:53,594
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1107
01:34:54,553 --> 01:34:56,764
You were a father.

1108
01:34:58,307 --> 01:35:00,267
We'll miss you always.

1109
01:35:07,149 --> 01:35:08,360
Stop!

1110
01:35:09,528 --> 01:35:10,888
I don't believe this is happening.

1111
01:35:11,029 --> 01:35:13,073
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1112
01:35:13,865 --> 01:35:15,242
I don't know.

1113
01:35:15,575 --> 01:35:18,036
- This can't be just coincidence.
- What?

1114
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:19,496
The Oracle.

1115
01:35:19,746 --> 01:35:21,540
She told me this would happen.

1116
01:35:21,957 --> 01:35:26,127
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1117
01:35:26,586 --> 01:35:27,796
What choice?

1118
01:35:30,799 --> 01:35:33,301
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1119
01:35:33,635 --> 01:35:35,971
- No, you're not.
- I have to.

1120
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:39,808
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1121
01:35:40,058 --> 01:35:41,977
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1122
01:35:42,561 --> 01:35:45,814
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1123
01:35:47,315 --> 01:35:48,358
What?

1124
01:35:49,067 --> 01:35:50,694
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1125
01:35:51,069 --> 01:35:54,030
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1126
01:35:54,281 --> 01:35:56,950
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1127
01:35:57,617 --> 01:35:58,868
No, Neo, that's not true.

1128
01:35:59,452 --> 01:36:02,080
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1129
01:36:06,501 --> 01:36:09,838
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1130
01:36:10,088 --> 01:36:14,467
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1131
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,681
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1132
01:36:19,931 --> 01:36:21,516
That's what it looks like...

1133
01:36:21,683 --> 01:36:22,726
but it's not.

1134
01:36:22,976 --> 01:36:25,353
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1135
01:36:26,438 --> 01:36:30,150
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1136
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,403
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1137
01:36:33,695 --> 01:36:36,197
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1138
01:36:36,364 --> 01:36:37,991
What?

1139
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:40,410
I believe I can bring him back.

1140
01:36:57,386 --> 01:36:59,305
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1141
01:36:59,597 --> 01:37:01,599
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1142
01:37:02,767 --> 01:37:04,894
Let me tell you what I believe.

1143
01:37:05,394 --> 01:37:07,772
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1144
01:37:08,105 --> 01:37:12,401
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1145
01:37:12,652 --> 01:37:14,695
And since I am the ranking officer...

1146
01:37:14,945 --> 01:37:17,823
if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1147
01:37:18,574 --> 01:37:20,993
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1148
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:22,953
Tank...

1149
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:24,246
load us up.

1150
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:37,176
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1151
01:37:37,593 --> 01:37:39,136
during my time here.

1152
01:37:39,387 --> 01:37:43,391
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1153
01:37:43,641 --> 01:37:45,893
and I realized...

1154
01:37:46,143 --> 01:37:48,437
that you're not actually mammals.

1155
01:37:50,648 --> 01:37:53,109
Every mammal on this planet...

1156
01:37:53,442 --> 01:37:58,364
instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1157
01:37:58,614 --> 01:38:00,449
But you humans do not.

1158
01:38:00,991 --> 01:38:04,537
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1159
01:38:04,787 --> 01:38:09,291
and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1160
01:38:09,625 --> 01:38:11,711
The only way you can survive...

1161
01:38:12,002 --> 01:38:14,964
is to spread to another area.

1162
01:38:20,386 --> 01:38:23,264
There is another organism
on this planet...

1163
01:38:23,514 --> 01:38:25,474
that follows the same pattern.

1164
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:27,768
Do you know what it is?

1165
01:38:28,144 --> 01:38:29,979
A virus.

1166
01:38:31,313 --> 01:38:34,358
Human beings are a disease.

1167
01:38:34,734 --> 01:38:36,277
A cancer of this planet.

1168
01:38:36,527 --> 01:38:38,654
You are a plague.

1169
01:38:39,196 --> 01:38:40,614
And we...

1170
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:42,158
are the cure.

1171
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:44,578
Okay, so what do you need?

1172
01:38:45,203 --> 01:38:46,329
Besides a miracle.

1173
01:38:46,913 --> 01:38:48,123
Guns.

1174
01:38:48,957 --> 01:38:50,167
Lots of guns.

1175
01:39:00,051 --> 01:39:01,261
Neo...

1176
01:39:03,013 --> 01:39:05,557
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1177
01:39:06,767 --> 01:39:08,685
That's why it's going to work.

1178
01:39:12,773 --> 01:39:14,691
Why isn't the serum working?

1179
01:39:15,317 --> 01:39:17,611
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1180
01:39:19,696 --> 01:39:20,947
Leave me with him.

1181
01:39:23,533 --> 01:39:24,659
Now.

1182
01:39:35,879 --> 01:39:37,464
Hold on, Morpheus.

1183
01:39:37,714 --> 01:39:40,425
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1184
01:39:42,803 --> 01:39:44,930
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1185
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,849
I'm going to be honest...

1186
01:39:48,225 --> 01:39:49,434
with you.

1187
01:39:53,814 --> 01:39:55,232
I...

1188
01:39:56,107 --> 01:39:57,234
hate...

1189
01:39:57,484 --> 01:39:59,444
this place...

1190
01:39:59,778 --> 01:40:02,072
this zoo...

1191
01:40:02,322 --> 01:40:03,448
this prison...

1192
01:40:03,698 --> 01:40:06,868
this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1193
01:40:07,118 --> 01:40:09,412
I can't stand it any longer.

1194
01:40:10,163 --> 01:40:12,040
It's the smell.

1195
01:40:13,416 --> 01:40:15,293
If there is such a thing.

1196
01:40:15,627 --> 01:40:18,922
I feel saturated by it.

1197
01:40:20,423 --> 01:40:21,716
I can...

1198
01:40:21,967 --> 01:40:23,510
taste...

1199
01:40:23,677 --> 01:40:25,720
your stink.

1200
01:40:25,971 --> 01:40:29,599
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1201
01:40:29,766 --> 01:40:30,767
It's repulsive.

1202
01:40:31,769 --> 01:40:33,145
Isn't it?

1203
01:40:35,314 --> 01:40:37,608
I must get out of here.

1204
01:40:38,025 --> 01:40:40,236
I must get free.

1205
01:40:40,486 --> 01:40:43,364
And in this mind is the key.

1206
01:40:43,614 --> 01:40:45,283
My key.

1207
01:40:45,533 --> 01:40:48,411
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1208
01:40:48,661 --> 01:40:50,288
Do you understand?

1209
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:51,956
I need the codes.

1210
01:40:52,206 --> 01:40:54,542
I have to get inside Zion...

1211
01:40:54,876 --> 01:40:57,378
and you have to tell me how.

1212
01:40:57,795 --> 01:40:59,672
You're going to tell me...

1213
01:40:59,922 --> 01:41:02,091
or you're going to die.

1214
01:41:22,278 --> 01:41:25,406
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1215
01:41:29,327 --> 01:41:30,369
Holy shit!

1216
01:41:42,465 --> 01:41:45,176
Backup. Send backup.

1217
01:42:08,991 --> 01:42:10,117
Freeze!

1218
01:44:24,962 --> 01:44:26,172
What were you doing?

1219
01:44:28,007 --> 01:44:29,300
He doesn't know.

1220
01:44:29,550 --> 01:44:31,052
Know what?

1221
01:44:59,122 --> 01:45:01,624
I think they're trying to save him.

1222
01:45:16,472 --> 01:45:18,224
There is no spoon.

1223
01:45:47,837 --> 01:45:50,006
Find them and destroy them!

1224
01:45:51,632 --> 01:45:53,467
We're under attack!

1225
01:46:25,584 --> 01:46:26,752
Trinity!

1226
01:46:27,252 --> 01:46:28,337
Help!

1227
01:46:50,359 --> 01:46:51,568
Only human.

1228
01:46:52,527 --> 01:46:53,612
Dodge this.

1229
01:47:06,833 --> 01:47:08,335
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1230
01:47:08,752 --> 01:47:12,673
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1231
01:47:13,799 --> 01:47:15,175
It wasn't fast enough.

1232
01:47:17,928 --> 01:47:19,221
Can you fly that thing?

1233
01:47:20,347 --> 01:47:21,348
Not yet.

1234
01:47:24,643 --> 01:47:25,686
Operator.

1235
01:47:25,894 --> 01:47:29,064
<i>I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.</i>

1236
01:47:29,523 --> 01:47:30,816
<i>Hurry.</i>

1237
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:40,367
Let's go.

1238
01:47:55,466 --> 01:47:56,551
No.

1239
01:48:48,144 --> 01:48:50,772
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1240
01:49:28,810 --> 01:49:29,852
He's not going to make it.

1241
01:49:39,655 --> 01:49:40,697
Got you.

1242
01:50:46,763 --> 01:50:47,931
Trinity!

1243
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:31,017
I knew it.

1244
01:51:31,643 --> 01:51:32,852
He's the One.

1245
01:51:48,826 --> 01:51:51,037
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1246
01:51:53,915 --> 01:51:55,083
Morpheus...

1247
01:51:56,751 --> 01:51:57,835
The Oracle.

1248
01:51:59,087 --> 01:52:01,464
- She told me...
- She told you...

1249
01:52:01,839 --> 01:52:03,424
what you needed to hear.

1250
01:52:03,716 --> 01:52:05,051
That's all.

1251
01:52:06,094 --> 01:52:09,055
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

1252
01:52:09,389 --> 01:52:11,683
there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1253
01:52:12,433 --> 01:52:13,726
and walking the path.

1254
01:52:16,771 --> 01:52:17,981
- Operator.
<i>- Tank.</i>

1255
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:21,442
- It's good to hear your voice.
<i>- We need an exit.</i>

1256
01:52:21,693 --> 01:52:24,487
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.

1257
01:52:37,542 --> 01:52:39,961
- Damn it!
- The trace was completed.

1258
01:52:40,211 --> 01:52:43,798
- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

1259
01:52:45,508 --> 01:52:47,010
Order the strike.

1260
01:52:53,558 --> 01:52:55,560
They're not out yet.

1261
01:53:06,739 --> 01:53:08,073
You first, Morpheus.

1262
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:31,055
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1263
01:53:34,308 --> 01:53:38,270
but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.

1264
01:53:41,857 --> 01:53:45,152
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1265
01:53:47,905 --> 01:53:49,448
Everything but this.

1266
01:53:50,949 --> 01:53:51,992
But what?

1267
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:18,060
Neo!

1268
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:19,937
- What happened?
- An agent.

1269
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:22,106
- Send me back.
- I can't.

1270
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:26,110
Mr. Anderson.

1271
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,697
Run, Neo. Run.

1272
01:54:34,993 --> 01:54:36,620
What is he doing?

1273
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:38,122
He's beginning to believe.

1274
01:55:05,108 --> 01:55:06,484
You're empty.

1275
01:55:07,068 --> 01:55:08,361
So are you.

1276
01:55:41,519 --> 01:55:44,522
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1277
01:55:45,648 --> 01:55:46,691
Mr. Anderson.

1278
01:56:27,649 --> 01:56:29,734
Jesus, he's killing him.

1279
01:57:55,905 --> 01:57:58,032
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1280
01:57:58,782 --> 01:58:01,785
That is the sound of inevitability.

1281
01:58:04,371 --> 01:58:07,708
It is the sound of your death.

1282
01:58:08,626 --> 01:58:10,961
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1283
01:58:11,211 --> 01:58:12,838
My name...

1284
01:58:15,841 --> 01:58:17,885
is Neo.

1285
01:58:50,126 --> 01:58:52,337
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1286
01:58:54,839 --> 01:58:55,882
Oh, shit.

1287
01:59:08,269 --> 01:59:09,729
Sentinels.

1288
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,732
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1289
01:59:14,776 --> 01:59:16,945
Tank, charge the EMP.

1290
01:59:17,195 --> 01:59:20,240
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.

1291
01:59:21,408 --> 01:59:22,492
He's gonna make it.

1292
01:59:22,742 --> 01:59:24,619
Flat or pumps? No, just...

1293
01:59:24,869 --> 01:59:27,747
What the shit? That's my phone!

1294
01:59:28,164 --> 01:59:29,749
That guy took my phone!

1295
01:59:32,127 --> 01:59:34,421
Got him!
He's on the run.

1296
01:59:34,671 --> 01:59:37,340
Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!

1297
01:59:37,590 --> 01:59:39,467
<i>I got an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.</i>

1298
01:59:43,430 --> 01:59:44,431
Oh, shit!

1299
02:00:05,994 --> 02:00:07,996
Help! Need a little help!

1300
02:00:09,622 --> 02:00:10,832
<i>The door.</i>

1301
02:00:26,807 --> 02:00:28,309
<i>The door on your left.</i>

1302
02:00:29,226 --> 02:00:30,478
<i>Your other left!</i>

1303
02:00:37,193 --> 02:00:38,444
<i>The back door.</i>

1304
02:00:59,215 --> 02:01:00,341
Oh, no.

1305
02:01:02,009 --> 02:01:03,511
Here they come.

1306
02:01:32,289 --> 02:01:33,541
He's going to make it.

1307
02:01:43,759 --> 02:01:46,887
<i>The fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.</i>

1308
02:02:22,007 --> 02:02:23,091
They're inside.

1309
02:02:25,427 --> 02:02:26,469
Hurry, Neo.

1310
02:03:22,692 --> 02:03:23,818
It can't be.

1311
02:03:31,618 --> 02:03:32,994
Check him.

1312
02:03:36,998 --> 02:03:38,541
He's gone.

1313
02:03:45,257 --> 02:03:47,676
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1314
02:03:55,268 --> 02:03:56,310
Neo...

1315
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:59,730
I'm not afraid anymore.

1316
02:04:01,357 --> 02:04:02,692
The Oracle told me...

1317
02:04:02,858 --> 02:04:08,281
I'd fall in love, and that
the man I loved would be the One.

1318
02:04:11,409 --> 02:04:13,369
So you see...

1319
02:04:14,078 --> 02:04:16,080
you can't be dead.

1320
02:04:17,665 --> 02:04:19,500
You can't be...

1321
02:04:21,043 --> 02:04:23,212
because I love you.

1322
02:04:25,047 --> 02:04:26,757
You hear me?

1323
02:04:27,883 --> 02:04:29,552
I love you.

1324
02:04:53,284 --> 02:04:54,577
Now, get up.

1325
02:05:03,252 --> 02:05:04,420
No.

1326
02:05:31,155 --> 02:05:32,198
How?

1327
02:05:33,074 --> 02:05:34,116
He is the One.

1328
02:07:00,871 --> 02:07:02,330
Neo!

1329
02:07:58,596 --> 02:08:00,306
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

1330
02:08:00,556 --> 02:08:02,391
<i>I can feel you now.</i>

1331
02:08:02,808 --> 02:08:06,437
<i>I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.</i>

1332
02:08:06,771 --> 02:08:08,606
<i>You're afraid of change.</i>

1333
02:08:10,066 --> 02:08:11,400
<i>I don't know the future.</i>

1334
02:08:11,567 --> 02:08:14,153
<i>I didn't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.</i>

1335
02:08:14,403 --> 02:08:17,365
<i>I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.</i>

1336
02:08:18,324 --> 02:08:19,909
<i>I'll hang up this phone.</i>

1337
02:08:20,159 --> 02:08:23,246
<i>And then I'll show these people
what you don't want them to see.</i>

1338
02:08:23,496 --> 02:08:25,373
<i>I'm going to show them a world...</i>

1339
02:08:25,623 --> 02:08:27,375
<i>without you.</i>

1340
02:08:27,667 --> 02:08:31,295
<i>A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.</i>

1341
02:08:31,546 --> 02:08:35,258
<i>A world where anything is possible.</i>

1342
02:08:37,885 --> 02:08:39,220
<i>Where we go from there...</i>

1343
02:08:39,470 --> 02:08:41,430
<i>is a choice I leave to you.</i>
