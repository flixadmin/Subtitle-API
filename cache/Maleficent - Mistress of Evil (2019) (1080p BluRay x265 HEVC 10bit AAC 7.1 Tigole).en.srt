1
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,550
Tie it off, come on!

2
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,201
Hey, guys!
Guys, I think we should turn back.

3
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,495
And lose good money?
Not a chance.

4
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,205
Stay close.

5
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,298
Here we are.

6
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,925
Get on his back.

7
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:53,654
Hurry up.

8
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,585
There he is. Go get him.

9
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,212
You'll pay for that.

10
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,521
No. No, please.

11
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,606
Please, no.

12
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,714
Hold it there.

13
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,858
I only got one...

14
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,860
but he's a fine specimen.

15
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,118
-That's all?
-Yeah.

16
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,995
That shroom bit me twice.

17
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,880
Tomb Bloom.

18
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,696
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

19
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,950
<i>or perhaps twice upon a time,
for you may remember this story...</i>

20
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,496
<i>there was a powerful Fey
named Maleficent.</i>

21
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,426
<i>For some reason, the mistress of evil
and protector of the Moors...</i>

22
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,595
<i>was still hated after all this time.</i>

23
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,598
<i>True, she had cursed the princess,
Aurora...</i>

24
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,602
<i>but that was before she found light
in the heart of a human child...</i>

25
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,522
<i>and raised the girl as her own.</i>

26
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:20,445
<i>After all, it was Maleficent's love
which broke that very same curse.</i>

27
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:24,782
<i>But that detail was somehow
mysteriously forgotten.</i>

28
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:30,329
<i>For as the tale was told
over and again throughout the kingdom...</i>

29
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,500
<i>Maleficent became the villain once more.</i>

30
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,223
It's time, guys.
Come on. Let's get everyone.

31
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,476
-It's the big day! Let's go!
-Come on.

32
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,227
Wake up. Wake up.

33
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,813
Come on.

34
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,994
Hurry up, wallerbogs! It's time!

35
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,511
Do you both remember the secret plan?

36
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,889
I've got it all right here.
When do I tell the queen the secret?

37
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,641
You must be patient, Thistlewit.

38
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,476
Do you think Queen Aurora's awake yet?

39
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,813
Well, she's not "Sleeping Beauty" anymore.

40
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,440
I see what you did there.

41
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,497
Next item of business, the missing fairies.

42
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:58,334
I've sent more sprites
to search the Tomb Bloom field.

43
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,919
They'll report back to me at nightfall.

44
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,338
We will keep searching until we find them.

45
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,468
Please don't raise your roots at me, Lief.

46
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,805
Crushing humans with branches
is not going to help.

47
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,059
Diaval, you're supposed to be on my side.

48
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,982
Well, I'm Queen of the Moors,
and I am a human.

49
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,487
We must all learn a little kindness.

50
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,197
Coming through.

51
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,741
Excuse us.

52
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,950
Official pixie business.

53
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,243
A word, Your Majesty.

54
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,786
-Maybe two.
-Aunties...

55
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,080
you need to wait your turn
like everyone else.

56
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,124
-No!
-This can't wait, Your Grace.

57
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,542
Not for a moment.

58
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,128
Or I might burst.
Truly, I might.

59
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,963
Is that...?

60
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,301
Pinto!

61
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:53,014
She's come bearing gifts.
The first sap from the warming trees.

62
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,307
It's for the big day!

63
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,267
Quiet, Thistlewit.

64
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,977
What big day?

65
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,106
Hey! My crown!

66
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,405
I'm not in the mood for this.

67
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,158
Pinto!

68
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,586
Come on.

69
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,089
Where are you going, aunties?

70
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,761
I don't have time for games, Pinto.

71
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,698
What's gotten into all of you?

72
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,957
There she goes, Your Majesty.

73
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,878
Come back here.

74
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,430
Pinto. I've had enough
of your games for today.

75
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,390
Look at me.

76
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,774
Philip. What are you doing here?

77
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,192
I was looking for you.

78
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,319
-Well, hello.
-Hello.

79
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,613
I'm really sorry, I can't talk right now.

80
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,533
The Moors have turned to madness.
I've got a castle full of complaints.

81
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,868
I know how busy you are.

82
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,662
-I wanted to ask you something.
-Yes.

83
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,291
Do you think there could be a union
between Ulstead and the Moors?

84
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,668
A union?

85
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,587
To connect both lands.

86
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,881
To bring harmony and peace.

87
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,091
I've been imagining a bridge.

88
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,010
A bridge.

89
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,845
Yes, a bridge.

90
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,222
A union's a wonderful idea...

91
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,266
if both sides are willing.

92
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,270
Well, I'm working on that part.

93
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,855
He's going to blow it.

94
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,106
Give him time. He's warming up.

95
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,235
Wait.

96
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,614
That's your formal coat.

97
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,534
You're in on all of this, aren't you?

98
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,870
If you're busy, I could always come back.

99
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,747
No. No, no.

100
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,123
I'm not busy at all.

101
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,583
No, because I'd hate to...

102
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,378
Really. All ears.
What did you want to talk about?

103
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,589
You're right.
He's blowing it.

104
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,426
Five years ago,
I thought I lost you forever.

105
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,722
I've decided to reclaim this day for us.

106
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,393
I've loved you since the moment I met you
and every day since.

107
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,146
If love has a truth, here is mine.

108
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,025
There is no magic nor curse that could
ever tear me away from you, Aurora.

109
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,532
-Are you sure this is a good time?
-Philip.

110
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,035
He's on his knee.

111
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,537
He took his sweet time about it.

112
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,373
Will you marry me?

113
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,584
Yes.

114
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,336
-Yes?
-Yes.

115
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,337
Yes!

116
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,673
Yes, just stand up. Kiss me.

117
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,560
We're having a wedding!

118
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,314
A secret surprise wedding.

119
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,820
Of course, we have to tell our parents.

120
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,907
Do we?

121
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,064
Mistress.

122
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,565
What?

123
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,859
I have a little bit of news.

124
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,153
Well, on with it.

125
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,947
It's nothing of any real consequence...

126
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,785
and it's certainly no reason to overreact.

127
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,745
It's just that...

128
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,373
Prince Philip has...

129
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,208
Disappeared?

130
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,378
No. No. Philip has...

131
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,962
Yellow fever? No, wait!

132
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,548
Leprosy!

133
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,342
No, Mistress.

134
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,970
Prince Philip has asked Aurora
if she'll become his...

135
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,806
Don't...

136
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,934
ruin my morning.

137
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,813
Mistress, please.

138
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,734
Stay calm!

139
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,535
<i>So, tell me, sire...</i>

140
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,080
am I to be a best man,
or did you choose a creature from the Moors?

141
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,750
General, if that's your way of asking me
if she said yes, then I...

142
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,836
I know she said yes, sire.

143
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,505
What human wouldn't want to leave that place?

144
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,257
What do you have against Moor folk, Percival?

145
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,676
"Moor folk"?
Is that what we're calling them now?

146
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,053
Winged beasts, murderous trees.

147
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,888
Guard your tongue, General.

148
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,265
You know nothing about them.

149
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,225
I know that Maleficent is a killer of men...

150
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,895
destroyer of armies.
Or so the story goes.

151
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,606
She's not like that.

152
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,109
It's my job to protect this kingdom.

153
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,861
And I will do so, old friend...

154
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,363
without hesitation.

155
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,657
Walk on.

156
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,247
Open the gates!

157
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,385
Your Majesty, spoils from the annexation
of the Midlands have arrived.

158
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,262
Weapons.

159
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,350
No. We have no need of arms.

160
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,186
Our days of war are over.

161
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,024
Ingrith...

162
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,903
you see where I've had you placed.
Right behind me.

163
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,615
And that's where I'll always be.

164
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,077
Ingrith, I said we had no need of arms.

165
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,913
One can never be too careful.

166
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,796
Your Majesty, it's cocked.

167
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,923
Is it, now?

168
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,013
-Father, Mother.
-Well?

169
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,473
What did she say?

170
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,891
She said yes.

171
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,184
Yes!

172
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,771
That is wonderful news.

173
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,565
Two kingdoms united at last.

174
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,650
Yes.

175
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,321
Yes.

176
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,074
Perhaps I've been selfish...

177
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,535
looking at this the wrong way.

178
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,746
You've made your choice.

179
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,540
Now is a time to celebrate.

180
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,338
I'm glad you finally approve.

181
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,673
Much more than that.

182
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,969
I am ready to welcome your fiancée
with open arms.

183
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,222
She shall come to dinner.

184
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,432
That would be incredible.

185
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,183
Under one condition.

186
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,727
She will bring her godmother.

187
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,395
Your Majesty, I strongly...

188
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:41,357
We will meet the one who raised her
right here in this castle.

189
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,775
Yes. The queen is right.

190
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,027
I'm not sure her godmother will...

191
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,737
No, but I insist.

192
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,991
After all, we will soon be family.

193
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,535
Well, let it be known
throughout the kingdom...

194
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,706
that my son is to marry Aurora.

195
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,209
And Maleficent is coming to dinner.

196
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,505
I shall send word straightaway.

197
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:27,862
Incoming.

198
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,409
Hold on to your petticoats!

199
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,547
Well, well.

200
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,551
So?

201
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,720
So.

202
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,475
Godmother...

203
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,439
Philip asked me to marry him.

204
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:05,942
Poor thing.

205
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,777
He'll recover.

206
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,823
My answer was yes.

207
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,660
No.

208
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,869
Yes.

209
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:17,995
No.

210
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,372
I wasn't really asking.

211
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,623
Nor was I.

212
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,667
What's next?

213
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,502
You'll turn him into a goat?

214
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,256
Stop.

215
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,925
Why don't you like Philip?

216
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,927
Well, for one thing, he's human.

217
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,512
I'm a human.

218
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,557
And I have never held that against you.

219
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,892
Until I fell in love.

220
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:44,188
Love doesn't always end well, Beasty.

221
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,859
I'll have you know
Prince Philip is a prince.

222
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,653
A very handsome and charming prince.

223
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,243
I'm just asking you to trust me.

224
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,537
Please give him a chance.

225
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,372
Let us prove you wrong.

226
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,458
Philip is thoughtful...

227
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,001
he's very kind...

228
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,461
Kind of what?

229
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,422
The king and queen are celebrating tonight...

230
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,050
and they have invited both of us
to the castle.

231
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:17,388
You want me to meet his parents?

232
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,057
It's just a dinner.

233
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,935
They don't want me in Ulstead.

234
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,896
Why on earth would I go?

235
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,149
Because his mother wishes to meet mine.

236
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,152
Please.

237
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,787
Philip.

238
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,039
I want you to wear this tonight.

239
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,667
Your sword?

240
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,462
Because of you,
Ulstead and the Moors will be united at last.

241
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,177
Father, my love for Aurora
has nothing to do with politics.

242
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,596
Yes, but your love...

243
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:02,517
will ensure peace for generations.

244
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,019
Now take it. And wear it...

245
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,147
to know that you will never have to use it.

246
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,275
My son.

247
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,113
I've never been more proud.

248
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,158
And what about Mother?

249
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,452
Is she okay with this?

250
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:26,457
Your mother will learn
to love who you love.

251
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,767
Tomb Bloom.
Tomb Bloom.

252
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,202
I'm losing my patience.

253
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:45,953
Your Majesty.

254
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,873
You need to move faster, Lickspittle.

255
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,083
Yes, Your Majesty.

256
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,045
Aurora said yes.

257
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,219
It's all coming together...

258
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,931
perfectly.

259
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,775
Hello.

260
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,486
Hello.

261
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,073
Hello.

262
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,993
Try it with a little less fang.

263
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,123
How's this?

264
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,793
Try the greeting.

265
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,297
How kind of you to invite me this evening.

266
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,341
Remember, it's not a threat.

267
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,304
So very kind of you
to invite me this evening.

268
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,266
Yeah. Better.

269
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,309
Try it with a curtsy.

270
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,230
We can skip that part.

271
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,070
She really loves that boy, you know.

272
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,741
You're doing her a great kindness.

273
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,411
Kindness?

274
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,538
Mistress...

275
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,179
Doesn't she look lovely?

276
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,226
I have something for you.

277
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,148
For your horns.

278
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:41,361
I just thought it might make Philip's family
feel more comfortable.

279
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,071
And you, as well.

280
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,618
Maybe it's a bad idea.

281
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,495
No, it's...

282
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,498
It's all right.

283
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,300
I'm so excited.

284
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,720
It's more than I can bear.

285
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,342
It's Maleficent!

286
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,891
Pitchforks?

287
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,810
Humans are hilarious.

288
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,400
It's getting better.

289
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,377
-Anyone leaves their post gets hung.
-Yes, sir.

290
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,014
They're here.

291
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,357
Have you ever considered
turning me into a bear?

292
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,734
I think I'd make quite an impressive one.

293
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,152
Look at their claws.
They're so strong.

294
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,112
Why are we talking about bears?

295
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,699
Presenting Queen Aurora of the Moors.

296
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,044
Thank you.

297
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,840
-You look wonderful.
-I'm so happy to be here.

298
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,303
Aurora, this is truly an honor.

299
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,226
Welcome to Ulstead.

300
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,230
Such a beautiful girl.

301
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,400
I can see how you stole Philip's heart.

302
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,861
Your Majesty.

303
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,034
The flowers in your hair. I'm allergic.

304
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,619
I'm so sorry.

305
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:40,123
Oh, no. No, no. It's all right.
They're beautiful.

306
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,457
Presenting Maleficent.

307
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:55,763
Maleficent, it's wonderful to see you again.

308
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:00,226
This is my father, King John of Ulstead.

309
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:02,270
And my mother, Queen Ingrith.

310
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,773
Welcome to our home.

311
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:13,281
It's so very kind of you to invite me
this evening.

312
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,074
Don't smile.

313
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,371
And I would like to introduce you to Diaval.

314
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:25,168
I trust you had no trouble
finding the castle.

315
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,003
Why would I have trouble?

316
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,925
He's making small talk.

317
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,261
I'll explain it later.

318
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:37,263
No trouble at all.

319
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,641
Your Majesties, ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

320
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:44,312
Please, make yourselves at home.

321
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:14,634
Bird.

322
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,262
Delicious.

323
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,398
Is there a problem?

324
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:31,693
It's iron.

325
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:35,988
Majesty, as you are sensitive to flowers,
she is averse to iron.

326
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,367
I had no idea.

327
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,994
Take it away at once.

328
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,211
I trust you'll be comfortable
using your hands?

329
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,507
Such a warm spell of weather, isn't it?

330
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,134
It certainly is.

331
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:03,641
Well, we have a small gift
for Philip and Aurora...

332
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:07,478
to celebrate their
glorious future together.

333
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:20,450
I simply can't wait to have a little one
running through the castle again.

334
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,748
This castle?

335
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,291
Yes, of course.

336
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,628
This will be their home.

337
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:36,674
I hear Aurora has a castle of her own.

338
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:39,510
Yes, sir, I do.

339
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,054
Yes...

340
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:46,851
I'm curious. How did Aurora
become Queen of the Moors?

341
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,186
I made her queen.

342
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,271
Her castle is quite stunning.
You must see it.

343
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,358
Yes, but in fact, she has another castle.

344
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:55,985
Does she not?

345
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:58,321
Mother...

346
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:02,408
One in the Moors,
and one left behind by her father.

347
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,578
King Stefan, was it not?

348
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:09,457
That castle was never my home.
It was given to the people.

349
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,252
So, you're also a true princess.

350
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,505
Even though Stefan died.
Was killed?

351
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:17,465
Remind me, did he die or was he killed?

352
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,593
Both.

353
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,555
Yes, you're right, it is very warm recently.

354
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:28,559
Because I remember
the story of a baby.

355
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,771
A baby cursed to sleep...

356
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,023
and never wake up.

357
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,609
Really?

358
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:40,363
Who would do such a terrible thing
to an innocent child?

359
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:46,703
Well, there are many who prey
on the innocent.

360
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,955
I'm sure your kind would agree.

361
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:50,790
What do you mean, my kind?

362
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,418
She means humans.

363
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,420
There are fairies missing from the Moors.

364
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,130
What I'm missing is some wine.

365
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,007
Stolen by human poachers.

366
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:00,466
That's the first I've heard of it.

367
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,968
Someone gave the order.

368
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:12,020
It sounds as if you're accusing the king.

369
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,564
No, she never said that.

370
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,150
Wait...
Sorry, who would steal a fairy?

371
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,694
Your Majesty, I must report
that two peasants were found dead...

372
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,654
just outside the Moors.

373
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,489
They'd been missing for several days.

374
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,657
I see.

375
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,659
Yes, we all see.

376
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:31,164
The borders are open, but humans
are not welcome. Isn't that right?

377
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:34,584
What exactly are you implying, Your Majesty?

378
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,879
Innocent men are being slaughtered
on the Moors...

379
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,048
and she's talking about fairies.

380
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:46,387
Contain your animal.

381
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,348
Or I will.

382
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:55,605
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were making a threat.

383
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:56,814
Well, do you?

384
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:57,815
Do I what?

385
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:58,941
Know better?

386
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,109
Enough.

387
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,527
Put her down.

388
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,947
Please, put her down.

389
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:10,078
We're here to celebrate.

390
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:15,166
Forgive me, he's right.

391
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,293
Let's not forget why we're here.

392
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,380
The start of a new life for Aurora.

393
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:23,883
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

394
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:31,683
You have done an admirable job, Maleficent...

395
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:35,895
going against your own nature
to raise this child.

396
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:38,356
But now...

397
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:41,943
Aurora will finally get...

398
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,445
the love of a real family.

399
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,656
A real mother.

400
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:50,118
Because the one thing I regret...

401
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,954
is never having a daughter of my own.

402
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,957
But tonight changes that.

403
00:31:56,124 --> 00:32:01,546
Tonight, I consider Aurora my own.

404
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:16,978
Guards!

405
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:19,188
We have opened our home to a witch!

406
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:30,825
Stop!

407
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,286
There is no union.

408
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:34,912
There will be no wedding.

409
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,749
-Maleficent!
-We must protect the king!

410
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:39,542
Maleficent, please, stop now.

411
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:42,045
John, I'm so frightened.

412
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,673
What has she done to me?

413
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,134
Father!

414
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:51,137
John!

415
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,097
We go home.

416
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:55,933
John!

417
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:58,144
It's a curse.

418
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,023
It's a curse!

419
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:04,400
Maleficent has cursed the king!

420
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:08,279
What have you done?

421
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,239
I've done nothing.

422
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:13,534
Aurora, we go home now.

423
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,621
Aurora!

424
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:31,552
Aurora!

425
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,262
Wake him!

426
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,308
Wake him, please.

427
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,060
Stand aside!

428
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:05,605
To the bedroom!

429
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,984
This magic, we have no tools to reverse it.

430
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:14,697
There must be a lesion.

431
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:16,115
Proof of her witchery.

432
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:18,451
Please, leave His Majesty his dignity.

433
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:21,579
We all saw what Maleficent did to him.

434
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:23,915
I'm so sorry.

435
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:27,502
A curse upon our king
is a curse upon this kingdom.

436
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,631
All he wanted was peace.

437
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,633
This is all my fault.

438
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,552
You have nothing to apologize for, my dear.

439
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:41,099
Maleficent is a threat to everyone.

440
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:43,351
Especially you.

441
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:46,813
We'll do our best to protect you.

442
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:50,066
There must be a way to reverse this.

443
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,237
Mother, could you try kissing him?

444
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,324
True love and all that.

445
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:04,372
I doubt that would work.

446
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:05,790
It could save him.

447
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:08,584
-A kiss is just a kiss.
-Please, Mother.

448
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:10,378
Very well.

449
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:23,016
You wanted peace...

450
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:26,519
now rest in peace forever.

451
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,363
I told you.

452
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,491
This is no fairy tale.

453
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,202
I have to return to the Moors.

454
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:44,412
It's the only way.

455
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:45,788
Wait, wait. Come here.

456
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,415
I have to find her.

457
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:48,583
It's the middle of the night.

458
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,418
She will break the curse.
I know she will.

459
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:52,211
Okay, well,
let me come with you.

460
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,797
No. You should stay with your family.

461
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:56,299
You are my family.

462
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:00,303
Let her go, Philip.

463
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,764
Maybe she can save him.

464
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,363
Maleficent!

465
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,660
Maleficent!

466
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,877
Godmother!

467
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:24,053
Please come back.

468
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:29,308
She's not in the Moors.

469
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:31,769
Diaval.

470
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,939
No one's seen her.

471
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,774
I'm so happy to see you.

472
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:39,944
She's nowhere to be found.

473
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,156
What if she never comes back?

474
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:45,491
I could be stuck as a human forever.

475
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,285
I have to find her.

476
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:53,124
She's the only one who can break the curse.

477
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:54,560
Tell me she's dead.

478
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,897
The iron pierced her flesh.

479
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:00,650
She fell into the river
and went over the falls.

480
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:04,904
Then where is her head?

481
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:07,365
There was something else.

482
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,575
Another creature.

483
00:40:10,076 --> 00:40:12,870
It pulled her from the depths of the sea.

484
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:15,081
What did it look like?

485
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:16,666
Her.

486
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,461
It carried her up into the sky.

487
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,340
A wounded animal lashes out
and now she's not alone.

488
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:27,135
We must be ready for war.

489
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:31,931
Maleficent has cursed the king!

490
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:39,689
Stay inside!

491
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,573
Maleficent has cursed the king!

492
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:25,420
If Conall hadn't found her,
she would be dead.

493
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,092
They tried to kill her with this.

494
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,861
Do you hear it?

495
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:52,238
Do you hear it?

496
00:42:56,117 --> 00:42:57,702
It's a message from the humans.

497
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:00,997
I hear it loud and clear.

498
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:03,958
Time for us to die.

499
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:08,671
Humans have used iron
against us for centuries.

500
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:11,215
And we are almost extinct because of it.

501
00:43:11,382 --> 00:43:15,094
Killing peasants on the Moors
will only lead to more conflict, Borra.

502
00:43:15,762 --> 00:43:17,263
They've pulled the iron from the earth...

503
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,099
made their swords and shields,
drove us underground.

504
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:21,601
But this...

505
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:26,022
This will finish us.

506
00:43:26,189 --> 00:43:27,732
Our people are safe here for now.

507
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:29,650
But for how long?

508
00:43:29,817 --> 00:43:31,694
The humans will find us.
They will not stop.

509
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:34,489
I call for war.

510
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:37,658
I call for war!

511
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:38,868
Right now!

512
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:42,205
There are too many humans.

513
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:45,792
Too many kingdoms.

514
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:49,879
Conall, they will keep finding
new ways to destroy us.

515
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:51,631
We can't win.

516
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:57,970
We can't win!

517
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:01,683
Not this way.

518
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:05,228
No. You're wrong, Conall.

519
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:09,524
We have something they didn't plan on.

520
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:13,778
We have her.

521
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:20,785
She holds powers none of us possess.

522
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:24,497
She is wounded, Borra.

523
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:27,250
Who are you?

524
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:46,019
You reek of human.

525
00:44:47,937 --> 00:44:49,564
Maybe I was wrong about you.

526
00:44:50,064 --> 00:44:53,568
Or maybe Conall should have left you
for dead at the bottom of the sea.

527
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:58,740
No.

528
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:02,285
It's there, isn't it?

529
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,121
It's inside you.

530
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:25,266
You see?

531
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,689
You see what's inside her?

532
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:35,151
That is what will save us all.

533
00:45:53,294 --> 00:45:54,796
You saved me.

534
00:45:58,466 --> 00:45:59,717
Come.

535
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:06,766
Let me show you who we are.

536
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:03,906
We're Dark Fey.

537
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:06,993
Same as you.

538
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:19,964
We're all that remain.

539
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:24,302
Unseen here, far away from mankind.

540
00:47:24,677 --> 00:47:25,720
Look!

541
00:47:27,263 --> 00:47:29,849
As more human kingdoms emerged,
we went into hiding...

542
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:32,643
from every corner of the earth...

543
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:35,813
doing what we had to, to survive.

544
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,900
But many were lost.

545
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:03,841
Only a few generations ago...

546
00:48:04,008 --> 00:48:06,260
our kind roamed every part of the world.

547
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,930
The tundra.

548
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:10,390
The forest.

549
00:48:10,556 --> 00:48:11,933
The jungle.

550
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:17,897
The desert.

551
00:48:23,528 --> 00:48:26,155
Now, our only refuge is here...

552
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:27,907
in this cave.

553
00:48:28,074 --> 00:48:30,118
Our nest of origin.

554
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:37,083
Listen. Play in the wind.

555
00:48:38,835 --> 00:48:39,836
Go!

556
00:49:00,023 --> 00:49:03,359
Those children should be soaring
over the trees and rivers.

557
00:49:03,526 --> 00:49:05,445
Instead, they are raised in exile.

558
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,530
I could protect them.

559
00:49:09,365 --> 00:49:11,951
How? By waging war against the humans?

560
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:14,037
I've been at war with them my whole life.

561
00:49:14,203 --> 00:49:15,246
Not all of them.

562
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:18,541
There was one you raised as your own.

563
00:49:20,918 --> 00:49:23,880
Maybe we don't have to hide from the humans.

564
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:25,965
Maybe we can exist without fear...

565
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:27,925
and war.

566
00:49:28,384 --> 00:49:30,762
Find a way together.

567
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:34,265
That will never happen.

568
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:07,400
Gotcha!

569
00:51:11,904 --> 00:51:15,575
Welcome to your new home.

570
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:37,013
We've been worried about you, dear.

571
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:39,057
Your Majesty.

572
00:51:40,016 --> 00:51:41,893
I couldn't find her.

573
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,687
My heart breaks for you.

574
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:49,150
She has brought a cloud of darkness
upon your happiness.

575
00:51:50,276 --> 00:51:52,695
I know she was against this marriage.

576
00:51:53,279 --> 00:51:56,157
Never trusted your instincts as a queen.

577
00:51:56,699 --> 00:51:59,243
When I saw her at dinner...

578
00:52:00,578 --> 00:52:03,331
with her horns covered...

579
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,460
bent cowering...

580
00:52:12,256 --> 00:52:15,843
Well, it's no wonder that she lashed out.

581
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:18,388
I just don't know what to do.

582
00:52:19,013 --> 00:52:21,724
You do truly love him, don't you?

583
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:23,309
My son.

584
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,811
Deeply.

585
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:28,731
It is love that will heal you.

586
00:52:29,524 --> 00:52:31,150
It's what heals us all.

587
00:52:31,943 --> 00:52:35,196
Let's move forward together...

588
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,740
as a family.

589
00:52:54,215 --> 00:52:57,051
<i>To all who live on the Moors...</i>

590
00:52:59,095 --> 00:53:01,139
What is that noise?

591
00:53:01,305 --> 00:53:04,267
<i>...and kingdoms far and wide,
the king and queen invite you...</i>

592
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:06,477
<i>to attend the wedding...</i>

593
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,981
<i>of their son Philip to Aurora
in three days' time.</i>

594
00:53:10,815 --> 00:53:12,525
<i>All are welcome.</i>

595
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:18,114
<i>And all are expected!</i>

596
00:53:19,407 --> 00:53:21,868
Did you hear that?
We're invited to the castle!

597
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:24,120
I knew Aurora wouldn't abandon us!

598
00:53:24,287 --> 00:53:26,372
I always knew I'd be invited.

599
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:28,666
Just glad you two made the cut.

600
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:31,252
Who's getting married?

601
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:43,306
Aurora, we don't have to think
about the wedding right now.

602
00:53:44,724 --> 00:53:46,476
The queen is right.

603
00:53:46,726 --> 00:53:48,978
We owe it to everyone...

604
00:53:49,437 --> 00:53:51,647
especially the king.

605
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:54,484
What about Maleficent?

606
00:53:57,612 --> 00:53:59,739
She's gone.

607
00:54:12,502 --> 00:54:13,920
The Phoenix.

608
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:16,422
It is said the Dark Fey began with her...

609
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:19,842
evolved over centuries.

610
00:54:21,636 --> 00:54:23,930
You are the last of her descendants.

611
00:54:24,722 --> 00:54:27,100
Her blood is your own.

612
00:54:28,768 --> 00:54:30,520
You are her.

613
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:37,235
In your hands,
you hold the power of life and death...

614
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:40,196
destruction and rebirth.

615
00:54:41,531 --> 00:54:47,203
But nature's greatest power
is the power of true transformation.

616
00:54:48,996 --> 00:54:52,250
You transformed when you raised Aurora.

617
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:56,337
When you found love...

618
00:54:56,504 --> 00:54:59,590
in the middle of your pain.

619
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,928
I'm asking you to take all of your fury...

620
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:06,389
all of your pain...

621
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:09,392
and not use it.

622
00:55:09,559 --> 00:55:12,854
Help us broker peace with the humans.

623
00:55:14,647 --> 00:55:15,773
Because peace...

624
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:21,112
could be the Dark Fey's
final transformation.

625
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:31,748
The Moors are our last true nature on earth.

626
00:55:32,749 --> 00:55:36,210
And yet you named a human as queen.

627
00:55:36,878 --> 00:55:39,505
A daughter you cared for.

628
00:55:41,591 --> 00:55:43,760
I have no daughter.

629
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:48,765
She has chosen her side.

630
00:56:01,152 --> 00:56:02,820
We've just heard.

631
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:06,074
There's going to be a wedding
at the castle in three days.

632
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,869
Humans will come from all over.

633
00:56:10,411 --> 00:56:12,246
That's when we attack.

634
00:56:12,413 --> 00:56:15,166
We'll kill the king and queen of Ulstead...

635
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:17,335
and their young prince.

636
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:22,215
Their kingdom will fall.

637
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,385
And the Fey will rise again.

638
00:56:41,234 --> 00:56:43,861
The fairies made it.

639
00:56:58,668 --> 00:57:02,422
I wore it when I married the king.

640
00:57:09,095 --> 00:57:12,015
I'm sure it's perfect.

641
00:57:12,557 --> 00:57:13,975
So am I.

642
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:22,233
Your Majesty, she's absolutely lovely.

643
00:57:22,775 --> 00:57:24,360
Considering how she was raised.

644
00:57:24,527 --> 00:57:26,904
By the same evil witch who cursed her.

645
00:57:27,488 --> 00:57:30,199
It's a miracle Prince Philip came along.

646
00:57:30,366 --> 00:57:33,327
It's a miracle
the poor child is alive at all.

647
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,539
Thank you so much.

648
00:57:36,706 --> 00:57:37,707
It's exquisite.

649
00:58:08,237 --> 00:58:09,864
<i>When I'm older...</i>

650
00:58:10,031 --> 00:58:11,824
I'm going to live here,
in the Moors, with you.

651
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:15,328
Then we can look after each other.

652
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:38,559
-Tell me what's troubling you.
-It's nothing.

653
00:58:39,769 --> 00:58:42,313
Aurora, I know you better than that.

654
00:58:45,149 --> 00:58:46,359
This jewelry...

655
00:58:47,276 --> 00:58:48,611
my hair...

656
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:50,863
all these rules.

657
00:58:52,073 --> 00:58:53,533
I can't breathe.

658
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:57,203
I feel like
I'm not Queen of the Moors anymore.

659
00:58:57,578 --> 00:58:59,580
I feel like a different person.

660
00:58:59,956 --> 00:59:01,165
Listen...

661
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:05,169
I fell in love with a girl in the forest
and only her.

662
00:59:05,336 --> 00:59:06,838
You don't have to change.

663
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:09,132
I don't want you to change.

664
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:20,435
I should have never asked her
to wear that scarf.

665
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:40,955
Ah, yes.

666
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,083
Well...

667
00:59:45,251 --> 00:59:47,045
Does it work?

668
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:50,006
I only have a handful of fairy specimens
to work with...

669
00:59:50,173 --> 00:59:52,633
and the extraction process is painstaking.

670
00:59:53,593 --> 00:59:55,345
Extraction from what?

671
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:58,473
Tomb Bloom flowers.

672
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:01,476
They grow from a fairy's grave,
contain their very essence.

673
01:00:01,642 --> 01:00:03,478
When you mix the pollen
with iron powder...

674
01:00:03,644 --> 01:00:06,439
the resulting dust ends a fairy's life.

675
01:00:06,606 --> 01:00:08,232
We will need thousands more.

676
01:00:10,109 --> 01:00:11,402
Show me.

677
01:00:13,446 --> 01:00:14,489
Show me.

678
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:15,948
Very well.

679
01:00:19,243 --> 01:00:20,078
So...

680
01:01:10,336 --> 01:01:14,132
Finally, the Moors will be mine.

681
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:17,635
No more fairies.

682
01:01:52,003 --> 01:01:53,129
Stay alert, men.

683
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:12,982
This is where I found them.

684
01:02:13,149 --> 01:02:14,150
Excellent.

685
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:16,361
But what if the winged one returns?

686
01:02:16,527 --> 01:02:18,446
Don't you worry about that.

687
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:20,365
We'll be ready.

688
01:02:20,531 --> 01:02:21,699
Take the Tomb Blooms.

689
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:24,369
Get to work!

690
01:02:40,009 --> 01:02:41,135
Sentries, stay alert!

691
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:42,553
Keep your weapons on hand.

692
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:04,534
Move it!

693
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,960
Maleficent...

694
01:03:56,961 --> 01:03:59,881
This is where we bury our dead.

695
01:04:01,174 --> 01:04:03,051
They've destroyed it.

696
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,682
This is what the humans do.

697
01:04:10,183 --> 01:04:12,435
They're nothing but locusts
that swarm the earth.

698
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:14,270
We have to stop them.

699
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:20,026
You spent years caring for a human...

700
01:04:20,193 --> 01:04:23,196
now it's time to care for your own.

701
01:04:32,747 --> 01:04:33,790
Fire!

702
01:04:54,227 --> 01:04:56,270
Reload! We go again!

703
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:03,528
Fire!

704
01:05:07,115 --> 01:05:09,617
Reload! There's another one!

705
01:06:26,652 --> 01:06:28,446
Everyone, stay together!

706
01:06:28,613 --> 01:06:30,281
We're about to leave the Moors.

707
01:06:30,448 --> 01:06:31,908
Grab the hand or the wing...

708
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:34,452
or the tail of whoever is closest to you.

709
01:07:16,452 --> 01:07:18,996
Hey, over here! Yeah, over here!

710
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,541
Hold formation, guards. Hold formation.

711
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:24,794
-Excuse me, sir.
-Stop right there.

712
01:07:24,961 --> 01:07:26,004
I'm with the bride.

713
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:29,257
We've been told to let the other kind
find their seats first.

714
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:30,508
But I'm not a human.

715
01:07:30,675 --> 01:07:32,427
-I'm a raven.
-What?

716
01:07:32,593 --> 01:07:34,721
A raven. The black bird.

717
01:07:35,847 --> 01:07:37,473
This rice is delicious.

718
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,184
You're supposed to throw it
at the bride and groom.

719
01:07:40,351 --> 01:07:42,770
What? And waste good rice?

720
01:07:42,937 --> 01:07:44,188
What's the hold up?

721
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:46,190
Let me in!

722
01:07:46,357 --> 01:07:48,317
Why can't humans come in, too?

723
01:07:49,986 --> 01:07:51,571
Why can't we come in?

724
01:07:58,911 --> 01:07:59,912
I know it's bad luck...

725
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,748
but I had to see you.

726
01:08:03,374 --> 01:08:04,584
For you.

727
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:06,419
A Tomb Bloom?

728
01:08:06,586 --> 01:08:07,545
Where did you get this?

729
01:08:07,712 --> 01:08:08,671
From my mother.

730
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:12,050
The sun's up.
It's our wedding day.

731
01:08:19,682 --> 01:08:21,893
<i>From my mother.</i>

732
01:11:11,104 --> 01:11:12,772
Where should we sit, Flittle?

733
01:11:12,939 --> 01:11:14,816
On the left.
We're with the bride.

734
01:11:14,982 --> 01:11:16,484
Yes, we are.

735
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:18,403
But the groom's lovely, too.

736
01:11:18,569 --> 01:11:20,238
Yes, he is.

737
01:11:21,155 --> 01:11:22,532
I'm with both.

738
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:33,584
Now.

739
01:11:57,066 --> 01:11:58,735
What's this?

740
01:11:58,901 --> 01:12:00,570
Nobody is allowed in here except me.

741
01:12:00,737 --> 01:12:03,489
And I'm already here, so go away!

742
01:12:21,716 --> 01:12:23,176
Maleficent, please stop.

743
01:12:30,308 --> 01:12:31,934
Maleficent.

744
01:12:32,101 --> 01:12:33,519
She didn't do it.

745
01:12:37,398 --> 01:12:38,232
Get out!

746
01:12:40,026 --> 01:12:41,110
Before I call the guards!

747
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:49,577
The missing fairies.

748
01:12:49,744 --> 01:12:50,995
I said get out. Did you hear me?

749
01:12:51,162 --> 01:12:52,538
What have you done?

750
01:12:58,127 --> 01:12:59,837
You're a pixie.

751
01:13:00,004 --> 01:13:01,297
How dare you call me that?

752
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:03,424
I'm Lickspittle, the nobleman...

753
01:13:03,591 --> 01:13:05,343
and I serve the queen.

754
01:13:06,135 --> 01:13:08,304
She took your wings.

755
01:13:11,849 --> 01:13:13,351
We have to release them.

756
01:13:13,976 --> 01:13:15,561
They belong on the Moors.

757
01:13:15,728 --> 01:13:16,729
As you do, Aurora.

758
01:13:18,856 --> 01:13:22,276
A human who has betrayed her kind.

759
01:13:28,866 --> 01:13:30,743
You put the curse on the king.

760
01:13:30,952 --> 01:13:32,495
Oh, dear.

761
01:13:33,037 --> 01:13:34,956
You may be queen...

762
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:36,874
but you are very young.

763
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:39,877
Ruling humans is a bit more complicated...

764
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:44,257
than running around barefoot
with flowers in your hair.

765
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:49,137
When I was young...

766
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,266
my family's kingdom bordered the Moors.

767
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:57,687
And one particularly harsh winter...

768
01:13:57,854 --> 01:13:59,480
our crops died...

769
01:13:59,647 --> 01:14:02,442
and the people began to suffer.

770
01:14:03,317 --> 01:14:05,903
And as we looked over our walls...

771
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:09,115
we could see the fairies thriving.

772
01:14:10,283 --> 01:14:13,036
My brother and I believed we
should take what we needed...

773
01:14:13,202 --> 01:14:18,332
while my father, the king,
sought their kindness.

774
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:23,129
Choosing peace over our people,
he sent my brother to do his bidding.

775
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:25,840
He never came back.

776
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:28,801
Those savages...

777
01:14:28,968 --> 01:14:32,972
creatures who could barely grunt,
let alone engage in talks, killed him.

778
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:35,058
I don't believe that.

779
01:14:35,224 --> 01:14:36,517
Our people became fearful.

780
01:14:36,684 --> 01:14:39,312
They overthrew my father.

781
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:42,440
The land fell into chaos.
I was cast out.

782
01:14:43,316 --> 01:14:47,695
Forced by fate into marriage
with King John of Ulstead.

783
01:14:48,237 --> 01:14:52,283
Another weak king
speaking of tolerance and civility.

784
01:14:52,825 --> 01:14:55,161
And now, my own son...

785
01:14:55,328 --> 01:14:58,539
corrupted with visions of harmony.

786
01:14:59,332 --> 01:15:01,793
But peace will not be our downfall.

787
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:08,675
Now lock her up.

788
01:15:09,801 --> 01:15:11,803
A war is coming.

789
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,560
No! No!

790
01:15:27,985 --> 01:15:30,405
I wish you could be here with me.

791
01:15:39,497 --> 01:15:41,124
Conall wanted peace...

792
01:15:43,334 --> 01:15:46,087
<i>and they filled him with iron.</i>

793
01:15:47,547 --> 01:15:49,966
Now, we will have our war.

794
01:15:52,051 --> 01:15:55,179
Our fight begins now!

795
01:15:56,431 --> 01:15:57,932
We will rise together!

796
01:15:58,599 --> 01:16:00,226
We fight together.

797
01:16:00,476 --> 01:16:04,856
And we will show them no mercy!

798
01:16:21,831 --> 01:16:24,000
Come on! Go!

799
01:16:28,338 --> 01:16:30,006
Go! Go!

800
01:16:31,341 --> 01:16:33,968
Go! Go! Go!

801
01:16:47,815 --> 01:16:49,609
Where are all Philip's guests?

802
01:16:49,776 --> 01:16:51,986
Humans are poor timekeepers.

803
01:17:18,638 --> 01:17:20,932
Start the music.

804
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:40,368
Come on! Come on!

805
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:45,475
She's gone.

806
01:18:47,226 --> 01:18:48,144
Hey!

807
01:18:58,571 --> 01:19:01,032
It's a trap! Get down!

808
01:19:19,801 --> 01:19:21,177
Your Majesty...

809
01:19:22,303 --> 01:19:24,681
they're coming from the sea.

810
01:19:34,357 --> 01:19:35,358
She escaped!

811
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:44,075
Down this way, come on!

812
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,084
Your Highness.

813
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:54,669
Upon my command.

814
01:20:05,263 --> 01:20:06,472
Check every room!

815
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:10,018
She can't be far!

816
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:43,968
Wait.

817
01:20:45,428 --> 01:20:46,596
Wait.

818
01:21:10,244 --> 01:21:11,996
What's going on?

819
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:17,293
Now.

820
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:18,711
Fire!

821
01:21:28,096 --> 01:21:29,430
No!

822
01:21:56,165 --> 01:21:58,251
They look just like her.

823
01:22:02,255 --> 01:22:03,756
Withdraw!

824
01:22:03,923 --> 01:22:05,967
Withdraw!

825
01:22:06,926 --> 01:22:08,636
Pull back!

826
01:22:08,803 --> 01:22:10,179
Maleficent's starting a war.

827
01:22:10,346 --> 01:22:12,515
First my father, and now this.

828
01:22:12,682 --> 01:22:14,851
Philip! She didn't curse him.

829
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:16,644
-Maleficent.
-What?

830
01:22:17,145 --> 01:22:18,855
She never cursed him.

831
01:22:19,981 --> 01:22:21,607
It was your mother.

832
01:22:21,774 --> 01:22:22,984
What are you saying?

833
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:24,360
It was the spindle.

834
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:31,159
The curse is still in it.

835
01:22:31,534 --> 01:22:34,162
Your mother used it against your father.

836
01:22:35,913 --> 01:22:37,331
Look.

837
01:22:39,834 --> 01:22:40,710
It's the same.

838
01:22:41,586 --> 01:22:44,130
She's locked the Moor folk in the chapel.

839
01:22:44,297 --> 01:22:45,506
This isn't a wedding.

840
01:22:45,673 --> 01:22:47,675
It's a trap.

841
01:22:52,388 --> 01:22:54,807
Remember where you came from.

842
01:22:55,641 --> 01:22:57,769
Remember who you are.

843
01:23:01,022 --> 01:23:02,940
I've made my choice.

844
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:06,069
You'll have to make yours.

845
01:23:34,347 --> 01:23:35,890
Stay low!

846
01:23:38,184 --> 01:23:39,310
Divide!

847
01:23:41,604 --> 01:23:43,106
Follow me!

848
01:23:52,073 --> 01:23:53,116
Attack!

849
01:23:54,492 --> 01:23:55,993
Attack!

850
01:24:07,046 --> 01:24:08,798
-Ignite!
-Ignite!

851
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:20,143
No!

852
01:25:04,645 --> 01:25:05,897
Aunties!
Aunties!

853
01:25:09,067 --> 01:25:10,443
It's too heavy!

854
01:25:11,778 --> 01:25:12,987
Aurora!

855
01:25:13,154 --> 01:25:14,364
Diaval! You're here.

856
01:25:18,534 --> 01:25:20,161
What's happening?

857
01:25:39,806 --> 01:25:41,140
Weapon change!

858
01:25:43,101 --> 01:25:44,268
Weapon change! Go!

859
01:26:24,642 --> 01:26:25,643
Mother!

860
01:26:26,561 --> 01:26:27,937
You have to stop this.

861
01:26:28,104 --> 01:26:29,564
We are at war.

862
01:26:29,731 --> 01:26:31,607
This isn't a war. It's a massacre.

863
01:26:31,774 --> 01:26:33,276
Philip, you don't understand.

864
01:26:33,443 --> 01:26:36,112
These creatures stand between us...

865
01:26:36,279 --> 01:26:38,865
and everything we need to survive.

866
01:26:39,032 --> 01:26:40,283
You're wrong.

867
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:41,826
We can stand together.

868
01:26:41,993 --> 01:26:44,704
Well, you're a fool to believe that.

869
01:26:44,871 --> 01:26:48,166
You don't know what it takes
to fight for our kind.

870
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:50,376
You lied to me.

871
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:53,379
I am protecting the kingdom...

872
01:26:53,546 --> 01:26:55,798
and your throne.

873
01:26:56,215 --> 01:26:57,425
What about Father?

874
01:26:59,052 --> 01:27:02,096
Were you protecting him, too?

875
01:27:04,432 --> 01:27:06,851
The prince is not feeling well.

876
01:27:07,977 --> 01:27:09,896
See him to his chambers.

877
01:27:13,816 --> 01:27:14,734
Now.

878
01:27:19,238 --> 01:27:20,448
Sire, stop!

879
01:27:47,433 --> 01:27:49,686
Yield! Yield!

880
01:27:49,852 --> 01:27:51,562
My mother cursed the king
so she could destroy the Moor folk.

881
01:27:52,063 --> 01:27:54,148
Your men are paying heavily for it.

882
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:03,074
We have to do something!

883
01:28:07,036 --> 01:28:08,454
Goodbye, girls.

884
01:28:09,789 --> 01:28:11,582
No, come back!

885
01:28:11,916 --> 01:28:13,668
Flittle! No!

886
01:28:26,264 --> 01:28:27,557
No!

887
01:28:27,724 --> 01:28:29,559
Hey, you, stay with your own!

888
01:28:30,184 --> 01:28:31,728
Run, Aurora, run!

889
01:28:31,894 --> 01:28:33,563
Let him go!

890
01:28:38,192 --> 01:28:40,278
No! No!

891
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:09,182
Godmother.

892
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:09,200
For Flittle!

893
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:18,918
We've got her!

894
01:31:06,966 --> 01:31:08,676
Go! Go!

895
01:31:08,843 --> 01:31:11,387
This way! This way!

896
01:31:11,554 --> 01:31:12,513
Go!

897
01:31:55,765 --> 01:31:57,141
Stand down!

898
01:31:58,935 --> 01:32:00,353
This is not my fight.

899
01:32:01,145 --> 01:32:03,690
My mother wanted a war,
and you're giving it to her.

900
01:32:05,483 --> 01:32:08,361
I won't allow her hatred
to ruin my kingdom or yours.

901
01:32:26,754 --> 01:32:28,548
There will be no Fey blood on my hands.

902
01:32:50,486 --> 01:32:52,447
This way!
This way!

903
01:32:54,407 --> 01:32:56,492
Maleficent's back!

904
01:33:01,164 --> 01:33:03,624
She's going for the queen.

905
01:33:09,380 --> 01:33:11,215
Yield! Yield!

906
01:33:11,382 --> 01:33:12,383
Stand down!

907
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:13,885
Lower your weapons!

908
01:33:26,189 --> 01:33:28,983
There's the evil that I promised them.

909
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:35,198
Your kind is more predictable than humans.

910
01:33:41,746 --> 01:33:42,747
Stop!

911
01:33:43,623 --> 01:33:44,540
Stop!

912
01:33:44,707 --> 01:33:46,834
Well, almost.

913
01:33:47,168 --> 01:33:48,211
Stop.

914
01:33:48,378 --> 01:33:51,381
I'm sorry I doubted you,
but this isn't you.

915
01:33:51,714 --> 01:33:53,508
There's another way.

916
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:54,884
I know who you are.

917
01:33:57,428 --> 01:33:59,764
I know you.

918
01:34:00,306 --> 01:34:01,808
You do not.

919
01:34:04,227 --> 01:34:06,437
Yes, I do.

920
01:34:07,021 --> 01:34:08,856
You're my mother.

921
01:34:43,975 --> 01:34:45,268
No!

922
01:35:01,034 --> 01:35:03,536
Do you know what
makes a great leader, Aurora?

923
01:35:04,829 --> 01:35:07,915
The ability to instill fear
in your subjects...

924
01:35:08,082 --> 01:35:09,292
and then use that fear...

925
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:10,418
Your Majesty.

926
01:35:12,003 --> 01:35:14,213
...against your enemies.

927
01:35:14,714 --> 01:35:15,965
So...

928
01:35:17,008 --> 01:35:20,345
I spread the story of the evil witch...

929
01:35:20,511 --> 01:35:23,181
and the princess she cursed.

930
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:27,894
It didn't matter who woke Sleeping Beauty.

931
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:30,730
They were all terrified.

932
01:35:30,897 --> 01:35:34,025
And the story became legend.

933
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:38,404
I know you think I'm a monster.

934
01:35:38,988 --> 01:35:43,951
But what I did to the king,
to Maleficent, to my son...

935
01:35:44,744 --> 01:35:47,705
I did for Ulstead.

936
01:35:47,872 --> 01:35:52,335
You are a traitor to your kind,
and you will pay for it.

937
01:35:53,378 --> 01:35:55,505
Maleficent is dead!

938
01:35:58,508 --> 01:36:00,718
We will never again live in fear!

939
01:36:01,719 --> 01:36:03,221
Get back here!

940
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:09,352
Ulstead is free at last!

941
01:36:10,395 --> 01:36:12,230
Let me go!

942
01:36:20,822 --> 01:36:21,948
What's happening?

943
01:39:47,612 --> 01:39:49,447
Well, well.

944
01:39:50,406 --> 01:39:52,575
Hello, Beasty.

945
01:40:11,219 --> 01:40:12,261
I missed you.

946
01:40:14,013 --> 01:40:15,515
Did you bump your head, then?

947
01:40:16,015 --> 01:40:17,183
I did.

948
01:40:20,144 --> 01:40:21,479
Philip.

949
01:40:21,938 --> 01:40:23,356
Yes?

950
01:40:25,191 --> 01:40:27,026
Do you love my daughter?

951
01:40:30,029 --> 01:40:31,322
With everything I have.

952
01:40:40,581 --> 01:40:41,749
Good.

953
01:40:50,508 --> 01:40:53,636
I believe this belongs to you.

954
01:41:00,351 --> 01:41:02,395
Curses don't end.

955
01:41:02,562 --> 01:41:04,272
They're broken.

956
01:41:29,672 --> 01:41:31,424
It ends.

957
01:41:37,597 --> 01:41:39,515
There will be no more fighting.

958
01:41:40,016 --> 01:41:42,560
Ulstead will never attack
the Moors again.

959
01:41:42,727 --> 01:41:44,020
And from this day on...

960
01:41:44,812 --> 01:41:47,023
we move forward...

961
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,776
and find our way...

962
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:52,278
in peace.

963
01:41:52,779 --> 01:41:54,238
Together.

964
01:41:57,575 --> 01:41:59,869
Today, there will be a wedding.

965
01:42:00,328 --> 01:42:03,664
Not just a union of two people...

966
01:42:03,831 --> 01:42:06,834
but a union of two kingdoms.

967
01:42:07,001 --> 01:42:08,503
And all are invited...

968
01:42:09,587 --> 01:42:11,547
all are safe...

969
01:42:11,714 --> 01:42:13,925
and all are welcome.

970
01:42:48,084 --> 01:42:49,836
Hello, there.

971
01:43:30,793 --> 01:43:33,838
We cannot live amongst monsters...

972
01:43:39,302 --> 01:43:42,472
Someone should really cover those horns.

973
01:43:59,530 --> 01:44:01,282
If only Conall could see you.

974
01:44:03,451 --> 01:44:04,452
Borra...

975
01:44:06,621 --> 01:44:08,831
it's time to come home.

976
01:44:15,338 --> 01:44:16,714
Hello.

977
01:44:18,299 --> 01:44:20,259
Can you come here?

978
01:44:30,687 --> 01:44:31,854
Yes?

979
01:44:33,773 --> 01:44:35,566
Will you give me away?

980
01:44:35,942 --> 01:44:37,402
Never.

981
01:44:38,569 --> 01:44:39,904
No.

982
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:41,989
Will you walk me down the aisle?

983
01:44:46,703 --> 01:44:47,620
Yes.

984
01:45:10,935 --> 01:45:13,146
Apologies to anyone
I might have mauled today.

985
01:45:25,742 --> 01:45:26,534
Is that...?

986
01:45:27,368 --> 01:45:29,162
She can change her back.

987
01:45:29,996 --> 01:45:31,122
I suppose.

988
01:45:31,289 --> 01:45:33,791
Only if we wanted to.

989
01:45:35,501 --> 01:45:37,003
Father.

990
01:45:41,716 --> 01:45:43,885
I'm so glad to see you.

991
01:45:44,052 --> 01:45:46,095
I've dreamed of this moment.

992
01:45:46,262 --> 01:45:48,514
Two kingdoms united at last.

993
01:45:49,140 --> 01:45:51,267
And it's because of you.

994
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:54,604
I'm so proud of you. So proud.

995
01:46:23,925 --> 01:46:25,218
She looks better in green.

996
01:46:25,385 --> 01:46:26,511
Pink, you mean.

997
01:46:29,847 --> 01:46:30,973
No, in green.

998
01:46:31,849 --> 01:46:32,558
Pink.

999
01:46:32,725 --> 01:46:34,018
-Green.
-Pink.

1000
01:46:37,188 --> 01:46:38,564
Flittle!

1001
01:46:38,731 --> 01:46:41,025
It's perfect.

1002
01:47:25,403 --> 01:47:27,196
Let her go.

1003
01:47:40,835 --> 01:47:43,212
Pull yourself together.

1004
01:47:43,588 --> 01:47:46,674
We are here to join
two kingdoms...

1005
01:47:46,841 --> 01:47:48,468
divided by fear.

1006
01:47:49,344 --> 01:47:54,390
Today, you teach us
we are not defined by where we are from...

1007
01:47:54,557 --> 01:47:56,768
but by whom we love.

1008
01:47:58,811 --> 01:48:00,396
The bands, please.

1009
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:18,915
-Do you, Philip, take Aurora...
-I do.

1010
01:48:20,541 --> 01:48:22,835
-And do you, Aurora, take...
-I do.

1011
01:48:23,461 --> 01:48:27,131
Then I pronounce you husband and wife.

1012
01:48:27,298 --> 01:48:29,342
You may kiss the bride.

1013
01:49:00,123 --> 01:49:01,165
You're smiling.

1014
01:49:24,105 --> 01:49:25,773
It's a new day.

1015
01:49:28,276 --> 01:49:29,986
It is.

1016
01:49:41,581 --> 01:49:42,623
Morning.

1017
01:49:43,499 --> 01:49:45,585
Will you stay awhile?

1018
01:49:45,752 --> 01:49:47,003
A little while.

1019
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:49,297
But don't worry...

1020
01:49:49,464 --> 01:49:51,966
I'll see you at the christening.
