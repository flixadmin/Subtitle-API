1
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,370
<i>I'm just glad we're
finally able to do this now.</i>

2
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,083
How is it?

3
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,295
Will the mixing make
the release date?

4
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,465
Can we redo it? I feel
like it's missing something.

5
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,635
What? We don't need to do that.

6
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,220
We need to finish this.

7
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,474
Besides, that's Elaine.

8
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,770
She can even sing "Happy
Birthday" and make it a hit.

9
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,482
<i>Cut! Cut!</i>

10
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:10,945
What's the matter?

11
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,197
What is it?

12
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,740
I can't feel the song.

13
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,284
Something's wrong
with the lyrics.

14
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,453
Let's fix it then.

15
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,871
Which part is the problem?

16
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:21,873
All of it!

17
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,043
The song is fine.
Maybe it's the singer.

18
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,628
Did you say something?

19
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,880
Me? No.

20
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,424
Mark, pack up our stuff.

21
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,304
So, who do you want
to write the lyrics?

22
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,766
Someone with heart,
depth and sense!

23
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,810
Who?
Excuse me.

24
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,852
Not now.
What is it?

25
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,938
I have a song.

26
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,855
Are you a lyricist?

27
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,441
No, but I can assure you
it's great, ma'am.

28
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,692
Leave us alone.

29
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,861
Hold on. Let's listen to it.

30
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,988
Here. Listen to it.

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,370
Sad, but…it's beautiful.

32
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,913
The song doesn't suit you.

33
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,040
I want this!

34
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,875
Fine! Do you know the composer?

35
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,001
Let's call him.

36
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,461
I don't,

37
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,506
but my friend knows him.

38
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,383
He's just nearby.
We can visit him.

39
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,843
Let's go and see him.

40
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,470
Okay, I need my phone.

41
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,978
Hey, are you busy?
Not really.

42
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,813
Do you remember
the song, "Anytime"?

43
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,483
Miss Elaine and Miss Amanda
are interested in it.

44
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,569
<i>You want anything? On the house!</i>

45
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,571
A latte for me.

46
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,488
Me, too.

47
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,990
<i>We'll make that three, please.</i>

48
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,367
All right.

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,830
Ben, do you know
whose song it is?

50
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,665
Yes. It's K and Cream's.

51
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,085
Wait. You mean Charles
Keith and Sue Anne?

52
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,379
Yeah. You know them?

53
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,215
<i>Well, I worked with them before
SA V Records.</i>

54
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,426
<i>Do you know how to
get in touch with them?</i>

55
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,428
That's the problem. I don't.

56
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,805
Maybe with Keith, at least?

57
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,974
Keith is gone.

58
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,726
He's gone abroad?

59
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,103
Farther than that.

60
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,980
He passed away.

61
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:10,982
Gosh!

62
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,609
He's gone too soon.

63
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,694
Yes.

64
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,445
What about Sue Anne?

65
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,865
I don't know
where she is, either.

66
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,200
Let's look for her.

67
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,202
Sure.

68
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,166
<i>Mom, wait!</i>

69
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,417
<i>Sorry.</i>

70
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,543
<i>Sorry, Keith.</i>

71
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,004
Mom, Dad's already gone.
You're leaving me, too?

72
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,089
Mom!
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

73
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,341
I can't do it.

74
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,760
Mom, I need you.

75
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,263
You need to be independent.
I'm leaving everything to you.

76
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,348
<i>Mom, please.</i>

77
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,974
Please don't go.

78
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,100
Mom!

79
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,393
Keith!

80
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,686
Mom!

81
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,855
I need you!

82
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,857
Mom!

83
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,151
Mom, please.

84
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,777
Mom!

85
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,363
Mom!

86
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,323
Mom!

87
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,035
<i>Sometimes, I want to run and run.</i>

88
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,747
<i>Till my head bursts.</i>

89
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,750
<i>Till my heart bursts, too.</i>

90
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,336
<i>That's how I want to feel.</i>

91
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,421
<i>Like everything's going to…</i>

92
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,005
Boom!

93
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,092
<i>And all will be gone.</i>

94
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,176
<i>Along with me.</i>

95
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,956
Hey!

96
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,882
Macabuhay!

97
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,261
What? It's not mine.

98
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,262
Whose is it, then?

99
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,263
It's…

100
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,269
To the principal's office. Now.

101
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,530
Hey!

102
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,366
What?
What?

103
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,076
They gave me a warning.

104
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,120
Just a warning!

105
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,246
<i>Let's celebrate.</i>

106
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,291
It's your treat. Come
on, I'm starving.

107
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,751
Hold on.
Don't be mad anymore.

108
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,752
<i>Life is short!</i>

109
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,797
Very good, Group 1.

110
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,512
What? You're getting me in trouble
again. I don't see it that way.

111
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,097
I'm keeping you on your toes.

112
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,308
So you'd be alive,
alert, and enthusiastic!

113
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,227
Let's go.
Can you just leave me alone?

114
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,604
If I did, you'd be miserable.

115
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,855
Your life would be sad.

116
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,441
I'm used to being sad.

117
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,151
Stop being mopey!

118
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,027
Are you scared?

119
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,446
Come on. The lesson's up
on YouTube anyway.

120
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,447
My bag!

121
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,876
<i>Mr. Macabuhay,
where are you going?</i>

122
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,094
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

123
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,638
<i>Thank you!</i>

124
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,099
Is it your birthday?

125
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,643
Nope.

126
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,269
It's a free cupcake.
Too good to pass up.

127
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,439
You better stop being like this.
You always get me in trouble.

128
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,818
It's you who needs to stop.
Your life is boring.

129
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,569
Well, that's true.

130
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,153
Let's change that.

131
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,990
Why not do something about it?

132
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,203
What funny ideas
are you getting now?

133
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,663
First, I wanna go to college.

134
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,916
I wanna get into a
music conservatory.

135
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,960
And then,

136
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,461
I want to be a composer.

137
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,172
And third,

138
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,800
I'm gonna finish
this pasta before you!

139
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,426
Wait, hold on!

140
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,179
I'm giving you two seconds.

141
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,264
<i>One,</i>

142
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,391
<i>two, three.</i>

143
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,521
Wait up!

144
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,107
Eat faster, I'm beating you!

145
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,443
Hurry! I'm soaked!

146
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,694
Can you hold this?

147
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,696
Come on!

148
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,406
Come on, hurry up!

149
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,533
Hold on!

150
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,249
Why are we even out in this rain?

151
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,709
We're gonna get sick.

152
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,836
You just had to take
me to your house!

153
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,422
Yeah, yeah. Keep complaining!

154
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,674
Hurry up!

155
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,766
Come in, come in.

156
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,146
This is beautiful.

157
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,564
It's huge! You live alone?

158
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,774
Why didn't you invite
me over sooner?

159
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,610
'Cause you'll make a mess.

160
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,904
And you'll eat
everything in my fridge.

161
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,364
Are there any ghosts in here?

162
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,658
What ghosts?

163
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,745
Who's this?

164
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,456
My mom.

165
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,876
Come on, this way.

166
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,879
Over here!

167
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,299
Do you have an extra shirt?

168
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,638
Here.

169
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,266
Thanks.

170
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,331
Why don't you change?

171
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,832
I'm doing it.
Hey!

172
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,959
Why did you look?

173
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,878
You were talking to me.

174
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,090
You could've answered
without looking!

175
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,091
Sorry.

176
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,218
I didn't see anything.

177
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,586
Give me your wet
clothes. I'll hang them.

178
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,981
Are we doing this?

179
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,527
Yeah.

180
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,154
You don't want to?

181
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,867
If we do this,
everything will change.

182
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,288
No.

183
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes.

184
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,088
It will get complicated.

185
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,426
It won't get complicated.

186
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,516
But we're okay the
way we are now.

187
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,519
We're okay. I…

188
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,982
I need this more, not…

189
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,984
Okay.

190
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,195
I understand.

191
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,491
You're mad.

192
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,745
<i>Frustrated.</i>

193
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,083
But, whatever you want.

194
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,210
<i>I will respect that.</i>

195
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,969
You're really…

196
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,805
really lucky to have me.

197
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,568
<i>It's true that I'm lucky
to be with Cream.</i>

198
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,988
<i>Sadness had been my default.</i>

199
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,865
<i>And then, she came along.</i>

200
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,867
Woof!

201
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,994
Woof! Wake up!

202
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,290
<i>Good morning!</i>

203
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,792
Where did that come from?

204
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,128
You two have the same hair.

205
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,588
Outside. I found him.

206
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,590
He's so cute.

207
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,759
Someone probably owns that.

208
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,136
I didn't see anyone.

209
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,306
If they look for him,
we'll give him back.

210
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,350
But, for now, we'll name him…

211
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,351
Charles.

212
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,562
That's my name.

213
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,106
You go by Keith anyway.

214
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,151
Also, why are you
named Charles Keith?

215
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,862
It sounds like a shoe brand.
We have to change it.

216
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,241
Let's make it… K.

217
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,909
Kay? Sounds like a girl's name.

218
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,454
What? Not K-A-Y.
Just the letter "K"!

219
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,666
As in, "You're O-K!"

220
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,003
I thought we were naming the dog.

221
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,672
Because we're a family.

222
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,173
You're K.

223
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,509
This is Charles.

224
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,511
And I'm Cream.

225
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,556
What the hell?
So, I have to adjust for a dog.

226
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,057
Why are you "Cream"?

227
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,560
Because I like ice cream.

228
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,687
<i>Ice cream?</i>

229
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,730
You know what'll
suit you? "Pick".

230
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,648
Why?

231
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,443
Because that's what they'll use to
stab you with when the owner finds out.

232
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,778
No!

233
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,322
So, that's what you want, huh?
Gross!

234
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,740
Let go!

235
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,410
You're disgusting!

236
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,386
I didn't know you had Roman feet.

237
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,141
No, they're Filipino.

238
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,643
Smart-ass.

239
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,480
Your big toe is bigger
than the next toe.

240
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,484
That means you'll live longer.

241
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,071
What? That's not true. <i>Fake news.</i>

242
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,492
My mom and dad had the same feet,
but look what happened, still.

243
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,494
They're gone.

244
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,663
<i>Sorry.</i>

245
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,752
It's okay.

246
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,796
We're the same.

247
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,758
We're not.

248
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,220
Your parents were in an accident.
They had no choice.

249
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,431
My mom is alive but she left me.

250
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,935
She might as well be dead.

251
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,687
That hurts even more.

252
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,651
Come on.

253
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,239
When someone leaves, it hurts. Doesn't
matter if it's on purpose or not.

254
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,868
So, you…

255
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,038
You dummy. I'm telling you.

256
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,832
If you die first…

257
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,876
I'll kill you!

258
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,796
Right, Charles?

259
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,591
That's not allowed. <i>No, no, no.</i>

260
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,593
Come here.

261
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,279
Hey, Cream.

262
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,408
Eat up so you can
take your medicine.

263
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,535
I don't want to.
I don't have any appetite.

264
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,954
I made sure it isn't
too hot. Come on. No.

265
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,581
Come on.
I don't want it.

266
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,167
Cream, it's going to spill.

267
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,712
I don't want it.
Jeez!

268
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,630
I want to die.

269
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,799
Do you mean that?

270
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:52,928
Just kidding.

271
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,850
I was just pretending
to scare you.

272
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,728
I wanna see how
important I am to you.

273
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,230
Do whatever you want.

274
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,441
You think too much.

275
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,070
Keep this on, okay? Stay still.

276
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,698
<i>You are important to me, Cream.</i>

277
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,200
I said, stay still.
What?

278
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,704
<i>You're the most important person
in my life.</i>

279
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,999
<i>You're my reason to live.</i>

280
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,084
Thanks.

281
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,421
<i>Thank you for coming
into my life.</i> Just rest.

282
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:32,468
<i>I would do everything
to stay with you.</i>

283
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,304
Let's go inside.

284
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,036
<i>Ma'am! Ma'am!</i>

285
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,789
Why did you leave Keith?

286
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,002
I didn't want to leave my son.

287
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,298
You hurt him.

288
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,932
It hurts me more.

289
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,227
I am sick.

290
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,524
I know all too well that my son would
do anything to get me treatment.

291
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,777
Why wouldn't you want that?

292
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,446
There's no cure.

293
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,701
I may be able to
live a while longer…

294
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:44,081
But that's the most
that can be done.

295
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,504
I don't want him to spend everything
his dad left for his future on me.

296
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,258
That's more important to me.

297
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,094
I'm begging you.

298
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,898
<i>I am feeling weaker each day.</i>

299
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,028
<i>I think my body and my
cancer cells are battling it out.</i>

300
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,323
<i>I hope they take a break.</i>

301
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,827
<i>Not this time, please?</i>

302
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,871
<i>Stay stable.</i>

303
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,040
<i>I don't want to let go yet.</i>

304
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,168
<i>Not yet.</i>

305
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:33,547
<i>Hey, Keith!</i>

306
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,301
I fell asleep.

307
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,386
Are you sick?

308
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,930
No.
Why did you pass out?

309
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,266
It's happened a few times.

310
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,226
I'm probably anemic.

311
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,144
Lisa.

312
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,733
I hope you keep it between us.
I don't want to worry Cream.

313
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,526
Fine.

314
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,653
But see a doctor, okay?

315
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,575
<i>Hi. Amanda, Bonnie's manager.</i>

316
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,659
<i>Keith, right?</i>

317
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,785
<i>Yeah.</i>

318
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,495
<i>I'm excited to work with you.</i>

319
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,580
<i>Likewise.</i>

320
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,665
Bonnie is on her way.

321
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,377
<i>She's here.</i>

322
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,399
<i>Hello, hello.</i>

323
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,569
<i>Bonnie is here.</i>

324
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,030
<i>Bonnie is your bomb.</i>

325
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,367
<i>Ready to explode.</i>

326
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,452
<i>Boom.</i>

327
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,832
<i>Hi.</i>

328
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:56,213
My staff. Eman,
producer/bodyguard.

329
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,714
And Paul.

330
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,302
Keith.

331
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,556
<i>To hope</i>

332
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:12,980
<i>Anytime</i>

333
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:22,906
<i>I'll be waiting till
our hearts meet</i>

334
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:34,334
<i>I'll be waiting till
our hearts meet</i>

335
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:40,090
<i>It's you that my heart beats for</i>

336
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,011
<i>My heart…</i>

337
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,804
<i>Cut! Cut, Bonnie!</i>

338
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,805
Let's cut!

339
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,016
Why?

340
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,189
Bonnie. Relax.
No need to belt it out so much.

341
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,442
I was relaxed enough.

342
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,444
Well, we weren't.

343
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,529
That was my normal
key. Wasn't even high.

344
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,407
High enough to get on my nerves.

345
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,241
<i>Why?</i>

346
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,617
Is something wrong?

347
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,786
No.
Yes!

348
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,289
It's the lyrics that are bad.

349
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,082
They're not even romantic.

350
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,543
There should be
more romantic words.

351
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,879
Like, "death".

352
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,880
"Infinite".

353
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,798
"Everlasting" or "the end".

354
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,216
You call that romantic?

355
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,720
Stop making excuses.
Let's change it.

356
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,721
Yes.

357
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,807
I am the recording star.
I'm the one singing it.

358
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,267
She gets what she wants.

359
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,269
<i>Okay!</i>

360
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,020
<i>Okay.</i>

361
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:40,816
And that line? "Till
our hearts meet"?

362
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,401
It doesn't sound smooth.

363
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,652
Aw, is that so?

364
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,780
Yeah, so change it. Now.

365
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,740
I know what we need to change.

366
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,117
Change your voice.
It sounds like a road roller.

367
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,161
<i>Oh, my God!
How dare you?</i>

368
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,204
<i>You are so rude!</i>

369
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,665
<i>How dare you?</i>
You're ruining my work.

370
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,542
<i>You bitch!
Bonnie!</i>

371
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,544
Oh, my…

372
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,681
Stop!

373
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,491
Hey.

374
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,743
What happened?

375
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,581
You left all that drama.

376
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,669
What did you do?

377
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,177
I stood my ground.

378
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,391
Why did it look like you came out
of a boxing match?

379
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,351
Nothing like that.

380
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,271
She should be thankful
they held me back.

381
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,734
I've already talked to our boss.

382
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,154
Just apologize.

383
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,823
I'll think about it.

384
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,495
What are you going
to do without me?

385
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,627
And you? What will
you do when I'm gone?

386
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:28,925
Whoever goes first needs to find
a way to get reincarnated, okay?

387
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,053
Let's find each other.

388
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,561
Wait. I need proof.

389
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,608
Say it.

390
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,031
I don't believe in reincarnation.

391
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,162
Fine, since you're
being so pushy.

392
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,791
I'll come back as your pillow.

393
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,628
So you'd hold me
tight all the time.

394
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,592
I wouldn't want to be your
shoes, though. Your feet smell.

395
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,017
You promised, okay?

396
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,562
You've made a promise to me.

397
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,070
<i>I wouldn't just search for you.</i>

398
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,906
<i>I would go to God
for you and beg.</i>

399
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,956
<i>I love it!</i>

400
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,041
It's cheesy.

401
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:48,587
You're right to put "life after
death" instead of "death".

402
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,755
<i>So morbid.</i>

403
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,298
You're so brilliant!

404
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,300
Thanks.

405
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,059
Bonnie, why do they act
like they're mafia?

406
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,437
Eman?

407
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,563
He used to be an NBI agent.

408
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:11,152
He's the one who recruited the
team. They act like my bodyguards.

409
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,281
That explains it.

410
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,869
Bonnie, I'm sorry for what
happened at the recording.

411
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,080
<i>Bonnie is able to move on.</i>

412
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,291
<i>Bonnie is happy.</i>

413
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,459
<i>Bonnie likes your lyrics.</i>

414
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,754
<i>So, Bonnie is now your friend!</i>

415
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,634
You're funny when you speak like that.
You sound like a Facebook status.

416
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,928
<i>Cream is funny.</i>

417
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,182
<i>Cream is happy.</i>

418
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,271
<i>And Cream is sorry.</i>

419
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,237
<i>"Boom, I Love You"
is the title track of choice.</i>

420
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,573
<i>Upbeat and catchy.</i>

421
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,328
What do you think, K?

422
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,164
I think that's your usual.

423
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,708
Why not something
unexpected and different?

424
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,085
Why not choose "Waiting"?

425
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,005
<i>Bonnie likes that, too!</i>

426
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,382
<i>No.</i>

427
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,176
<i>Yes!</i>

428
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,762
<i>This is not your sound.</i>

429
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,805
<i>Bonnie can have different sounds.</i>

430
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,849
I like it.

431
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,850
It would sell.

432
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,894
Then we'll make a music video.

433
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,687
A sad, romantic one.

434
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,731
<i>This will go viral.</i>

435
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,066
Sad?

436
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,360
Yes, the song is sad.

437
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,236
I'll be emoting in
the music video.

438
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,530
It'll be great!

439
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,909
Is this the one by Cream?

440
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
<i>Yes!</i>

441
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,101
Cream.

442
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,103
How was it?

443
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,063
Did they say yes?

444
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,231
Tell me!

445
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,566
<i>Congratulations!</i>

446
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,197
Wait. Why are you
congratulating me?

447
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,199
Are you serious?

448
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,785
Your song is the
album title track!

449
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,882
Let's go.

450
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,134
Okay.

451
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,136
Let's go.

452
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,764
Wait a minute.

453
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,268
Is there something
going on between you two?

454
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,603
<i>Something?</i>

455
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,773
<i>Never mind.</i>

456
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,400
You're not going to admit it.

457
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,153
<i>Anyway, I want to
celebrate Cream.</i>

458
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,280
It's my treat.

459
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,906
Let's eat out!

460
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,116
Where?

461
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,409
You guys have fun.

462
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,119
There's something I need to do.

463
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,579
What?

464
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,122
I have to sort something out.

465
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,707
<i>Anyway, let's just go.</i>

466
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,167
<i>Bye, see you next time.</i>

467
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,169
Have fun!

468
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,470
Doctor, am I okay?

469
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,893
No, you're not.

470
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,524
It's been a year since I
told you to quit your job.

471
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,904
I'm not going to make it
even if I quit anyway, right?

472
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,448
<i>That's not the point.</i>

473
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,578
We're trying to avoid infections.

474
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,247
<i>You can get the common cough.</i>

475
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,668
<i>And it will cause complications.</i>

476
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,214
Please take care of yourself.

477
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,302
Especially when we're still waiting
for a donor for your transplant.

478
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,553
You said that two years ago.

479
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,097
Still, nothing.

480
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,975
Don't lose hope.

481
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,647
Too bad K can't make it.

482
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,024
This is our favorite place.

483
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,693
What's going on
between you and him?

484
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,861
Nothing.

485
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,155
There is something.

486
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,115
We're just friends.

487
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,035
But you live together?

488
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,579
<i>Live-in?</i>

489
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,167
We have separate rooms.

490
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,004
<i>What? Is he gay?</i>

491
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,592
So, how come nothing happened?

492
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,429
Because we're not like
what you're thinking.

493
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,514
So, what are you?

494
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,891
<i>Housemates?</i>

495
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,479
Do you like him?

496
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,403
There we go.
Well, your boyfriend is weird.

497
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,696
He's not my boyfriend.

498
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,656
Okay. This is what
you're gonna do.

499
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,575
It'll get him to
come to his senses.

500
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,244
Look for a super cute guy.

501
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,872
And then, he'll get jealous.

502
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,710
That's when he'll
realize he loves you.

503
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,299
Is that how it works?

504
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,135
<i>Trust Bonnie!</i>

505
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,513
<i>Bonnie has a
solution for everything.</i>

506
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,441
Do you have something to tell me?

507
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,442
No?

508
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,611
Don't you have
any secrets to share with me?

509
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,529
Why are you being weird?

510
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,656
Say, I'm a priest and
you wanna confess.

511
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,950
What would you say to me?

512
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,411
<i>Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.</i>

513
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,121
Not that one!

514
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,999
Let's eat. You're just hungry.

515
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,335
You eat. Eat all you want, okay?

516
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,670
Let's put it this way.

517
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,590
What's your wish for me?

518
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:09,594
I want you to be
happy, of course.

519
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,889
And for you to find
someone who loves you.

520
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,350
Why? Don't you love me?

521
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,188
That's different.

522
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,358
What I mean is,

523
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,568
I want you to find someone…

524
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,404
you can spend your life with.

525
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,406
Someone smart,

526
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,282
nice,

527
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,284
devout…

528
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,536
<i>healthy…</i>

529
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,289
And…

530
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,125
will give you a comfortable life.

531
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,337
But we're comfortable
here, right?

532
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,757
I'm not marrying you.

533
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,926
Also,

534
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,220
when I get married,

535
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,681
I'll throw you out.

536
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,364
<i>This is my classmate
in high school, Lisa.</i>

537
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,325
<i>This is my girlfriend, Cindy.</i>

538
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,286
All right, you two
enjoy yourselves. Okay.

539
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,371
I should get back.

540
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,498
<i>Nice seeing you again.</i>

541
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,376
Who was that?

542
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,004
He was my schoolmate.

543
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,006
<i>Valedictorian.</i>

544
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,633
Smart?

545
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,010
Smart.

546
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,012
Rich.

547
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,971
Good-looking.

548
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,389
Nice.

549
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,267
But, he's taken.

550
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,149
I see another friend!
Sorry. Is it okay?

551
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,150
Of course!
Sure!

552
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,527
Just leave us!

553
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,238
No! I'm coming back. Wait.

554
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,575
Alan!
Lisa!

555
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,243
Hey!
What's up?

556
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,369
Go on then.

557
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,412
Hi!

558
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,998
Is it okay?

559
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,959
I'll be fine here.

560
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,713
<i>Sorry, hon.</i>

561
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,923
I wouldn't leave you here
if I could help it.

562
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,426
<i>I know some girls
might hit on you here.</i>

563
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,552
<i>But I have to go.</i>

564
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,722
Okay, but take care.
You've had a few.

565
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,474
<i>Yes, yes. Thanks, hon!</i>

566
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,602
Take care on your way home. Bye.
Bye.

567
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,734
Thanks.

568
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,789
<i>Hey, sweetheart.</i>

569
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,297
<i>Get him to come to his senses.</i>

570
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,925
<i>Look for a super cute guy.</i>

571
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,471
<i>That's when he'll
realize he loves you.</i>

572
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,061
Let me borrow this.

573
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,146
What?

574
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,314
Your glass.

575
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,942
There aren't any other ones left.

576
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,778
What?

577
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,701
Your choice if you
still wanna use it.

578
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,703
It's like we just kissed.
But only a quick smack!

579
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:25,206
In case you think I'm cheap.

580
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,709
<i>What?</i>

581
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,969
Messy, as always.

582
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,735
So, Cream, how long
have you known Lisa?

583
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,075
All right. Rinse first.

584
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,832
I met her at work.

585
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,084
You two met in high school?

586
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,460
Why is it taking so long?

587
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,421
<i>To answer your first question,</i>

588
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,089
we met in high school.

589
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,967
She used to copy
off me in our tests.

590
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,053
<i>And to answer your
second question,</i>

591
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,765
You have a cavity on your molar.

592
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,351
So I took it slow.

593
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,106
I hope you take it slow
when you fall for me.

594
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,483
Slow because it's deep.

595
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,366
Okay, um, you have a
follow-up appointment next week.

596
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,702
<i>Because I need to
check on that cavity.</i>

597
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,245
You're too much.

598
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,581
On our first meeting,
it's like you kissed me.

599
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:51,918
This meeting's more
like an intense kiss.

600
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,669
Deep in my esophagus.

601
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,016
<i>Good news!</i>

602
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,851
I met someone.

603
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,311
I wish you'd knock.

604
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,230
I wish you'd lock the door.

605
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,733
Anyway, you should be glad
because I met someone.

606
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,527
What do you mean?

607
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,239
Didn't you say you want
someone to love me?

608
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,908
Now, I found him.

609
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,875
Aren't you happy?

610
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,881
Where did you even meet him?

611
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,674
A bar?

612
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,677
What if he's a drug
dealer or an addict?

613
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,429
Neither. He's Lisa's classmate.

614
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,391
He's an approved
gentleman, for sure.

615
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,940
Move over.
Hey! You pushed me.

616
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,911
How is it, Doctor?

617
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,372
Is it getting better?

618
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,458
Is it stable, or is
it getting worse?

619
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,214
Even if you undergo chemotherapy,

620
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,927
you know that only a
transplant will cure you.

621
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,725
If there's no donor,

622
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,394
how long would I have?

623
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:39,525
This is the time to focus on
making your body stronger.

624
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,112
So that when a donor
comes, you're ready.

625
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,033
If there's no donor…

626
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,244
shouldn't I be ready
for something else?

627
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,915
<i>Maybe.</i>

628
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,793
<i>More or less…</i>

629
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,588
<i>A year.</i>

630
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,440
I'll just wait for the pastries.

631
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,657
Bro.

632
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,201
Shouldn't you be with Bonnie?

633
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,202
Nope.

634
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,330
She just asked for coffee.

635
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,585
Bro, can I ask you a favor?

636
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,255
You were a policeman,
right? Or NBI?

637
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,882
Dude, we don't kill people.

638
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,843
Dude, no. I don't
wanna kill someone.

639
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,098
Just wanted a background
check on someone.

640
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,683
All right, then.

641
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,478
<i>"Compositions by Sue Anne."</i>

642
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,729
Who's Sue Anne?

643
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,857
Me! AKA Cream.

644
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,569
So, you're a songwriter.

645
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,571
<i>Congrats!</i>

646
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,198
Impressive, huh?

647
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,994
Yeah. You're impressive.

648
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,247
Hang on.

649
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,041
You don't have an
appointment today.

650
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,460
Nope. Just here to drop that off.

651
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,172
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

652
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,007
Just "thank you"?

653
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:31,262
No congratulatory
blowout or a treat?

654
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,388
For what?

655
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,474
Because I gave you a CD!

656
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,352
CD. Right.

657
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,106
Actually, I don't
have a CD player.

658
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,358
You just don't want to treat me.

659
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,569
Come on, treat me.

660
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,031
<i>Is that a guy thing?</i>

661
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,453
When it's hard for you
to express your feelings?

662
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,121
Not really.

663
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,247
<i>I mean…</i>

664
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:03,169
Women are generally
more outspoken than men, right?

665
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,044
But what about you?

666
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,629
What do you mean, me?

667
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,882
If you like someone
or love someone,

668
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,634
is it easy for you to
say what you feel?

669
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,472
Yeah. I guess, yeah.

670
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,640
How can you tell?

671
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,268
<i>Well…</i>

672
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,980
<i>I have a fiancée, so…</i>

673
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,445
Do you love your fiancée?

674
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,031
Yeah. I love her.

675
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,200
I feel like you only think that.

676
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,244
I feel you two will break up.

677
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,541
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

678
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,879
<i>I'm sorry! Sorry.</i>

679
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,631
<i>John Luis.</i>

680
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,008
<i>Top 10 in the dentist
licensure exam.</i>

681
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,012
<i>No criminal records.
No traffic violation.</i>

682
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,430
<i>Healthy?</i>

683
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,432
He's perfect.

684
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,894
But… he has a girlfriend.

685
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,439
<i>Cindy De Leon.
Professional photographer.</i>

686
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,529
Here's what we'll do.

687
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,075
Let's hire her for
Bonnie's promo shoot.

688
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,622
This feels strange.

689
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,624
Are you a stalker?

690
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,960
No, um…

691
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,671
Let's just keep it
between us, okay?

692
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,553
Hey, you smell like alcohol.
Are you drunk?

693
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,345
Just a bit.

694
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,638
Come upstairs...

695
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,182
No, thanks.
I'll just sleep here on the sofa.

696
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,018
I might throw up on your bed.

697
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,861
Who were you drinking with?
John.

698
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,868
Did you enjoy yourself?

699
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,381
What do you like about him?

700
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:17,052
What's with the Q&A?
Am I on <i>Miss Universe?</i>

701
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:03,556
<i>Okay, ready,
Bonnie? Let's do this.</i>

702
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,768
<i>Test shot, first.</i>

703
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,562
<i>Okay, start.</i>

704
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:15,444
<i>Give me that fierce look. Okay.</i>

705
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,738
I love it!

706
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,990
<i>Okay, let's hold that.</i>

707
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,285
<i>And then, look at the camera.</i>

708
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,621
That's perfect.

709
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,999
<i>Hold that one. Hold that one.</i>

710
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,213
<i>Just give me more
poses, all right?</i>

711
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,466
<i>Just a little bit
closer to each other.</i>

712
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,928
<i>Yes! I love that leg.
Just point your toes.</i>

713
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:46,724
<i>Gorgeous, Bonnie.
Just look at the camera.</i>

714
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,227
<i>One last.</i>

715
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,188
<i>Okay, let's do
some retouch first.</i>

716
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,816
<i>Glam team!</i>

717
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,293
<i>Excuse me.</i>

718
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,295
<i>Sorry.</i>

719
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,052
Where's the chart
for Anne Monson?

720
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,054
Here, sir.

721
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,473
<i>Thank you.
Welcome.</i>

722
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,092
You need to be hospitalized.

723
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:08,098
Or, at the very least, get a
private nurse to take care of you.

724
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,935
Doctor, I can still
take care of myself.

725
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,522
As long as Cream doesn't know.

726
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,775
You're still concerned about her
over yourself?

727
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:25,115
I'll have to run away
if she ever knows about this.

728
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,659
She should be able to decide.

729
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,746
Don't deprive her
of her right to do that.

730
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,879
Ma'am, Charles Keith
Macabuhay, please?

731
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,881
<i>Cubicle 1.</i>

732
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,552
K, what happened?

733
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,263
Did you freak out?

734
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,349
What happened to him?

735
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,601
Why were you feeling dizzy?

736
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,394
I'm pregnant.

737
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,397
Hey.
It's not funny!

738
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,487
<i>His hemoglobin is very low.</i>

739
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,908
<i>He has anemia.</i>

740
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,579
How did you get anemia?

741
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,500
Nutrition deficiency.

742
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,960
You eat a lot,

743
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:22,838
so I haven't been getting enough from
what little's left from our dinners.

744
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:23,839
Ow!

745
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,260
Ow! That hurts!

746
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,262
Stop it.

747
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,233
Cindy.

748
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,277
<i>Hon!</i>

749
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,243
Who's this?

750
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,334
It's not what you think.

751
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:01,837
Answer me, Cindy.

752
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,463
Who's this?

753
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,549
It's really nothing.

754
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,343
Cindy, this is not nothing.

755
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,599
<i>I'm sorry!</i> So I messed up.

756
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,100
<i>You were always so busy!</i>

757
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,685
What sort of excuse is that?

758
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,687
<i>Busy?</i>

759
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,399
<i>I was busy working
for our future.</i>

760
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,651
Where did you get even get those?

761
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,612
<i>Does that even matter?</i>

762
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,326
<i>We're done.</i>

763
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,079
<i>Hon!</i>

764
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,255
We can tone down this part here.

765
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,257
Hey!

766
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,012
What did I ever do to you?

767
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,096
What's this about?

768
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,932
Why did you get
me into this mess?

769
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,476
What do you mean?

770
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,602
You bastard!

771
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,563
I saw you on our security's CCTV.

772
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,690
You took pictures of us!

773
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,318
I can sue you!

774
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,782
<i>Tell you what.</i>

775
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,826
<i>Instead of stalking…</i>

776
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:18,497
why don't you just help me
with Bonnie's album?

777
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,793
Is that all you
really care about?

778
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,877
What?

779
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,170
What do you mean?

780
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,047
I'll lose my job.

781
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,800
It's easy to find another job.

782
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,218
But, Cream's future…

783
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,387
It's over for us now.

784
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,933
Not us.

785
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,601
Just me.

786
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,229
Are you drunk?

787
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,815
Or are you being serious?

788
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,900
I'm being serious.

789
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,195
Cindy might wreak havoc.

790
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,573
I don't want Cream
to find out about all this.

791
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,247
All right.

792
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:01,915
We'll fix it.

793
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,447
I want to apologize
for the mess I've made.

794
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,412
It's not just a mess you've made.

795
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,788
You've ruined everything.

796
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,123
So, what is this?

797
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,667
<i>A consolation prize?</i>

798
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,669
That was not my intention.

799
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,173
Everything you see here…

800
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,049
was all possible because of John.

801
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,427
<i>He made me.</i>

802
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,681
But you don't love him, right?
If you did, you wouldn't...

803
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,642
Why are you so
obsessed with John?

804
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,769
My friend likes him.

805
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,771
<i>Bravo!</i>

806
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,940
So, there are still guys like you
these days.

807
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,234
<i>So I bet…</i>

808
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,070
you're in love with her?

809
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,369
Is John a good person?

810
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,580
Yes.

811
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,584
Can I ask why you cheated on him?

812
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,795
<i>I played around.</i>

813
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,214
<i>Harmless.</i>

814
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,966
But you got into our business.

815
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,220
We'll still make up.

816
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,390
What will it take
for you to give up on him?

817
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,559
Nothing.

818
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:51,316
<i>So, what's your story?</i>

819
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,075
<i>I'm dying.</i>

820
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,374
I want to make sure…

821
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,171
that someone will
take care and love her.

822
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,141
<i>Here's the calling
card of my doctor.</i>

823
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:26,852
<i>Just in case.</i>

824
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:34,985
<i>Sorry, I have to go.</i>

825
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,319
<i>Wait.</i>

826
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,321
<i>Here's the deal.</i>

827
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,242
If I can really
verify your story…

828
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,579
I might consider it.

829
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,416
<i>But you have to let
me cover your story.</i>

830
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,293
How?

831
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,713
You'll be the subject
of my next exhibit.

832
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,008
I don't want to.

833
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,385
You don't get to decide.

834
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,512
I do.

835
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:22,782
<i>Hello.</i>

836
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,826
I didn't break in or anything.

837
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:27,329
The security guard let me in.

838
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,080
What are you doing here?

839
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,084
You said you'd be home late.

840
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,461
So, I thought I'd bring you

841
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,006
some congee, pork and tofu.

842
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,259
Thank you.

843
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,261
It's nothing.

844
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:45,931
It's not.

845
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,183
This is something.

846
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,436
You're the first
to have ever done this for me.

847
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,776
Next time, let me
know what you want.

848
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,487
I'll bring it to you.

849
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,448
You're sweet.

850
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,240
It's not sweet.

851
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,743
I'll have to charge you
for the delivery service.

852
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,119
Flat rate. Just 40 pesos.

853
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,246
Eat up.

854
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,666
<i>Thank you.</i>

855
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,842
<i>Flirt with the camera, Bonnie!</i>

856
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,345
<i>I wanna see those flirty eyes.</i>

857
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,682
<i>Good!</i>

858
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,564
K, meet John.

859
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,066
<i>Hi.</i>

860
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:41,319
<i>K, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.</i>

861
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,737
Okay, I'll leave you two to it.

862
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:44,990
Is it okay?

863
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,579
You know what, K?

864
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,333
I feel like I know you already.
Cream keeps talking about you.

865
00:54:58,294 --> 00:54:59,503
<i>Likewise.</i>

866
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:00,672
Me too.

867
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,680
Yeah, Cream talks too much.

868
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,725
A little.

869
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,915
<i>Bonnie, cut!</i>

870
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,501
Why are you pouting like that?

871
00:56:20,376 --> 00:56:21,543
Sorry, sir.

872
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:25,715
<i>It's my fault.
Sorry, guys! Sorry.</i>

873
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,896
Thank you for doing
what we'd agreed.

874
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,274
<i>No choice.</i> John and
I were over anyway.

875
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,069
Where did you meet Cream?

876
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,572
We met in high school.

877
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,078
<i>One more. Left. Yeah.</i>

878
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,164
But why is she such
a big deal to you?

879
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,624
Do I need to explain that?

880
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,918
She's important to me.

881
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,506
She's important to you…

882
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,094
<i>But you will not
tell her the truth?</i>

883
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,763
Yes.

884
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:17,392
Precisely because
she's important to me.

885
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,395
<i>Why?</i>

886
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,023
I don't want to hurt her.

887
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:29,654
<i>Camera.</i>

888
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,577
But, when you're gone…

889
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,289
you'll still hurt her.

890
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,757
So why would I want her to grieve
before that?

891
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:53,303
She's already been through a lot.

892
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,352
But…

893
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,396
What about you?

894
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,693
She's more important
to me than myself.

895
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,076
It shows that you love her a lot.

896
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:21,289
You chose my
boyfriend to make sure…

897
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,667
that she'll be taken care of
in the future.

898
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,006
I don't know John.

899
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,134
They chose each other.

900
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,012
Cindy and I are done.

901
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:38,973
Huh?

902
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:42,936
<i>Well…</i>

903
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,689
It would be stupid to stay
together at this point, right?

904
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,150
<i>So…</i>

905
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,153
<i>We called off the engagement.</i>

906
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,531
Are you gonna be okay?

907
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,534
That was six years.

908
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,327
<i>Yeah.</i>

909
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,371
I'll be fine.

910
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,498
<i>Actually, I'm…</i>

911
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,333
<i>I'm relieved.</i>

912
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,587
I can't see a future
for us anymore.

913
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,590
The trust is gone.

914
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,009
It's hard to gain it back.

915
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:22,934
<i>She's not like you.</i>

916
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,196
John, you should
know more about me.

917
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:42,620
I was in my fourth year in
high school when it happened.

918
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,794
My parents had just
dropped me off at school…

919
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,673
Then, there was a collision.

920
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,178
<i>All of a sudden…</i>

921
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,973
my whole family was gone.

922
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,019
I became an orphan.

923
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,233
Then, I met K.

924
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,361
He was also an orphan.

925
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,448
We became family. I
know it sounds weird.

926
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,116
No.

927
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,327
It isn't weird.

928
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,004
K is…

929
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,049
He's all-in-one.

930
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:41,137
He's like my mom
when I need some scolding.

931
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,891
He's like…

932
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,768
my dad too.

933
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,646
When I need
someone to protect me.

934
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,735
And, like a boyfriend…

935
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,740
when I need someone to hold me.

936
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:18,758
<i>Thank you.</i>

937
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,555
Thank you for opening up to me.

938
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,476
You make me
appreciate you even more.

939
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:32,230
And I understood you more, now.

940
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,045
<i>Hi, baby.</i>

941
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:44,510
<i>For you.</i>

942
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,017
<i>You like them?</i>

943
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,478
Yes.

944
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:56,272
Thanks.

945
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:09,744
<i>Babe?</i>

946
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,252
What is it?

947
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,588
My gift for you.

948
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:31,348
Sorry, I don't
have a gift for you.

949
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,683
<i>It's okay.</i>

950
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,520
<i>You are more than enough.</i>

951
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,562
<i>Okay?</i>

952
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:39,106
There's nothing else I need.

953
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,651
Only you.

954
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,531
I made you coffee.

955
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,407
It's over there.

956
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:50,868
I'll just finish up here.

957
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,120
Okay. I'll sit over there then.

958
01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:54,747
Okay.

959
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,636
Is that from him?

960
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,227
K, why do people get married?

961
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:19,856
He proposed?

962
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,441
No.

963
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,777
I was just asking.

964
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:31,200
Maybe…

965
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,453
It gives meaning
to someone's life.

966
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,125
And it lets you experience it all
with someone else.

967
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,086
Joy.

968
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:43,629
Sadness.

969
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:45,590
<i>Success.</i>

970
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:47,508
<i>Failure.</i>

971
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:51,679
That's why it's "for
better or for worse", right?

972
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,892
Why aren't we married, then?

973
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:58,895
Isn't that us?

974
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,399
We're not that.

975
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,277
Hey!

976
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:10,781
It's to have someone by your side
for life and in your twilight years.

977
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,911
So, I'll just hire a nanny then.

978
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,121
Or a nurse.

979
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:22,418
Then marry someone
to have someone share the bills.

980
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:25,922
Is that what marriage is to you?

981
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:29,550
No.

982
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:35,640
I believe…

983
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:40,853
when two people
really love each other,

984
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:44,773
God wouldn't separate them.

985
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,609
It's <i>"till death do
us part",</i> right?

986
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:50,696
It's like my parents.

987
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,450
They died together.

988
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,869
Neither of them had to feel…

989
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:00,289
the pain of losing one another.

990
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,215
I'm starving.

991
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:11,175
Let's eat.

992
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,553
You're always hungry.
You should check for worms.

993
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:28,567
<i>The mind seeks and
tries to comprehend</i>

994
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:36,659
<i>The feeling</i>

995
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:40,871
<i>You need to know</i>

996
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:46,961
<i>My heart is only yours</i>

997
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:52,424
<i>My only one…</i>

998
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,426
K?

999
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,636
Don't smile.

1000
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,765
What's wrong with smiling?

1001
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,726
It doesn't make a sound.

1002
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:03,727
Still.

1003
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:06,731
If you smile, it
seems like there's joy.

1004
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,025
It should be sad.

1005
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:12,569
Okay.

1006
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:20,118
<i>Should doubts be entertained?</i>

1007
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:23,872
<i>Expect my…</i>

1008
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,541
That's too sad, K.

1009
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:27,334
One more time.

1010
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:40,306
<i>Should doubts…</i>

1011
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:44,976
<i>be entertained?</i>

1012
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:51,942
<i>Expect my everlasting promise</i>

1013
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:56,655
<i>Anytime</i>

1014
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:02,243
<i>I will be here</i>

1015
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:05,247
<i>Anytime</i>

1016
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:09,502
<i>I won't be abandoning you</i>

1017
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:13,671
<i>Anytime</i>

1018
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,800
<i>Anytime</i>

1019
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:30,897
<i>Everlasting love</i>

1020
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:35,861
<i>Is what your heart desires</i>

1021
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:41,492
<i>And you want to possess it</i>

1022
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:46,663
<i>I'm here</i>

1023
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:51,502
<i>Ready to love you</i>

1024
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:56,132
<i>Without…</i>

1025
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,010
<i>end…</i>

1026
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:31,333
The song is beautiful.

1027
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:37,840
Thanks.

1028
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,137
I almost can't
believe you wrote it.

1029
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:46,682
Stop it.

1030
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:52,104
Would Bonnie like the song?

1031
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,650
Will the song like Bonnie?

1032
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:32,436
K.

1033
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,855
I know how close
you are with Cream.

1034
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:36,982
We're just friends.

1035
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,528
It just so happens
that she lives with me.

1036
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:45,741
She told me about it.

1037
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,995
And I understand
the dynamic between you two.

1038
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,291
I don't want us to feel
awkward around each other.

1039
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,169
<i>Okay? Especially because…</i>

1040
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,005
<i>you're very important to her.</i>

1041
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:02,841
Family.

1042
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:05,344
That's us.

1043
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,095
<i>Right.</i>

1044
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,555
<i>I understand.</i>

1045
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:13,227
That's why I want
you to be with her

1046
01:11:13,894 --> 01:11:16,021
<i>during the preparation
of our wedding.</i>

1047
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,943
<i>If, of course, that's
okay with you.</i>

1048
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,491
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

1049
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:29,410
<i>Why not?</i>

1050
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,873
<i>But, K, I want you to
understand something.</i>

1051
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,626
<i>After our wedding…</i>

1052
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,879
<i>Cream is my responsibility.</i>

1053
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:42,756
<i>No one else's.</i>

1054
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,179
<i>I will take care of her.</i>

1055
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:52,683
<i>Of course.</i>

1056
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,686
<i>I'll respect that.</i>

1057
01:11:57,771 --> 01:11:58,814
<i>Okay.</i>

1058
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:01,442
I'm glad we're on the same page.

1059
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:22,212
Well, what do you think?

1060
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:25,924
You look decent.

1061
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,634
It suits you, ma'am.

1062
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:31,137
Sir, would you want to try
your suit as well?

1063
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:34,098
I'm not the groom.
Yes! Persuade him for me.

1064
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:38,311
I want to see how it matches with my
gown when I am standing beside the groom.

1065
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:39,395
Quick! Take him.

1066
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:40,814
I don't want to.
Go!

1067
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,299
Shall we take a selfie?

1068
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:05,022
<i>One,</i>

1069
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:06,608
two…

1070
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:22,498
I'll just try on the
other gown, okay?

1071
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:23,500
Stay here.

1072
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:16,052
No. I don't want
to send it to you.

1073
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,304
I want it to be a surprise
on the wedding day.

1074
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,557
<i>Hello?</i>
Is the food ready? I'm starving.

1075
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,809
Hold on, okay?

1076
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,104
<i>Hello.</i>

1077
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:32,235
My phone died. I'll call
you once I charge it, okay?

1078
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,904
Okay, bye-bye!

1079
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:36,864
This won't take long.

1080
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,241
Then, we can dig in.

1081
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:39,283
Where did you go?

1082
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:41,662
You left me looking
silly back there.

1083
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:44,705
<i>Hello?
Hello, K?</i>

1084
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,625
Yes, K's here. <i>May I
know who's calling?</i>

1085
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:48,793
<i>Hello?
Hello?</i>

1086
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,212
I'll call you later.

1087
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,047
Okay. Bye.

1088
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:54,090
What was that?

1089
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,216
Huh?
What?

1090
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,093
It's my phone!

1091
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,928
It's not a landline!

1092
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,763
Do you have any
sense of propriety?

1093
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:03,224
You have no respect for privacy!
Who was that?

1094
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,685
Are you seeing her?
Is she your girlfriend?

1095
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:06,769
Don't wait for me.

1096
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,397
Hey! You eat up first.

1097
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:09,982
I'm full.

1098
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,776
You'll miss my
cooking when I'm gone!

1099
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:14,987
I'll get takeout!

1100
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:20,701
<i>You shouldn't have said anything.</i>

1101
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:25,455
Don't be paranoid.
I only said hello.

1102
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,584
She won't recognize my voice.

1103
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:31,712
She might associate
you with John.

1104
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,967
I thought you'd want her to
think that you're seeing someone?

1105
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:44,224
Yes.

1106
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,477
So she can focus on John.

1107
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:56,194
You really love her so much.

1108
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,991
<i>Don't you think she
deserves to know?</i>

1109
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:04,119
<i>No.</i>

1110
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:13,337
Cindy.

1111
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:15,422
Can you do me a favor?

1112
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:21,053
On her birthdays,
can you send her flowers for me?

1113
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:26,391
Are you sure?

1114
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,813
Don't you think that would be…

1115
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,733
torture for her?

1116
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:38,528
You want her to
forget you, right?

1117
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:40,822
You confuse me sometimes.

1118
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,618
I just thought of it.

1119
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,580
So it would feel less sudden
for her to lose me.

1120
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:56,797
<i>Here.</i>

1121
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,675
K.

1122
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,594
You'll die anyway.

1123
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:07,099
You should do
all the things you want in life.

1124
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:11,395
Say everything you
want to say to her.

1125
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:16,024
So that neither of you
would have regrets.

1126
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,530
Just because you're about to die…

1127
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:24,908
doesn't mean you're entitled
to do whatever you want.

1128
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:29,121
If you love someone…

1129
01:18:31,164 --> 01:18:33,500
you'd do what's best for them.

1130
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:37,212
Even if it hurts you.

1131
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:53,978
I think you're just scared.

1132
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,731
I'm not scared to die.

1133
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:01,069
When my mom left me…

1134
01:19:02,946 --> 01:19:04,614
That was when I wanted to die.

1135
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:09,578
But Cream changed everything.

1136
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:16,668
Now, I want…

1137
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,423
I really want to live.

1138
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:27,262
I still want to love her.

1139
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,769
I still want to be with her.

1140
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,610
I'm really happy
when I'm with her.

1141
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:49,868
But it's going to end soon.

1142
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:55,582
I can't do anything about it.

1143
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,598
HAVE YOU EATEN?

1144
01:20:19,272 --> 01:20:22,066
NOT YET.

1145
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:29,074
GO TO THE KITCHEN
BUT DO NOT TALK TO ME.

1146
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,122
THANK YOU

1147
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:46,716
AND I'M SORRY.

1148
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:52,722
FOR WHAT?

1149
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:08,029
IT'S OKAY.

1150
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:24,504
JUST DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

1151
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:48,945
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY

1152
01:24:44,954 --> 01:24:47,707
K. I want you to
understand something.

1153
01:24:48,374 --> 01:24:49,876
After our wedding,

1154
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,712
Cream is my responsibility.

1155
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:54,881
No one else's.

1156
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:57,801
I will take care of her.

1157
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:15,735
K, wait! K, where are you going?

1158
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:21,323
Talk to me! Wait! Don't leave me!
K! Don't leave me, please!

1159
01:25:21,324 --> 01:25:24,953
K, don't leave me! K!

1160
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:29,374
K!

1161
01:25:58,194 --> 01:25:59,320
Cream?

1162
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:05,326
Cream.

1163
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:09,747
Cream?

1164
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:27,724
John, I'm sorry.

1165
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,686
<i>All I can say to you is…</i>

1166
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:33,897
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1167
01:26:34,981 --> 01:26:37,233
<i>Thank you for the
love that you gave me.</i>

1168
01:26:39,235 --> 01:26:42,864
<i>Sorry for all my
faults and mistakes.</i>

1169
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:51,538
Why is it so hard for me
to write a song for you?

1170
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:53,291
You ask for deep songs.

1171
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:58,213
As if you have the voice for
them. You've got a screechy voice.

1172
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:25,508
<i>Sorry for all my
faults and mistakes.</i>

1173
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,469
<i>The most painful thing…</i>

1174
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:32,181
<i>wasn't discovering
that K was sick.</i>

1175
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:34,099
Hey.

1176
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:36,018
What happened?

1177
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:39,564
<i>It was realizing that he
was going through it alone.</i>

1178
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:41,941
What did you do?

1179
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:46,154
I stood my ground.

1180
01:28:48,781 --> 01:28:51,159
What are you going
to do without me?

1181
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,414
And you? What will
you do when I'm gone?

1182
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:00,835
<i>I should be with him.</i>

1183
01:29:01,544 --> 01:29:04,755
<i>I realized he was pushing me away
to be with someone else</i>

1184
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,133
<i>not because he doesn't love me,</i>

1185
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,471
<i>but because he loves me so much.</i>

1186
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:14,806
You need to be hospitalized.

1187
01:29:14,807 --> 01:29:20,521
Or, at the very least, get a
private nurse to take care of you.

1188
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,983
Doctor, I can still
take care of myself.

1189
01:29:24,984 --> 01:29:27,737
As long as Cream doesn't know.

1190
01:29:28,529 --> 01:29:30,865
You're still concerned about her
over yourself?

1191
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:34,869
I'll have to run away…

1192
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,330
if she ever knows about this.

1193
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,374
She should be able to decide.

1194
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:42,543
Don't deprive her
of her right to do that.

1195
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:46,880
As long as I'm capable of fighting
this, I'll continue doing it.

1196
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:49,299
I don't want to die…

1197
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:51,636
before I see Cream
live a better life.

1198
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:08,736
<i>My family had just
passed away back then.</i>

1199
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:13,491
<i>It was the most painful thing
I've ever felt.</i>

1200
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:17,328
<i>Then, I saw K.</i>

1201
01:30:18,704 --> 01:30:22,125
<i>I didn't know what
had happened to him.</i>

1202
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:25,461
<i>The only thing I knew…</i>

1203
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:30,591
<i>was that he was sadder than me.</i>

1204
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,638
<i>It made me curious about him.</i>

1205
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:41,435
<i>Perhaps, it was my way
of distracting myself.</i>

1206
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:45,481
I want you to find someone…

1207
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:48,151
you can spend your life with.

1208
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:51,320
Someone smart, devout…

1209
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:53,322
<i>Healthy.</i>

1210
01:30:57,034 --> 01:30:58,953
And will give you
a comfortable life.

1211
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:03,583
But we're comfortable
here, right?

1212
01:31:05,084 --> 01:31:06,711
I'm not marrying you.

1213
01:31:07,503 --> 01:31:09,922
Also, when I get married,

1214
01:31:10,673 --> 01:31:12,133
I'll throw you out.

1215
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:15,178
<i>I hope you'll understand.</i>

1216
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:18,764
<i>K needs me.</i>

1217
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:21,893
<i>I'm the only family he has.</i>

1218
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:27,899
<i>He only has me.</i>

1219
01:31:58,804 --> 01:32:00,932
<i>I don't believe in reincarnation.</i>

1220
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,643
<i>Fine, since you're
being so pushy.</i>

1221
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:06,312
<i>I'll come back as your pillow.</i>

1222
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,315
<i>So you'd hold me
tight all the time.</i>

1223
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:14,195
<i>I wouldn't want to be your
shoes, though. Your feet smell.</i>

1224
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:39,553
<i>I'm sorry John, I didn't mean it.</i>

1225
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:44,600
<i>I needed to have you
so K would see that…</i>

1226
01:32:45,768 --> 01:32:47,478
<i>it's okay for him to die.</i>

1227
01:32:50,189 --> 01:32:51,524
Do you love me?

1228
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:55,026
What about me? Do you love me?

1229
01:32:55,027 --> 01:32:56,695
<i>I asked you first.</i>

1230
01:32:56,696 --> 01:32:59,073
But I was the one who
made the first move.

1231
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:07,914
<i>You make me very happy.</i>

1232
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,958
Do you want to be
happy every day?

1233
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:12,295
From morning to evening?

1234
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,006
<i>Are you proposing to me?</i>

1235
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:17,049
No.

1236
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,593
I'm waiting for you to propose.

1237
01:33:28,394 --> 01:33:31,021
<i>I've had the chance to love…</i>

1238
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:35,568
<i>two such wonderful men.</i>

1239
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:41,824
<i>If God would give me a chance
to fulfill my wish…</i>

1240
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:46,662
<i>I hope you'll think over
everything I've said.</i>

1241
01:33:49,332 --> 01:33:50,833
<i>Don't be angry.</i>

1242
01:33:52,835 --> 01:33:54,503
<i>Don't be bitter.</i>

1243
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:57,923
<i>And I hope…</i>

1244
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:01,969
<i>I hope you won't be
afraid to love again.</i>

1245
01:34:06,182 --> 01:34:07,350
Sorry.

1246
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:59,025
Let's practice them.

1247
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:00,027
Huh?

1248
01:35:01,028 --> 01:35:03,030
The, um…

1249
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:05,282
<i>wedding vows.</i>

1250
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:09,912
<i>Okay.</i>

1251
01:35:21,715 --> 01:35:23,050
<i>Do you, Cream,</i>

1252
01:35:23,676 --> 01:35:24,969
<i>take John…</i>

1253
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:27,430
<i>to be your husband?</i>

1254
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,476
<i>Do you promise
to be faithful to him,</i>

1255
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:35,396
<i>in good times and in bad?</i>

1256
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:38,149
<i>In sickness and in health…</i>

1257
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:42,569
<i>to love him and to honor him</i>

1258
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,196
<i>in all the days of your life?</i>

1259
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,577
<i>I take you…</i>

1260
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:53,247
<i>to be my lawful wedded husband.</i>

1261
01:35:54,206 --> 01:35:55,499
<i>To have and to hold.</i>

1262
01:35:56,959 --> 01:35:58,502
From this day forward…

1263
01:36:00,337 --> 01:36:02,882
for better or worse,

1264
01:36:04,508 --> 01:36:06,719
for richer or poorer,

1265
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:12,099
in sickness and health…

1266
01:36:14,643 --> 01:36:16,645
<i>'till death do us part.</i>

1267
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:55,099
Actually, they used to be
our regular customers.

1268
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,603
I even have a copy of their CD.
You might want to check it out.

1269
01:36:58,604 --> 01:36:59,605
Thank you.

1270
01:37:03,567 --> 01:37:06,195
I want to record Cream's songs.

1271
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,095
You look stupid.

1272
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,766
You thought I wouldn't find you?

1273
01:37:43,649 --> 01:37:45,359
It's okay.

1274
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:51,240
I'm here now. You'll get better.

1275
01:38:07,673 --> 01:38:10,175
We promised each other.

1276
01:38:15,764 --> 01:38:18,809
If you leave me,
I'm really going to kill you.

1277
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:32,489
Don't be afraid.

1278
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:39,079
You'll be okay.
Everything will be okay.

1279
01:38:40,205 --> 01:38:41,999
We're going home, okay?

1280
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:45,836
I'll take care of you.

1281
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,256
We're going home.

1282
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:54,845
I'm here.

1283
01:38:55,929 --> 01:38:57,264
Just here.

1284
01:39:00,684 --> 01:39:02,394
I'm here.

1285
01:39:25,250 --> 01:39:26,627
Eat a little.

1286
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:28,920
There.

1287
01:39:33,717 --> 01:39:34,718
Cream?

1288
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:36,762
I'm sorry.

1289
01:39:39,181 --> 01:39:41,058
I messed up your life.

1290
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:47,606
What are you talking about?

1291
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:50,401
We're even.

1292
01:39:52,528 --> 01:39:54,738
I'm the one who
messed up your life first.

1293
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:00,786
Messy is better, right?

1294
01:40:01,787 --> 01:40:03,163
Better than boring?

1295
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:07,376
I'm okay.

1296
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:16,301
Of course, you're okay!

1297
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:20,097
Because I'm here now.

1298
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:22,307
Right?

1299
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:25,769
Remember? That's
why I named you K.

1300
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:32,651
Look.

1301
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:34,820
Look at this.
Cream?

1302
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,783
I'm not afraid anymore.

1303
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:48,167
You asked me before
what my wish was.

1304
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,173
My wish…

1305
01:40:55,507 --> 01:40:57,760
is to be with you always.

1306
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:11,148
K! K!

1307
01:41:12,649 --> 01:41:14,193
Look here, K.

1308
01:41:15,986 --> 01:41:17,029
Look. See?

1309
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:21,450
We're so cute here.

1310
01:41:31,835 --> 01:41:33,128
<i>Selfie?</i>

1311
01:41:34,797 --> 01:41:36,173
Let's take a selfie?

1312
01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:46,141
I want it to be wacky, okay?

1313
01:42:42,739 --> 01:42:44,616
K, my wish…

1314
01:42:47,953 --> 01:42:50,664
I wish you wouldn't leave me.

1315
01:43:01,466 --> 01:43:04,011
K, I love you so much.

1316
01:44:25,175 --> 01:44:26,551
<i>I believe…</i>

1317
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:31,932
<i>that when two people really love
each other,</i>

1318
01:44:33,558 --> 01:44:35,601
<i>God wouldn't separate them.</i>

1319
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:37,396
It's <i>"till death do
us part",</i> right?

1320
01:45:26,903 --> 01:45:27,904
John!

1321
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:30,365
Glad you could come!

1322
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:32,992
You invited me, remember?

1323
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:33,994
Come.

1324
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:38,290
He really was different.

1325
01:45:38,915 --> 01:45:40,167
They're both different.

1326
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:47,340
If I hadn't met K,

1327
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:51,094
I wouldn't have believed
that true love exists.

1328
01:45:54,222 --> 01:45:55,807
He said to me once,

1329
01:45:57,559 --> 01:45:59,603
"Just because you're dying,

1330
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:04,524
doesn't mean you're entitled
to do whatever you want.

1331
01:46:05,942 --> 01:46:07,694
If you love someone,

1332
01:46:08,945 --> 01:46:12,741
you'd do what's best for them.

1333
01:46:14,242 --> 01:46:15,535
Even if it hurts you."

1334
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:21,457
<i>He loved with everything he had</i>

1335
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:22,793
<i>and didn't have.</i>

1336
01:46:28,965 --> 01:46:30,175
How are you doing?

1337
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:33,887
<i>I'm coping.</i>

1338
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:36,681
I'll be okay one day.

1339
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:40,267
What about Cream?

1340
01:46:40,268 --> 01:46:41,937
<i>Like I said…</i>

1341
01:46:43,271 --> 01:46:44,898
they're both different.

1342
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:48,318
<i>A few days after K died…</i>

1343
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,238
<i>her heart stopped.</i>

1344
01:46:54,157 --> 01:46:56,785
Maybe because it'd
been beating for him.

1345
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:00,580
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1346
01:47:02,457 --> 01:47:04,292
It hurts, but…

1347
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:08,255
I carry everything I
learned from them.

1348
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,343
<i>And I hope we will be
better human beings</i>

1349
01:47:14,052 --> 01:47:15,637
because of them.

1350
01:47:27,065 --> 01:47:28,191
Bye, Mom!

1351
01:47:31,486 --> 01:47:33,195
Bye, Dad.
Bye-bye!

1352
01:47:33,196 --> 01:47:34,196
Take care!

1353
01:48:21,536 --> 01:48:23,038
Mom?

1354
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:25,165
Mom!

1355
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:31,128
Mom! The car that let
us through just got hit!

1356
01:48:31,129 --> 01:48:32,714
What do you want me to do?

1357
01:48:33,215 --> 01:48:36,634
You want me to worry about them?
Your father is dying!

1358
01:48:36,635 --> 01:48:39,596
Hang on, sweetheart!

1359
01:49:29,604 --> 01:49:30,814
I take you…

1360
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:33,858
to be my lawful wedded husband.

1361
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:37,988
To have and to hold.

1362
01:49:38,905 --> 01:49:40,573
From this day forward…

1363
01:49:42,575 --> 01:49:44,034
<i>for better</i>

1364
01:49:44,035 --> 01:49:45,453
<i>or worse,</i>

1365
01:49:47,497 --> 01:49:50,834
<i>for richer or poorer,</i>

1366
01:49:53,044 --> 01:49:54,837
<i>in sickness</i>

1367
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:56,381
<i>and in health,</i>

1368
01:49:58,216 --> 01:49:59,301
till life…

1369
01:50:01,678 --> 01:50:03,013
after death.
