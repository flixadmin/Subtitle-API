00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,600
Auntie Carol?

813
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,680
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

814
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,400
I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

815
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,680
But we knew they were lying.

816
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,920
I'm not really
who you think I am.

817
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,080
That is the craziest shit
I ever heard.

818
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,280
Green transforming aliens?
There's no such thing.

819
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,960
FURY: You are
absolutely right, young lady.

820
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,560
There is no such thing.

821
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,120
'Cause if there were,

822
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,640
we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

823
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,880
You don't believe me?

824
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,800
(KETTLE WHISTLING)

825
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,120
No way!

826
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,440
That's so cool!

827
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,120
FURY: Oh, she can do
a lot more than make tea

828
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,320
with those hands.

829
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,560
Like what? Show us.

830
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,000
(SIGHS) Maybe later.

831
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,480
I kept all your stuff.

832
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,840
I'll go get it.

833
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,400
You want to give her
a hand with that?

834
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,800
Hmm?

835
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,720
You don't remember anything?

836
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,480
I see flashes.

837
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,040
Little moments.

838
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,520
But I can't tell what's real.

839
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,120
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

840
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,960
maybe it'll all make sense.

841
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,040
(CLICKS TONGUE)

842
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,280
You woke me up
banging on my door at dawn.

843
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,000
Your usual move.

844
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,160
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

845
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,200
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

846
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,880
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

847
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,200
at doing something
that mattered.

848
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,120
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

849
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,240
and I wasn't about to argue,

850
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,120
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

851
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,400
But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

852
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,120
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

853
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,320
Since it violates
the predetermined

854
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,400
rules of engagement.

855
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,720
I definitely
don't remember those.

856
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,520
Hmm. Of course you don't.

857
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:37,920
(BOTH LAUGH)

858
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,720
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

859
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,920
She said
she had lives to save.

860
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,320
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

861
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,440
but you said that...

862
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,120
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

863
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,560
Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.

864
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,160
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

865
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,640
The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

866
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:14,480
But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

867
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,760
I know
this must be hard for you.

868
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,840
Oh, what?
This part right here?

869
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,000
No. No. Mmm-mmm.

870
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,800
Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

871
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,640
in a mission so secret

872
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,800
they act
like it never even happened.

873
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,400
Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

874
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,360
too damn stubborn to die.

875
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,440
And now you come up in here
after six years...

876
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,480
with your supercharged
fire hands...

877
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,040
and you expect me
to call you...

878
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,440
I don't even know what. Vers?

879
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,160
Is that really
who you are now?

880

and you on Halloween.

and you're Janis Joplin.

Oh, this is you
when you were little.

885
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,920
You didn't get along
with your parents...

886
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,640
so Mom said
we became your real family.

887

This is us on Christmas.

888
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,680
I got my favorite
bunny slippers.

This is another picture of you
when you were little.

You've always wanted
to be a pilot.

And this is right after
you graduated.

This was your dog
that you got for Christmas...

from your Air Force team.

And this is you with Mom

right after a good day
of training.

let me wear it anymore

that survived the crash.

out here's no joke.

I noticed that peculiar bird
you got parked by the road...

916
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,640
and I was just wondering...

917
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,920
if you mind
if I bring the boys over

918

to get a closer look-see?

-A closer look-see?
-Yeah.

920
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,800
To see the "bird"
parked out by the road?

Mmm.

aren't you, Talos?

as my true self.

And who is that out there?

Okay, that's a fair point...

but I'm sure
that you understand

949
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,720
I had to take
some precautions.

950

I saw you crush
20 of my best men

I just wanna talk.

Last time we talked,

I ended up
hanging from my ankles.

different from the others.

on a device I believe you call
a "black box."

in the crash.

to get into places
I'm not supposed to be.

967

in a place

it's not supposed to be.

970
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,200

where that is?

973
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,640
But, look,
I just need your help

974
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,920
decoding some coordinates.

975
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,920
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

976
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,280
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

977
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,200
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

978
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,800
Deal.

979
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,960
(PURRING)

980
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,920
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

981
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,400
How'd that get in here?

982
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,600
Hmm?

983
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
-The cat?
-(WHIMPERS)

984
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,240
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

985
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,880
That's not a cat.

986
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,040
-That's a Flerken.
-FURY: A Flerken?

MARIA: Monica.

989
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,960
-Why can't I listen, too?
-Shh!

990
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,200
What's happening?

991
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,960
It's loading.

Who the hell are they?

1002
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,040
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

1003
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,120
Yes, ma'am.

-Me. My work.

1005
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,040

You remember what I said about
our work here? What it's for?

1024
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,120
To end wars?

1025
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,920
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

1026
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,600
Damn it!

1027
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,200
My name is not Lawson.

1028
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,680
My real name is Mar-Vell,

1029
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,560
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

1030

(EXHALES)

1031

I would say
that you're delusional...

1032
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,760
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

1033
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,320
and your blood is blue.

1034

Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

1035
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,040
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

1036
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,320
any more regrets.

1037
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,600
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

1038
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,760
You gotta save 'em without me.

1039
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,960
Save who? How?

1040
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,000
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

1041
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,480
What are you doing?

1042

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,480
We have no interest
in hurting you.

1045
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,200
No?

1046
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,040
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

1047
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,040
The energy core.

1048
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,120
Where is it?

1049
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,000
Pararescue's on the way.

1050
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,720
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

1051
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,680
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,880
VERS: No, wait!

1053
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,680
You mean that energy core?

1054
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,360
(SHOUTS) No!

1055
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,360
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

1056
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,520
Hold your fire.

1057
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,400
MINN-ERVA:
There's nothing left.

1058
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,240
The core has been destroyed.

1059
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,840
YON-ROGG:
She absorbed its power.

1060
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,880
She's coming with us.

1061
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,280
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1062
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,120
He lied to me.

1063
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,720
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

1064
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,400
Now, you understand.

1065
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,040
What?
What do I understand now?

1066
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,080
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

1067
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,400
He killed her...

1068
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,040
'cause she found out
that she was

1069
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,360
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

1070
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,480
VERS: No.

1071
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,200
Your people are terrorists.

1072
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,840
They kill innocents.

1073
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,760
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

1074
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,200
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

1075
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,880
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

1076
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,640
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

1077
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,800
and they destroyed our planet.

1078
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,560
And the handful of us
that are left

1079
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,680
will be slaughtered next...

1080
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,840
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

1081
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,560
The core that she found

1082
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,160
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

1083
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,120
capable of carrying us
to safety.

1084
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:31,280
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

1085
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,120
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

1086
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,440
wasn't to fight wars...

1087
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,600
but to end them.

1088
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:43,760
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

1089
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,840
Well, I already destroyed it.

1090
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,520
No, you destroyed the engine.

1091
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,720
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

1092
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,160
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

1093
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,880
we can find it.

1094
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,280
You'll use it to destroy us.

1095
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,560
(SIGHS)
We just want a home.

1096
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,040
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

1097
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,040
Can't you see it now?

1098
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,560
You're not one of them.

1099
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,120
You don't know me.

1100
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,960
You have no idea who I am.

1101
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,320
I don't even know who I am!

1102
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,920
You are Carol Danvers.

1103
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,280
You are the woman
on that black box

1104
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,920
risking her life
to do the right thing.

1105
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,480
My best friend...

1106
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,560
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

1107
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,080
when no one else did.

1108
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,800
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

1109
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,240
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

1110
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,480
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

1111
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,640
You hear me?

1112
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,880
Do you hear me?

1113
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,120
Come here. Come here, girl.

1114
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,200
I got you.

1115
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:25,480
TALOS: <i>I know</i>
<i>I don't deserve your trust...</i>

1116
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,840
but you were our only lead.

1117
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,240
We discovered
that your energy signature

1118
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,080
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1119
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,760
Now we know why.

1120
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,560
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1121
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,400
I just need your help

1122
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,040
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1123
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,760
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1124
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,880
For orbital position
and velocity.

1125
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,760
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1126
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,080
'cause it's not on Earth.

1127
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,320
VERS: That was the location

1128
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,480
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1129
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,040
If we track its course,

Glad to have you back, sir.

So, is it true?

1619
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:21,800
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1620
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,400
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

I'm sorry to report

that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.
