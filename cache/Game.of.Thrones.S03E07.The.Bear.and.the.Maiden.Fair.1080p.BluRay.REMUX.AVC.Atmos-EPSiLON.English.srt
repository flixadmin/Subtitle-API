YGRITTE: How far are we?

3
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,135
About a week, I think.

4
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,553
You think?

5
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:17,138
You don't know?

6
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,850
JON: When we went to Castle Black, we took
the King's Road.

7
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,561
(SCOFFS) You and your roads.

8
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,980
Is that how you lot do your fighting?

9
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,400
You march down the road
banging drums and waving banners?

10
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,193
Most of the time, yes.

11
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,447
How do the men holding the banners fight?

12
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,657
They don't, really.

13
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,910
It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.

14
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,040
And the drummers...
Is that a great honor, too?

15
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,043
Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.

16
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:48,836
So, what good are they?

17
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,629
They help the men march.

18
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,173
How?

19
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,924
Well, it's...

20
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:55,676
It's the rhythm.

21
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,054
Oh, you mean right foot, left foot,

22
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,431
right foot, left foot, right foot?

23
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,767
What, you need help remembering that?

24
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:07,104
When Mance gives the signal
and we hit Castle Black,

25
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:10,107
we won't be banging
on drums to let them know we're coming.

26
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,567
No.

27
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,696
No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire

28
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,698
the North has ever seen
to let them know you're coming.

ORELL: She's right, you don't.

31
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,129
I know you cut me loose on the Wall.

32
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:35,966
Cut her loose, too.
Do you see her sulking about it?

33
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,804
That's because
she understands the way things are.

34
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,891
And are you gonna share it with me,

35
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:47,812
the deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

36
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,022
People work together when it suits them.

37
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,066
They're loyal when it suits them.

38
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,568
They love each other when it suits them.

39
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,154
And they kill each other when it suits them.

40
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,615
She knows that, you don't.

41
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,827
Which is why you'll never hold on to her.

"Prickly"? That what you call it?

47

Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.

48

Yes, and that is why...

49
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:37,945
I've seen wet shits
I liked better than Walder Frey.

50

Apologies, Your Grace.

51
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,787
I've spent too many years
around lancers and pikemen.

52
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:51,000
I've spent two years nursing wounded
men, watching them bleed and die.

53
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,544
I'm not afraid of wet shits.

57

He's getting the wedding he wanted.

58
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,220
He's getting a wedding.

59
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,763
It was a king he wanted.

60
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,727
Edmure is the best match
a Frey has had in the history of their house.

166
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,702
What?

167
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,997
My son...

168
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,124
With him.

169
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,545
I'll have to...

170
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,923
We'll have to...

171
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,800
If it's the pain you're worried about...

172
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:24,221
I'm not afraid of the
pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.

173
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,722
What is it, then?

174
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:32,688
He's rather good-looking,
even with the scar. Especially with the scar.

175
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:33,855
He's a dwarf.

176
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,858
And Loras...

177
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,069
Loras.

178
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:46,326
Some women like tall men.
Some like short men.

179
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,954
Some like hairy men. Some like bald men.

180
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:53,417
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls.

181
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,379
Most women don't know
what they like until they've tried it.

182
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:03,010
And, sadly, so many of us
get to try so little before we're old and gray.

183
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,599
Tyrion may surprise you.
From what I've heard, he's quite experienced.

184
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,812
And that's a good thing?

185
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,188
It can be.

186
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,567
We're very complicated,
you know. Pleasing us takes practice.

187
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,319
How do you know all this?

188
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,989
Did your mother teach you?

189
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,995
Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.

190
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,375
TYRION: She's a child.

191
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,960
BRONN: She's a foot taller than you.

192
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,628
A tall child.

193
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,006
What's the youngest you've ever had?

194
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,507
Not that young.

195
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,051
How much older?

196
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:46,595
Older.

197
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,973
You're a lord, she's a lady.

198
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,226
And a beauty, at that. I don't see the problem.

199
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,395
Shae isn't going to like it.

200
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,272
Shae is a whore.

201
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,150
Are you gonna marry her, eh?

202
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,403
How did marrying
a whore work out for you the first time?

203
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:06,114
I should never have told you about that.

204
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,618
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

205
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,662
All you have to do
is get a son in the Stark girl.

206
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,498
He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day.

207
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,458
You can rule the North in his name.

208
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,586
You'll have two women
and a whole kingdom of your own.

209
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,632
Two women to despise me
and a whole kingdom to join them.

210
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,804
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

211
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,515
you'll end up
the most popular dead man in town.

212
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,141
(BRONN CHUCKLES)

213
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,270
You want to fuck that Stark girl.

214
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,231
You just don't want to admit it.

215
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,735
I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head.

216
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:46,988
The ones already there don't need company.

217
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,908
You pay me to kill people who bother you.

218
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,204
Evil notions come free.

219
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,814
(DOOR CLOSES)

220
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,113
Your Grace.

221
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,282
Grandfather.

222
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,368
You wanted to speak to me?

223
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,995
Yes.

224
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,623
I'd like
a report on the meetings of my Small Council.

225
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,209
You're welcome to attend the meetings

226
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,128
of your Small Council, Your Grace.

227
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,671
Any or all of them.

228
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,506
I've been very busy.

229
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,176
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

230
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,594
Of course.

231
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,890
You've been holding the council meetings

232
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:58,602
in the Tower of the Hand
instead of the Small Council chamber.

233
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,145
I have, yes.

234
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,356
May I ask why?

235
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,151
Well, the Tower of the Hand is where I work.

236
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,321
To walk from there to here would take time,

237
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,282
time I could otherwise spend productively.

238
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,659
So if I wanted to attend a council meeting,

239
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:18,663
I would now have to
climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?

240
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,932
We could arrange to have you carried.

241
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:45,106
Tell me about the Targaryen girl
in the east and her dragons.

242
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:46,858
Where did you hear about this?

243
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,318
Is it true?

244
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,238
Apparently so.

245
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,285
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

246
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,916
When I was Hand of
the King under your father's predecessor,

247
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:07,837
the skulls of all
the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room.

248
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:13,510
The skull of the last of them was right here.

249
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,721
It was the size of an apple.

250
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,268
And the biggest was the size of a carriage.

251
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:26,398
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged died 300 years ago.

252
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,069
Curiosities on
the far side of the world are no threat to us.

253
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:34,656
But how do we know
these dragons are just curiosities

254
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,784
and not the beasts
that brought the whole world to heel?

255
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,745
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

256
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,789
who serve the realm by counseling the King

257
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,916
on matters about which he knows nothing.

258
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,335
But I haven't been counseled.

259
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,839
You are being counseled at this very moment.

260
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,885
I should be consulted about such things.

261
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,888
From now on, I will see to it that you are

262
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,558
appropriately consulted on important matters

263
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,144
whenever necessary.

264
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,735
Your Grace.

265
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,418
Yunkai. The Yellow City.

266
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:37,802
BARRISTAN: The Yunkish train
bed slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them.

267
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:42,599
On the field, with ease.
But they won't meet us on the field.

268
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,977
They have provisions,
patience, and strong walls.

269
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,563
If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls

270
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,191
and chip away at us, man by man.

271
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,817
I don't want half my army killed

272
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,527
before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.

273
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,947
We don't need Yunkai, Khaleesi.

274
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,617
Taking this city will not bring you

275
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,911
any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.

276
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,665
How many slaves are there in Yunkai?

277
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,503
200,000, if not more.

278
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,632
Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city.

Send a man to the city gates.

00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:26,142
Tell the slavers I will receive them here,
and accept their surrender.

282
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:31,564
Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer
the same fate as Astapor.

You will release every slave in Yunkai.

She had other urges.

So did the septons, only they lied about it.

If he comes back...

We need to make him feel better.

513
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,651

You have a family.
You need to go back to Castle Black

so you can get back to
them, where you belong.

What if I belong in the North?

What if I fell from that tower for a reason?

telling you? That it's all for a reason?

All these bad things happened because the

649
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,079
None of you have been up there.

650
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:36,461
I had a man once. A good man.

651
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:40,840
Bruni, his name was.
I was his and he was mine.

652
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:43,885
But one night Bruni disappears.

653
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:48,473
People said he left me, but I knew him.

654
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:52,060
He'd never leave me. Not for long.

655
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,688
I knew he'd come back.

656
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:57,732
And he did.

657
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:02,570
He came in through the back of the hut.

658
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:07,367
Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really.

659
00:47:08,952 --> 00:47:14,290
His skin was pale like a dead man's.

660
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,877
His eyes bluer than clear sky.

661
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:28,596
He came at me,
grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard

662
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,099
I could feel the life slipping out of me.

663
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,520
I don't know how I got the knife.

664
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:41,359
When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.

665
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,157
And he hardly seemed to notice.

666
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:53,121
I had to burn our hut down with him inside.

667
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:58,626
I didn't ask the Gods what it meant.

668
00:47:58,752 --> 00:48:01,463
I didn't need to. I already knew.

669
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:07,469
It meant the North was
no place for men to be. Not anymore.

670
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,725
I promised your maester
I'd get you to Castle Black and no further.

QYBURN: How is the pain, my lord?

672
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:30,992
What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?

673
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,832
Well, we've stymied the corruption.

674
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:39,834
Yes, we've stymied the corruption.

You're a learned man.

All the good it's done me.

677
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,216
You did well sewing up this mess.

678
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:51,513
You're far better at this sort of
work than Grand Maester Pycelle.

679
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:53,765
Faint praise, my lord.

680
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:58,520
So, why did the Citadel take your chain?

681
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,106
Did you fondle one boy too many?

682
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:04,109
No, my lord. That's not my weakness.

683
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,445
What is?

684
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,075
Curiosity.

685
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:15,495
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease,

686
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:19,332
and the only way
to understand it is to study the afflicted.

687
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:23,211
You performed experiments on living men.

688
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,296
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

689
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,843
My studies have
given me insight that has saved many lives.

690
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:34,931
Dying paupers, I assume.
Men with no families to complain.

691
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,434
You found them moaning in the poorhouse

692
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,728
and had them carted back to your garret

693
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:42,772
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

694
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:45,692
How many men have you killed, my lord?

695
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:48,736
- I don't know.
- 50?

696
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,072
100?

697
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:54,033
Countless.

698
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:56,828
"Countless" has a nice ring to it.

699
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,663
And how many lives have you saved?

700
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:01,082
Half a million.

701
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,295
The population of King's Landing.

702
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:13,428
You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal.

703
00:50:14,262 --> 00:50:18,349
Did you... Did you
get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?

704
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:21,269
A bird flew off and a bird flew back.

705
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:24,689
Lord Selwyn Tarth

706
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:28,735
offered 300 gold dragons
for his daughter's safe return.

707
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:30,153
A fair offer.

708
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,030
A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

709

owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.

Absolutely not.
I've got orders from Lord Bolton.

to your father at King's Landing.

something to you. When my father sees me,

00:51:44,227 --> 00:51:47,146
the first thing he's going to
ask is what happened to my hand,

this man chopped it off.

I had nothing...

Or I could tell him this man saved my life.
