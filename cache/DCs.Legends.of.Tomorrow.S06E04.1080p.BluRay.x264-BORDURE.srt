1
00:00:59,394 --> 00:01:00,395
Gideon, what is it?

2
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:03,314
I didn't sound the alarm.
It was Mr. Rory, I believe.

3
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,650
Hey.

4
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:08,151
Zari.

5
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,573
Oh. You're not used
to my nighttime makeup.

6
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,031
I mean, no makeup.

7
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,159
Sorry to ruin the illusion.

8
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,120
No, you, um...

9
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,539
You look just like her.

10
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,499
Oh.

11
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,001
You mean the other Zari.

12
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:24,586
Yeah.

13
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,673
I could change my hair if it would help.

14
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:29,716
Help what?

15
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:31,593
Whatever's happening down there.

16
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,931
- It's not my fault.
- Mmm.

17
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:38,391
- I was sleeping.
- Yeah.

18
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:39,474
It's natural.

19
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:41,727
Whatever you say,

20
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,353
Steel.

21
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,942
<i>Move your butts,
people, need you on the bridge.</i>

22
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:50,361
All right, all right.
Got to finish my last set.

23
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,327
Is he doing all right, Gideon?

24
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,078
Mr. Tarazi
asked me to formulate

25
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:02,373
an ingestible gelatinous
cannaboid compound to help him sleep.

26
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:04,000
You make marijuana candy?

27
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:12,884
Sometimes I wonder if they're
ever gonna let me back into Texas.

28
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:17,472
Rory, what time is it?

29
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:20,308
Technically, time doesn't exist
in the temporal zone.

30
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,268
Thank you, Gideon.
I mean it's early.

31
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,687
I got a hit on the alien
that kidnapped Sara.

32
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,190
Why the hell didn't you wake me?

33
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:31,069
Um... Remember that sketch I drew,
the, uh, squid face?

34
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,820
I thought it was chicken wings.

35
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:36,949
Well, Gideon helped me find this photo
buried among some old KGB files.

36
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,910
A report about a crashed space alien.

37
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,121
It was redacted until Putin was ousted
from power in 2044.

38
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,874
"Redacted, ousted"?
Where are these words coming from?

39
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,334
I know words.

40
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,712
Look, uh, thanks for cleaning me up.

41
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:52,882
Thank you.

42
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,550
Oh, you even smell nice.

43
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,930
Gang, great news. Rory got a lead
on the alien that took Sara.

44
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,682
Hmm, shocking, honestly.

45
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,100
Hmm.

46
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:05,311
The pod we are looking for is picked up
by military forces

47
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:07,480
at 0600 hours,
sits en route as we speak.

48
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,441
The plan, rendezvous with it here.

49
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,110
Any questions?

50
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,612
En route, rendezvous...

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,532
What?

52
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:21,619
This is great, Mick,
but shouldn't Gideon do the coordinates?

53
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,496
Already set, numbnuts.

54
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:26,708
Wait, shouldn't we stop by John's,
pick up him and Astra?

55
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:36,342
Let's move, it's a two-klick hike
through a thick jungle.

56
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:39,512
I love the intensity, but just a little
heads-up would be nice.

57
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,638
Okay, hold up.

58
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,515
I thought this was a time machine.

59
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:45,435
Why not bring us back an hour earlier?
Y'all can change out your PJs.

60
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,854
Oh, girl, we don't ask those questions.

61
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,164
Damn it, we forgot Behrad.
What did I tell you

62
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,749
about the Legends buddy system?

63
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:10,710
That hippie burnout
wouldn't want no part of this action.

64
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,256
Okay, Rory, what's the plan?

65
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:16,966
Cover me.

66
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,801
With what? I'm wearing slippers.

67
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:34,776
Commie son of a bitch tried to shoot me!

68
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:37,028
Think it was a bad idea
letting Rory run point?

69
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,738
Eh, we've had messier missions.

70
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,291
Let's go.

71
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:02,762
I'm in, let's go!

72
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:16,150
Why is everyone shooting?

73
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,735
Oh, they started it!

74
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,571
Time to check on the loot.

75
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,073
We're not bank robbers, Rory.

76
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,991
Wouldn't guess it by our use of guns.

77
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,869
Right to bear arms,
that is my Second Amendment privilege.

78
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:29,372
The right to tell you guns suck,
that's my first.

79
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,250
We're not gonna shoot the alien.
We're gonna talk to it.

80
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,626
What if it doesn't want to?

81
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,170
- Well, we roast it.
- Okay, just open the crate, Rory.

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,676
Huh. This alien pod's
different than the last one.

83
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,845
That's because it's not an alien pod.

84
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,350
It's a warhead from a Soviet SS-4
medium range ballistic missile.

85
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,185
Uh, Rory, where are we?

86
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,354
Uh, some island in the Caribbean.

87
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,440
Wouldn't happen to be Cuba,
would it, Mick?

88
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:58,359
Tell me you didn't take us to 1962.

89
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,694
Why, what happened?

90
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:01,779
- Oh.
- Oh!

91
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:04,574
You dropped us in the middle
of the Cuban missile crisis.

92
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,909
- And helped us steal a nuke.
- So?

93
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:09,662
This is the moment in history
when Americans and Soviets

94
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,331
came to the brink of nuclear war.
If we even sneeze...

95
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,542
Okay, nobody move.
It could be Armageddon.

96
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,379
But we can still find the alien
that'll help us find Sara.

97
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,548
You remembered to cloak the ship?

98
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:29,724
Yes.

99
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,436
I see. Let him in.

100
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:36,856
Mr. President.

101
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,233
If this is about
the missiles down in Cuba,

102
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:40,317
I've been briefed.

103
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:42,236
The nuke's the least of our problems.

104
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,364
These photographs were taken
on the latest U-2 pass over Cuba.

105
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:47,825
What is that?

106
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:51,162
Mr. President, it would appear
that the Soviets have a new bomber.

107
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,462
Gideon, what's the latest in D.C.?

108
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,757
JFK just called for an
emergency meeting of his top advisers.

109
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,135
That's what I get for letting Rory
run point in a Cold War.

110
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,470
- It's all good.
- Is it?

111
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,805
JFK delivered
a master class in diplomacy

112
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:11,515
during the Cuban missile crisis.

113
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,518
How do I know this? Because I wrote
my doctoral thesis on it.

114
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,895
You want to go to Washington.

115
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,578
With your permission,

116
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,815
- I'd love to throw the ball...
- Lose the accent.

117
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,835
- Way to wear that suit.
- Thank you.

118
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:22,859
Aw, thanks, girl.

119
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,112
What happened to your totem?

120
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:27,365
Oh. Old one clashed.

121
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,618
- You want to go to Washington.
- Yes. I spent a lot of time on this.

122
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,620
Ah, morning, team. What did I miss?

123
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,873
Nate and Zari will make sure
that JFK doesn't start World War Ill.

124
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:38,834
The rest are chasing down
a displaced space alien in Cuba.

125
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:41,545
- Cool, I'll just be...
- Nah, you will just be with me.

126
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,797
Let's go. Come on.

127
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,300
Go see the Kennedys.

128
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:50,096
Good news, Captain, we found the pod.

129
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:53,182
It's on its way to Fidel Castro's
not-so-secret bunker.

130
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,226
Wow. You found the alien
using your powers?

131
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,477
No, CB radio.

132
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:01,773
Mmm-hmm.

133
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:05,027
Right, easiest way in is here.

134
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,696
I'm guessing four guards.

135
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,490
- We blow the place to...
- Okay, I'll take it from here.

136
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,659
They won't let you
walk through the door.

137
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,619
It's exactly what they're gonna do.

138
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:16,414
- Let's go. Come with me.
- Why do you keep grabbing me?

139
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:21,085
Look, Captain, authoritarian leaders,
secret bunkers, nuclear missiles.

140
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,295
I'm not feeling the energy
of this mission.

141
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,507
Too bad, I need your energy.
Can't afford starting a nuclear war.

142
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,176
Hey, I'm just trying to help you
find your girlfriend.

143
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,888
Help me by getting the missile back
to the people that we stole it from.

144
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,516
- Wait, the Russians?
- Defeats the purpose of stealing.

145
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,728
Our job is to protect history.
Remember that next time.

146
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:47,237
Where are you going?

147
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,030
Sorry. We got turned around.

148
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,740
Is there another entrance?

149
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:52,491
Who is your companion?

150
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,118
Oh, uh... She's...

151
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,412
I am Dr. Yevgania Shostenko.

152
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,538
At ease, comrade.

153
00:08:58,164 --> 00:08:59,373
Who are you here to see?

154
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:02,043
Um... That's classified.

155
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,629
It's cool. We can come back later.

156
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,840
Oh, no, please. We enter now.

157
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,884
What kind of doctor are you?

158
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:11,677
Um...

159
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:19,477
The kind who specializes
in extraterrestrial creatures.

160
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,147
Why didn't you say so?

161
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:24,898
Follow me.

162
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:34,366
We're supposed to give the nuke
to the Russkis, right?

163
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,077
Well, those ain't Russkis.

164
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:38,079
Um...

165
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:41,248
Permission to shoot a way
out of a sticky situation, Captain.

166
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:42,750
No, absolutely not.

167
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,586
We don't need
an international incident. Do you copy?

168
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,628
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

169
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,089
Is that a yes grunt or a no?

170
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,507
<i>Uh...</i>

171
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,758
That's what I thought.

172
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,177
Just let me do the talking, okay?

173
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,356
Sorry.
We, uh, found this rig in the jungle.

174
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,650
We're getting it back
to our Soviet comrades.

175
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,901
It's a stolen missile.

176
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,695
We'd hate for a nuke
to fall into the wrong hands.

177
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,823
I must take it
to <i>El Comandante.</i>

178
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,367
<i>- El</i> who?
- Fidel frigging Castro.

179
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,537
Sir, wouldn't the Soviets prefer
that we return it to them?

180
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,621
You don't understand.

181
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,165
The North Americans
have started a mutant invasion.

182
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:24,458
You will follow us.

183
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,628
Did you not hear my order?

184
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,589
Lead the way, comrade.

185
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,805
How does this help history again?

186
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:39,181
Captain's orders.

187
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,517
I liked it better
when you were in charge.

188
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,981
- I can't believe we're here.
- Let's focus.

189
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:48,607
What's the plan?

190
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:52,403
Uh, I'm going to try to get into JFK's
inner circle by pretending to be

191
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,530
an international relations expert.

192
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:57,158
This way I could keep his finger
off the red button.

193
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,826
Okay, what about me?

194
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,619
Um...

195
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,872
- You could pretend to be my...
- Secretary.

196
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:03,956
Bingo!

197
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:05,748
Yes?

198
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,419
The boys could use a fresh pot.

199
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,337
Oh. Right away, sir.

200
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,047
Who's the egghead?

201
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,841
Do I know you?

202
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,261
Uh...

203
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,970
I doubt it.

204
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:20,931
Dr. Nate Heywood.

205
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,976
Harvard? Class of 1940?

206
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,227
Yes.

207
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,021
Go crimson!

208
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,858
Well, you can always use
another Harvard man in the huddle.

209
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,235
Isn't that right, there, Bobby?

210
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,864
Class of '46. Nice to meet you.

211
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,365
Uh, Nate Heywood.

212
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:39,926
Let me introduce you
to the brain trust.

213
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,329
We have Secretary of Defense.
Robert McNamara, Class of '39.

214
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,370
Nice to meet you.

215
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,167
Secretary of Treasury Douglas Dillon.
Class of '31.

216
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,292
Pleasure.

217
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,462
Now that the reunion's over,
we could get back to business.

218
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:58,761
General Kilgore here wants me to upgrade
our nuclear readiness to DEFCON 3.

219
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,429
This photograph shows the Soviets

220
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,974
have some sort of space-age bomber
parked off the coast of Florida.

221
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:08,604
Damn it, Mick.

222
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,190
- What do you think, Mr. Heywood?
- Me?

223
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,399
I, uh...

224
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:13,567
It's a spaceship.

225
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,986
It's probably made out of
plastic and plywood.

226
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:18,948
What did you say
your area of expertise was again?

227
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:29,959
- You know, Mr. President...
- Call me Jack.

228
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,419
Wow.

229
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:38,884
Jack, this reminds me
of the 1942 Princeton game.

230
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:42,179
Refresh my memory, son.
I was too busy fighting a world war.

231
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:43,847
Thank you for your service.

232
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,768
It was a 0-0 tie, a defensive stalemate.

233
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:52,356
Neither team put the ball in the air or
got close enough to kick a field goal.

234
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,899
Terrible game, both sides lost.

235
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:57,736
But when we're talking
about lobbing nukes at one another,

236
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,532
that is the only way both sides win.

237
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,121
He's over there, right here.

238
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,204
Okay.

239
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,499
Ah. Just in time,
comrade <i>doctora.</i>

240
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:14,086
The anesthesia is working, and we're
ready to begin the vivisection.

241
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,587
Uh, the what?

242
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,755
The vivisection.

243
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,301
Oh. Oh, yes.

244
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,845
Uh, but first, can I have shot of vodka?

245
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,514
As they say in my country,
it steadies the hands.

246
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:26,849
No, there is no time.

247
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:31,103
<i>El Comandante</i> wants to know how we can
best kill these mutant invaders.

248
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,187
Okay.

249
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,901
Then, uh, let the vivisection begin.

250
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,529
Hey, uh...

251
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,905
- Team Pow wow.
- Hmm?

252
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,908
You're gonna kill the only alien
who can lead us to Sara?

253
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,494
No. I'm stalling
so I can come up with another plan.

254
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:48,578
Okay.

255
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:50,913
Okay.

256
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:53,334
I should have
mentioned this before,

257
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,336
but I do not like blood.

258
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,338
Relax, everyone.

259
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:03,052
I am just going to make
a tiny little incision. Yes?

260
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:12,227
It's just a little
tiny bit of blood.

261
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,734
Okay, it's okay. Everybody relax.

262
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,362
It's, uh, perfectly normal.

263
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,383
This area is restricted. Come back here!

264
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,258
Let me see.

265
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,804
I didn't realize it was you, sir.

266
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:50,224
- No worries.
- Let me show you to the bunker.

267
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,892
Fidel will be glad you're here.

268
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,734
<i>Comandante,</i> look who's here.

269
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,236
It's your old friend Che.

270
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,364
Wait. You think I'm Che Guevara?

271
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,157
I never said I was Che.

272
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,325
Then who are you?

273
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:13,997
I am Che's cousin, Jay.

274
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,350
Jay Guevara.

275
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:36,937
Just as your cousin
and I fought Batista's men.

276
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,441
You and I will fight
the CIA's mutant army.

277
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,609
Wait, you mean the alien?

278
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:43,861
Sent to kill me, no doubt.

279
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,029
It's like the Bay of Pigs
all over again,

280
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,116
except this time we've been invaded
by squids from space.

281
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,998
Sir, I have an Ambassador Popov
on the phone.

282
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,632
Ambassador, what a pleasant... Attack?

283
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:07,468
What attack?

284
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,430
You lost a nuclear missile?

285
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,640
What do you mean, stolen?

286
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:18,145
It sounds like you've been drinking,
so call me when you've sobered up.

287
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
What did he say?

288
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,816
Never believe it.

289
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,362
Russian ambassador just accused us
of attacking Cuba with...

290
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:28,822
A steel man.

291
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,666
- Is that...
- At least it's a good photo.

292
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,339
Steel man?

293
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,508
This is even faker than the spaceship.

294
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:50,844
This is clearly a super-yoked guy
in silver body paint.

295
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:53,388
Actually, I have reason
to believe that it's real.

296
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:56,433
DARPA initiated a program
to develop a serum

297
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,894
that could turn a soldier's
flesh into metal.

298
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,397
It appears one of their
test subjects has gone rogue.

299
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,691
Why didn't anyone tell me
about such a program?

300
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:08,278
Eisenhower didn't think you boys
had the stones to deploy such a weapon,

301
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:11,490
but the good news is,
the weapon has been deployed for you.

302
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,909
But, sir, if the Russkis think

303
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,495
we sent a steel soldier
to sabotage their missiles,

304
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,872
they might do something stupid
and launch 'em.

305
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,000
What do you suggest I do?

306
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,086
We launch a preemptive strike
against Cuba.

307
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,089
We take their little island
out of the equation.

308
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:31,385
Mr. President, this reminds me
of the '39 Yale game...

309
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,221
Well, you are the quarterback, Jack.

310
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,681
You're calling the shots.

311
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,109
Take us to DEFCON 3, General.

312
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,240
Yay, one less DEFCON.

313
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:56,118
That means that
we're one step closer to nuclear war.

314
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,245
Well, that makes no sense.

315
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,377
- Can I tell you a secret?
<i>- Sí, sí.</i>

316
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,089
I'm not really Russian.

317
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:14,177
- Are you a North American spy?
- Worse.

318
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:17,806
I'm a clone from the future. I snuck
onto the base to steal the alien.

319
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:22,227
I don't even know
why I'm still talking like this.

320
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,482
Get comfy. I'll be right back.

321
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:31,820
You know, the CIA had a secret plot

322
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,907
to try to put a bomb
in one of my cigars once.

323
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,743
Not cool.

324
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,663
But now,
I have a secret weapon of my own.

325
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,459
A nuclear missile.

326
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:51,882
I'm so done being a pawn
in this game of chess

327
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,259
between the Americans and the Soviets.

328
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:56,345
If Cuba is attacked by squids,

329
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:59,640
I will wipe Washington
off the face of the earth.

330
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,183
Ooh!

331
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,560
Candy?

332
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:11,568
- I have never seen this brand before.
- They're not for everyone.

333
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,120
Strap in, dude.

334
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,485
Fidel will decorate you two
as heroes of the Republic for this.

335
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:57,072
Great! I'll be sure to put
that one in my trophy case.

336
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,452
Headache? That time of the month?

337
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:03,536
Very funny.

338
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,747
No, I'm being serious.

339
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:08,250
My daughter. She has the same thing.

340
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,544
Oh. That's very sweet of you, then.

341
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,964
But it's not my period. It's the alien.

342
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,969
I think my powers are getting stronger.

343
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,596
It's almost like I can hear it talking.

344
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
What's it saying?

345
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,893
Don't wake up. Please, not now.

346
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:29,771
Oh, it is pissed.

347
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:31,815
We gotta find Ava.

348
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,289
I don't wanna hurt you, all right?

349
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,541
I... I need to know
where you took my girlfriend.

350
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,681
Let's get out of here.

351
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:12,606
If I can force
the Soviets out of Cuba,

352
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,941
then all the missiles will be mine.

353
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,904
Would you mind if I played
you a song, <i>Comandante?</i>

354
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:25,076
I would have you killed if you didn't
play me a song, Jay Guevara.

355
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:58,026
<i>Well, I've been smiling lately</i>

356
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,612
<i>Dreaming about the world as one</i>

357
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,407
<i>And I believe it could be</i>

358
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,160
<i>Someday it's going to come</i>

359
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:10,163
<i>Oh, peace train sounding louder</i>

360
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:12,332
<i>Glide on the peace train</i>

361
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,548
<i>Come on the peace train</i>

362
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,634
<i>Peace train, holy roller</i>

363
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,387
<i>Everyone jump on the peace train</i>

364
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:33,103
<i>Come on the peace train</i>

365
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,821
<i>Come on the peace train</i>

366
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:51,788
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

367
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,629
Oh, I must call Kennedy at once.

368
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:03,967
He and I are brothers,
just like you and I are brothers.

369
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:09,806
We are all humans,
placed on this one fragile planet.

370
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,893
And the only way forward is

371
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:13,976
love!

372
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,032
How about another tune?

373
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,492
I told you that thing
was sent to kill me!

374
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,494
If it's war the Americans want,

375
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,164
it's war they shall have!

376
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,878
Prepare the missiles
for launch immediately!

377
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:48,929
Oh, damn it!

378
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,015
We forgot Behrad, again.

379
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:54,517
<i>Sí!</i>

380
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:58,271
Guys, I thought you might like
an update on <i>El Comandante.</i>

381
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,690
Wait, you're with Fidel Castro?

382
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:04,361
We're super tight. The problem is he
thinks the alien was sent to kill him.

383
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,905
- Why would he think that?
- It tried to kill him.

384
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:10,283
Report back to me as soon as
the missile has been fueled.

385
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,578
Oh, and also, he's preparing
to launch a nuclear missile at D.C.

386
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,832
- Why does Castro have a nuke?
- 'Cause we gave it to him.

387
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,169
- You said no shooting.
- I said...

388
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:23,797
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, this is not happening.

389
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,882
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

390
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:29,135
Let's hope that cooler heads
are prevailing in D.C.

391
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:37,310
One of our boys flying over Cuba
reports a missile being fueled.

392
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,354
Has Khrushchev lost his mind?

393
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,649
It appears that the missile is no longer
in the Soviets' possession, sir.

394
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,442
Huh. Castro's got it.

395
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,529
History is not
supposed to go down like this.

396
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,992
Say there, Jackie,

397
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,246
how would you and the kids feel about
getting out of town for a couple days?

398
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:59,165
Uh, I think Jack's starting to crack.

399
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,502
Is Hyannis Port within the blast radius?

400
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,671
There is no time for this,
Mr. President.

401
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:07,716
If those Russkis catch us
blinking now, we're through.

402
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,051
What if this is just
a big misunderstanding?

403
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:14,014
What if those Russkis want us
to hit Cuba so they could hit us?

404
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,307
Those clever commie bastards.

405
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,980
Our only defense is to attack the USSR.

406
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,024
Jack, that is insane.

407
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:28,945
Take us to DEFCON 2.

408
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:32,406
Yes, sir.

409
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,497
Sir, maybe I can help.

410
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,420
My secretary can type
120 words a minute.

411
00:25:45,503 --> 00:25:48,506
This way, we could get
the bombers in the air faster.

412
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,051
I thought
you were just another pretty face.

413
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,176
Oh, my gosh.

414
00:25:56,681 --> 00:26:00,143
This is a direct order
from the President of the United States

415
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,062
to the entire Strategic Air Command.

416
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:05,523
I've never seen someone type
with just their thumbs.

417
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:08,777
I want every B-52 we have headed towards

418
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,071
their primary targets
in the Soviet Union.

419
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:14,115
Should we lose contact
due to a first strike from Cuba,

420
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:17,869
it should be considered
a direct attack from the USSR.

421
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:22,373
Full retaliatory measures must then
be taken without any further orders,

422
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,003
because we'll all be dead.

423
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:36,638
- Did you get all that, sweetie?
- Oh, every last word, sir.

424
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,768
Guys, why is Fidel
starting World War Ill?

425
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:44,229
<i>He thinks
you are invading Cuba with aliens.</i>

426
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:46,523
Look,
Behrad's trying to cool him down.

427
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:48,525
<i>Comandante.</i>

428
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,401
You have a phone call.

429
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,153
It's Che Guevara.

430
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:54,823
Hello, old friend.

431
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:59,911
Yes, I know. The news
is very scary at the moment.

432
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,579
Oh.

433
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,083
Yes, I wish you were here, too.

434
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:10,630
But I have a comrade-in-arms right
next to me who's the next best thing.

435
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:24,352
Tell the CIA
to call back their squid soldiers

436
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:27,147
or else I'll launch the nuke.

437
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,313
Oh, my God.

438
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:35,238
- Sounds like you're up, Rory.
- I thought I was in the dog house.

439
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,825
That's when we were trying
to finesse the situation. Plans change.

440
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,703
- You want us to kill the alien.
- We don't have a choice.

441
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,496
Spooner, help him track it.

442
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,749
We need to deescalate the situation
and get history back on track.

443
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:50,253
Screw history! You kill the alien,
you kill any chance of finding Sara.

444
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,297
If we don't,
Castro starts a nuclear war

445
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,340
and Sara doesn't have
a home to return to.

446
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:56,926
I do not have time
to game this out with you, Rory.

447
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,220
- We will find another way to find Sara.
- Right.

448
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,181
Lot of big brains in this ship.

449
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:04,392
I'll just stick with what I know.
Shouldn't have cleaned me up.

450
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,896
I'm better off doing what I do best.
Being a goon, killing people.

451
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:08,979
Yes.

452
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,941
It's exactly what I need.

453
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,073
Right. At least I know
what I'm here for.

454
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,250
Alien's gone.

455
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,836
No, it's still here. I can sense it.

456
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:35,715
Base is wide open. Why would
the stupid thing still be here?

457
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,551
It's not stupid.
It's looking for something.

458
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,930
It wasn't right for Ava
to try to pin this all on you.

459
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:45,266
- I don't give a rat's ass.
- You were just trying to find Sara.

460
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,352
I was pretending to be somebody I'm not.

461
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,146
You're going to go back
to being a dumb drunk, that it?

462
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,231
Yes.

463
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,321
Is that...

464
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,453
What's it want with the nuke?

465
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,248
I think it wants to get away from here.

466
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,541
Like, off this planet.

467
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,377
Wait here.

468
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:22,344
Hey, dummy.

469
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:27,934
You really think you're gonna
hitch a ride home on that thing?

470
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:30,770
It's a missile.

471
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,735
Go ahead, eat me,

472
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,779
but you're not gonna get home.

473
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:41,281
Let him go!

474
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:44,325
I know you understand me.

475
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:47,287
Put him down or I blow your ass away.

476
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:54,085
That thing is not a spaceship.
But lucky for you, I've got my own.

477
00:29:57,255 --> 00:30:00,383
Keep talking. It understands you,
it just doesn't trust you.

478
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,176
You're not as dumb as you look.

479
00:30:04,554 --> 00:30:06,806
The alien wants
its own spaceship, not yours.

480
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,476
I can take you to it.

481
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,522
But under one condition.

482
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:16,774
You help me find my friend.

483
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,617
She's asking you a question.

484
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:28,618
She?

485
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:32,457
Yeah, she wants to know
what kind of fuel the <i>Waverider</i> uses.

486
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,251
Sounds like we got
a long trip to find the captain.

487
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:41,423
<i>Comandante?</i>

488
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,634
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

489
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:46,721
You want to start World War Ill.
You will kill all of us.

490
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,697
History will absolve me.

491
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,628
Call for you, General Kilgore.

492
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:20,504
Thank me?

493
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:21,922
What for?

494
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:23,883
What three-day weekend?

495
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,719
And who all received that order?

496
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:29,764
The entire Strategic Air Command?

497
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:31,891
Should've known that

498
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,518
- she was too good to be true.
- Whoa!

499
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:36,896
This secretary has been
countermanding your order, sir.

500
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:40,733
If Fidel Castro launches that missile,
you have only got seven minutes

501
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,236
to order a counterstrike
against the Soviet Union.

502
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:45,988
I thought you said
all our B-52s are still on the ground.

503
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:49,117
As much as it pains me
to have to ask the Navy for help...

504
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:54,580
What is that?

505
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,374
That is a nuclear football.

506
00:31:56,457 --> 00:32:01,504
Sir, that allows you to contact the
nuclear submarine captains directly

507
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,465
and order an all-out
strike against the Soviets.

508
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:08,845
Jack, they don't want
a nuclear war any more than you do.

509
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:20,481
There's a report
of a missile launch from Cuba.

510
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:21,816
Clock is ticking, sir.

511
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,156
Somebody get me Premier Khrushchev.

512
00:32:28,906 --> 00:32:31,325
- This has to be a mistake.
- You want to negotiate?

513
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:34,036
They were right about you. You are soft.

514
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,166
Well, if you don't have the guts
to stand up to those commies,

515
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,460
I guess I'll have to do it myself.

516
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,920
- You take one more step...
- Or what?

517
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,094
The steel man.

518
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:51,178
You're damn right.

519
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,972
But Jack, I didn't go rogue.

520
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:55,558
I'm here to protect the world
from guys like him.

521
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:59,812
I'm guessing your accomplice here
ain't quite so bulletproof.

522
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:00,938
Come on.

523
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,569
Boys, huddle up. Huddle up.

524
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:07,652
Okay.

525
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,823
We gotta get that
nuclear football back, boys.

526
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:13,868
Hey, Bobby, what was that play
we ran against Dartmouth back in '39?

527
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:19,332
Guess we don't need you anymore.

528
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:20,833
Rude!

529
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:23,419
Thirty seconds
for the safeties to be released.

530
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:25,880
All we gotta do is
to keep that football

531
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:28,633
out of the hands of those
lily-livered Harvard boys.

532
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:29,967
Okay, crimson on three.

533
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,969
One, two, three, crimson!

534
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:46,441
Hike!

535
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,124
This is fun.

536
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:14,929
My back!

537
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:18,723
No!

538
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:39,911
Intercepted!

539
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:44,374
Whoo!

540
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,130
To tell you the truth, sir...

541
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,341
this football belongs in your hands.

542
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,602
The missile's headed straight for us.
It'll be here any second.

543
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,479
The safeties are off.

544
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,274
You still have time to strike back.

545
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:10,192
This game ain't over yet, Mr. President.

546
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:11,986
It's not a damn game.

547
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,822
Whoever launched that missile,
it was a mistake.

548
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,950
If you strike back,
they're going to strike back at us.

549
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:20,661
That's why it is called
mutually assured destruction.

550
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:23,122
Clearly you do not
understand the concept.

551
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,959
Listen, Jack,
just because we're about to die

552
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:30,463
doesn't mean that we have to take
the whole damn world with us.

553
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:37,886
You're right.

554
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,056
I'm spiking this football.

555
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,029
Um...

556
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,407
Are we about to die?

557
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:04,330
Yeah. But at least
we gave it the old college try.

558
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:07,541
Well, I ain't going out without a fight.

559
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:39,073
Take that, you commie bastards!

560
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,791
Um...

561
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:52,002
I think we can let go of our hands.

562
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:56,340
You did it, Jack!
You saved us all!

563
00:36:58,384 --> 00:36:59,677
Luck of the Irish, I guess.

564
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,432
- Come on, buddy, get in there. Yeah.
- Nah.

565
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,432
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

566
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:06,433
Yeah! Ah!

567
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
Go crimson!

568
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:21,073
Captain, I'm detecting an
unusual level of radiation on the ship.

569
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:25,452
Rory.

570
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:31,041
Are you sure it's safe for us
to be carrying plutonium around?

571
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:32,251
No.

572
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:47,057
Oh, uh... This is not how it looks.

573
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:51,687
I know. I owe you an apology.

574
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,232
You saved the entire world
from nuclear Armageddon, Rory.

575
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:59,111
- Well, I, uh... I had help.
- Yeah.

576
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,492
It doesn't say much, does it?

577
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:07,453
Oh, she does. You'd be surprised.

578
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:08,788
- Did you say "she"?
- Mmm-hmm.

579
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:09,871
Huh.

580
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:11,456
So what's the plan?

581
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,960
Well, she's hooking some kind
of turbocharger to the <i>Waverider.</i>

582
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:17,087
Why would she help us?

583
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:20,049
I promised her I'd help her
find her ship.

584
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:21,300
Okay.

585
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:22,885
Do you trust her?

586
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,304
- No, it's why I'm going alone.
- Al...

587
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,265
- Uh, no, but that...
- But no.

588
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:30,643
You said your job is to protect history.

589
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,437
I also said your job
wasn't to think for yourself.

590
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:35,439
But had you listened to
any of my orders,

591
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,775
we'd have absolutely
no hope in finding Sara.

592
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:38,858
So, I...

593
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,823
I guess you got this.

594
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,783
Stop saying nice things.

595
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:53,582
You just bring me back my girl, okay?

596
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,208
Hmm.

597
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:57,836
Good luck, big guy.

598
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,597
Sorry, what happened to the ship?

599
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,474
It should be somewhere around here.

600
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:14,520
God, these shoes are killing me.
And this stupid hair.

601
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,819
I look like her again, don't I?

602
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,951
I hate that I'm a reminder
of everything you lost.

603
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,996
You're not.

604
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,291
I mean, I guess at first.

605
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,294
But now?

606
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,423
Now you just remind me of you.

607
00:39:47,094 --> 00:39:49,889
- Wasn't there a <i>Waverider</i> here?
- Hmm.

608
00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:51,640
Hey!

609
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:55,269
Well played, gang. How'd you manage
to avert nuclear Armageddon?

610
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:57,855
- Sports analogies.
- Pot gummies.

611
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,149
- Ah. Very on-brand, both of you.
- Thank you.

612
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:01,984
Hey, where are Rory and Spooner?

613
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,903
That son of a bitch stole our ship.

614
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,279
Well, very on-brand, Mick.

615
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:06,697
Oh, come on.

616
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,617
Thank him for stealing
the warhead out of the missile

617
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,160
that Fidel launched on D.C.

618
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,243
- Thanks, Mick.
- Hmm.

619
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:14,914
Oh! And who made a deal
with the alien to take it to its ship

620
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:16,582
as long as it took us to Sara.

621
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,230
- So he stole the ship?
- But it's...

622
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:19,793
Sorry, my phones were on that ship.

623
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:21,252
So was my...

624
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,755
Oh, thank God.

625
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,174
How are we gonna catch aliens now?

626
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:28,218
So, so sorry, but where
are we going to live?

627
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,096
- Constantine's house.
- John's.

628
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,891
Sweet. I could use a little R&R.

629
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:37,019
All of us under the same roof
with John and Astra.

630
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:38,604
Could be a real bonding experience.

631
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,231
- He's gonna hate it. Let's leave.
- Okay.

632
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:43,609
Damn. Rory had the right idea...

633
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,736
Hmm? Hmm?

634
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,300
Nobody wants your drugs.

635
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:51,742
Mom.

636
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:59,541
Listen up. Before we start
this little journey of ours,

637
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,502
let's get a few things straight.

638
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:05,089
Keep your slimy tentacles
off my stash, understand?

639
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,342
That better be a yes.

640
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,012
If you're going to run
your ugly mouth off this whole trip,

641
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:13,347
we're gonna have problems.

642
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:26,986
I was just asking if you had
anything stronger on board.

643
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:36,327
Don't mind if I do.

644
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:48,632
Here's to long journeys.
